written by jon hoeber erich hoeber based on the graphic novel by greg rucka december antarctica
six million square miles of ice
the coldest place on earth
forty six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts
the antarctic treaty holds these claims in check
there is no regular law enforcement
a single u
marshal is assigned to the territory
snow covered hills thrust up out of a barren white wasteland
no buildings no animals
closer the hills are more defined
rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses
a fine mist of wind blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice
still closer we track down through valleys skirt crevasses climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice
hold on this scene of timeless savage beauty then
a face hooded and goggled in ecw extreme cold weather gear drops into frame smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact the shattered goggle shield pops out
eyes stare blankly into camera locked in death
its a man
camera slowly starts to pull back to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles the head grotesquely twisted bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out
down tiny cracks in the ice until with startling speed it turns dark and freezes
we pull back further and look down on the body a bizarre shape in a spiders web of frozen blood
and slowly we pull back
further and further
until all is dazzling white
the sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby
cu on womans toes digging up soft white sand
the shadow of a palm tree cascading over top
widen slightly a pair of feminine hands donning an antique silver ring on the left middle finger are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm athletic calves
knock knock on a door
the hands stop
another knock knock
the lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt halt
slightly annoyed yeah
widen to meet carrie stetko late s
cargo pants rolled up and an exercise top
shes kicking back but shes not at the beach
in fact shes in an office sitting on a chair
a newly open bag of kitty litter sits next to a plastic tub shes got her feet in
two floor lamps stand like sentinels above her blasting her with warm wattage
a fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body
shes pulled the earplugs out of her ipod back to the real world
the door opens
leaning into the room is jamie clark s african american
shes dressed in a flannel shirt jeans
carrie doesnt look entirely happy at the intrusion
sorry a professor sapperstein needs to see you in biology
said its urgent
alright jamie leaves
as carrie gets to her feet camera moves away from her panning around the small office
half packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor
a calender hangs crookedly before a desk
each day has been marked off with a large x
three days remain unmarked
last space reads winter over and in the space next to it theres a cut out picture of a tropical beach
a dart board is next to it with a photograph pulverized with dart holes over the bullseye
its of a candy striped pole topped with a silver ball surrounded by international flags the south pole
carrie is standing next to the pole smiling at the camera arm in arm with sam murphy s
looks like hes handsome but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him
an ugly sprawl of prefab buildings power lines and above ground sewage pipes
it looks more like a siberian work camp than antarcticas largest research base and logistics hub
in the background smoke rises from mt
an icy wind howls but the base swarms with parka clad figures shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for winter
we pick up carrie and follow her as she strides down the icy unmade street
her hood is pulled up and shes not enjoying the cold
she reaches a row of buildings and checks the names geology lab
until she reaches biology building and pushes through the double doors into
long benches are covered with antarctic flora mosses lichens and liverworts
they are being nurtured and studied by scientists who look like homeless people unkempt beards bloodshot eyes and sun damaged skin
carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket
approaches one of the scientists with familiarity who is in the process of extracting an ice core sample from a stainless steel cylinder
hey fred unlock any secrets of the universe discover were alien life forms
workin on it
which ones sapperstein
he indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall grass samples across the room
professor sapperstein young thin and bearded is studying them
she crosses to him carrie contd sapperstein
he looks at her yeah
wanted to see me
his face tenses this is serious
he leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a glass herbarium containing only stalks and a few heat lamps
one of the glass panels has been smashed
sapperstein contd they took it all
she looks at him
sapperstein contd my weed man
ive been growing it all summer and they took it
it was just budding too
he sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy eyed scientists sitting around a desk munching on potato chips candy bars and drinking beer
sapperstein contd its not funny
carrie looks back to him can barely stifle a laugh
professor sapperstein id like you to read something for me
she pulls out a small leather fold chained around her neck
opens it up
puts it in front of his face
carrie contd whats this say
hes not sure what shes getting at carrie contd cmon go ahead read it
united states marshal
she closes the fold lets it drop around her neck
now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic
he actually ponders the question for a moment
carrie puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away from the others
carrie contd professor
are you planning on doing the winter over
not this year no
and how are you feeling right now
you think im crazy
is that what youre saying
no no not crazy
but this time of year down here were all going a little toasty arent we
how about you plant a little cannabis when you get home
she pats him on the back
walks by a mirror
takes a glance
is about to fix her hair then stares at the reflection whats the point
we notice a slight scar on her right temple
she steps around the moving boxes to her desk which is bare except for a thick binder labelled daily reports
she takes a seat opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading incident none
action taken none
on todays page she fills in the blanks with theft of botany sample
a pencil falls down onto the desk before her
then rolls off
she doesnt even flinch or look up
just stares unhappily at the binder
camera tilts up several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles
she closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos carrie in a marshals uniform graduation day crisp clean uniform
she and two other girlfriends all smiles at a bar shes got a birthday cake in front of her
carrie on a beach somewhere sitting in a chair feet in the sand shaded by a palm
as she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a nearby box you busy
she turns to see sam murphy base commander the guy on the dart board
theres an awkward beat
what do you think
i know you werent in the area
he sees the photo on the dart board saunters over to it
i got a pilot at asb who thinks he spotted a popsicle out on the ice
and we were doing so well
this throws her
what was he doing out there
thats no mans land
he takes a closer look at the photo almost seems amused
ive got a plane heading to asb in an hour with some supplies for winter over
cant get you back until tomorrow
he looks at her with a smile
murphy contd you leaving the dart board
no just the picture
the red and white striped ceremonial south pole stands surrounded by international flags
super title south pole amundsen scott station usa opulation temperature ice as far as the eye can see
in the background is the base
its much smaller than mcmurdo a few dozen specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings raised on hydraulic stands interconnected by tubular shaped walkways
off in the distance a snowcat mounted with a plow pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a large berm
its been busy several other berms flank both sides of the runway
camera pans to carrie with a gear bag in tow as she deplanes a lc
a half domed hangar rises up on the other side of the plane
the main asb complex is before her
across the top of the entrance is a huge poster days to winter over evac
piles of packed equipment are everywhere
half a dozen naked men wearing only boots and face masks blow out the front door screaming and yelling run around the south pole right past her and back into
carrie heads in bottom of the frickin planet
carrie knows her way
people come and go as she strides along a corridor decorated with party balloons and signs that read dont forget the eve of evac party comes to an office door
with a small plaque on it that reads marshal
pushes it open
its smaller than her mcmurdo office with a holding room that has a viewing window in the door
a fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer and lamp on top
a map of antarctica is spread across a wall with sub station positions marked in block letters
a window gives view to the south pole
carrie opens the door
she tosses her gear bag onto the bed
closes the door
carrie pokes her head in
an examination table cabinets with drugs and first aid equipment
a couple of hospital beds
moving boxes are packed up
another door in the back of the room is open but the light is off
carrie turns to leave and almost bumps right into one of the runners from outside aussie russell keller late s coming down the corridor
hes naked except for a towel wrapped around his waste
sports a goatee
flashes a cocky smile
well hello marshal
he falls into stride with her
carrie contd you seen doc
what are you doing here
checking the freezer for a popsicle
it got called in this morning
who spotted it
delfy one of the pilots here
keller half smiles
its his first year down here
you know how that goes
my bet it was just debris an old tent or something
heres an idea why dont you stay here with me and well party just the two of us
put those cuffs of yours to work
were you the second guy from the front
they come to the end of the hall
carrie goes right
a large room by base standards
a giant map of antarctica dominates one wall with the international stations and research outposts flagged with pins that have their countries flags on them
a grid of evac times of each station and outpost is next to it
a tech is changing a few
another tech sits as a console lined with comm equipment and computers
others hustle about
talking into a headset is the station manager rhonda stewart s
silky white skin
long red hair tied back
ill have them boomerang back and pick up the load just have it ready
the tech at the console turns to her guys got the science lab all shut down
good have them check all the pressure levels on the hydraulics then clear the exterior storage bins
make sure were not leaving anything out there
rhonda sees carrie coming in the doorway
theres a flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional demeanor
sam told me youd be coming up hows the sleigh ride
i need a plane and that pilot who saw the popsicle
ill have him meet you in the hangar
a moment of silence lingers as neither have anything else to say
selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is doc fury
wears the only non red parka weve seen its royal blue trimmed with black fur and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from years of antarctic service
in less than three days we begin winter over
the sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months
camera pulls back to reveal five newbies first timers an asian french brazilian danish and an american
all are standing on their jackets shivering uncontrollably in the wind
doc contd the sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice
extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land
you have chosen for your own misguided reasons to stay
and it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die
doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts
the ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible wind driven arc approaches a flag and sinks
doc contd time
the asian holds a stopwatch
he stares at it stupidly
your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately degrees
you are shivering uncontrollably losing basic motor skills
youre having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks
in short you are well on your way to dying and it has only been two hundred seconds
put your coats on
the class struggles into their jackets
doc assists those who in their diminished capacity are having trouble figuring out how to put them on
doc contd your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather
so be aware
there is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout
dont get caught in it
winds kick up snow thats lain on the ice for thousands of years cant see six inches in front of your nose
temperature plummets to triple digits
we found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth
carrie walks up
docs eyes brighten
doc contd class here we have another of the many hazards found on antarctica
say hello to marshal stetko
through a disjointed chattering chorus hello marshal stetko
always a pleasure to see you
unlike most of the beaker heads down here
i wish we got a job
i need you to take a ride with me
carrie contd might be a body out on the ice
whys this crap always happen at the end of the season
carrie pulls a driver from docs golf bag
lines up another pink ball
doc contd too cold for driving
carrie swings whack
the ball shatters and pink bits rain down around them
so it is
carrie and doc cross the interior which houses three double prop twin otters two snowcats and six snowmobiles
keller and two other employees are busy working on one of the otters
whats your gut say about this body
my gut and i dont talk anymore
they continue after a beat carrie contd i saw your boxes packed up
what was all that bs last month about im never going back ill die here
scatter my ashes over the pole
he takes a beat people change carrie
i got a card from my granddaughter inviting me to her fifth birthday party
you know ive never even met her
or mentioned her
doc thats great
it got me thinking i need to be a better grandfather than i was a father
its time i deal with my life
ive been down here a lot longer than i probably should have
they arrive at one of the otters
byron delfy a baby faced african american pilot leans out the planes door
where the hell they get these thumb suckers
delfy smiles graciously
and unless your wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane i think well be all right
delfy disappears back into the plane
doc looks to carrie
i want keller
hes my pilot
keller get over here
delfys taking us doc
hes the one who saw the body
cmon youll be fine
ill even hold your hand if you want
she ushers him in
the plane soars through a cloudless sky the sun sparkling brilliantly on the endless ice sheet below
carries in the copilots seat wrapped up tight in her ecw just trying to stay warm
delfys at the controls
docs in the back
what were you doing out there
i went to evac a camp
had to fly off route to get around a storm
got down low to avoid some turbulence and there it was
carrie notices a picture of a young boy around seven wearing a yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel
its framed in popsicle sticks with i love you daddy written around the perimeter
that your son
he lights up
yeah names nathan
has your eyes
lucky he got his mommas brain
so why arent you with him
the bonus pay
trying to buy a house
give my boy a yard
his own room
stuff i never had
he looks at carrie all bundled up
delfy contd dont like the cold huh
then why are you down here
carries eyes drift out the window we all make stupid mistakes
delfy tips the nose of the plane down
the ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses
its right up here
he spirals down among the icy hills visibility is poor
heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways delfy laughs at docs nervous reaction
delfy contd i dont carry extra panties doc so keep it tight
there it is
he banks the plane and slips down into a valley
delfy contd three oclock
its a popsicle alright
down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to the crevice
carrie contd red jacket
the twin otter is in the distant background
carrie doc and delfy who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder weave their way around huge ice boulders skirt small crevasses
its always different when they freeze
some curl up
some stretch out
some tear their clothes off
they get delirious
what was that guys name
hes lost in a storm
we cant find him but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the serengeti heat and his wife janet
next day we find him frozen solid wearing nothing but his bunny boots
drops the gear bag
the corpse is just ahead a frozen display of death
they all stare at it the body in unnatural angles the spiderweb of frozen blood
delfy looks nauseous
never seen a dead guy
delfy slowly shakes his head no
carrie moves up to it
takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away
cant see the bottom
she walks around to get a look at the face
doc contd you know him so do you
think his names weiss
we wintered over last year with him
played cards a couple of times
the guy who cheated
geologist i think
doc takes a look
damn carrie pulls out a digital camera from a pocket
shoots a couple of pics
doc takes a look up behind them
the ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau scattered with jagged boulders of ice
doc contd looks like he fell from up there
carrie pauses with her camera looks up doesnt seem as convinced
then wheres his crampons his gear
doc looks around shes right
maybe down the crevasse
yeah maybe carrie glances to delfy
carrie contd whats the closest camp
brits about eighty miles west
looking at body soto what the hell where you doing all the way out here
doc reaches down and tries to move the body doesnt budge frozen solid into the ice
ah christ hes a sticker
carrie unzips the gear bag
digs out ice two axes
a pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse
delfy who looks very uneasy about all this grabs the feet as carrie and doc each grab an arm
you going to be alright
no this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life
they all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground
gonna give myself a goddamn hernia
they keep pulling and snap
the arm doc is holding breaks off at the elbow
lands on his ass
delfy turns away and pukes
oh yeah im really going to miss this place
is peering down at them from the top of an ice cliff
widen to see a man wearing a white camouflage parka
lowers the binoculars
goggles shield his eyes
he moves on
a party is in progress
people are mingling some have drinks others dance
the volume of the music dies replaced by a repetitive squeaking noise emanating through the silence
people stop what theyre doing and focus on where the noise is coming from which is
doc and carrie ushering a pushcart with weiss contorted frozen body through the middle of the party
his dismembered arm rests across his chest
the festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay glued to the horrific state of weiss body
just as they pass operations rhonda steps out with the brazilian and french newbies at her side to see whats going on
her eyes immediately go to weiss then shift to meet carries
before she can say anything who manages the post stations
doc and carrie keep moving
everyone else just keeps silent and watching
squeaky wheel fades
one two three
carrie and doc set weiss body onto the examination table
carrie contd how long to thaw him out
carrie lets just bag him and put him on a plane to mcmurdo
she moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot water from a tap
it bothers me no ones reported him missing yet
because maybe no one thinks he is
howd he get out there
there were no tracks
sounds to me like you and your gut are talking again
carrie returns with the water
goes to pour it on the zipper but doc gently puts his hand on hers stopping her
doc contd lets ask ourselves if we really need to do this
they share a moment carrie understanding but nobody wants to get out of here more than i do trust me but right now were all this guy has
she slides her hand away from his starts pouring the water on the zipper
little by little it starts to move then finally ziiiiiiiiiip
the jacket opens up barely like sliced skin
doc watches as she tries to pry it open further but cant
grab that side
she takes one half he the other and begin to pull
the jacket opens up like bending metal slowly revealing a frozen but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding a deep puncture wound through the shirt
docs face sags
carrie stares at the wound
carries memory hit the well defined chest of a man wearing a tight t shirt
a bullet hole dead center
doc looks at carrie with deep concern hes tuned in
stirring up a few things
ill be alright
both take a moment looking at the body
you know this means a federal investigation and were witnesses
we may get stuck here
doc looks to carrie gentle like a dad would his daughter
we both want to do the right thing carrie but we also need to get off the ice
right now we dont have to say a word
when they find something later hey we didnt know
we were leaving the body was frozen we didnt have time to examine it
no one gets murdered in antarctica
think about it
dead is dead
he eyes her pleadingly
exactly this is the first murder in antarctica doc and i cant just pretend it didnt happen
why did i know you were going to say that
carrie steps out into the hallway
takes a moment leaning against the wall this whole thing wearing on her more than shes revealed
she tilts her head back
the second it hits the wall
carries beat to shit soul weary
shes on her knees full of blood
a man is on the floor between two beds before her
she holds her gun at her side
pulls away from the wall
leaves the memory behind
carrie has a nextel phone walkie to her ear making her way up the corridor
moves past a couple of guys loading a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room
what camp was he with
im on my way to find out
this is all i need right now
im sure his familys thinking the same thing
thats not what i meant
ill contact the fbi see how they want to handle this
she hangs up
approaches a closed door
name plate on it reads dinkle sub stations manager
moaning and groaning great sex
carrie rolls her eyes
knocks on the door
no one answers
she doesnt have time for this
opens the door to see a large tv playing a locker room porno where a quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader with no top
half a dozen guys oblivious to carrie standing there cheer the action
i hate interrupting educational programming but the cheering dies as everyone turns to see carrie standing behind them
only fake porno moaning remains
carrie contd i need to talk to dinkle
everyone gets up thrilled for an excuse to leave
one of them nods to carrie on the way out
carrie flips a nearby wall switch
lights kick on
theres a beckham poster and an x framed photo turned backwards hanging on one wall
a large map of antarctica on another
a proud assortment of tea bags are uniformly lined up along a shelf
one guy remains
on the heavy side
am i in some kind of trouble
as he crosses to her he flips the x framed photo back around its of the queen mother
a file folder drops into frame onto a desktop which is a map of antarctica under glass
file reads delta one widen
carrie opens it
three photos are stapled inside
one is of weiss the other two have names written under them rubin and mooney
mooney is a runty looking guy with a mop of blond hair
rubin is a skinny thin faced young guy with a beard that hasnt filled in yet
what are they doing out there
one one has an extremely old surface with low sediment deposition
means its a good place to look for meteorites
its right here
dinkle points to a location on the map
delta one one is labeled
boasts an american flag
i dont get it weiss was no where near delta one one
she looks at dinkle
carrie contd when are they scheduled for evac
one sec he refers to a radio log sheet hanging off the corner of his desk
gets uneasy cant find what hes looking for
finally dinkle contd they havent arranged a pickup yet
isnt that a little unusual this close to winter over
he hates to say it but yes it is
really unusual actually
i guess i shouldve contacted them but
youve been a little busy
yeah i can see that
she moves over to a long range radio console tucked up against a wall
carrie contd whats their frequency
carrie spins a dial to
keys the microphone drawing it to her face
into microphone delta one one this is united states marshall carrie stetko come back over
carrie contd delta one one i repeat this is united states marshal stetko come in over
the dull constant static never wavers
she puts down the mic
thinks for a moment
suddenly carries nextel rings takes it off her belt
carrie contd stetko
marshal its jamie
ive got some guy holding from vostok who wont give his name says he has to talk to you
patch it through
youre on now
this is marshal stetko whos this
you know who i am
carries eyes shift to his picture on the desk
what happened out there mooney
you come to vostok and well talk
come to vostok
carrie is moving at a quick pace
passes the open door to the clinic
sees doc looking through some boxes a glass of scotch in hand
getting drunk already
just gearing my liver up in case i have to stay the next six months
murphys contacting the feds
he looks over to her
raises his glass in a somber toast
youre making my day
ill do everything i can to get you off this ice promise
i know you will
whats the hurry
going to vostok
he raises a curious brow carrie contd one of the guys from weiss team called
wants to talk
whats he doing in russia
carrie walks in
rhonda has a phone to one ear another in her hand
shes hovering over one of the techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying satellite weather imagery think doppler
his focus is on a vast storm system that is heading toward asb which is marked in red neon
other stations are marked as well
were tracking it now
i need a plane to vostok
rhonda raises her finger putting her on hold
carrie doesnt like it
into phone i dont control the weather you want to stay the winter then dont be ready for your evac
she looks to carrie rhonda contd sorry cant
all the planes are committed
im not asking
what am i supposed to tell the deep drill ice core team getting picked up in four and a half
tell them i took their plane
squat soviet ugly buildings some collapsing others with boarded up windows are barely visible through the driving ice
storm lines of different colors interconnect all the buildings
carrie and delfy wearing full ecw gear lean hard into the wind making their way towards the compound
shes carrying a duffle bag
can barely see the twin otter behind them
super vostok station russian federation population temperature carrie leads the way up a decrepit dimly lit hall strung with exposed pipes and wiring
gaunt malnourished faces look up from the rooms they pass
looks more like death row
whats with this place
the russians barely supply vostok anymore
they have to barter with other bases for supplies
some of these guys have been rotting here for years
carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it out of the s ancient computers and steel cased radios fill one wall
one man welds equipment off to the side
four more russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking vodka
they all take their time looking her over
whos in charge
yuri a big bear of a man in his forties gets up from the table
heavy accent whos asking
stetko us marshal
im here to talk to an american named mooney
so many people come through vostok
is hard to remember
carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it
yuri pulls it open
its packed with steaks
the russians react with smiles and the mood lightens
yuris grin widens further
takes out a porno theres a cheerleader on the cover
mister mooney yes
i remember now
he offers pay us to fly him off antarctica on our transport
we give him very good price because plane leaves a week ago
the russians laugh
where is he
red storm line
carrie is suiting up in her ecw gear rope harness and crampons
her jackets open
delfy has a steaming cup of coffee in his hand
he looks to her gear belt cuffs pepper spray baton
you dont carry a gun
against the law antarcticas the only place in the world you cant have one
part of the treaty
doesnt that make you feel kind of naked
all this crap on i prefer naked
she zips up her jacket
he glances to a temp readout by the door
minus eighty one
wind at a hundred and ten knots
he takes a sip from his hot coffee
do you have to do that in front of me
he sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs to be fastened
give you a hand
sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf
as he fastens it carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask
they finish at the same time
ever been on a rope line in a whiteout
yeah hold on tight
delfy leaves as carrie cranks the submarine type wheel lock in the center of the door
the door is suddenly yanked from her grasp slamming open against the building
wind knocks her back
the storm sings in an even dull roar
a solid white wall of wind driven ice blows past
the light is oddly dim
the coffee mug delfy left on the shelf breaks in half exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee
it rolls across the shelf falls and shatters on the floor
carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three foot tether from her harnesses to a red storm line attached to the side of the building
she steps into the storm
carrie leans into the door pushing it closed and locking the wheel
two steps into the storm the building behind her is gone
step after step theres nothing but the guide line and the roar of the storm
a gust of wind lifts her off the ground
shes caught by her tether and smacked down on the ice
slowly regaining her stance she pushes onward
finally carrie runs into something
it takes her a moment to realize shes at a building
she grabs the wheel lock and turns breaking ice opening the door
unclipping from the line she closes the door on the howling behind her
pulls off her mask
teeth are chattering
she spins the wheel lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building
carrie hits the lights nothing
just a sliver of light stabbing in through a window
calling out mooney
only silence responds
the hallway is long and dark leading away from her in both directions
she draws a flashlight from her pocket
thumbs the switch sending a beam out through the dark
something doesnt feel right
slides her baton out from her belt
she decides to go left
walking the hall she tries door after door
finally one gives
carrie contd mooney
she cautiously pushes it open four stripped bunks in an empty room
moves on down the corridor hears coughing like someone trying to clear their throat
looks ahead and determines its coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall
its confirmed when she hears it again
stops at the door
she slowly opens it now she can hear heavy labored breathing
sweeps the inside with her light
its a large lounge type room scattered chairs tables and an overturned sofa on the other side where the heavy breathings coming from
she enters the room
inching forward she gets to the sofa
looks over it to see a body its mooney lying in a pool of blood
struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus
she goes to him
as she kneels he grabs her gasping for air trying to tell her something
carrie catches a reflection of moment behind her in his eyes someones coming at her
she instinctively rolls back over mooney just as wham
an ice axe swings down at her
just misses her head by an inch but the shaft nails her arm holding the baton that goes clattering across the floor
the killer wearing ecw gear with hood and goggles takes another swing
she lunges to the side
axe misses her but sinks into mooney
game over for him
carrie slices the floor with her light looking for the baton but cant see it
the killer yanks his axe free of mooney as carrie bolts around the sofa heading back out the door
carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run retracing her steps
her light zigzags
the killer emerges a few beats later on a run
its going to be close
halfway down the hall she hangs a hard right toward the ready room
throws a glance over her shoulder hes right behind
she targets the ready room door the orb of her light getting smaller and smaller as she nears
doesnt even want to look back its all or nothing
she pulls open the door leaping in she spins the wheel lock closed
the killer hits the door from the other side
she spins open the outside door wheel lock as the lock on the inner door behind her starts spinning open at the same time
its a race
carries door slams open first and the wind hits her hard
she pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind her bursts open
carrie jumps into the whiteout catching the red storm line and clipping in as she staggers forward
glancing back she sees the killer in the doorway then loses sight of him as shes swallowed in the whiteout
she struggles down the line buffeted by the storm but her hand on the line moves erratically hes on
she swivels a nervous whirl to see the killer materializing out of the whiteout right behind her
hes clipped into carries line
he raises the axe
she jumps back losing her footing
hits the ice hard face first
the killer towers over her raising the axe again
carrie drives her heel into his knee knocking him off balance
he drops next to her
he reaches for carrie grabbing her mask pulling it off
she cries out as the freezing wind catches her face
the killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib cracking kick flipping carrie onto her back
sound fades from carries world
there is nothing but her strained breathing
the killer draws back the axe shiny with frozen blood
carrie unclips her harness from the tether
the wind grabs her and carrie slides away the killer disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white
sliding across the ice carrie slams into a pole
cinching her hood down she searches the storm with no idea which way to go
carrie glances up the post
barely visible through the blowing ice are signs pointing different directions moscow tokyo fiji los angeles she pulls herself up and heads out leaning into the wind
carrie staggers blindly trying to protect her face
falling she gets up and struggles on
her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat
a rope catches her in the neck
its another storm line
carrie lurches forward holding the line with one arm
finally she bumps into something
it turns to face her
its the killer again
she deflects the blow with her free arm and manages to grab the axe head
the killer tears the axe free taking carries glove with it
he swings again but carrie pulls hard on the rope throwing him off balance
the axe cuts through the line
the killer hits the ground and is immediately ushered away in the wind as carrie clinging to the rope slides over the ice like a pendulum
the line goes tight shes jerked to a stop
it takes everything shes got to get to her feet
she slowly struggles up the line
more dead than alive carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel lock with both hands
unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around the wheel she struggles to turn it
finally it gives
the door swings wide and she stumbles in
but shes caught her bare hand frozen to the metal
ripping it free her scream is lost to the wind
carrie falls collapsing against the door
blackout a single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto carrie whos leaning against a sink staring at herself in a mirror
she looks stressed
her marshals badge dangles around her neck
wears a shoulder harness
the bathroom door behind her is open
she catches a reflection of a shadow moving across the room behind her
as she turns jack
she withdraws a mm from her harness eases toward the door
gun ready she rolls her back around the jam wham
carries blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam
before she can recover a guy dark eyes unshaven grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror
shards fall into the sink as carries right temple goes bloody
she drops to the floor carries pov a blurry figure stands over top of her
shes still got some fight in her hands lash out in a frenzy like a cat in water
carrie contd jack
wo wo wo
its okay its okay
the figure materializes around her
its delfy holding her down
carrie slowly settles then shes out again
shes lying on a table wrapped in blankets
an old wrinkled faced russian man slowly lowers her wounded hand pale white and missing some skin back into a tray of water next to her
her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights
a huge bruise runs across her arm
when you didnt come back we went looking for you
found a dead guy in the other building that mooney
someone got to him before i did
then went after me
how long was i out
a couple hours
carries eyes drift to the old man next to her
delfy contd hes been looking after you
he flashes a smile of crooked yellow teeth
as she starts to sit up he protests saying something in russian
she ignores him
he walks away mumbling something else
she sits up
lifts her hand out of the water fingers are slow moving
carrie contd i need to get back in there
delfy and carrie with her hand bandaged both slice the dark with flashlights
shes starting to get her bearings back
whoever it was could have flown out after the storm broke
they walk a few silent beats then delfy contd whos jack
its a moment before she responds let it go delfy
he lets it go
same as before
carrie goes to the over turned sofa
moves her light around searching
passes over the blood on the floor
until i met you i hadnt seen any dead people
now im at two
carrie gets on her knees looks under the sofa
low angles her light
retrieves her baton just as carrie and delfy leave the lounge her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight which bled out from a doors threshold
halfway down the hall
delfys eyes go wide carries finger goes to her mouth shhhhh
she instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand but it hurts
she shifts it to the other
she turns off her light
delphy does the same
motions for him to stay put
she heads to the source keeping her baton ready and her back tight to the wall
gets to the edge of the door
its open just slightly looks in
sees a man in an ecw jacket with his back to her holding a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag with his other
items are strewn
another bag has been completely turned inside out
unless you want your head cracked i wouldnt move
his body tenses
take it easy
let me see your hands
he slowly raises them
carrie contd now turn around
hes a guy in his s
although hes clean shaven theres a rugged edge about him
carrie contd who are you
delfy comes up behind her
im a united nations observer for the oceanic and antarctic section
if you relax ive got my id
lets see it slowly
as he reaches into his liner you must be stetko this throws her
pryce contd i was heading to asb to talk to you about weiss when i was told you had come up here
he holds out his id for her
as she reads how do you know about weiss
fbi notified us
your base commander called it in
carrie lowers her baton
pryce contd i thought i might find answers in his gear but theres nothing here but clothes
this is part of a crime scene
i realize that but considering the time constraints were up against lets be honest taping and bagging everything isnt going to be an option
ill be sure to let the u
know if i find out anything
she starts to walk away he follows hes not done at all
delfy brings up the rear
you heading out to delta one one
ill grab my bag
dont take this personally but i dont need your help
if theyve been digging out there thats a direct violation of the united nations treaty
we think they were digging
that makes it my business
this stops her digging
you dont dig for meteorites
and you dont get killed for them either
this is now a u
i am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if i have to
he can you know
she knows and her patience is running thin
but this is my investigation understand
if you obstruct it in any way i will have you detained
she continues with pryce next to her
mind if i ask you a personal question
no but i have the feeling youre going to anyway
why do you smell like suntan lotion
carrie and delfy are heading toward the ready room
she has her phone to her ear
two russians trail behind with mooney in a bodybag
murphy listen to me its got to be rubin who tried to kill me
you have to shut down flights leaving asb and mcmurdo search for him
thats not possible
were still bringing people in and resupplying other bases for winter over
she thinks about it sam i think these guys found something out there at the camp
im going to check it out
until i find rubin no one leaves the ice
she clicks off
carrie opens the door to the ready room to find pryce standing there with a gear bag typing into a pda treo type
he finishes entering his text into the pda
puts it away
delphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep blue crevices
delfys twin otter has landed beside the camp
there are two big tents and some scattered equipment a snowcat a chest of tools drums of gasoline
the sky is dark with clouds and the wind moans
a haze of wind driven snow whips by
carrie pryce and delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents
place looks deserted
what time is it
pryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his jacket
re tent ill take this one
she moves toward tent one pryce the other
carrie peers in
its too dark to see anything
she goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand stops herself
reaches in with her right extracts it from her pocket
turns it on
her flashlight beam plays over a litter of personal effects then picks up a trail of blood leading to a cot between two others
someone is huddled in a yellow sleeping bag on it
her body tightens
she steps into the tent
moves to the cot
theres a pool of blood underneath
her heart pounds
she uses her flashlight touches the sleeping bag
it doesnt move
she pulls at it
and discovers a pair of ecw pants the left leg is soaked in blood
she steadies her breathing
she pulls out a small baggie from her pocket
uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen blood sample from the pant leg
puts it in the baggie
takes out her camera next
flash goes off
carrie enters with delfy
place is lit by a single dim bulb
this is a work space two tables instruments on top
sample containers piled everywhere
numerous photos of meteorites are stuck to a board
she finds pryce reading the crews daily log
someones left leg took a hit lost a lot of blood
what do you got
their daily work log
delfys drawn to a bizarre looking piece of equipment its a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower
a circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box
looks like my dads old lawn mower
its ground penetrating radar
carrie moves over to a table with a map spread out on top
the ice field is marked off into sections
looks like they were surveying sections at a time
yeah hes flipping back and forth through the pages
at sections and they spent one day
carrie finds them on the map
pryce contd two days
carrie finds it
pryce contd seven days
that was a month ago
they look at each other
carrie finds it on the map as pryce moves up next to her
looks like they hit some really big meteors
about four miles
lets go see what they found
i want to check something out first
carrie has mooneys bodybag unzipped and is examining his left leg
she thinks on this non discovery for a moment then zips it back up
the cats tracks clank and crunch as it powers across the featureless ice the loneliest place on earth
pryce is in the backseat delfy is driving
carrie is next to him with the map and her gps in hand
she stares at a tiny blinking red light on the gps flashing police reds reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel
several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance
patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations watching as a handcuffed carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers
her eyes are full of tears
shes put into the backseat of one of the cars
as the door closes she stares out the window where coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck
delfys looking at carrie like hes waiting for an answer
i said which way
she glances to the gps
pryce sees carrie pause for a moment massaging her gloved left hand
yeah a little
he can see it aches more than shes letting on
how long have you been down here marshal
almost two years
what brought you to the ice
she pauses humored
the excitement mostly
everyone down here is running away from something
some shrink tell you that
yeah and that i should call my mother more often and do you
where do you plant your boots
they got me working out of christchurch new zealand
but this crazy place to make a living
she takes a moment gazing out the window to the endless landscape of white
i came down to fill in for a marshal for six weeks before winter over
i met someone decided to stay
he give you that ring i saw
tell you he was going to marry you
no just gave me a headache
carrie contd i didnt see a ring on your finger
flattered that you even looked
a faint beeping noise emanates from her gps
this is it
all eyes go ahead as they drive on
nothing but an icy plateau
after a couple of beats carrie contd stop
theres nothing here
delfy pulls to a stop
they exit the cat
all three get cold cocked by an invisible wind
carrie steps away from the cat
pryce does too
her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal
its completely flat
you sure this is right
these are the coordinates
maybe you wrote them down wrong
carrie ignores him
walks further away from the cat
ice crunches under her feet as she keeps looking then she stops
somethings not right
kneels to the ice
scoops some up
checks it out
pryce approaches from behind
this is shaved ice
she gets to her feet
walks further her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice
after a dozen steps texture changes
ice is now smooth like its supposed to be
she turns around
tries to get the bigger picture
looks at the ground all around her
realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick carrie contd they were digging pryce
and they tries to spread the ice to hide it
she heads back across the area
scans the horizon
takes another step forward
in an instant carries gone
disappears below the ice
only a four foot wide hole remains that was covered up with a white iced over tarp
pryce and delfy move toward her each hesitating slightly unsure of their own footing
pryce gets to the hole
carrie is precariously dangling in an ice shaft that slopes at a slight angle
shes managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice but shes fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on
it slips off
below her nothing but darkness
carrie contd grab me
pryce lays flat
reaches his hand down six inches too short
delfy appears from behind
to delfy hold my legs
pryce inches closer
almost got you
im losing my grip
he gets closer
moves to within an inch from hers she slips
things become silent
can you hear me
delfy peers over pryces shoulder into the abyss
saw a rope in the cat
delfy springs to his feet
a flashlight clicks on
reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up
carrie gets to her feet
sees that shes in a small dug out area
as she slowly turns to get her bearings her light falls on an escape hatch of some kind maybe three feet high
carrie shines the light to her feet
the ground beneath her is metal
pryce with a flashlight in hand lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where carrie waits
both take in the discovery
carrie moves over to the hatch
pulls on it
she and pryce hit the interior with their lights
find themselves staring into
off their lights every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out they go forward and aft disappearing
place is tomb silent
twisted and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles victims of an intense impact
the plane is pitched up at the nose making their footing precarious
cargo plane but i dont recognize it
its an antanov
russian made late fifties
no ones put these in the air for forty years
carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness heading for the cockpit
something brushes her leg
shines her light which illuminates a hand fingers in a clawed position as if in excruciating pain
she whips her light past the hand up the arm captures the face of a man staring at her
it takes a moment to realize hes dead pinned between two large metal crates
delfy stands still
carrie throws a look back over her shoulder guess that makes three
she continues on with delfy staying close
her light targets the cockpit door
carrie pushes the door open
the beam of her light reveals frozen blood splattered across a shattered windshield chunks of ice protruding through it
continues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved
each have a sidearm holstered around their waist
this isnt funny she looks back to delfy gets confused
trailing her beam of light carrie and delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing
enter a cluttered cargo area
ransacked antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons old ecw gear and boxes of supplies
dipping into a case of bottles delfy pulls one free sniffs and drinks
what is that
carrie continues through the hold
her flashlight beam flickers over more chaos of the crash
huge steel tanks spots pryces flashlight holding on something just ahead
moves to it
find what youre looking for
her light hits pryce who is focused on a heavy steel cage welded into the airframe
and inside it is a steel safe
door is open
pryce takes a beat turns to she and delfy
those are fuel tanks behind you
this plane was outfitted for long range capabilities
and by the looks of that safe mustve been transporting something pretty important
carrie moves in closer
sees that the cage has been breached
part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening
discarded tools litter the floor
they put some serious work into this
theres a pool of frozen blood near the opening where one of the torn jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood whoever got hurt they dragged him
out of here
theres blood all over the tunnel
she uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely the frost on the shelves exposes six round rust rings where containers have been removed
each one roughly measuring a foot tall four inches wide
the plane suddenly trembles
carrie contd what is that
the muffled roar of a diesel
its the cat
the unmistakable sound of falling ice
they scramble back through the darkness the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold
more ice falls
its getting louder as theyre getting closer to the source
carrie targets ahead with her light illuminates the hatch as a load of ice drops in covering it completely
the continual sound of falling ice grows muffled and
carrie and pryce both pull out their phones
no signal you
shakes his head no
carrie contd someone followed us
ice is flying
things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate illuminates carrie delfy and pryce hard at it frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with
pieces of scrap metal from the plane
efforts are big but the progress minimal
this isnt going to work its like digging through concrete with a spoon
were going to suffocate before we get out here
how long do you figure weve got
three of us down here hours at the most
delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped animal
im not going out like this
the light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade
carrie goes over to the crate slaps it against her leg trying to get more juice going
light goes out screen goes black
cant see a thing
a second later another light kicks on pryce is holding it
hands it over to carrie
delfy contd and when that one goes were screwed
carries mind whirls with her lack of options then what about the vodka we could make some torches maybe melt the ice
fire will burn the o quicker
what choice do we have
pryce knows shes right
delfy looks to them both
dont need my vote
pryce heads to the back his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light
carrie takes a six inch pearl handled buck knife from a pocket unfolds it starts cutting the liner of her coat
delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate
goes to lift it but its frozen to the floor
stomps on it
pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks
pryce comes back with a couple bottles
stops dead in his tracks
carrie looks over to see him staring at two life jackets attached to the wall near the hatch
he moves to carrie hold these
he exchanges the bottles for her flashlight
he shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back leaving carrie and delfy getting swallowed in the dark
whatre you doing
all these planes used to have bail out hatches
we came in through it
pryce goes back into the cargo area
has to be more than one
itd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing
carrie watches pryces flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft
carrie and delfy get to pryce
they follow his beam straight up to expose an escape hatch in the roof of the fuselage
pryce contd with the angle of the plane i dont think were that far from the surface
give me a hand
pryce moves to a large crate starts to push it over
they join sliding it over below the hatch
he jumps up onto it examines the hatch area
pryce contd these are explosive bolts
if we blow the hatch maybe itll smash a hole up through the ice
or if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us
we can be blown up suffocate or freeze to death
take your pick
pryce hands carrie the flashlight
she targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it a crisscrossing maze of wires
as he reaches up to examine the wiring carrie catches a glimpse of a shoulder harness under his liner
pryce contd this could work give me the battery from your phone
as he looks down carrie masks her discovery
hands over her phone
he extracts the battery
pryce contd when i connect these two wires hopefully theres going to be a big bang
may want to take some cover
pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery and prepares for another
he looks to carrie and pryce who have backed up against the fuselage
pryce contd you guys ready
carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head
pryce touches the last wire to the battery
pryce tries again ka boom
the hatch explodes inward ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light
slam slam slam until
wham it buries itself edge on halfway into the fuselage missing carrie by a hairs width
they stand there deafened and stunned then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a thin shaft of light drops into the
cargo bay like a gift from god
hallelujah pryce drops down
moves to another crate
delfy help me with this
well need to get up higher
delfy moves forward to help
the two of them push it over
its a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other
just as they finish pryce turns to find himself facing carrie holding one of the russians guns to his face
pryce stares at her in disbelief
whats going on
yeah whatre you doing
our friend here isnt who he says he is
she reaches into pryces liner pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster
switches it with the one in her hand
puts the russian gun in her coat pocket
carrie contd didnt you know its a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here
ive been authorized because of whats happened
stop lying to me she takes out her handcuffs
carrie contd delfy cuff him to the wall
she holds out the cuffs
dont do this
man the guy just saved our lives
he was saving his own
delfy takes the cuffs from her
cuffs pryce to some exposed piping
carrie lowers her gun
carrie contd you know what was in that safe
now who are you
she sees a moment of contemplation on pryces face carrie contd i swear ill leave you here to die
have you got an id for that too
listen to me forty eight hours ago we picked up chatter between someone down here and tahir soufian a black market trader in new york
it was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old russian transport buried in the ice
damn i knew that government eavesdropping was true
theres been rumors for years that the russians had a second base a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties nothing was
pryce contd the fact is before the treaty in they were strip mining all over the place down here we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapons use
it was the cold war
no one knows half the things the russians were up to
this plane could be the link between rumor and truth
and if it is true whats in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack
why did you lie to me
look the u
carries a lot of weight down here
think about it if i had told you i was c
you would have been on the horn back to washington in no time
this is a very sensitive matter
news travels fast down here i dont have to tell you that
besides i didnt know if i could trust you
carrie wrestles with her emotions
she looks back towards the open safe the blood staining the airplane floor
makes a decision
delfy wriggles out from the hole
he reaches back
helps carrie to the surface
they look around
the weather has deteriorated the sky is dark with fast moving clouds
the wind is howling
the snowcat is parked over the hole blade lowered
delfy runs over jumps onto the cat
looks inside the cab
keys are still in it
carrie notices a single set of an airplanes ski tracks in the distance
plane couldve gone anywhere
theres forty six countries here all counting down to winter over
rubin could just disappear in the mayhem
delfy starts up the cat
carrie pulls out her nextel as pryce takes out his pda
she depresses the walkie button makes her way to the cat
carrie contd rhonda
where the hell are you
how many fly ins to mcmurdo in the last four hours
you expect me to how many
i need a list of names
carrie clicks off
you think rubin might try to leave out of mcmurdo
he knows im on his ass so he might
i want to eliminate his options
she massages her gloved hand
looks to pryce whos talking on his pda as he heads toward the cat
six cannisters maybe four inches in diameter about a foot high find out exactly what the russians transported in something that size
he looks to carrie pryce contd you have a photo of rubin anywhere
back at asb to delfy how long to get there
when we get back to the plane ill get ya there in forty minutes
as pryce climbs into the cat and slides into the back into phone ill scan a picture of him and get it to you
meanwhile contact every non american base down here and put them on watch
hes got some plan to get these off the ice
he hangs up
carrie climbs in looks back at the planes ski tracks
i know why weiss was so far from delta one one
pryce and delfy wait for the answer
carrie contd he was dumped from a plane
she closes the door to the cat
carrie strides along the corridor with pryce
they pass a window where we see that an lc o evac plane is parked out front its tail section open like the mouth of a massive beast
move past several people balloons and eve of evac signs
pryce sees carrie really cradling her left hand now
you need to get that looked at
ill have the doc take a peek when were done
dinkles pulling a duffle bag toward them
sees carrie and pryce about to head up some stairs
murphys looking for you
what the hell is he doing came in on the evac
she pulls dinkles two way off his hip
hands it to pryce
dinkle contd hey i dont turn that in i have to pay for it
carrie ignores him
im on if you need me
rubins picture is in a file on my desk
dinkle shoots pryce the stink eye as he walks away make sure i get that back
pryce heads up as carrie continues on down the main corridor
murphy and rhonda are standing next to the comms tech who is sitting in front of his computer
the screen revealing the satellite imagery of the storm its grown and moving closer to asb
its packing winds of a hundred thirty knots
murphy looks stressed
shit weve got to move up the evac
six hours at least
jesus i got crew thats still not in
then get them in
rhonda is thrown off by his tone you wanted to see me
murphy looks over
sees carrie coming in through the door
where the hell have you been
she doesnt like his tone buried under tons of ice
do me a favor you find any more bodies mind not parading them down the main corridor
ive got newbies afraid to winterover for chirstsake
they want out on seats i dont have
and next time you want to take a goddamn plane anywhere you ask me
sure thing chief
we dont have enough supplies for all of us to winter over if we get stuck down here
and you wonder why it didnt work out between us
it didnt work sam because you couldnt keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here
i was stupid enough to be one of them
now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second you would realize that someones out there with six cannisters possibly full of uranium and he wants
to get it into the hands of some very bad people
and im trying to stop it so fuck asking you for shit sam
this is ridic the sound of a large book dropping onto the floor sends a harsh reverb across the room
everyones attention goes to doc standing at the door
hes really pissed
glares at murphy
doc contd what the hells wrong with you murph
ive got bodies piling up in my lab and shes the only one doing anything about it
doc contd why dont you try helping her for a change
murphy looks at doc
not giving in
carrie calms down shes had enough
you know what doc its alright
carrie looks to rhonda carrie contd you got my list
rhonda pulls it from her clipboard
hands it to her
carrie walks out with doc
a subjective pov watching carrie and doc from behind the crack of a door as they walk down the main corridor and right by
carries sitting on the edge of an examination table as doc slowly unwraps her bandaged hand
she winces from the pain
im worried about you
is it going to take another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down
she looks at him warmly you worry too much but its what i like about you
doc smiles continues to unravel the gauze carrie contd doc did you notice if weiss had a wound on his left leg
i striped him down to put him in a bodybag
theres only the puncture from the axe
no way i would have noticed it
then its gotta be rubin
i dont know
any word from the fbi
theres no way theyre gonna make it
not with that storm coming in over the peninsula
the gauze finally comes off revealing her middle two fingers have turned completely black along with part of the flesh of her palm
her ring looks strangely out of place
carrie contd oh god
doc reaches over to a nearby drawer takes out a sterilized syringe packet
jesus carrie how long did you let this go
he opens up the packet
when did i go to vostok
doc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh
he pushes hard penetrates the skin
we see the worry begin to elevate further on carries face
doc tries the needle in another location
slowly shakes her head
he holds her gaze evenly
doc contd i have to amputate your middle two fingers
dont tell me that
the fingers are dead carrie
if i dont do it now gangrene will set in
youll lose your hand
carrie is sickened
doc contd im sorry
carrie sits in sullen silence the room dark around her
the only light bounces in from a sterile draped area where doc works on her hand
she cant watch as his curved suture and thread rises and falls with every stitch he makes
carrie has her attention on bloody gauze piled up in a tray carries memory hit an image she saw earlier the well defined chest of a man wearing a t
a bullet hole oozes dead center
this time we stay there a little longer watching the t shirt absorb the blood around the wound
as the stain widens so does the camera
bringing into picture the man carrie shot
hes wearing a marshals badge around his neck
carrie looks at him sullen afraid to look down
then slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand
doc contd its going to be an adjustment
goes to a medicine cabinet
selects a pill bottle
only a couple inside
he returns with the pill bottle
doc contd should ease the pain
ill look around dig some more up for you
she stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to be
carries bag is open on the bed with the russians gun next to it
shes trying to put on a clean flannel over a t shirt but cant button it up with only one hand
her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion thats trying to get out
she finally gives up kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed
bag and gun go flying
carrie slumps to the floor
after a beat she notices pryce standing in the doorway with some papers in his hand
hes looking at her compassionately
i stopped by the clinic
doc told me
carrie nods pulling herself together swallowing her emotion
pretty tough marshal huh
holds out her ring for her
carrie contd holds up hand with missing ring if you came to propose nows not really a good time
he joins her
hands over her ring
takes a seat next to her
carrie contd anything
got rubins face all over antarctica but nobodys seen him yet
they sit in silence together for a moment
carrie sees the russian pistol thats ended up on the floor close by
picks it up
examines it like a relic
you ever kill anyone
anyone you ever trusted
i hadnt held a gun in my hand for over two years
wasnt supposed to need one down here
she looks at him carrie contd you asked what i was running away from
i came down here to forget my partner jack
thought it would be better than any therapy
we were on a stakeout at a holiday inn in miami waiting for this buy to go down
i was excited wed been after this trafficker for a long time
thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass
anyway guys a no show
one hour went by then two nothing
carrie contd then jack starting acting strange
next thing i knew my face was being rammed into a mirror
my own partner was trying to kill me
turns out the whole bust was a set up from the start
jack was dirty working with the guy we were after
carrie contd four years together
i knew things about him that his wife didnt even know
but he was my partner and i killed him that night
theres no changing that
pryce takes it all in
not the story he expected
carrie contd marshall service cleared me ruled it self defense but i had a real hard time getting over the betrayal how little my life meant to a guy i
was willing to take a bullet for
carrie shifts in her chair
carrie contd know what the kicker is jack thought i was close to figuring him out
thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me make it look like a bust gone bad
truth is i had no idea
god i was young and stupid and in way over my head
pryce joins her
carrie contd you asked me why i smell like suntan lotion jack wore aramis this cheap after shave his wife gave him
some of the guys down here wear it suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it
she notices the papers hes holding faxed photos of carrie contd what do ya got there
he shows them to her
one by one
its what the russians used to transport weapons grade materials in
they match the dimensions inside the safe
were looking for six of these
as carrie studies them pryce contd langleys thinking it might be hexafluoride which is a derivative of uranium
its a component for nuclear detonation
these beakers where really in over their heads
the radio on pryces hip crackles
dinkle its rhonda pryce smirks
i better get this back to him
and we have to find rubin
think you can you help me with these buttons first
he moves closer
starts to button her up
pryce contd for what its worth i think youre pretty tough marshall
light streaming in through the window hits her tired face
she reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall aggressively yanks her away from the open door
its kicked closed as shes drawn backwards into a mans embrace
a knifes brought to her neck
raspy deep you stetko
carrie nods slides her hand toward her pocket
man contd dont
who are you
he slowly turns her around to face him
its rubin but he looks beat to shit
deep cracks slice across his bloody chapped lips
peeling skin flakes on his face
desperate despondent eyes
shaky frostbitten fingers
hes having a hard time holding it together as he can barely get the words out
did mooney talk to you
i didnt hear from him he was supposed to call me after you talked
his eyes well
and sos weiss
he nods he knew
and im next i know it
its okay youre safe just put the knife down
his shaking hands slowly lowers it she breathes a little easier
he sets it down on an empty book shelf next to him
carrie contd whos after you
where are the cannisters
he stares off blankly weiss didnt want to go through with it
how did we let this happen
rubin i need you to focus for me
looks at her through tired pinched eyes hes trying
knock on her door
rubin is spooked
glares at her scared
like a caged animal
carrie its doc got those painkillers
its okay hes a doctor he can help you
it falls on deaf ears he goes for the knife
she tries to stop him
rubin shoves her aside throwing her against a chair
she topples backwards
he whips open the door driving an unexpected shoulder into doc who gets nailed so hard he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him
takes the wind right out of him
pills all over the floor
rubin dashes off down the hallway its an effort
carrie appears at the door
catches a glimpse of rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs
carrie contd you alright
she takes off after him pulling her phone off her hip
she takes two at a time keys the two way
carrie contd pryce yeah
hes on the run
white t shirt
as carrie comes off the stairs looks left theres three guys carrying boxes out of a room
snaps a look to the right rubins at the far end slipping through a doorway that leads into an interconnecting tunnel to another part of asb
carrie contd into walkie hes heading for the science lab
carrie kicks it into high a subjective pov catches interval glimpses of rubin through the small windows that run along the side of the tunnel as he dashes through
rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as carrie enters
its lined with several free standing empty bookcases
carrie enters through the connecting tunnels doorway
not a lot of light
slows her pace
vacant lab stations
rooms been shut down for the winter
fall upon a door across the room
a sign above reads ready she takes off again slaloming her way around the lab stations to get to the door
carrie gets to the door
pulls on the handle
looks in through a viewing window sees a panicked rubin inside grabbing ecw gear off a rack mounted to the wall
he and carrie exchange glances
rubin i can help you
he shakes his head
she tugs harder on the doors
looks through the window to see hes tied them together with some climbing rope
in that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods half the room as the outside door is whipped open
a man in full ecw stands in the doorway
hes wearing a face mask and goggles
holds an ice axe poised ready to strike its the same guy who attacked her
rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and carrie but swooosh
the ice axe is buried into his shoulder gaffing him like a fish
the pains excruciating for rubin who spins on his attacker like a wild man
bulldozes into him driving him back out the door
both tumble down a steep set of stairs the exposed end of the ice axe gets stuck in a steps steel meshing on the way down rips out of rubins
rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet
runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria
disappears around the contour of asb before the other guy can get to his feet
his assailant rises
goes back up a couple steps to retrieve his embedded ice axe but finds it wedged so tight it wont budge
carrie shoulders the door but still doesnt budge
hears footsteps behind her
turns to see its pryce
doors jammed pryce latches on to a heavy supply cart filled with beakers micro scopes and other gear thats tucked against one of the lab stations
carrie contd pryce its not rubin off his confused look carrie contd someones trying to kill him
pryce picks up speed as he targets the door
hits it like a freight train busting it open
cart goes crashing
contents scatter like buckshot
the two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through the open exit door
carrie throws a look outside bottom of stairs are vacant
ice axe is still there
shit rubin doesnt have any gear on
carrie immediately closes the outside door
pryce goes for the ecw wear
scrambles to get a coat on
how longs he been out there
rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins tucked against the base of the main building
the blood from his wound already frozen on his shirt
the cold its killing him
the suns reflection off the ice is blinding
his vision begins to cloud as the corneas are literally being burned by the intense light
he tries to shield them has little effect
he looks over his shoulder gets a blurred image of his attacker not far behind
hands go to the icy ground to protect his fall
still hits hard
starts to get up but his palms are frozen to the surface
doesnt have time to care pulls hard tearing the skin right off
spins around in a panicked whirl hes lost ground
continues to the end of the storage bins
moves under asb using the enormous hydraulic lift columns to conceal his movement
up ahead forty yards away hope
he continues toward some storage containers and the snow melter on the other side where two people clad in ecw are finishing filling an insulated container with water from an
insulated hose mounted to the melter
a snowmobile is parked next to them
he tries to scream but only a dull raspy muffled voice escapes
the guys oblivious
carrie and pryce now bundled up in ecw exit the room and head down the stairs
split up go opposite directions around the complex
rubins pace is slowing hes exerting himself to get to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the container
frostbite is chewing up his lungs
hes too slow they take off
he coughs up blood
he turns around to check on his pursuer
twenty feet away and closing
rubins eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon anything
sees the insulated hose on the snow melter
heads for it
carrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow through their vertical slats she catches a glimpse of rubin at the
snow melter across on the other side of the main building
sees the ecw guy closing in
pryce is moving under asb
passes a hydraulic support leg
spots carrie on the other side moving toward rubin
also sees the ecw guy in pursuit
heads toward them
rubins frostbitten hand reaches for the hose
grabs it but he doesnt have the strength to turn it on
throws a defeated glance over his shoulder to see the villain in ecw gear right on him
shoves rubin against the tank
grabs the hose from him
turns it on spraying him head to toe
rubins clothes turn to ice
one eye freezes shut
lips go cobalt blue
he tries to escape but several stiff steps away he slows and finally stops a prisoner in his ice locked clothing
the man moves to rubin
grabs his head and snap breaks his neck
rubins body topples stiffly to the ground
rhonda crosses the busy room
reaches for a clipboard hanging next to the window
something outside catches her attention
she looks to murphy who is on the phone
murphy and the others join her at the window
they see rubin on the ground but the snow melter blocks any view of the killer
the killer turns to leave the crime scene and whack
hes blindsided by a shovel to his head
carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head snaps the goggle from his face
blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head
the shovels courtesy of carrie who stands over top of him
holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine blade
glances to rubins frozen body neck askew
carrie is wound up
kellers still recovering from the impact i sh
shoulda killed you at vostok
where are the cannisters
go to hell
help me drag him over here
they each take his jacket by the shoulder pull him back over to the snow melter
carrie contd keep him still
she hands the shovel to pryce who puts it to kellers neck
carrie pulls her buck knife from her back pocket then whips off kellers gloves
tosses them aside
the cold makes him more coherent
sees pryce at this throat
whos tahir selling it to whats the intended target
keller shifts his attention to carrie whos using her knife to slice open his ecw jacket and pants exposing bare arms and legs
whatre you doing you crazy bitch
keller instantly starts to shake
why did you kill those scientists keller
was a four way split too much for you
carrie grabs the hose from the snow melter
she brutally stomps on kellers exposed arm douses him with water from the hose welding his arm to the ground as it freezes instantly
where is the uranium
almost smug you have no idea whats going on here do you
keller begins to shiver violently
hit the sonofabitch again
carrie releases more water freezing more of the arm
pain is too much
the plane theyre in the fucking plane
carries suddenly grabbed from behind
two other guys at his side
have you completely lost your mind
let go of me
she twists free of his grasp
gets in kellers face
carrie contd where in the plane
find them yourself
what the hells going on
she glares at him
the cannisters are on the plane
she looks to the guys that came out with murphy
carrie contd throw him in the holding cell
the two guys go to keller but his arm is stuck to the ground
carrie kicks it free
the guys lift him to his feet
haul him away
murphy looks to pryce who the hell are you
carrie looks at pryce
pryce looks at carrie
hes with the un
we have to search that plane now
murphy looks to carrie with an intense glare we dont have time
well just search it in christchurch when it lands
pryce steps in its a twelve hour flight to christchurch
anything can happen in that time
keller is here so we know its still on the ground
pryce contd once that plane is in the air weve as good as lost it
just give us minutes
murphy looks to carrie softens slightly sam do what is right here
do what you have to but that plane takes off in one hour
well need some help
ill send what i can
carrie is near the cockpit searching under a row of seats
a handful of asb employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo
carrie gets to her feet
pryce contd you check the cockpit
what the hell are you up to keller
i dont get it why lie to us we have him either way
hes stuck here
carries suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that hes buying time
carrie races off the plane
pryce tries to keep pace
carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor which is packed with asb employees carrying their bags for the evac
pryce is close behind
out of the way
pryce at her side
her face goes white
the door to the holding room is wide open
hes got nowhere to go nowhere to hide
then it hits her he wont try
hes a goddamn pilot
as the two of them take off for the door delfy walks across the floor
hangar is minimally lit
void of personnel
the otters are lined up
the snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side
he heads toward an otter
delfy reaches in and gets his sons picture which is still hanging on the console
then something catches his attention through the windshield of his plane
he sees a fuel hose running to another plane and its pumping
curious he gets out of the otter
eyes dart about the hangar
doesnt see anyone
heads to the other plane
discovers that a door is open on the other side
takes a another look around
doesnt see anyone
gets to the plane
takes a look inside and thud
hes nailed with a giant crescent wrench to the head
keller leaps out grabbing hold of a staggering delfy
ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool chest
delfy collapses to the ground in a heap
carrie and pryce dressed in ecw are making their way toward the hangar
employees are trudging up through the back entrance into the plane
get checked off a list by the load master
toss their gear into a netted cargo area
find a seat
plane is nearly full
keller has the engine going
preps the console for flight flipping switches suddenly sees carrie and pryce enter the hangar
shift their attention to the plane
they stalk forward
eyeing for any betrayal of movement
then with a nod from carrie they move in
look into the plane
its empty except for a duffle bag in the back
carrie nods to pryce
motions for him to go one way shell go another
carrie eyeballs a snowcat
its door is slightly open
she heads for it
pryce moves to check the next plane
eyes dart to every dark corner
carrie gets to the cat
springs toward the door
pryce walks under the wing of the next plane
spots delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest
looks like hes stirring into consciousness
an ice axe swings down from above embedding in his pryces chest
gun goes flying
keller drops down from the wing above
keller kicks him hard
pryce goes down
keller grabs the gun
points it right at pryce before he can shoot bang
bullets zip by keller who rolls for cover behind some equipment
another rips into his shoulder
keller spots carrie over by the cat
she fires continually forcing him to stay behind cover
the shots go wide shes not yet used to firing with the right hand
keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest shoots back which gives pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover beneath the plane
hes losing blood quick
carrie keeps shooting
bullets ping off the tool chest
carrie has to reload
keller makes his move
fires at carrie and sprints for his plane
runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it
the temperature immediately begins to plummet as winter is let inside
keller keeps shooting
runs out of bullets
leaps into the idling otter
carrie makes her move
dashes toward him firing away
bullets plant in the windshield but cant penetrate glass is too thick protection from the cold
begins to move the otter forward toward the opening doors
carrie dashes to pryce
sees delfy get to his feet
he moves to pryce
she gets over to the guys quickly giving delfy a visual once over
hell be fine but things look bad for pryce
hes bleeding profusely
she kneels beside him pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest
delfy looks to the hangar doors which are nearly open
i didnt see him
his eyes flutter shut
carrie slaps his face no
you stay awake
puts her hand directly on the wound
blood continues to ooze
she looks over to keller just as his plane exits the hangar
looks back to pryces wound wont stop bleeding
carrie contd damn it
to delfy come on
were getting him up
they lift him to his feet
haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can
the two of them place the now unconscious pryce to the ground
carrie grabs delfys hands
puts them directly on the bloody wound
surprisingly he stays focused
hard or he will die
it wont stop
looks delfy right in the eye
hes not going to be number four
carrie rips open pryces jacket and liner
scoops up an armful of wind blown ice
starts packing it around him
keeps repeating the motion
she keeps shooting looks to kellers departing plane moving toward the runway
the cold hits pryce shocking him awake
what are you doing
she holds him down
youre bleeding out
freezing drops your pulse
we have to slow it down
you hold on
carrie snags the two way off her hip like its a quick draw
carrie contd sam is doc on the plane yet
no whats going keller got out
he hurt pryce hes bleeding bad
in the clinic
about to bring the bodies out
whats tell him to stay put and i need your help getting pryce there
were at the hangar
ive got to stop keller hes got the cannisters
carrie doesnt wait for an answer
gives delfy the two way
carrie contd dont let him die
sprints back into the hangar
on a full sprint carrie dashes over to the snowmobiles
doesnt stop her
she jumps on one
fires it up
uses her left palm to steer blood starts to seep through the gauze
she quickly bundles up then guns it
rubber treads grip
she races it across the cement floor and out the hangar
off in the distance kellers heading for the front of the runway has to turn around to take off into the wind
carrie veers off targeting the tunnel to asb
hits her light as she races in
carries light silhouettes murphy and a couple of his guys as they head toward her
she doesnt even slow down as she blows right by them
desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto the runway
his wound oozes blood eats the pain as he gives it full throttle
starts to pick up speed
heads down his strip of freedom
a funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before carrie on the snowmobile
she holds tight as she burns a big u turn around one of the berms and onto the runway
heads straight for the lights of kellers plane
he sees carrie
she targets him like a japanese zero
hundred yards and closing
hes pushing to get airborne
seventy five yards between them
gap narrows fast
stay on carrie
looks like suicide
she suddenly swerves a hard left disappearing behind a berm he bears a momentary sense of triumph starts to get airborne until launching up off the berm is carries snowmobile
she bails letting it continue right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she tumbles down the berm
kellers pov a thousand pounds of snowmobile comes at him fast obliterates the cockpit
cripples the plane pitching it sideways
a wing catches the runway catapulting the entire plane into a cartwheel of disaster as it veers off the runway and resume carrie slowly gets to her feet
the flames reflecting off her goggles
she heads to the wreckage
the cold and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly
only a sputtering of flame remains on the front of the twisted remnants of the otters cockpit
the aft seems relatively intact
carrie looks in
sees the charred and already frozen remains of keller
in the back the charred duffle bag
she moves closer
reaches in through a broken window
pulls it out to the runway
only survival gear
delfy along with murphy and his two guys carry pryce in
docs in the back room with two others loading the bodybags onto a cart
doc quickly moves into the front room
the other two follow
doc springs into action pulling on gloves
pryces face ashen
get him on the table
they usher him onto one
he looks to delfy who still has his hand on pryces wound
doc contd dont move that hand
i know i know hell die
doc shifts his attention to one of murphys guys you four units o pos in the warmer
second shelf fridge
the guy heads for it
shes still in her ecw gear
heart sinks when she sees pryce
doc leans over pryces pale form
as doc gets an iv going he looks to carrie doc contd what happened
keller hit him with an ice axe
he get away
murphys walkie on his hip crackles to life
rhondas standing up front with the pilot and copilot watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming at them like a tidal wave
brings a walkie to her lips
sam its rhonda we gotta go
murphy looks to doc
can you do this on the plane
its your call but i need to know now
doc whos wrestling with deep contemplation looks to carrie she sees the answers no
ill stay with you to his guys grab the bodies and get them on the plane
the guys head for the back as doc looks at pryce knowing he needs him
leave the bodies you dont have time
dead is dead
pick them up in six months
doc looks to carrie whos thankful im sorry
the guys after the bodies look to murphy for a decision
murphy and carrie exchange a quick look closure
take care of yourself
he takes off with the others
the wind is hurricane fierce as murphy and his two men are just about to board the plane
murphy looks to the storm a forboding darkness getting closer by the second
he realizes they might not make it
the lc s jet engines roars as he gains speed down the runway faster and faster then it suddenly gets swallowed in the storm like an avalanche covering a skier
camera stays on the fast moving storm the plane nowhere in sight until the lc finally pushes out the front of it airborne
takes off into the horizon where we see that the sun is just about to set
carrie is standing next to pryce on the examination table
hes been bandaged up
an iv drip hangs from a stand on wheels
shes looking at him with soft caring eyes been through a lot
he slowly opens his
tries to smile not easy
hey hey back
you get him
she shakes her head nope
they both think on it for a moment
what did we miss
think keller cut and run without the stuff
after all this no way
keller didnt have it on the plane because hes got it hidden somewhere
where would he hide something for six months
somewhere he could be sure no one would ever look
if he had made it out he wouldnt have been crazy enough to come back for it
true what the hell was his plan
pryce thinks hard hes got nothing
weve got six months to figure it out
a squeaky noise in the back of the room draws their attention
its doc coming through with the cart a bodybag on top
eyes open thats always a good sign
he continues pushing the gurney toward them hey doc thanks
thank her if she hadnt slowed your bleeding
doc rolls the gurney behind her doc contd im going to hunt me down a bottle of scotch carrie turns looks at doc as he wheels the gurney by
need any help
she sees its weiss name on the tag but something disturbing catches carries eye its weiss left leg pressing against the bag
although the plastic is clouded shed swear his left calf has a long line of stitches running down the side
doc contd you okay
his voice pulls her focus
she masks her startle
just thinking where it all began
yeah its a damn shame isnt it
doc continues on out the door
pryce sees that shes bothered what is it
nothing ill be right back
she heads out the door
carrie slips in
weve been here before this is where she chased rubin
darkness creeps in phantom like as the remaining daylight fades out through the row of windows that run along the side
carries plunged into inky black
she hears the science lab door open before her peers through the dark blanket to see doc walking toward her
carrie slips in between two bookcases trying to stay tight against the wall
doc walks right by and out the door
she rises to her feet
hurries down to the end
disappears into the science building
turns on the light
illuminates the lab stations and the busted open doors of the ready room
heads for the freezer
carrie opens the door
illuminates the interior with her light
storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls
lying on the floor are the bodies of mooney rubin weiss and keller
carry goes to weiss body
kneels next to him
goes to unzip the bodybag but sees that its been locked with a plastic cinch
pulls out her knife
holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch
unzips the bag
her light travels down his body to his left leg
she rolls it slightly for a better look
the truth hits her like a sledge hammer
there it is like standing center stage in her light the row of stitches holding a deep gash tight together
shes about to stand and walk out but she stops herself
thinks about that leg those stitches
the fact that doc lied to her
pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor
her light pans back explores the rest of weiss upper body sees a dried river of blood thats run out from under his armpit
to herself someplace no one would ever think to look
she raises weiss arm
she cuts through them
skin splits to reveal the bottom of a cannister thats been stuffed inside his chest
she reaches in and pulls it out
even has rust on the bottom
carries confused its not like any of the cannisters pryce showed her photos of
it look more like she contemplates opening it for a moment then places her hand on the top
begins to twist
it loosens easily
pulls the lid off
looks at it
whatever it is its frozen
tilts the can slightly and out slides a foot long ice core sample
cant quite figure it out until she shines her light on it the freezer dances with glistening light
the core sample is packed full of diamonds
she looks to the other two bodies
she opens mooneys bag
sees his chest is uneven more cylinders inside
repeats the action with rubin
carrie slowly stands the betrayal almost too much
if they had just gone along with it
she turns doc is standing right behind her
doc contd those fools found a plane had no idea what they stumbled onto
turns out the russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties
and we thought it was nukes the whole time
keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us
it was a hell of a lot of money
how did you get wrapped up in thing doc
weiss got hurt on the plane
they were afraid to move him so mooney called me
keller and i flew out
but they couldnt get the safe open keller found a way
then weiss got cold feet
it got ugly didnt it and keller killed him at delta one one
everything went to hell after that didnt it doc
keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing
if those idiots hadnt panicked none of this would have happened
he turns and walks out of the freezer
carrie carefully follows
sees hes heading for kellers ice axe in the ready room that someones removed from being wedged outside onto the now uprighted lab cart pryce used to bust open the
turns back to her
but there has been a subtle shift inside him something illogical
ill cut you in carrie
theres at least million in diamonds in there
that can buy both of us a nice life back in the world
how many times have we both talked about having a fresh start
well this is it
those beakers finding that plane was a sign
a sign telling me it was time to go back
now i have something to go back for
she has a realization
there is no granddaughter is there
this was about greed plain and simple
no one will ever know
its just me and you
we can take care of pryce
his callus disregard for human life rocks her
dead is dead right
yes yes now youre getting it
whats happened to you
there are four people dead
people we knew
doc looks at her
shes not sure if its registering
carrie contd where you going to stuff my body too
was i going to be five
he turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards it
she pulls the gun out from inside her liner her mind a whirl of limited options and grim solutions
he nears the ice axe on the cart carrie cocks back the trigger carrie contd i wont go through it again
dont make me shoot you please
her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she wrestles with her emotions
its either ignore all of this or kill me and you and i were too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice
he walks right past the ice axe and into the ready room
doc your not thinking straight
but hes not listening
ya know its really warm
im gonna take a walk try and cool off
the temperature gauge on the wall reads
he looks at her
carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside doors latch
he musters a smile
remember carrie freedoms just a sunrise away
using both hands on the latch he pulls
the door blasts open filling the space between carrie and doc with violent winds and blowing snow
docs throws one last look to carrie then takes two steps out the door
disappears into the blanket of white
wind and cold storm into the room against carrie who remains standing still like a statue
freezing to death tears frozen to her cheeks
a shadow passes by her its pryce
hes hunkered over in pain but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the ready room
latches onto the door
it takes everything hes got but he manages to get it closed
cold to the bone he grabs a jacket off the racket
approaches carrie who remains staring at the closed door
the effects of the chill and docs decision apparent
pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders
gently leads her away
super three months later the sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby as we cu on sand with a shadow of a palm tree
casting over top of two pairs of feet intertwined
slowly widen to see carrie and pryce kicking back on lawn chairs side by side
two heat lamps pouring out bright warm light
a cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps throwing the shadow
pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder
carrie lies back rests eyes closed
hows the weather where you are
but theres a gentle breeze
fijis beautiful this time of year
barts aint bad either
they lie there quietly relishing the moment
pryce contd six months
six long months
carrie turns over on her stomach lets the heat warm her back
freedoms just a sunrise away
theres a new calender on the wall where the days of winter over have been marked off long way to go
pull away from the building which fades into the icy darkness and howling wind of the antarctic winter
