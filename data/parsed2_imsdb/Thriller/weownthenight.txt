written by james gray the camera zooms out to reveal a cemetery in the foreground
tombstones blend into a never ending sea of middle class row houses in the distance and nothing seems to separate the two
a newly dug grave is in the lower left hand corner of our frame
hundreds of policemen in their dress blues enter from frame right
a few cops carry a coffin
new york new york
a new breed of narcotics has swept the great city bringing with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in recent memory
the old criminal order is gone
in its place new ethnic groups rise up to seize control without respect for traditional rules of engagement
outmanned and outgunned demoralized by cutbacks and scandal the police find themselves burying one of their own at the rate of twice a month
the words turn blood red then disappear
the police lower the coffin when they arrive at the site
as we begin to zoom into a close angle on them we hear music
a thumping close on bobby green thirty
he is passionate and vital and handsome a real physical presence
his clothes are stylish expensive
a sly smile
he steps forward into the camera moves with him to see rosario diaz twenties dark skinned impossibly gorgeous
leaning up against the wall biting her lower lip eyeing bobby with true desire
youre so fuckin beautiful you know that
they kiss passionately
they really go at it
they are ferocious as they devour each other i love you baby
then we hear a fist banging on a door a muffled voice bobby
you in there
no answer theyre too busy making out
then more banging
they both start laughing
the voice continues bobby
if you two could just keep your hands off each other for a second i i think we got a situation brewin out front
we gotta go anyway
beat to the door ill be out in a second louis
she grabs him he moves back in starts mauling her again
she slides down his body perhaps to perform fellatio
a huge bustling vibrant nightclub very s
decadent pure new york
bobby emerges from the back room area straightening out his outfit
rosario is behind him fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club
bobby enters the pulsing vital heart of the place
as he appears everyone approaches happily shouting out his name
he is having a blast
bobby is the master of this domain
an s version of tony manero from saturday night fever but without kitsch
he is genuine cool
music blondies heart of glass
bobby waves hello to people greets them hey baby
a pretty girl kisses him the women love him
moves with a swagger a dance
as he sways he re buttons his shirt claps his hands
he is the club manager and he loves every minute of it
hes giddy alive a permanent grin
a man waves to bobby
bobby sees seated at a table surrounded by his gang vadim nezhinski
thirty five acne scarred huge black pompadour big gut
one of his men pavel lubyarsky is next to him
bobby nods back to them
rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends and we see an operation at work people come get their coats slide the coat check girls a hundred bucks and with
their coats the patrons get junk put in their jacket pockets
rosario looks to one of her girls alina a young russian with too much makeup and counts the cash
pockets some of it
from rosarios behavior we see shes involved in the a huge fight thats breaking out
club patrons and security guys are in the melee
rosario moves past all this to the front door
louis falsetti forty backs off from the multiple struggles all around him
louis is wearing a jacket that says security on it
he is the jocular type very overweight redfaced
bobby arrives at the fight scene
with cheery braggadocio what the fucks goin on in here
bobby moves right in
grabs a struggling and drunk patron puts him in a headlock
he gives the patron a shot to the temple just to keep him docile
lou bobbys best friend watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment chortling with every punch and scream
he balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care avoiding spillage
but the battle gets closer and closer
seeing his friend bobby whos hardly got everything in control okay bobkes
looks like you got everything under control here so uh so im gonna go outside take my break
yeah just keep that wide load of yours outta trouble arright
yes your fuckin majesty
the patron is acting up again trying to free himself from bobbys grip
bobby looks down at him
whatre you doing
you gotta behave yourself here
gives the guy a shot in the head
meanwhile louis saunters past the melee jumping gracefully over a fallen drunk
he bows in triumph when others applaud his leap
everyone laughs as he goes out the door
bouncer freddie helps clean up the mess
a girl screams as a guy is flipped on his back by bouncers
a patron with blood on his face acting like an eight year old to bobby who hurls his guy out of frame cmon mr
i didnt do nothing
well now youre gonna do nothing someplace else
louder to all fighters pointing now listen one of these days im gonna run this whole block and i see any you in here again any you ill bust your
to freddie throw em out on their ass
i gotta go upstairs drop off my keys with the old man
wood panelled walls
bobby walks upstairs fixing his hair
an ornate gaudy place
the walls are covered by mirrors with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them
plush couches clutter
bobby walks in
we hear radio music up here nothing like the stuff played downstairs
a russian crooner
in an easy chair sits marat buzhayev pronounced boo shy ev
he is old kindly weakened by age sits next to his babushka wife kalina
buzhayev watches a russian musical program with the sound off listening to his small transistor radio
buzhayev how are you
bobby leans over hugs the seated old man
the two embrace warmly they are close
before separating buzhayev touches his face
kalina yells happily in russian grabs bobby embraces him too
she couldnt be more motherly amd bobby beams at the treatment
bobby is moved almost embarrassed by the loving attention
then gently dropping a set of keys on a side table listen mr
buzhayev i gotta go do something right now
but dont worry everythings in good shape downstairs
warm gentle yes good
you take care of things good for us
then as bobby stands next week you come by we talk
we talk about plans for you
bobby lights up nods
marat pats his cheek
kalina tries to give him a small care package of food
he politely refuses and a minor and friendly ad libbed argument in russian he said he didnt want any food and you keep trying to give it to him
breaks out between the old husband and his wife
as bobby exits broken english bobby
where you run off to
a modern church
a big crowd in front made up of police
we hear music
close shot of a black outdoor sign behind glass
our lady queen of martyrs church queens ny

a large room with columns
streamers balloons everywhere
old cops young cops men women are here

many cops are drinking cavorting smoking cigars making sandwiches

a mass of people surround two people as a photo is taken angle on joseph grusinsky thirties

angle on bobby as we go to we move past partygoers
then appearing at the top of the steps bobby and rosario whos being eyed up and down salaciously by the men in the party
the two start to come down the narrow stairs leading to the basement
a portly ebullient man russell de keifer bobby

the two walk upstairs
burt steps forward
rosario moves near everybody this is my girlfriend

burt and joseph take one look at her and respond with subdued hellos
she is not exactly well proper looking
and she isnt white
she picks up on this tries to act as though she doesnt care
burt turns to bobby we gotta talk to you
angle on bobby
this gives him pause but rosario gives him a slight nod of her head assuring him its okay
so jack and michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church
looking for anyone who may be hanging out ducking in and around
they spot a couple making out in one of the pews
the man is shirtless the woman in her bra
caught they let out an embarrassed chuckle
with offense but also humor in a house of god no less
cmon get up
the couple sheepishly exits the room pulling on their clothes
as they do they pass bobby burt and joseph coming up the stairs
joseph pulls up the rear standing behind his father
bobby sees jack and michael now seated several rows back
beat then hello bobby

bobby gladly gives a nod of recognition sits down in an empty front pew
burt brushes lint off his sons shoulder
your hairs long

joseph speaks up diverting bobbys attention bobby i asked pop to bring you here

bobby is still focused on his brother then to his father you fuckin broadsided me

joseph sharpens whole citys falling apart bobby dont you got any sense of responsibility at all

burt gestures to mike and jack and they exit
joe doesnt respond at first

joseph lingers leaves

bobby turns his back on burt getting up to walk downstairs
burt remains emotional reaching out to his son when bobby is not looking lowering it to no avail
the music is off now
bobby comes down burt follows
joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another cop
a squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak nypd deputy commissioner spiro giavannis
rosario is leaning up against a post drinking watching the party
she stares down a guy who ogles her lasciviously
with a sense of humor she winks at him you take a picture itll last longer
bobby approaches rosario grabs her hand cmon lets get outta here well go party with jumbo
he tugs her away
she stops him
with assurance we could stay if you want baby
they dont like me i dont care youre better than them anyway waves her off were goin
she hurriedly puts down her drink
joe stands near spiro but his attention is on his brother im deputy commissioner spiro applause
bobby rosario move to the exit
simultaneous you know we look around in these troubled times and in moments like this we need leaders men and women who can bring order back to our great communities

joseph smiles waves
filled with hubris
joseph many of usve known your father deputy chief burt grusinsky for many years and i know he wants to say a little something
applause for burt who waves steps up thank you

big applause as joseph steps forward
bobby and rosario squeeze through the crowd to the stairs
thank you everybody for coming happy thanksgiving
before i say anything else
we got some bad news this morning
one of our irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night detective edward conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on northern boulevard
the clocks about to strike ten so i thought we might give a moment of silence to remember
instinctively he turns back to the room motions to rosario to stop
out of respect
then the church bell rings
the bell gongs
the camera dollies past joseph and his family and jack and michael then past rosario and burt and bobby
the bell stops
the sea of blue the police genuflect
our characters do not
instead bobby stares at joseph and burt across the crowded room
they return the glare and bobby exits
the camera tilts up to an apartment window
we cut inside music up princes housequake
hot girls and flashy looking guys
the men are drinking
the women make themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the sofa
a couple kisses in the corner
everyones getting ready for a night of revelry on the town
they are singing having a great time
the decor is late s though not exaggeratedly so
drugs are everywhere
we pan around the room a set of weights on the carpeted floor with clothes scattered everywhere on the wall a jets football schedule a led zeppelin poster
bobby is primping in the mirror
rosario stands on bobbys king bed dancing sensually to the music in a state of partial undress
she moves with great freedom puffing on a joint
im gonna be like madonna
you think im like madonna
bobby sees rosario in the reflection his face lights up
were both leos you know
youre just like her baby
bobby opens his top drawer to get a watch
reveals thousands of dollars in cash hidden underneath a fake drawer bottom
traces his fingers across the money with private pride then puts on the watch
rosario bounces down on the bed
reaching under the bed sneakily she pulls out a small box
she hides it
then i talked to my mother yesterday
she said shed be okay by herself so i could move in if i want
without self pity your family aint gonna be too happy though
i saw how they looked at me
its all right they dont like nobody outside their own little world
you know copsre fucked up
in my neighborhood if they aint taking money theyre beating on you for no reason
my brother and my father aint like that
its just the whole thing aint for me thats all
bobby approaches her
takes a puff of her joint
then you know how gorgeous you are
bobby pushes her down on the bed
starts kissing her on the neck lips then breasts
caressing her hips he leans back and looks at her observing the brightness and kindness of her face
her eyes mild calm and truthful and her smile carry him into a wave of tenderness
he moves in to kiss her again and under his breath she takes out a little jewelry box
i got you something
what is it

he opens it
a simple gold chain
she takes it out puts it around his neck
she has a huge smile ear to ear
he looks at her moved
a flood of emotion
sotto youre so good to me
i love you
and someday were gonna get a big house together in new jersey with a lotta kids
only if you behave yourself
bobby gently spreads her legs starts to rub the inside of her thighs
then moves to her breast
kisses her with love
rosario clutches him secure
the doorbell rings
a mussed bobby enters from the bedroom passing the party
bobby opens the front door louis hazel
thrilled he waves them in
when the rest of the room sees louis they scream jumbo
he holds his arms aloft as if greeting an adoring crowd
uh oh the partys really gonna get started now

bobby starts to punch louis in the arm playfully but hard
rosario enters the room singing along with the song thats playing yazs situation
she moves to bobbys side mock punches louis stomach too
to the gang with cheer everybody i gotta be at el caribe in an hour so get ready
silence except for the clicking of gun mechanisms
the troops gird for battle checking their weapons

joseph is deeply troubled by the prospect
whats it gonna be
bobby and rosario and louis and the gang enter
bobby gleefully shakes hands upon entering then splits from the group
rosario joins several girls as they fix themselves up in front of large lobby mirrors
opening the door is kalina who embraces him
in russian bobby

a grown woman marats daughter masha waves while sifting through a stack of furs on the sofa
one of her young children a daughter holds her hand

bobby is being shown out by kalina and is about to depart when buzhayev calls to his wife in russian give him for tonight
she reaches for her purse

a large neon sun is lowered from the top of the theater
sitting on it singing s pop star taylor dane
the crowd goes nuts

without a word louis motions at a large corner table vadim nezhinski seated in the center
surrounded by two young girls and slavic featured men and dark skinned latinos
a latino man and one of vadims guys a young dark skinned white man converse at the table
after a beat the two men move to the coat check area
cash stacked on the edge of the table
rosario appears coming through the crowd
she goes to nezhinskis table counts out money for him
nezhinski appears affectionate with her sticks some of the bills in her hands
bobby turns away from vadims sight
shes with that fuckin animal again
shes a player bob

jesus christ what i saw
the camera moves into a close up on louis
its the mens room in the club
louis is in the stall his pants pulled down
he hears nezhinskis voice and a muffled struggle
louis immediately pulls his feet up squatting on the toilet seat
looks into the crack in the stall door
we still hear nezhinski dragged him into the toilet
they stood him up against the wall and held him we see exactly this
nezhinski faces the man
two associates of nezhinskis hold him back covering his mouth with silver electrical tape
they fuckin pulled down his pants and i swear to god nezhinski just cut it off
nezhinskis associates pull down his pants and louis sees the mans bare ass
the man is panicking muffled cries for help penetrating even the flashback
nezhinski pulls out his switchblade holds it up to his face then lowers it
a glint of reflection on the knife
back to the present
worst thing i ever seen in my life bob
anyway cops found his head in the middle of brighton avenue the next day fuckin dick was in his mouth
you sure it wasnt your dick

bobby laughs heartily
just then vadim sees him
pavel holds up his drink in acknowledgement and waves him over
ill be right back
bobby walks to the table
theres a lot of food around vadim hes eating off six different plates
bobby is really only focused on rosario
when rosario sees him shed been counting bills she brightens virtually getting out of her seat hi honey

bobby sits between rosario and nezhinski
rosario kisses him grabs onto his arm vadim puts his arm around bobbys shoulder

bobby takes rosario by the arm away from the table
as bobby moves with rosario to the bar

he grabs her you hear what i said

and im not gonna rely on you for bobby purses his lips frustrated
then just hold off then for a little while
i got my reasons
momentarily confused she mutters a kay then kisses him
bobby moves the hair from rosarios face

bobbys about to respond in kind when
all of a sudden the doors at the clubs entrance have burst open
loud like a gunshot
plainclothes and uniformed both
joseph comes in holds up his badge which hangs around his neck
with command everybody
get your hands on your head and dont fuckin move
to a woman turn off that music
four uniformed cops bolt straight to the coat check area
all kinds of drugs and weapons start falling to the floor
the patrons are desperate to get rid of any incriminating evidence and both men and women run to the bathrooms
several patrons start dumping narcotics into the toilet bowls when many cops enter and with ferocity hit them with batons to corral them
the toilets are backing up
some girls rush in others are already inside
two pretty young women are in the corner freebasing when cops burst in
one of the pretty girls out of surprise starts to shake the small pipe flame to extinguish it
the opposite occurs and the flame ignites the ether
the two girls holy shit
get the extinguishers call paramedics
the cops pin everyone up against the wall or on the ground
everyone is lined up searched
s are checked
bobby turns to rosario gimme your shit
troubled she nonetheless puts a handful of pills in his palm
bobby quickly swallows them
a uniformed cop approaches bobby hey
i saw that
get your hands on your fuckin head
bobby is brutally shoved to the floor and searched rosario is tossed aside
the uniformed cop to someone else jessie
this one just ingested
all patrons in the club with rare exception get forcibly lined up hands clasped on the backs of their heads
paramedics speed to the ladies room
jessie the cop takes out a ketchup squeeze bottle except its black and forcibly fills bobbys mouth with charcoal arright open up a little charcoal to absorb the toxin
as bobby gags joseph walks through the club with confidence
the place though absolutely packed is uncharacteristically silent
he turns to uniformed cop give everybody a toss
this gets mikes attention
joseph signals something to him he nods moves to the back
joseph walks over to louis pokes his gut too much pizza right there
several cops laugh
then joseph sees bobby and vice versa
close shot on joseph
he sobers his brashness muted
joe walks toward vadim and his party
vadim has his face to the wall
joseph kicks his legs further apart
joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on vadim
in russian subtitled turn around
vadim turns around
joseph starts to search him
he pulls a wad of money from vadims pocket what is this
want me to double your money
vadim doesnt answer
joseph takes out a huge swiss army knife hes got on his keychain
he cuts the wad in half
its doubled now hows that
michael and jack search the other members of vadims party
they rip out pockets
michael points to a womans fur you got anything in there
he motions for the mink
she hands it over
he pats it the uniformed cop puts handcuffs on bobby and others
rosario watches upset but powerless
louis is down next to bobby
unwittingly referring to bobbys brother
jesus that cops crazy
shut your fuckin mouth
several officers charge through now pulling the latino man and the young dark skinned white man in cuffs from behind the coat check
bobby is pulled up on his feet
joseph interrogating vadim
as he looks through i
you got a cross and a jewish star on you
the cross is for good luck
whats the star for
that ones for god
just then michael solo interjects
in josephs ear coupla dimes on em cocaine a little pcp
joseph nods acknowledging this news
he eyes vadim then turns to the two men okay lets go
and you to the young man youre under arrest possession and sale of narcotics michael reads two other men one of whom is a tall man from near the table
a lookout perhaps their miranda rights in a totally perfunctory manner
almost mumbles them
paramedics exit the womens room
girls are on stretchers
marat buzhayev enters the main room of the club
he is escorted by two uniformed officers who are very obviously not arresting him
they are asking him questions and writing down his comments
he turns to see
a humiliated bobby who eyes him back
bobby is then quickly ushered out along with tens of others
marat watches as does rosario
louis and rosario are left behind not having been arrested
neither has vadim
joseph moves close to vadim
with arrogant brio re the dark skinned white man in russian subtitled your boys gonna turn
and then well come back for you
joseph eyes vadim virtually mocking him
vadim eyes joe back with silent rage on his face
then the cops push the young dark skinned man out and as they do he turns back to vadim
the young man is terrified
bobby too is hauled out like a common criminal
the station s era very unlike ones seen on t
the walls are tan brick peppered with fallout shelter signs
archaic robert moses era like
lit entirely by large fluorescents overhead noticeably free of those desks and typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies
a big sign above a bulletin board reads we own the night
bobby is led in by a portly cop
there is blood all over the floor forming a lake
jesus christ what the hells goin on in here
the young dark skinned man is right outside the cell his body in spasm covered with blood coursing from his neck
cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams
russian guy fuckin slashed himself
after seeing this bobby is shoved in his cell his nose still leaking the charcoal blood all over his shoes
after a beat he lies down on the cot
bobby exits walks toward the nearby subway station
spots burt whos waiting for him
bobby ignores him where you going
i was the one who got you outta there
thanks a lot
i appreciate it
youre a real big shot arent you
you see what happened in there last night
hey im talking to you
burt grabs his sons arm
moves closer you know you and your girlfriendre only getting off cause of your brother
up to me youd sit in there another couple days
bobby looks around
he opens up
with quiet but real fury and total sarcasm okay ill go thank him too then
he comes in raids the fuckin place now i gotta go beg em not to fire me fire you
probably the best thing that ever happened to you
fuck you pop
fuck the both of yous
enraged burt slaps his son on the side of the head dont ever speak to me like that again
you hear me
ill rap you right in the mouth
you fuckin touch me
you gonna fuckin touch me
bobby cocks his fist
but burt is ready
then bobby decides against it bolts
on burt as we go to bobby enters
packed with people
a family get together for thanksgiving
children abound a party atmosphere
bobby is in the foyer holding a cake hes brought
several furs laid out on a felt covered bench
into the living room he sees masha and eli seated on the couch holding the hand of their son who is dressed in a striped suit
upon seeing bobby eli nods to him and masha enters the foyer greeting bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and taking the wrapped present from him
sitting at the large table is marat playing with one of his grandchildren
bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance
when buzhayev spots him the child hides behind marats leg
marat lets out a laugh at this to the child no no its okay
the boy waves perfunctorily
now we go this week to the field okay
to ride the horses
go to mama
marat addresses the boy clutching his leg ad lib a russian go kisses him and the child runs off
bobby steps closer to marat mr
im real sorry about what happened the other night
if i was working maybe i wouldve been able to do something but
anyway im sorry
its not your fault
marat darkens considerably
more interior tone almost as much for himself as for bobby you cant always control everyone in your family
my nephew he dont come back to the club anymore
marat brings his hand to his head looks pained
you dont mind my saying i think thats probably the right thing to do
things get back to normal im hoping we could get started on what we talked about
shakes his head we need time for the bad publicity to go away
buzhayev my getting arrested aint gonna be a problem
i dont got a record with great effort marat stands
i dont worry about any of that
he puts his arm around bobbys shoulder
i used to teach chemistry before i come over here and now i have the fur store and this
one thing i learned here you can always start over
so dont worry someday we do it
food is ready
marat looks at bobby with great sympathy as they walk toward the living room
you take some time off everything will be fixed in a little bit
then you come back
i pay you for the time
bobby mutters a thank you
buzhayev touches his cheek
marat then turns back into the dining room spreading his arms affectionately and wide yelling ohhh to the children as they cheer
angle on bobby as we go to
present joseph michael jack
joes seated at the head of a long table which is covered with coffee deli sandwich remnants and police reports etc
they are working we greet them in media res
he stabbed himself he was a bundle guy
mighta known how theyre movin it
see thats the key all of a sudden in comes bobby
finally we waited til it was your day off
we had to go im sorry
bobby takes a step toward him you had to hit that spot
nezhinski was seen there bobby
what am i supposed to do announce it in advance compromise the whole thing
i had plans down there
yeah well i tried
what do you want from me anyway
you know youre standing there feeling sorry for yourself but you wouldnt be in this shit if you didnt fuck around in the first place
you got real balls saying that to me
i made something for myself and you come in and fuck it up
just cause im not trying to be like you
and pop bobby youre the one acting like youre above it all all the time
fuckin around with your little puerto rican all day what did you call her
you heard me
have some fucking class for once
bobby takes another confrontational step forward
raging you piece of shit
ignoring him you go around like youre a big shot
youre a joke
grow up already
bobby lunges forward grabbing his brother
joseph leaps up out of the chair
awkward punches are thrown
jack and mike leap in trying to pull the two apart hollering break it up ad libs
the two are split up panting
you come at me like that
dont come around me no more i dont wanna have to look at your fuckin face ever again
fine with me you motherfucker
bobby exits slamming the door
angle on joseph distressed
silence then i dont know joe forgive me but uh your brother
ever since your mother got sick do me a favor dont get involved
well pick this up tomorrow
im gonna go home
michael is quieted as joseph packs his briefcase
joseph drives up to the house a working class part of queens
he parks the car
joseph looks at his knuckles
they are bruised and bleeding
emotional about the fight he looks toward his lit house then opens the car door
joseph drops his keys as he exits
reaching down for them on the asphalt he hears a sound and looks up and to his left
a man with a hood over his head
looks almost like an old time klansman with two holes cut into the hood for his eyes
hes pointing a gun right at joseph
josephs eyes pop and he lets out a quick gasp but he has no real time to react
the man pulls the trigger
a thunderclap slaps the silence in the neighborhood the a mist of blood plumes around josephs head
the bullet hits joseph in the face through the cheek
he snaps back spasmodically
an automobile a monte carlo pulls up to the scene of the crime
another hooded man in the back seat throws what looks like a molotov cocktail into josephs car
the auto starts to burn
joseph lies on the sidewalk bullet in the head his blood everywhere
he seems pretty dead to us
the monte carlo speeds off
the shooter slumps into his seat ducking out of sight of the street
he pulls the hood off over his head
it is vadim nezhinski
in russian get us onto the expressway
joseph on the ground
the car burns in relative silence
dogs barking in the neighborhood
the pal gym filled with off duty cops boxing jumping rope
burt hits a large bag that swings from the ceiling
he is dressed in sweatpants and a v neck undershirt
as he hammers away he is involved in some cheerful banter with fellow cops you gotta keep your hands up
keep your hands up
then he sees in a large mirror two uniformed cops and the police chaplain edwin oconnor standing near the doorway
he stops his exercise
they approach him
after a long beat burts expression changes and he senses something bad
a long look at the men
then which kid is it
the cops turn to each other
burt tries to prep himself but its impossible we see the cracks in his sangfroid its joseph
hes at st
it dont look good right now
burt does his best to stay stoic
you want us to contact your other son
go on ill be right out
hesitantly they leave
he crouches near his gymbag
closes his eyes
the color drains from his face
then seeing other cops eyeing him whatre you lookin at
its got nothing to do with you
all of a sudden as if hes been shot he collapses
chief you all right
smoke and drink everywhere
madonnas dress you up plays in the background
bobby rosario and louis are at the center of a poker game
lou sits next to bobby partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear from time to time
rosario sits next to bobby and watches the game intently
the poker pot seems exceptionally large
a stocky latino man is the main one competing with bobby
bobbys a mess maybe worse than weve yet seen him
but he is happily drunk his eyes bloodshot
he and louis look at their cards
rosario turns looks at bobby for a beat
she sees a small bruise hes got on his forehead kisses it
baby you got a little bruise here that aint nothing
he starts rubbing her between the legs under the table
she kisses his bruise again
louis pokes her
smiling and pointing to his crotch i got a bruise too you know right here
rosario lets out a loud laugh
louis whispers pearls of wisdom to bobby so bob i think we fold
we fold right
bobby ignores him
instead aloud to the latino man well see you and bump you two cs
whispered too loud we will
bobby turns to him winks
the phone is ringing
rosario gets up walks over to the phone near the sofa and picks up with a soft hello
meanwhile bobby puts a whole lot of cash in the middle
the latino man looks at him like hes crazy
bobby takes a shot of liquor
turns over his cards
he has a pair of queens siegfried and roy baby
two fucking queens
a pair of tens
bobby stands claps once
lou thrilled jumps up and hugs bobby
bobkes i love you
rosario has a slightly serious look on her face as she calls out to bobby bobby its for you
who is it
she shakes her head as if to say i dont know
slightly peeved that he needs to attend to the call he leaves the table
as he does so louis to some girl proudly i was the one told him to keep goin
then louis grabs the pot for himself as bobby picks up the phone several feet away from the ruckus
he covers his free ear with his hand to hear better hello
bobby its michael solo i got some bad news
your brothers been shot
hes at st
johns theyre workin on him now
i just thought you should know
bobby of course is stunned
the poker table in the background is a riot a contrast to the sober message bobbys getting
he turns his back to the crowd sotto is is he gonna be all right
listen your fathers coming i gotta go
but hes at st
bobby waits a beat frozen then does the same
rosario knows something is wrong approaches him
my brother was shot
theyre operating on him now
rosario sees how remote he is what a blow it is
she pulls him to her you gotta go see him be there for him and your father
bobby eyes her walks to the table
a close shot on him
games over everybody
what you shuttin it down
i gotta go
fuck you man

bobby grabs his coat
rosario responds in kind moves to bobby
he spins to her
in hushed tones whatre you doing
i wanna come too
no its gonna be a fuckin scene
ill call you later
bobby moves to louis louis lock up and take her home
confused he nods sure bob
hurt rosario spins around and enters bobbys room closing the door behind her
yeah no i just remembered i gotta do something thats all pats louis arm as if to reassure him
then the latino man tries to grab some of the pot
other players revolt hey hey
what the fuck
a fight breaks out
louis moves over to the women holding them back odd they werent going anywhere to begin with take it easy take it easy
calm down and everythingll be uh non compos mentis
bobby exits his place leaving behind rosario and louis and chaos
bobby walks briskly to the entrance
media are all around but they arent paying attention to him
they are elsewhere with members of the police each other etc
the room is jammed with officers and friends including many faces from the opening party
most of the cops dont seem to recognize bobby at all
all the news media are outside banned from the hospitals interior
burt emerges from the hallway
he sees bobby at first comforted by the sight of his son
but quickly he darkens and starts to walk right past him
burt keeps walking
bobby follows pop he all right
bobby touches his fathers arm and burt spins around what do you want
you stayed out of it you got what you wanted
why dont you go somewhere and pick a fight youre good at that
bobby is speechless for a moment
burt pulls his arm away and walks on
a mustachioed cop approaches burt chief the union sent a shrink over for you nah i dont want that crap
enter someone we recognize as the mayor storms in with his entourage
the commissioner william ruddy well see him later and deputy commissioner spiro giavannis are with him too
they approach burt
bobby moves aside
hello your honor
thank you for coming
chief grusinsky an attack on an officer is an attack on society
whoever did this in a clean neighborhood like that they gotta be hunted down like animals
well get em your honor
im gonna come back in and run it myself well get em
meanwhile michael takes bobbys arm walks him into a small room with payphones
theres a window through which we can see the waiting room
the shot went in his cheek and come out through the jaw
it missed his brain thank god
close shot on bobby
he was real lucky considering
almost to himself i need to see him
bobby starts to exit
michael stops him bobby that aint a good idea
i probably shouldve told you not to come down here therere a lotta things going on right now
a beat then you guys blaming me for this
is that it
listen i aint judging you i called you cause i thought you had a right to know
but were gonna be going hard after nezhinski and maybe some other people youre close to
like that girl you know thats bullshit shes clean
you fuckin keep away from her
bobby realizes that no one wants him here
he looks through the glass to see burt still speaking to the mayor
bobby storms out of the room to
he turns toward intensive care
sees a crowd down the hall
two guards block the doors to the ward
determined bobby decides to walk over
nobodys allowed in except immediate family
you got some i
bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet
as he does we hear a soft chime
a womans voice sounds on the p
as a friendly reminder visiting hours will be over in five minutes
says here your name is green
look im his brother you fuckin hard on
bobby stares at the men for a beat then makes his move
charges past the guard
the guards stop him and a messy struggle ensues
all of a sudden josephs wife sandra emerges from the ward
she looks devastated
the struggle stops
all fall silent out of respect
bobby steps back
sandra turns to look at bobby
to the guards its okay
bobby walks toward the entrance
sandra seems to read his mind speaks
your father just left for the precinct
bobby nods subtly mouths a thank you
the guards step aside
he walks to the doors
enters josephs bed is in the back of the large space
his face is blocked by hospital curtains
bobby steps forward
slowly he walks to his brothers bed
he peels away the curtain
looks at josephs face
josephs visage is completely ravaged on the left side covered with bandages that are soaked with blood
a terrible image
the emotion surges within him hes heartbroken
it is a surprisingly painful moment
we can tell he didnt expect this level of destruction
his mouth drops open slightly
josephs eyes open just a bit but dont look at bobby
bobby slowly lifts his fingers touches joes arm gently
his fingers move down to his brothers hand
joseph is unresponsive but conscious
all of a sudden sir
josephs hand closes around bobbys fingers
the connection is huge
bobbys eyes well up and he rubs them almost ashamed of the emotion
it is a shocking outpouring of feeling from him
he leans over haltingly kisses his brothers forehead sir im sorry i
visiting hours are over
he waits a beat
the nurse gently pulls his shoulder
he backs away his eyes reddened
the camera moves into a close shot on bobby as we go to a loud active hallway of a housing project
graffiti on the walls trash on the floor but full of life
bobby emerges from the elevator emotionally distraught
he sees in one far corner of the hall two young latino teens smoking crack
he goes to one of the apartment doors knocks
opening the door is a late middle aged latino woman
behind her is rosario
the woman who answers the door is clearly rosarios mother
rosarios mother discreetly backs away from the door
he and rosario stare at each other for a moment
bobby gropes for words
his emotions bubble up inside of him then barely audible his voice cracking feels like it was my fault
he sinks down holding her tight his head at her stomach
she gently strokes his hair kissing the top of his head
she shakes her head to reassure him whispering no
in this moment he needs her
in this moment he is like a twelve year old boy
across from the el caribe
its like a scene out of balm in gilead here raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town
bobby and rosario and louis sit at one of the tables
bobby kisses rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse
she looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine
louis meanwhile is unaware of bobbys state of mind and is busy putting on a show as usual whered you run off to like a jew
you got outta there it became like a real zoo
the spics looks to rosario scuse me the p
s theyre goin nuts for the money picka picka picka picka and the girls theyre screamin and im keepin everybody in line
im fuckin bustin heads like bruce lee im fuckin bustin heads he gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible
accidentally kicks the waitress whos bringing the check
oh scuse me sorry about that
bobby picks up the check hands louis some cash
hercules do me a favor before you kill a waitress go pay the check
but ill tell you bobkes nobody else could ever do for you what i did
louis smiles walks off
scoops up the tip from a nearby table
dont tell louis nothing about what happened
far as he knows my family moved away a long time ago
i aint ever gonna say nothing
i just thought
maybe he could cheer you up a little
bobby kisses her atop her head
just then vadim and his gang enter the establishment
they create a ruckus
spotting bobby and rosario vadim ambles toward them hey look whos here
as vadim approaches we were just gettin something to eat
nods to bobby you make it through that bust okay
bobby gives a simple nod as well
inside bobby is extremely uneasy though outwardly he is quietly confident i didnt have nothing on me
glad to hear it
without making eye contact bobby shrugs then your uncles got some problems now though
he does what he gotta do i do what i gotta do
he dont own me
to rosario baby why dont you go keep jumbo company make sure he leaves a tip
rosario leaves the table
two girls walk by hi bobby
bobby nods to them
vadim watches them walk away
then you know moves closer i still got my shit coming in
some of us think you could help get it out there
its a little dangerous right now dont you think
we got a lot of muscle behind us
the brazenness of the comment shocks bobby
he looks up begins to focus
softly as the camera zooms into a close angle on bobby muscle
a cop got hit today
they aint never gonna sit still for that
another member of the gang speaks up pavel
police are a fuckin joke dude the mickey mouse aint gonna do nothing
pavel laughs and bobby looks at him with real resentment
vadim pushes pavel aside motions for him to sit down elsewhere
vadim pulls up a chair
intimate bobby those cops they they aint no problem
vadim turns over his hand
a spider web tattoo graces the palm of his right hand you see this
i got this on the inside at tchita
you earn these
so dont worry well get em all
cut off the head the bodyll fall right
you keep on doin it til they get the message
even quieter we got all their names
on a list
vadim leans back in his chair
bobbys eyes widen
vadim makes a pop sound
bobby tries to hide his shock
vadim grabs bobbys arm squeezes it
just think about it
you change your mind you call pavel
nods then ill see you around
and the men move to another table
bobby looks at rosario and louis whore standing by the register
they turn back to bobby and smile totally unaware of the conversation thats just taken place
close shot on bobby as we go to its a huge municipal structure
bobby bolts inside
the place is hopping with police everywhere
almost like a fraternity house
bobby charges in looks around
pushes his way through the crowd toward the main desk
sergeant provenzano forties rings a silver bell which is engraved with the words homicide bell
the room quiets down
provenzano holds up his hands
our little a house got another coupla stiffs today so its time for another poem
catcalls reads from a pad the people of brooklyn have been volleyed and thundered at last the number slaughtered has reached one hundred
bobby shoves his way through the crowd
urgently i need to find deputy chief grusinsky
oh uh hes on the second floor i think
in the muster room
bobby looks down the hall
he sees his father talking to a crowd of uniformed cops
burt sees him keeps talking
bobby touches his arm
pop i gotta talk to you
its important i got information
bobby pulls his father aside looks around to be sure the two of them are out of earshot of others
forcefully its about you
burt is surprised
his attention sharpens its bad
burt realizes the severity
then we hear
jesus christ you gotta be kidding me
a large room lit by fluorescents
mostly empty of furniture in the center with vending machines against the wall and a sole ibm pc in a corner
a huge gun rack is on the wall conspicuous a hint perhaps of the violence to come
it is bobby and burt jack and michael
bobbys been telling his story
he and burt are seated jack looks out the small window in the door then turns the lock for privacy and a nervous michael is pacing nezhinski got a hit
bobby looks at his father then nods
mouths an almost yeah
michael purses his lips then spins around to burt
we gotta go bust em burt right now
angle on burt
he betrays no hint of concern no
theyll be back on the street in a day
we gotta try and catch em with their hands full find out where they got the real weight
then we can move
that could take us forever
its our only play
uncustomarily jack speaks i say we go hit em all
wipe em out suicide by cop whatre you talkin about
cmon dont be a first class schmuck
but we dont got the time to infiltrate em burt lets his temper flare briefly we see a more mature version of bobby then we make the time
to mike bobby look i want you all to understand something we dont ever play in the dirt here okay
not ever no matter what
you piss in your pants you only stay warm for so long
what about callin in the feds
they got a lot more juice than we bunch of college boys from kansas
we protect our own here
bobby sees an opening pop nezhinskis been talkin about a shipment hes got comin
maybe thats how you get to him
how you know about that bobby
somewhat sheepish they been wanting me to buy in for a while
michael turns to the others
brightening well maybe thats it then
if we can get him re bobby to set something up maybe one of our uncles could move in
pointing to bobby with some ridicule itd have to be him forget it both of you
what do you mean set something up
youd go set up a buy with em just like theyve been asking you to
we follow you to the spot bust em a week later
that way your names clean nobody knows youre involved thats too dangerous for him
we dont know how solid his cover is out there
to bobby that girlfriend of yours she knows about you right
so can we just get back to the discussion please
bobby is dead serious pop
you could trust her
but its not happening
so forget it
but you could get killed dont worry about me just worry about yourself arright
anything happens with your brother ill call you
bobby is still there fixated
finally bobby exits
we go to bobby enters his room which is dark
rosario is here asleep
her back to bobby
upon hearing him enter she turns and looks at him and us in slow motion
bobby sits on the edge of the bed touches her back
she senses something wrong and speaks voice ravaged by sleep everything okay
they said on the television your brother was doing better
me and my mother we said a prayer for him
something seems to dawn on bobby your mothers real important to you aint she
youd do anything for her
yeah i guess
she looks at bobby who appears deep in thought you thinking about your brother
about your family
there was nothing you could do
bobby leans over kisses her go back to sleep
he lies down next to her still fully clothed
stares up at the ceiling
she whispers to him
its all gonna work out
burt and jack and michael
burt is talking to the others in front of the hospital but we are in wide shot and we cant hear them
burt shakes their hands then walks inside
mike and jack walk in the opposite direction
bobby stands inside an abandoned parking kiosk
hes been watching from afar
jack and mike approach their parked car
he tries to obscure himself partially inside the kiosk
they see him
you been up to see my brother
your fathers still with him we were just gonna go back to the psa
try and figure out a tac plan on nezhinski
hows that been goin
we dont got much yet but well do our best
you all right
bobby hesitates then reveals himself completely well i
i been thinking
if you could keep it confidential
id make the connection for you
they trust me we could go in large use my money for the buy they wont suspect anything
its too dangerous you heard your father
he dont gotta know anything about it
if anything went wrong hed never forgive us
its just i realized
strains to utter my father dies cause of all this i couldnt live my life knowing i coulda done something
looks at both men i know the same is true for you
i know it is
so please can we do this
jack michael turn to each other
then angle on bobby
prelap a phone ringing a small office equipped with telephones headsets and fold out chairs
lockers line the walls
bobbys on the phone waiting for someone to answer
reveal jack and michael are here too with headphones on listening in
its bobby green
i decided i wanna buy in
how much we talkin bout here dude
bobby looks to the cops
they start mouthing something but he ignores them
fifty k to start
mike and jacks hairs stand on end upon hearing this
oh the mans gonna be good with that
how bout tomorrow night
well meet at el caribe round midnight
with a sly laugh that way you could dance a little say hi to your girlfriend
ill see you tomorrow
bobby hangs up
most expensive phone call i ever made
well get it back for you
jack reaches into a nearby locker for something then approaches bobby and hands him a small black beeper
now listen from now on youll get all your information through this at an undisclosed location
your contact with us is over after you leave here
bobby takes the beeper
michael touches his shoulder just be smart about things
you get burnt and we gotta put you in protection its still better than winding up dead
an informant dies they talk about you for a day
a week later aint no one remembers your name
moral of the story is dont die
angle on bobby as he sobers
then you need to promise me something though
you wont investigate my girlfriend shes she dont know any better
she wont be a target
just make sure she dont open her mouth
ill take care of it
michael grabs bobbys shoulder a gesture of affection
you know we known you your whole life kid
bobby enters the bedroom
presses his answering machine button and a message begins to play
it is rosario
just wanted to see how you were doing i guess youre at the hospital now
i hope your familys doing good
okay i love you
jumbo says hello too
as her voice plays on the machine he moves to the dresser where he opens the top drawer
inside thousands of dollars his savings
he begins to take the money out of the drawer and count it when we hear a soft buzz
he quickly looks over checks the beeper
he stares at the paged number
a man stands by a bench almost floating in the fog
he is stocky dressed in a down vest
bobby enters the frame trepidatious he and the man eye each other for a moment then bobby holds out the beeper
the man takes it
man takes out a kel device listening unit and its accessories
among them a cigarette lighter
he unscrews the lighter
complex electronic innards
your wires in here were gonna follow the signal
find the stash house and make the deal you leave the rest to us
you gonna leave me all alone out there
shrugs then i aint gonna lie to you
theres always a risk
man hands bobby the lighter
he fires it
your covers blown call for help dont try and be a hero
just get outta the way place could turn into a butcher shop
talk about pussy thatll be our signal to come in early
you come up with that one all by yourself
ignores the joke just do the deal and get out
bear in mind your life is in that lighter
anything goes wrong the departmentll get word to your father
the man unceremoniously turns to leave
then suddenly and oh g
told me to tell you your brothers coming along real good
they reset his jaw and sometimes hes awake
bobby acknowledges that with a single nod of his head
the man departs
bobby grasps the lighter tight looks at the man as he virtually disappears back into the fog
it is an older catholic church a beautiful interior
a line of young latino women hold candles singing as they walk toward the altars
a healing mass
rosario is here
she lights a candle at the altar then walking back to the pew she sees bobby and approaches
bobby looks around seeming harried and paranoid
bobby whatre you doing here
bobby looks at her his eyes filled with emotion
i i need to talk to you
im coming home in a little bit
he doesnt respond at all
he appears almost in tears
finally sotto i im gonna inform
for the police
im gonna help em set up nezhinski
rosario is shocked
almost inaudible what
as she steps back he moves forward i had to do it rosario
these motherfuckers they were gonna come after my father
rosario tries to recover
can barely speak
sotto but nezhinski finds out hed kill he aint ever gonna find out
he aint ever gonna know
but what if something goes wrong
whats gonna happen to you
i dont know
id id probably have to go into protection
oh my god
rosario breaks down tears flowing
her hand to her mouth but thats never gonna happen
how could you not even talk to me about it
bobby spins around to see if anyones listening
he pulls her into a dark corner of the church rosario listen i had to do it
bobby pulls her to him holds her tight
in her ear i had to do it
rosario is emotional
then everythings gonna be all right
dont worry itll be all right
still fervid she is silent
club music up
bobby enters the place determined
he has a bag tucked under his arm
many clubgoers say hearty hellos to him
people are dancing having a glorious time
louis is here thrilled to see bobby
he hugs him effusive heartfelt bobkes

bobby gently pats his old friends shoulder
interrupting this freddie steps in bobby hey
buzhayevd love to see you im sure want me to tell him youre here
no its okay ill talk to him later
he then walks by the coat check
he and rosario see each other
he turns sees pavel in back
pavel waves to bobby and bobby starts walking to him
bobby approaches a table reserved for pavel and the rest of the gang
bobby joins them with his bag
oh he dont come in here no more well i got fifty grand in here
and it dont move less i deal with the man himself
so if youre interested i wanna see your stash right now
pavel thinks a moment eyes his cohorts
back to bobby be on the boardwalk in a hour
bobby turns to leave
pavel calls after him and dude this dont shake out
pavel quickly draws his hand across his adams apple
bobby exits passing by rosario as he does
she gives him a fearful look
the famous brighton beach boardwalk
bobby stands in the cold waiting holding his bag of money
takes out the lighter the listening device
he fires it it works
looks at his watch
in rummaging through his pockets for a smoke he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number on it
he approaches a nearby phone booth
bobby holds the paper in his hand dials the number
a voice answers hello
joseph on the phone in bed
nearby sandra is folding his blanket around him
bobby says nothing
bobby sees pavels car drive up
bobby hangs up the phone
takes a deep breath
we hear dude
bobby approaches the car
pavel is in the back seat calling to him with the window open
bobby approaches the automobile
pavel is in the back seat calling to him with the window open
another american sedan behind them
bobby enters pavels
bobby takes the front passenger seat
pavel is behind him
someone we dont know is driving
bobby is somewhat edgy with pavel behind him
the car pulls away from the curb
then pavel throws a small towel over bobbys head
points a revolver at bobbys temple
bobby is startled by the action blinded
trying to stay calm
put your hands out where i could see em
you know me
shut your fuckin mouth and do it
the driver looking anxiously in his rear view mirror makes a sharp left and the car veers
pavel then pats bobby down searching for a wire anything incriminating
to the driver turn at the light
the car makes a sharp left
in russian subtitled go left
the livery car makes another brutal sharp left tires screeching just slightly
pavel again lets go
no ones on us
the camera moves into a shot of the hooded bobby
the livery car pulls up to the curb
we are on a strange residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere
many silhouetted figures stand in doorways up and down the block
they are all armed with shotguns and machine guns slung over their shoulders
a garbage can is on fire a few yards away
the men get out of the car
they pull bobby out
they walk up the stairs pulling bobby up over the steps
they pick him up lead him to a door
someone pulls the hood off him
bobby looks around
the room is absolutely bare
the driver puts bobbys bag of money down on the floor
a teenaged boy wearing a surgical mask comes and puts one on bobbys face as well
bobby surveys the place
where the hell is he
with that mask on his face we hear his breathing loud and present through the sequence
it could be night or day we wouldnt know
the windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light
there is visquine hanging from seemingly everywhere
parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material
silhouetted figures roam through the space like apparitions
a slavic looking man takes bobbys bag of money leaves the room
stands pavel masked as well armed now with a kalashnikov rifle
without a word he motions with a move of his head to bobby
follow me he seems to be saying
bobby enters the room right behind pavel
he sees a dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror
tables set up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them
there is a television on in the corner a russian ethnic musical program silently unfolding
there are other people in the room a brown haired man and two dark haired slavic looking women
its an assembly line for the preparation of narcotics
the slavic man takes out the stacks of bills
starts counting them methodically
pavel motions to the brown haired man puts up two fingers
on cue the brown haired man rubs his hands together then takes two large jars from his desk
beneath the desk bobby spots what looks like an enormous number of packages of narcotics stacked against the wall
this is clearly their stash house
the brown haired man pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk blotter
he sits down takes off his jacket revealing
the designs combine several images skulls snakes and the spider web element that marked vadims own tattoo
he takes a rusty letter opener it had been sitting atop the desk and pierces a green package
white powder seeps from the package
bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form
he uses two playing cards to move the drug
bobby eyes that rusty the brown haired man dips a measuring spoon in another powder to add to the mix
he is cutting the drug
he continues to manipulate the substance and his hands move with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef on a cooking show
close shot on some lines of cocaine
pavel takes a toot
he offers it to bobby as a taste
he pulls down his mask momentarily rubbing a rather large quantity of the drug on his gums his lip
we hear you needed to come here tonight
bobby looks over to see emerging from the black from down a darkened hallway vadim nezhinski
everyone is wearing a surgical mask except of course for him
bobby eyes him with eyes that seem to become more bloodshot by the second
whats the matter aint pavel good enough for you
thats all the money i got
and i aint gonna leave it alone
the slavic youth finishes counting bobbys cash its all there
vadim points to the money whered you get this
from my savings
from el caribe and rasputin
nods then that buys you three keys in here
with the crack on the street its worth two hundred k
vadim walks over to a stack of green packages all the shit i get here is at least eighty six percent pure
and we got a lot more comin in a lot more
in a way nobody could ever trace
vadim steps away from the narcotics and towards bobby the whole cityll be sucking our glass soon youll see
we push the guineas out the domosll work for us
vadim looks at that money again takes a step forward
bobbys forehead has beads of sweat
vadim walks up close
looks bobby in the eye for a beat
youre breathing heavy
i took a little taste
vadim puts his hand on bobbys chest checking his heartbeat
you know i seen fighters they breathe like that means they get nervous
bobby shakes his head
he is wired out of it but he pulls himself together
his jaw clenches
with fire an edge of defiance im clean
you wanna search me again you go head
i just wanna make this deal and go home
vadim violently pulls out bobbys pockets
out falls a he sifts through the items lighting the lighter
bobby gets slightly edgy
notices that the others congregate around the objects from his pocket all except for pavel who holds an ak trained on bobby
bobby inches ever closer to the rusted letter opener that the brown haired man had used to open a package of cocaine
vadim puts down the lighter
and it occurs to him you got both matches and a lighter
bobby realizes instantly that vadim is right
bobby shrugs feigning innocence
he braces himself and decides to give the signal im gonna get pussy from this
what you say
bobby looks around
theres no cavalry to the rescue
he tries again when this deal goes down im im gonna get a lotta pussy
pavels attention turns to vadim
he moves toward nezhinski who starts frantically pounding the lighter against the desk
trying break it open
bobby scans the joint
the men are trained on that lighter and this is his chance
he slips the letter opener into his hand
bobbys head now
setting himself bobby looks around the room wheres that backup
and the camera speeds past pavels and vadims faces to the other side of the room
it moves toward the window vadim hits the lighter again
this time it breaks open
revealing a bevy of wires
it is clearly not just a lighter
the camera tilts up
vadim is enraged
he got a wire
kill this motherfucker right now
it looks like hes a goner
pavel raises his gun and charges toward bobby about to fire when the door bursts open
mike and jack lead the way but there are what seems like tens of emergency services unit officers with them hands on your heads
on the floor
bobby a terrifying look on his face
but bobby is ready and shoves the letter opener into pavels neck
blood cascades down the mans chest
pavel collapses on bobby still very much alive
his eyes are popping and he throws his hands around bobbys throat
vadim charges into where he pulls up a section of linoleum revealing a trap door that leads down to the apartment below
horrifyingly drug peddlers armed with all kinds of guns pour out from rooms everywhere on the first level of the building as well as the third
several pushers are hit
the police have their gear and are reasonably protected though two of them are wounded
bullets splinter the floor beneath their feet and the wall right above their heads
they have their backs to the wall as their only cover
percussion grenades thunder through the structure
pavel this has become the madness of war
pavel bleeds profusely all over bobbys chest and this is a fight to the death
bobby wrenches the letter opener out of pavels collarbone and desperately and repeatedly stabs pavel in the base of the neck
pavels screams mix with gunfire to make a hell
at that moment a shotgun blast blows the top of pavels head clean off spattering bobbys face with brain particulate
bobby is forced to get out from under
vadim slides down to the back room in the apartment below
panicked he cocks his gun searches for an escape route
bobby gets up into a crouch amidst the gunfire
dodging the bullets
an esu police officer does not recognize bobby as an ally and he trains his assault rifle on bobby
bobby screams his hands raised im with you
im with you
this is inaudible with all the ammo being dispensed and bobby knows it so he dodges the officer the officer begins to unload his weapon getting closer to bobby
bobby is about to be killed when bobby falls roughly twenty feet through the air
his body tumbles upside down toward a wrought iron fence that surrounds the base of the apartment buildings side
bobby hits the fence
his leg gets caught on one of the small spikes
he screams as we go back to
cop cars pull up by the dozen from everywhere
out of one comes burt grusinsky carrying a shotgun
he charges right into the structure
nezhinski opens the window about to go out onto the fire escape
a warrant unit officer is below
looks up halt
hold it right there
hands on your head
vadim spins around
his hands are in the air
officers pour in among them burt
cops forcefully push vadim to the ground
start to cuff him
burt pulls jack wheres my goddamned kid
jack is speechless he doesnt know
we see that burts question revealing bobbys identity registers on vadims face
vadim mutters aloud but sotto in russian he is a dead man
not comprehending shut up
burt frantically pushes through the crowd of cops
bobby is upside down hanging from the fence but he is alert
two members of the emergency services unit approach him
on sheer instinct alone he starts to pull his leg off the small spike his teeth clenched
an army of esu troops and paramedics come to bobbys aid
bobby is being lowered from the fence
an ambulance zooms up the street to the alley
burt rushes to his son
jack and mike come right behind him
bobby looks at his father his face nicked by many small cuts from the glass
sheepish he cannot say a word and averts his fathers gaze
hes gonna be okay chief
to others clear out
burt eases when he hears this
they move bobby toward the ambulance
burt turns to michael
sotto you guys go on a bust like this and you dont tell me about it
you think im born yesterday
i guess we do
youre a real comedian
hes gonna need to be in protection now
bobby sits up on the stretcher as a medic treats his leg
burt approaches watches for a moment
the medic leaves the post for a moment and the two are alone
burt stares at his son who finally speaks ill be all right pop
shakes head then well i guess i dont have a say in anything anymore
you did it
you did it and it took real balls
but now youre burnt and we gotta get you someplace safe keep you under wraps for awhile
i need you to get my girlfriend pop
i need her to come with me
burt is getting emotional aware of how close his son came to death
trying not to show it and failing
ill get them to take care of that
just go get yourself fixed up thats the most important thing
with that the medic returns and with a heavy heart burt closes the ambulance door
bobby is alone with the medic for a moment in the back of the vehicle he watches through the window as his father walks to his car
bobby sinks to the cot lies down
as vadim nezhinski is led away in a local news channel the story is about the bust major narcotics seizure kilos of cocaine
an officer is killed two perpetrators among them pavel and the slavic man killed
four others wounded
more than a dozen arrests
we see the perps lined up against the walls
vadim nezhinskis mug shot
were told hes awaiting trial
in a related story a news report on joseph grusinskys release from the hospital
he is a hero she says and she tells us its been five months since his shooting
he is going home
several police cars line the block
there are armed officers perched on rooftops
many of the houses have welcome home banners hanging from them
the media are here
neighbors are on their porches
packed with people and playing children
two armed guards stand against the wall
a crowd surrounds someone
then as the camera dollies closer people move away to reveal bobby seated in a chair against the wall
his leg is bandaged
ad lib friendly hellos from partygoers who surround him and treat him respectfully
pan over to reveal rosario seated next to him
she sits quietly his arm is around her shoulder
people are staring at her
spiro giavannis we saw him at our films beginning hes the deputy commissioner and hes in uniform shakes bobbys hand enthusiastically
he uses his hands to cup bobbys bobby hi
spiro giavannis deputy commissioner
glad to see you made it out here today
they let me come long as i brought these guys with me
bobby points to the armed guards next to him
hows the leg treating you
its rehabbing good for only nine weeks
dont matter i wasnt no fred astaire before
laughter from others
bobbys expression changes sobers
anyway it aint nothing compared to my brother so
ad libbed agreement from others
a fat lady peeks her head in calls out everybody theyll be here any minute
a rush toward the door
rosario leans in to bobby bobby im gonna go outside for a minute have a smoke just hold on til he gets here
you got any idea what youre gonna be doing after the trial
im not sure yet
we been thinking about moving down to miami
guy i used to work for his brothers got a place down there
gee thats great
well listen you need any help you give us a call
cause we can be part of your family too
he gives bobby his business card
bobby takes it mutters a thank you
spiro pats him on the shoulder leaves
bobby turns to rosario knowing shes somewhat out of place here
children run by having fun
bobby eyes them then he leans closer
sotto tender a lotta kids here lotta family
its nice aint it
whispered you know how happy i am youre with me
he leans over kisses her
a random woman whod been looking out the window turns back toward the house
with a huge smile on her face here they are
bobby brightens begins to stand with only a little difficulty as he anticipates josephs entrance
as this happens rosario slips out from under his grasp be right back
and she walks off
bobby watches as she enters
rosario closes the door on bobby turns on the running water
then begins to rummage through her purse
finds a small vial of cocaine inside
takes it out opens it but drops it in the sink
the drug spills into the water washing it down the drain
frantically she tries to finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain
entering the house joseph and sandra his wife
joe holds two bags one filled with cards and memorabilia the other with clothes
what seems like a zillion people are here when he walks in
burt moves right behind him all smiles
joseph is thrilled but somehow not the same
his face doesnt look bad but one eye is a different color from the other and hes had reconstructive surgery on his jaw
there is of course a scar and hes lost a lot of weight
behind him burt waves everyone closer
jack and mike and other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand back all smiles
ad lib hellos
an elderly neighbor comes forward giddy wow fella
you look great
pointing to his own your eye does it hurt
only when i look at you
then joseph freezes
he notices bobby next to the armed men who havent left his side
the two brothers make eye contact
the crowd quiets a bit
bobby smiles at the sight of his brother
joseph gets emotional too hey bobby
without a word bobby nods moves to his brother
as burt looks on pleased bobby takes his hand and grips the back of josephs neck
joseph pulls his brother to him by his neck
a real embrace
joseph pats bobbys back
im real glad youre home
the two separate both smiling gently
breaking the moment
everyone lets lets move inside theres plenty to eat
small talk begins
the group dissipates moves to eat etc
burt moves to joseph joseph we got some things we need to discuss when you get the chance
we could do it now if you want pop
in the den
burt nods reluctantly
all our men walk to the den except for bobby who hears rosario down the hall
she approaches him
bobby im gonna go back to the motel
whatre you talking about
they got a lot of food over there why dont you go eat something
shakes her head n im gonna go back
bobby senses shes not completely right
looks into her eyes then more an accusation than a question you fucked up
a muttered no from rosario hardly a committed denial
before he can say anything from the den burt peeks his head out bobby you should hear this too for the trial
burt motions for bobby to enter the den
back to rosario we gotta straighten this out later
bobby then moves to the den
burt and joseph and jack and mike
bobby enters the room
as he does we hear nezhinskis cache was huge about keys yayo some angel dust too
were gonna try and turn him get him to tell us how theyre bringing it in
but dont worry well make sure he does plenty of time
he aint gonna be reliable pop
bobby closes the door behind him softly
joseph sees bobby is surprised hes here
well you marry an ape you dont complain about the stench of bananas

you dont gotta get involved in this anymore
i asked him to come in joe
if hes gonna have to testify he should know all this

an ugly beat
then ill be outside if you need me
bobby exits and burt watches him depart
the unaware crowd is having a great time
children run around the rooms
bobby sees guard approaches
burt comes up next to him takes him into a corner what was said in there he he didnt mean it
bobby contemplates this we see that he tacitly accepts his fathers words
then well whys he goin back to work so soon anyway
he aint ready
no its better this way
i dont want him sitting around with nothing to do feeling useless bobby is about to leave
burt stops him hey cmere
bobby returns a lotta people been talking

considering the alternatives
maybe you might wanna think about joining the department
i could pull some strings get you through the academy with an early no come on

bobby motions to his bodyguard
burt senses hes said the wrong thing
gently tries to stop him wait dont go yet to the guard take me back to the motel
with that bobby leaves with his bodyguard
burt stands there for a moment frustrated
teddy his grandson runs past him
sandra follows the boy
burt turns to see the naked youngster then to sandra cant you put some clothes on him
its a cheesy hotel on queens boulevard
two unmarked cars pull up
armed guards exit the autos first casing the area
theyre followed by bobby
bobby approaches his room
a guard well call him vitt is outside the room holding his shotgun
nods a hello
bobby moves past him opens the door
the room is empty
then bobby spins around furious a number of people are here
we are on the rosario diaz is in the center of the crowded floor dancing up a storm
she is having a great time surrounded by many would be male suitors and louis
she is laughing and stoned and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free
as she moves she pushes the men away with a smile
all of course except for louis
louis dances a can can with two amused girls
though fat hes surprisingly graceful
all of a sudden coming through the crowd bobby
when louis sees his friend he lights up
bobbys furious inside but strangely calm outside bobkes
bobby glares at rosario
he takes her arm starts to walk her out
she tries to pull bobby toward the dancing cmon honey lets dance
the copsre right outside lets go

starts to move to i was just trying to have a little fun for once thats all
lou no more of this for her

louis nods understanding
rosario leads bobby back toward the escort car

sotto but intense you gotta put everything in jeopardy
i was just dancing

bobby leans over kisses her
he tenderly puts his hand on her face
she kisses his hand
their guards are watching
she smiles and that love returns cmon
lets go back thisll all be over soon
vadim nezhinski is being led in handcuffs into an unmarked chevy
both joseph and jack are here
joseph and vadim exchange looks as vadim is placed into the back seat
joes expression is pure suppressed rage
ill go in the lead car

joseph gets in his lead car also an unmarked chevy
both vehicles pull away from the curb
we see bobbys armed guards waiting on the steps
tilt up to the closed door
over this we hear we heard all about you in the news
we were all very sorry about your brother
bobby and marat buzhayev inside the living room
bobby sits down on the couchs armrest marat is in an easy chair his lunch being served on a t
tray in front of him by his wife kalina
the television plays a russian movie and marat seasons his food
you know mr
buzhayev i come to see you today cause
with everything thats gone on i dont think its a good idea for me to stay in new york anymore
i was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if i could work with him down in miami
on his restaurant
i could talk to him
i think he would like you very much
id appreciate it
marat turns to bobby puts his hand on his knee
emotional were going to be very sad if youre going
having you here in this house meant a lot to us

bobby youll always be welcome back here
bobby is moved
the two embrace
the car is moving
jack is driving
another cop is in the front passenger seat
two other cops straddle vadim
silence then motioning toward josephs car they did good
on his face
shut your fuckin mouth
as joseph looks back at vadims vehicle behind him he makes a deal today maybe my brother dont gotta take the stand
least thats something
jack puts a cigarette in his mouth turns to the cop next to him give me that lighter
hes probably killed
the cops see this accident
the driver holy shit
stop the fuckin car
as joseph pulls out his gun readying himself to do battle immediately pins joseph and the other two police inside the vehicle
three men in ski masks emerge from the van automatic weapons in hand
jack pulls out his piece and immediately begins firing at them using the wheel and dashboard as cover
he opens his door to slink out
the other two officers are immediately riddled with two of the men pull vadim toward them
the third man in a ski mask is hit by jacks fire but has just enough adrenaline to get into the second car
burt dressed in his v neck undershirt is reaching into a jar of b g pickled tomatoes
the television plays the peoples court
the phone rings burt grabs the receiver hello
whats the matter
burt looks disturbed then jesus
listen to me you and jack get someplace safe
let esu take care of it im gonna go get your brother
burt hangs up grabs his jacket which had been draped over the kitchen chair
burt bolts out of the house
bobby and rosario in media res
bobby lights a cigarette
you know my aunts in miami
we probably could stay with her for a little bit til we get settled
why dont we give em all these bags to throw out its becoming a mess
burt barges in
other cops come through the door as well beginning a move
whats goin on
your brother was taking him to the a
and they got ambushed
they hit three of our guys
what about your brothers fine
we gotta get you moved youve been here too long
bobby looks to rosario whos in shock
burt looks to her you need to pack up
the two start packing
our characters are leaving the hotel bags and all
the rain comes down in sheets
they pause under the awning waiting for the cars to be brought close
burt stands under the awning looking out at houses beyond the parking lot
rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as bobby stands nearby
vitt approaches burt chief we got three vehicles coming around the corner
backups on the way
burt nods vitt runs off
the sound of rain
bobby is putting his bulletproof vest on sees burt staring out
you see something out there
burt shakes his head moves to help with the vest nah were good
its just i just realized i know this neighborhood
i used to come with my father to work on the plumbing for the houses brought me along to do the talking
he only spoke russian his whole life
anyway its all changed now
a guard approaches one more minute chief
joe come close this morning
i dont know
i heard he did good though
you know with everything thats happened who knows
maybe all thisll bring us closer together someday
once this is over you and your brother youll talk youll work things out
but you know the way he is
bobby your brother i think he probably feels a little guilty with everything you did with you in protection now
but he appreciates what youve done i know he does
rosario is right behind them listening
when burt stares at her she averts his gaze
burt changes course look im just trying to keep us together here thats all
thats all i want
relents a bit nods i know pop
burt warms slightly too
a beat then the cars pull up
bobby looks at his father with real feeling
burt eyes him then touches bobbys cheek a truly loving gesture almost to himself okay
to an officer well move em to corona
ill lead the line
bobby takes rosarios hand as we go to three cars burt in one heading the route
behind him is bobby and rosarios car with guard vitt behind the wheel and the two of them in the back seat
a third car has two officers in it
that vehicle trails the other two
bobby and rosario are in the back seat
she looks through her pocketbook for some gum he remains focused on the view through the windshield of his fathers car
bobbys driver vitt follows burt down the streets
rain is falling frighteningly hard to the point where the windshield wipers arent moving fast enough for the water on the windshield
the cars swing onto the kosciusko bridge loop
the traffic is sparse this early morning
we hear the thumpety thump of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers
and we hear the steady haunting hum of the bridge surface beneath the wheels of the automobiles
bobby puts his arm around rosario in the back seat
re the rain its really coming down
bobby i think i left my watch at the hotel bobby does not answer instead spots an oldsmobile driving alongside his vehicle
seems a bit suspicious the way its moving
hey vitt i think somethins on our right
a bullet punctures the windshield but we dont hear the shot
the hole seems to appear almost out of nowhere
the windshield cracks down the middle
vitt is hit in the shoulder and he lets out a piercing cry
blood hits the seat
bobby pushes her head down into the back seat
the car starts to swerve
bobby climbs awkwardly over to the front seat
takes the wheel forcefully pulling vitt to the side
to rosario get down
rosario crouches covers the back of her head with her hands
the water gets pushed away by the speedy wipers other side to side then a hubcap we dont know from which car its been dislodged
right at bobby right at us
the hubcap skids off the front windshield
bobby brushes up against the guardrail
we see that it is all that protects him from spinning off into the river two hundred feet below
bobby darts from lane to lane and the third police car behind the olds has slammed on its brakes to avoid hitting bobbys car
the olds is right next to burts car
bobby sees the barrel of the gun swing to burt
another big puddle a muffled thunderclap sound
the water slides away revealing that the back window of burts car has shattered
bobby is startled at this his mouth momentarily drooping open
he can see his father firing his weapon out the window at the olds
we hear burt through the radio a static ravaged signal they got a hit on
get support now
bobby pulls up alongside the olds
he tries to get a good look but cannot
he sees two people in the car one driving and one doing the shooting boom
and it punctures a hole in the side of bobbys rear door
rosario is jolted screams again
she shakes her head her face still buried in the vinyl
shes hysterical but physically unharmed
the traffic gets denser now
the weather is terrible blinding
rushes of water cover the glass around the car wrecking visibility
we are on the b
with many trucks big and small on it
the olds weaves in and out in front of and behind many large semis
bobby watches as burts car is right behind the olds
this is unbelievably dangerous
a truck starts changing lanes
the olds scoots past it before it does but burt does not
the truck clips burts car on the drivers side
he sneaks through recovering and keeping up the pursuit
the truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway
then it jacknifes spinning out
the police car behind bobbys slams into the truck making a macabre crunching sound
bobbys eyes as he turns around and witnesses the horrific accident through the rain soaked rear window
it is the truck crushes the police car its carriage flipping over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people inside
the olds skids ferociously pulling off the expressway toward city streets
burts car follows
burts car and the olds are neck and neck
bobby pulls up beside burt
into the radio pop lay back
but burt does not
burt has a clear shot at the hooded man in the back seat
we can see the blood spatter the perps automobile
the mans head jerks back spasmodically
we hear i got him
i got the sonofabitch
he sees through the rain a long shotgun barrel come out of the window from the rear passengers seat area
his eyes pop
the olds speeds up
the barrel of the shotgun turns water covers the windshield blinding the driver and us
the water slides off the glass
bobby watches as blood covers burts face
hes been hit
he loses control of the automobile
bobby freezes in through the rain we see a patch of parochial school children asian children on the streetcorner
bobbys car peels off away from danger
burts car is headed right for them
in what seems like his dazed last gasp he slams on the brakes
the car skids out spins
the motion is dizzying
the olds is uncontrolled
the vehicle moves through a traffic light hitting another car
it is one intense image
the car is upside down now
it slides for tens of feet before stopping
the rain falls making an oddly serene sound
we hear sirens
the police are approaching
burts car stops slowly
he gets out of the car his face a mess
he stumbles for a few feet in the rain
bobbys car arrives on the scene
burts eyes are red filling with blood
his jaw is open
he gasps for air a vacant stare on his face
his body spasms
then he collapses on his knees
in a pool of blood
the police are in the background
wide shot of the block as bobby moves to his father who is lying on the street
bobby bends down turning his father over
his fathers blood is all over his hands now
burt is dead
other cops surround them
bobby looks up at all of them they at him
broken he pushes the others away
as water drips off his face dont fuckin look at him
i said dont back up
dont look at him
bobby eyes his father spent crestfallen but not histrionic
the camera tilts down
the blood from burts body flows into the street along the curb into the gutter
bobby and rosario outside an office
armed cops are up and down the hall
we hear conversation through the walls
bobby is standing smoking a cigarette holding back tears
rosario is seated on a nearby bench wet shivering stunned
rosario looks to bobby bobby
could i call my mother
speechless bobby nods
jack emerges from the office approaches michael no i
on the guys in the car
but mike pulls m
closer we had that place locked up tight
how they knew where they were i go no idea
turns to bobby we gotta get you to a secure location bobby bobby emotional and glassy eyed interrupts does my brother know yet
beat then hes taking it very hard
they had to sedate him
these words hit bobby
his eyes close forcing tears down his cheeks
then you gotta take me to him
i wanna go see him
michael turns to an officer motions
the officer leaves
the camera dollies into a close shot of bobby and we go to
sitting on the couch is joseph
he is trying to be stoic but appears wan and tired
we hear the crowd in the house but they are in the living room
a knock bobby enters
joseph eyes him seems heartened by the sight of his brother
but he is out of it emotionally bludgeoned ill catch em bobby
bobby walks over to joseph stands close to him
searches for words
before he can speak theyre gonna need us to identify the body
then as emotional as weve yet seen him bobby strains to get the sentences out of his mouth i dont know if i can do that
i i saw him die
bobby breaks down
joseph responds by clutching him tightly
the brothers rock back and forth gently
i wanna stay close to you from now on joe
into js ear i wanna stay with you
the shot is of a small and bare room in a queens funeral home
in the center is a coffin
the camera dollies toward it
entering the room is an undertaker with bobby and joseph right behind
we know mere words cannot suffice in this time of tragedy
were so very sorry about your loss
the undertaker unhinges the coffin
inside is burt eyes closed clothed in a suit
we dont see the body what we do see are the reactions of his two sons
bobbys grief is obvious but hes already seen him dead
this is new territory for joseph who though he does not break down seems overwhelmed
both young men nod in acknowledgement and the undertaker closes the coffin
now im told youre going to be handling the arrangements for tomorrows service
could you come with me please
to bobby well be right back
as the undertaker leads joseph away bobby enters an where waiting are jack and michael
bobby gives a fiery stare to the two cops
he approaches them
sotto but intense his teeth clenched in a simmering anger you gonna fuckin catch these guys
bobby senses uncertainty you aint got nothing do you
michael looks to jack who steps forward all our uncles on the street been hearing about a big deal goin down maybe monday or tuesday
they dont know where yet but
we got a feeling now that nezhinskis out hes gonna be there
growing emotional you gotta find that spot
you and your brother dont gotta worry about any of that
just take the time you need the men all turn around
joseph stands there wounded but ill be ready to come back and head it up
ill be ready and and well get em
after the funeral
joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin
bobby watches him from behind as his hand runs along the top of the casket
we hear a limousine pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of tombstones
emerging are bobby and joseph
they are both wearing dark sunglasses
rosario and sandra and the children get out behind them and are led away by funeral coordinators to another place in the coming processional
in the distance many many people and a long line of cars move toward the two brothers
the undertaker walks away briefly to direct some traffic
bobby slowly puts his arm around josephs waist prompting bobby
im real glad youre with me now
joseph grows more emotional adjusts his sunglasses
leans to bobby clears his throat
sotto you know i was
i was jealous of you for a long time
bobby is surprised to hear this admission and is taken aback by the honesty of it especially in this moment
joseph grabs his brothers arm his voice cracking
i always did what pop wanted
and you were free
bobby tears up his voice breaking too he shakes his head no
i did it to hurt him
i disappointed him
interrupting the moment the undertaker approaches gentlemen
the undertaker guides the two men toward the procession
just as the drums reach a thunderous volume we go to a line of cars files into the cemetery led by the hearse
the procession is phenomenally long
the new york skyline is in the distance
uniformed police line the narrow road
the coffin is removed from the hearse put on wheels for the move to the gravesite
bobby joseph approach
the drums continue people get out of their cars
many of them we recognize from elsewhere in the film but dont know by name
one of the people to emerge from a town car is marat buzhayev and his ever present babushka wife kalina
the walk begins with everyone saluting bobby and joseph
behind them the mayor the commissioner all the rank and file of the force
the turnout is enormous
rosario is here too though several rows back
she is with the women
bobby peers at the procession which is made up of hundreds of saluting cops others
among them we spot at that moment bobby sees his old friend and the two make eye contact
bobby is greatly moved by his appearance and nods subtly to jumbo
louis salutes gently a slight and sympathetic smile coming across his face
simultaneous joseph takes a look at the coffin grows more distraught
he breaks down
bobby is there to catch him and does
several white gloved cops move to help and then trying to recompose himself he squeezes his brothers forearm for support
tries to straighten its all right
ill be all right
bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is momentarily rendered speechless
he tightens his own grasp around joseph leads him on the walk behind the coffin
eyeing the cops the cop wives
she does not fit in
cops are staring at her
she sees cop wives looking at her leaning over to each other and talking about her
though she cant hear what theyre saying she is made to feel terribly uneasy
rosario quickens her pace away from them and the march the line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the coffin which is in the ground
bobby and joseph silently lead the line shoveling dirt and moving on
rosario moves behind them
bobby sees beyond the cemetary grounds teenagers have climbed the trees
and theyre laughing at the spectacle
michael stands next to bobby
a beat then bobby speaks in a way thats preoccupied
almost as if the words are more for himself than for mike i cant live like this no more mike
they destroyed my family
theres a deal going down i
i wanna help
youre a civilian bobby
aint no way
bobby leans closer more focused i i could join you
michael turns to him surprised
my pop tol me you pull guys outta the academy guys with special knowledge and make em cops
you could do that
bobby come on you got your own life to live no
i cant do nothing else now
a beat as mike ponders
then then you gotta understand this aint something you do just for a vendetta
you gotta go back to the academy when youre done you gotta commit yourself
bobby looks at his brother then back to mike
gimme a couple days ill talk to the p
bobby again eyes joseph who stands over the grave wiping his eyes with a handkerchief
he walks over to him puts his arm around him
into his ear joe im gonna join you
i just decided
joseph looks at him for a moment nods subtly
then he looks back into the grave
this is where i belong
angle back on bobby as he spots rosario who stares right back at him
hes going to have to tell her his decision
a line of policemen in white gloves begins to fire rifles into the air
a fairly run down place on the way to kennedy airport
bobby is still in his funeral suit standing near the sofa
smoking a cigarette holding a drink in his hand
an armed guard accompanies rosario into the hotel room theyve arrived home from the funeral separately
she turns her back to him puts her handbag down on a dresser
bobby eyes the guard who promptly leaves the room
he places his drink on the coffee table
i wanna talk to you about something
he starts to take off his tie
im thinking of
maybe joining the force
no response from rosario yet
surprised and not surprised
i mean i help find nezhinski we dont gotta live like this the rest of our lives moving every three fuckin days
she looks at him for a moment then stares at the floor
shakes her head
she gets emotional bobby i dont know if i can be here no more
whatre you talking about
i just got through telling you no i think maybe its time i leave then go down to miami on my own with my mother
struggling to stay i cant let you do that
that aint safe for you
you know thats not true bobby
theyre not after me
hold on a second i know what im talking aboutd be a change
itd be a big change for us
she is still shaking her head still staring at the floor bobby gets up walks over to the desk
rubs his fingers on its surface not looking at her but resolutely but we could make a life here
thisd be something we could build on
we could raise a family and
this seems to focus rosario who stares at him
he moves closer to her pretty soon youd fit in
no i wouldnt
they know what i was what i was theyll accept you if were bobby
she halts him opens up
tearful i gave it all up for you and you changed everything
gave it up
gave up what
what fuckin life did you have
youre a fuckin cokehead look at you
beat deeply hurt and you were clean bobby
we were well maybe i was a piece of shit too

she is momentarily speechless
how could you say that
we had wake up
all that was nothing
now is nothing
look at whats happened to your family bobby your father hes dead look at your brother
it could all happen to you
my brothers gonna be all right and nothings gonna happen to me
thats what you said before
a moment then she turns to walk toward the bedroom
hey where you goin bobby grabs her
get off me
let me go
he holds her by the wrists what the fuck you doin
get off me
as he tries to restrain her a torrent of emotion explodes from rosario get off me i dont want it
its not what i want
she breaks free
panting tears streaming down her cheeks
after a beat bobby seeks to calm her
why dont you just calm down and think about it a little
she looks at him frozen
you think about it youll feel different
and in time well look back on all this and youll see i was right
look i love you
why dont you go get some rest
without a word she turns and walks back into the bedroom
closes the door
bobby sinks to the couch picks up his drink
after a beat we hear a we appreciate your patience bobby
as he looks into the camera
we cant yet tell where we are
he continues backing up from us slowly leading us somewhere not yet in focus the commissioner is here now and hes ready to go
we pan around to reveal bobby green as he steps forward in formal police uniform
his hair is cut closely cropped now
he is clean shaven
a real physical transformation
a lavish room
filled with photographs of important people shaking hands receiving awards etc
commissioner william ruddy a middle aged balding and yes ruddy faced man is here
were all very sorry about your father he was a great man
thank you sir
im gonna try and do my part too now
raise your right hand
ruddy leads him to the corner of the office
bobby is guided into position as the commissioner picks up a small leather bound black book
with one hand he holds the bible upon which bobby places his hand
with the other he holds a manual off which he reads an oath i hereby pledge and declare
bobby repeats after him
this process continues until the entire pledge is completed
i robert green hereby pledge and of bobby in the police armory
he is receiving his gun and his badge
over this we still hear that i will support and defend the constitution both of the united states government and the state of new york to the best of my
he walks down the hall with his back to us
i will faithfully discharge my duties in the rank of rider in the new york city police department
so help me god
ruddy and giavannis shake bobbys hand vigorously
close shot on bobby pausing right before he enters the muster room
he takes a breath and enters many cops mug shots and files strewn all over
a discussion in media res
many cops approach bobby all of whom shake his hand ad libbing whispered hey bobby and welcome to the force
bobby thanks them then moves to stand behind his brother
michael testily grills jack on the investigative progress but we got our guys out there working the street all over
i mean they coupeing or they working
everybodys out there bustin balls left and right
what else you want us to do
as michael says the following dialog a uniformed officer comes up to bobby
sotto in his ear he speaks to him bobby a rosario diazs been callin for you
she says she needs to talk to you
ill call her back
well you tell narcotics queens we got an a sale hanging over our head and either they help us or we fuckin take it out on em later
the uniformed officer leaves and bobby stays put to hear this exchange
what about nezhinskis uncle
that clubowner marat buzhayev
we tailed him for weeks
goes out with his grandkids takes em horseriding at floyd bennett field
checks on his fur business from time to time we even looked at some of the coats and tore em apart
turned out to be fake sable if you could believe it
its comin up quick we dont know anything
were gonna lose it
joe this is still new territory for all of us
i mean we hadda use your brother here to get any results to begin with
michael points to bobby who up until now had been focused on and concerned by his brothers behavior
i know that
and my family takes the hit my family
an awkward silence
bobby stiffens could you guys go outside for a minute
i wanna talk to my brother
michael hesitates then nods
everyone wheels around and exits the room
jack follows mike out the door
bobby turns to his brother youre trying to do everything its gonna kill you
shrugs ruefully we dont got much time
we lose nezhinski were both dead
the streetsll get flooded the whole citys gonna be on fire we could handle it
i mean i come on to help you
well i didnt ask you to do that
i dont need your help i could deal with it on my own
but you dont gotta do everything yourself
thats what im trying to tell you
bobby eyes joseph who looks deeply troubled
joe whats wrong
come on you can tell me
a deal this big somethings gonna come up
youll see someonell fold
joseph ponders for a beat then comes out with it its not that
you give up what you wanted to do to be here bobby
and part of me feels a little responsible
nah you didnt do nothing
its meant to be
you cant fuckin control it
slight laugh you know i remember when pop was mad at you he always used to say you didnt believe in our family
and mom shed protect you
shed give you those little caramels
anyway i knew he was wrong too but i didnt say nothing
just then the uniformed officer knocks and re enters bobby rosario diaz just called again
tell her im on my way back now
to joseph dont worry
thats all in the past
kisses him ill see you later
an unmarked car with bobby inside pulls up to the front
a guard steps forward to greet protects him
there are several guards in the space
bobby scans the room and quickly notices everything of rosarios is gone
bobby wheels around to a guard
what happened whered she go
she left about an hour ago
she said to give you this the guard hands bobby a note
bobby sees it grabs it we gotta go find her
she asked us not to bobby
shes bobby we cant do that legally
bobby tries to charge past them
the guards all restrain him delicately cmon calm down but bobby is in no mood and instead starts a melee
he is a tour de force of energy and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue him
the fight is more a wrestling match than anything else and it is messy tough bobbys forehead is cut the struggle is ugly
the guards rouse up enough strength to push him into the hotel room for good
the door slams
a silent beat
bobby paces in a rage
then sarcastic go head
keep me in here keep me
bobby we dont wanna have to put you in restraints so just calm down
calm the fuck down
bobby stares at the door
you gonna keep me here
still in a fury he takes a lamp and hits the door repeatedly
then he hurls the lamp toward a mirror on the wall and it shatters
exhausted he stops
moves to where he sits on the edge of the bed touches his neck
blood on his hand
he still grips the unread note
he throws it to the ground and then perhaps motivated by the realization of his situation a flood of feeling comes over him
tears begin to fall down his face and he succumbs
it is as though all of the emotions in our story find their outlet here in this moment
bobby lets all the remaining feeling drain from him until he has nothing left
after this outburst he is exhausted
he calms breathing heavily
a beat he puts his bloodied hand to his head
we prelap the sound of a phone ringing a noisy queens place its blue collar patrons watching boxing on the television and cheering
pan over to one of those old in the wall phone booths with a sliding door
bobby is on the phone seated in the dark space
holds a glass half full of liquor
distraught he listens for an answer as the phone rings once more
bobby collects himself
then its me lou
how you doin

shes holed up with you aint she

angle on bobby as we go to a show is about to go on
the place has a darker quality to it now and many patrons are wearing halloween masks
bobby enters approaches a table in the back where seated are louis and louis girlfriend hazel
lou is armed with a huge grin and he stands and hugs bobby my brother

as they sit lou notices bobby is alone

jumbo i dont want nothing right now dont worry about it
just then the house lights dim
a spotlight on the stage
marat buzhayev ambles up to the microphone with some difficulty
my name is marat buzhayev and im the owner of the el caribe
we have a special night tonight the odessa dance troop is here to perform for us
i know youll enjoy it
marat holds up his hands to quiet the clapping we also have an old friend whos come back to us i want him to stand bobby
ladies and gentlemen bobby green who used to be our manager here
the spotlight swings to bobby who stands briefly sheepishly
marat waves to him bobby nods sits
the spotlight swings back to marat who finishes up his introduction enjoy the show
and exits to still more applause
eli mirichenko marats son in law approaches bobby
in his my father in law would love it if you come upstairs later to say hello
tell him ill come up
eli nods exits
then sensing bobbys mood bob you all right
hesitates then rosario rosarios gone down to florida for a little while
well she probably just needed a little time for herself
shell be back

louis turns to watch the show for a beat takes a huge swig of his drink
then turns around again close to bobby i mean between you and me that place they had you in was drivin her crazy
the kew motor inn we used to call that the screw motor inn with all the hookers
back to hazel get that waitress wouldja
louis turns back to the show
the camera moves into a close shot on bobby as louis words freeze him
he seems ready to explode
lou turns to him howd you know where i was staying
howd you know where i was staying
it was it was in the papers
bobby gets up with astonishing speed and moves right next to louis
he grabs his arm tightly and in his ear it wasnt in no papers louis
dont make me embarrass you
lets go outside right now
the camera moves into a close shot on louis as he frets
still grabbing louiss arm bobby wrenches him loose
louis stumbles and falls to the asphalt
bobby steps forward
something is different about him now
he is colder than ice his eyes black saucers of rage
i dont know dont play games with me louis
but i dont kn i just said do not play games with rosario tol you where we were staying didnt she

louis begins to crack
tears come to his eyes
bob were were buddies were like brothers

bobby i swear i dont know nothing
you know my father is dead because of you
louis begins to sob quietly shivering
he brings his hand to his mouth
bobby takes a threatening step forward you know im on the force now
and i could do anything to you
louis eyes widen
he holds out his hands defensively
beat weakening dont do this to me
even softer dont do this to me bob please
you tell me what you know right now or i swear to christ i will make you disappear
louis is crying loudly like a ten year old
he falls to his knees
shivering in fear he moves to bobbys feet bobby i
i told em where you were but but it aint what you think
i was makin a buy and these guys in hoods they held a gun to my head so i tried to give em the wrong information
bobby clenches his fist
louis grabs onto him again
no wait listen
rosario tol me you moved every couple days she said you was gonna move i thought youd be gone by then
its the truth bobby
i would never try and hurt you
never swear to god
bobby stares at him for a moment then his teeth grit
he tries to calm himself but cannot
with a ferocity he unleashes a brutal punch across louis face with the brunt of his fist
in louis ear you tell me right now wheres your fuckin spot
the camera dollies past a shooting gallery
addicts their inert bodies both crumpled and standing in virtual trances wander an alleyway
they recoil from car headlights an american sedan a dark blue car pulls up to the building
a man gets out we cant quite tell who it is yet
a young african american male stands in a doorway dressed in a green parka
the hall covered with trash and graffiti is illuminated by a solitary light bulb
he guards another shooting gallery which is in the room right behind him
the african american male is on guard
the man emerges from the darkness his back still to us
upon seeing him the african american man smiles reaches into his pocket
hands the unseen man a small yellow envelope i got your money man but my shits running low
when you get me more
as he counts the just hold on a little while longer we get more for you soon
whens that gonna be
we cut to the over the shoulder of the man and leaning out of the darkness and into the light eli mirichenko marats son in law
he continues after tomorrow everybodys gonna get well
the african american man nods
satisfied with the cash eli turns around walks back down the hallway
angle back on african american man as the camera zooms past him into in the darkness among the addicts bobby green
his face illuminated only by the sliver of light from the crack in the door
hes witnessed the whole thing
we hear we got your boy eli completely covered bobby
the group is all together
cops we dont know pack the room standing around the table
seated at the table michael jack bobby and at the head joseph
a tough looking cop weve seen before but not met he just turned in for the night
cant move an inch without us up his ass
well he said tomorrow and thats what matters
and well be right there with him you can be sure of that
theyre movin serious weight we might be talkin major league firepower

bobby turns to joseph pop would never bring em in joe
we gotta see this through ourselves
josephs back stiffens
with resolve yeah definitely
well get the tac plan together
and wherever it is well be ready for em
thats it for now
the troops get up to leave
jack approaches joseph
bobby looks at jack who leans in to josephs ear you know theyre laughin at us out there on the street
now when we get there itll be up to you what we do
but i hope you think about droppin the hammer on em
joseph contemplates this briefly then jack pulls him
i mean after your father and everything
these peoplere like fuckin lice
just think about what im saying to you
bobby senses the pressure being placed upon his brother and he moves jack away from joseph all right cmon
angle on bobby joseph as we go to series of shots of
wide shot of a marsh area with tall wheatlike weed growth that is extremely dense
medium shot of a structure in the middle of this
an old small abandoned stone building built as a wpa project in the s
it is a mens ladies bathroom probably a robert moses project but long since abandoned
wide shot of the structure
the camera booms down from high above the stone building and pans to reveal the tall
medium shot of elis dark blue automobile arriving
eli emerges from the car
a bodyguard behind him armed with an ak
he prepares to greet out steps a host of men in suits grasping suitcases presumably filled with money
then another town car
and yet another
the men all congregate like its a legal business transaction
we pan around moving through the weeds now
and we see bobby and joseph as they arrive move into position
the camera moves laterally and we see michael and jack and other cops doing much the same
all carrying shotguns
one cop points a shotgun microphone at the activity and our guys can hear perp conversations in their earpieces
another car arrives
appearing out of it is vadim nezhinski
joseph bristles at the sight of him
bobby grabs his brothers arm squeezes were gonna get all of em today
just at that moment a white van pulls up two men get out
they open the back filled with furs
they take a number of coats out of the back of the van bring them to the shack
all the cops appear confused
what the hell is this
another town car
a crowd of people stand around the auto
helping someone out of the vehicle
whoever this is hes the emperor
emerging marat buzhayev
stepping up behind him eli helping king marat
marat and vadim greet each other
they kiss warmly
angle on bobby
we see the devastation
almost to himself lookit the two of them
theyre so fuckin close
then the cops spot two young grandchildren sitting in the back of the car
they do not get out
they seem clueless
standing guard over all of this is a lookout who is armed with an ak
several other armed men take positions closer to the structure as the furs are brought in
businessmen make some banter then enter the shack led by nezhinski
marat buzhayev and eli follow him in
many other men pour into the structure briefcases in hand
okay when they complete the sale thats when we move
esull grab the kids
a transaction begins inside the shack and the cops are watching
they see the action through broken windows
nezhinski and marat with the businessmen
he looks behind him to marat who steps forward
in russian thiss what weve been planning for for so long
my nephew has stayed just to see this through
when this is done well control almost the whole market
motions to man each load is completely untraceable
its my own method
the man places a fur on a distressed countertop
rips it apart
nezhinski steps forward the rest of the product is in the van total weight kilos
places one of the lengths of fur into a basin filled with fluid
the camera zooms into a close shot on the fur in that basin
the fur is poked a couple of times
then white plumes rise from the coats fabric to the top of the liquid and eli begins to skim the substance off the surface
dumping out some of the substance now in crystalline form onto a pad marat buzhayev hands it to a businessman who tastes it
the businessman nods pleased with his product
he reaches for a suitcase
it is opened
filled with money
bobby and joseph
joseph has his earpiece hears
then the deals closing lets go
bobby gets up out of the weeds shotgun aimed youre surrounded by the police
come out now with your hands on your heads
vadim and marat snap to attention
russian words are exchanged and everyone starts to panic
the cops begin the assault exploding from everywhere
sirens the whole thing
bobby and joseph get up stand into a crouch and move slowly toward the structure
a group of esu cops charge marats car going for the children who watch this with fear and incomprehension
an armed guard standing outside the shack begins to fire at the cops
everyone opens fire
all of a sudden a cop that tough looking cop we saw at josephs house but a few moments earlier is hit by the armed guards fire
hit in the face he falls down near joseph and bobby
dead his visage a bloodied pulp
close shot on joseph
we momentarily flash cut back to his own shooting
he cannot bear reliving the terror of his moment
as the cops move in bobby spins around to look for his brother
he finds him still on the ground
joseph seems unable to move holding onto his shotgun for dear life joe
joseph looks at his brother shakes his head
completely shattered in the moment
shots ring out
bobby pushes his brother down on the ground
in his ear arright just stay down
all of the men inside the small building have aimed their guns into the weeds
but instead of stopping because of the shooting bobby progresses inexorably toward the structure his shotgun poised to fire
now michael and jack and other members of the narcotics teams come out of the weeds
they fire their weapons
marats grandchildren are dragged out of the car crying a line of uniformed police officers forms
they move in unison
seems like a hundred men
bobby and jack and some of his men are coming from one side the line from another
a gun battle
the lookout with the ak is hit fatally
bobby sees several people fleeing out a back entrance toward another section of the weeds
joseph remains in the grass his head down his hands on his head
we cannot see his face
vadim nezhinski is frazzled by the approaching force he sees through the window
moving with tremendous speed he begins to light the furs on fire
vadim begins to cough taking a suitcase of money with him
he backs out of the structure
bilious clouds of smoke
bobby is moving toward the really starts to burn
it is an odd flame blue and bobby runs off into the weeds following vadim
eli charges toward his car
jack is right behind him stop
jack ruthlessly pumps eli full of bullets and the man falls down dead
jack approaches mercilessly fires another shot into the corpse
the wind howls
tall tawny colored weeds marsh
bobby moves through the dense weed growth
pushing his way through the brown plants
we hear police dogs
bobby starts thrashing
the camera is hand held moving to and fro with ferocious and vertiginous speed
angle on bobby as we it is bobby seeing through the wet glass burt as he is shot
during the chase in the rain
we go back to bobby raises his shotgun as he races through the phragmites grass
the weeds part
it is tricky
bobby sees other men running through the weeds but he cant tell whos who
backing up toward him each man has his back to the other
shadow on the ground
he turns slowly
raises his weapon about to fire when he realizes its michael solo who in profile to bobby is unaware hes almost been killed
he stops when he feels the barrel of bobbys shotgun against his ribs
slowly turning around he sees bobby
whispered thiss too dangerous
well all wind up killing each other vadim is in here with us
radio our guys tell em to get into the clearing
all of a sudden we hear shouted bobby
we got the old man
bobby looks at michael points to his earpiece
michael nods and as we hear mikes words into his radio our guys outta the brush
bobby starts to back up toward the clearing
bobby is greeted by the boys
other police including michael solo emerge from the weeds quietly
jack we got the old man buzhayev
up by the cars
his grandkids are safe theyre in the van
bobby acknowledges this turns to another officer are all our guys out
the officer looks counts
bobby looks toward the weeds and says burn it
all the officers back up all of them except bobby
who stands shotgun in hand waiting for vadim nezhinski to emerge from the now burning brush
two other men come out of the fire coughing
they are carrying their guns and thus killed by police gunfire
whatre you doin im not gonna let him get away
as the other police panic around him bobby enters the bobby walks through the flame
it is otherworldly
the orange blue the smoke it all seems to blow from left to right
chaos of heat smoke
we hear only the rushing wind
bobby seems inconceivably driven
methodically stepping forward past the fires peering through smoke
then he spots an area in which the smoke flows unnaturally against the breeze as though it surges around something
within what seems like a split second bobby raises his shotgun and fires it
vadim crumples to the ground
a direct hit to the chest
bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches
the weeds separate revealing nezhinski with a look on his face that registers a kind of shock a shock that hes been hit
nezhinski sees bobby standing over him
with all the energy he has in the world dont
dont let me die in here
bobby stands over him for a beat
then bobby turns his back on vadim walks through the fires around him
as vadim calls after him bobby
please dont leave me here
the flames begin to engulf the area where nezhinski lies
the police are assembled around marat buzhayev
bobby watches him for a moment his face filled with bobby i i didnt know it would be your family bobby takes a threatening step forward
bobbys expression seems unmatched in its ferocity marat sees in bobbys eyes a horrible determination begins to cry
bobbys emotions are a cauldron get down
on the ground
marat gets on his knees
bobby puts marats hands on his head starts patting him down
bobby puts the shotgun at marats temple
we hear the dogs the fire the wind the sirens
the police see the unforgiving expression on bobbys face and the reality of the old man in front of them
bobby turns to the others particularly jack
he looks at him dark eyed
then he turns away and starts walking making eye contact with none of them
he utters a command to all of them and none of them in particular put him in the fuckin van
dont touch him
bobby walks past the small building which continues to burn silently with that eerie blue flame
other cops watch him with awe and respect
they back away from him
he proceeds on toward the cars
he sees joseph inside one of them still
staring at him
we dolly with him as he moves to his brother
crouches down stays by joseph
hundreds of police officers all dressed up to the nines are here
white gloves and all
milling about in a white plaster walled room
then bobby emerges through the doors in his dress blues
upon seeing him the others smile cheer
people touch him shake his hand
eye him with respect
ad lib greetings
lookit you six months in the academy and already you look like a chief
bobby moves toward the auditorium doors
now michael approaches
in bobbys ear i just saw the commissioner
a lotta peoplere gonna wanna talk to you important people
about maybe settin you up with your own unit
well talk about that after
bobby sees joseph standing nearby with his hand on his childs shoulder the rest of his family surrounding him
the brothers embrace
then theyre getting started we should probably go in now
the ceremony is getting underway
as bobby and joseph move past the seated crowd toward their chairs in front you know i think pop would be real happy to see you like this
slight ironic laugh i dont think hed believe it
but i guess things dont always go the way you think they will
ah the forcell treat you good
im sure you do very well
you definitely gonna leave
aint no way you change your mind
shakes head then its the right thing
its over for me im out
listen well spend some more time together from now on
ill come over next week
bobby approaches the police chaplain hands him a note
id like you to introduce me this way
if you dont mind
the chaplain looks at the paper nods
he then walks to the podium
bobby sits as the chaplain begins ladies and gentlemen we shall begin todays ceremony with the traditional invocation moving then to the valedictorian address to be given by
son of the late deputy chief albert grusinsky brother of captain joseph grusinsky
angle on bobby as his real name is spoken you know as i look at this fine young man seated here i cant help but think about all the young
members of our department
i get filled with such pride
men like him are the great future of our force
as the man speaks bobby scans the room
he sees rosario standing in the crowd behind the seated audience
her face is partially obscured
bobby cannot believe the flood of emotion that overwhelms him the happiness he feels upon catching a glimpse of her
but just as quickly as this thrill grabs him it disappears when she becomes completely visible for he realizes that it is not her but rather a young woman who
bears merely a faint resemblance
joseph interrupts this leans over i love you bobby
back to reality love you too joe
police line up on the stage
everyones seated bobby and joseph in front
the police band begins to play the drums
bobby straightens up raises his hand along with the sea of blue in a salute as the flag is carried to the front
