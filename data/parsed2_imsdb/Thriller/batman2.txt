batman returns unproduced draft by sam hamm screenplay by sam hamm its finally happened
hells frozen over
christmas is two weeks off arid snow is falling in gotham
beneath its pristine white blanket the city looks uncharacteristically serene almost inviting peace has been miraculously restored strangers wave hello
salvation army santas ring their bells on streetcorners
and now as night falls an illuminated sign winks on above broad avenue joyeux noel gotham only shopping days left till christmas
the streets are bustling with jolly shoppers
at a souvenir store we find an exasperated mom squabbling with her seven year old
like many other storefronts in gotham this one is overflowing with bootleg batman merchandise t shirts key chains ceramic figurines
the kid is already wearing a batman baseball cap and a little black cape but he obviously wants more
mom drags him off past another store window this one full of scrap metal with a sign reading authentic fragments of the batwing
a panhandler is perched at the entrance
beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt with the familiar yellow and black logo
in gotham this winter batmania is everywhere
two hours later the snowstorms grown into a full fledged blizzard
the drifts are two feet deep and the streets are all but empty of cars
a massive snow plow the size of a panzer tank rumbles past filling the frame
and revealing as it passes a group of carolers all bundled up in mufflers and parkas
unbothered by the weather they walk the street singing spreading cheer and goodwill to the few passersby
theyve just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of silent night when an oversized delivery truck outfitted with snow chains clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow
its sides are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice cream snack polar bars oddly inappropriate for this time of year
a streetcorner santa with bell and bucket waves at the truck as it rounds a corner
the carolers carol
then a violent explosion rocks the street followed by the sound of automatic gunfire and a high wailing security alarm
around the corner theres carnage on the streets
the windows have blown out of gothams leading jewelry store
gut shot security guards stagger and go face down in the snow as robbers dressed in white camouflage gear clamber out through the shattered glass with sackfuls of loot
carolers spill around the corner to see whats going on but a spray of gunfire sends them scattering in panic
the polar bar truck pulls even with the jewelry store and as it does
the rear doors open
a ramp slides down from the back of the truck
the robbers scramble aboard and mere seconds later slide out again riding atop five skidoo snowmobiles
a police car appears taking the corner just a trifle too fast fishtailing on the icy street and plowing into a drift
the cops gun the engine but their wheels are spinning in the snow no traction
theyre about to climb out and give chase on foot when through the windshield they see the salvation army santa
hoisting an ak and firing directly at them
the windshield disintegrates and the cops sink from view as santa races off to the last of the snowmobiles which is already burdened with loot
more squad cars converge on the jewelry store but its difficult to carry on a high speed pursuit when the snows a foot deep and the best you can do
the cop cars skid to a halt blocked by the rumbling snowplow
by now of course the looters are gone scooting off on either side of the plow sticking to the snowy sidewalks
snowmobiles glide across the sidewalks sending the few hardy souls who are out on the streets diving for cover
a couple of derelicts are cowering behind a fire hydrant trying to avoid getting run over
every time they poke their heads out another skidoo whizzes past missing them by inches
the robbers fan out in various directions
these guys are obviously going to get away clean unless the derelict points up at the night sky where a beacon is blazing in the darkness the black silhouette of
a cop takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders gotham park one of the few streets which is relatively clear
the cop at the wheel goes wide eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief
before their eyes five snowmobiles appear from the cross streets up ahead and converge at the entrance to gotham park
bringing up the rear is santa claus
what the hell
several squad cars are now massed at the entrance to the park but theres one problem
the citys snow plows dont operate on the park roads and the entrance is blocked off with sawhorses reading closed to traffic
a huge steep drift prevents them from entering and so all they can do is stand by helplessly watching as the snowmobiles vanish into the trees
the cops race about like headless chickens trying to concoct a plan
a couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls of the park
another is at his car barking into a radio mike yeah you heard me
pause so what do we do
chase em on foot
all eyes turn at the blare of a horn
the cops peer down the long corridor of the cross street and see a strange black vehicle barreling toward them at mph with no intention of stopping
cops dive left and right
a split second later
a forty foot jet of nova intensity flame erupts from the front of the jet black supercar instantaneously dissolving the drift that blocks the entrance to the park turning the
ice and snow on the paths before it into water
the batmobile screams past in the wink of an eye
the cops get to their feet cold as it is theyre sweating one of them mops his brow and announces dumfounded that was batman cop ii yanks cop i into
the nearest squad car and the others follow suit
as long as the batmobiles cleared a path they might as well join in the chase
two burly teenagers both dressed in red berets and parkas with black batman sweatshirts visible underneath are trudging along the path when theyre startled by a pair of speeding skidoos
moments later they spot a red glow on the horizon
and their jaws drop as the batmobile roars into view burning off the snow in its path
thrilled beyond words they whoop with glee slapping high fives as the car streaks past
his face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting from the front of the car
cool as ever approaching the chase as a simple problem in logic he checks a radar display on his dashboard and sees five blips
the cops follow along in batmans path
the lead car loses control and plows headlong into a drift
the driver jams the pedal but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the ice
he sits there cursing pumping the accelerator as other cops race past him on foot
the various robbers have spread out their vehicles bounding over the hilly terrain of the park
he spots two of them up ahead as he draws closer they part ways veering off to the left and right
pods open on the front fenders and missile launchers rotate into place
the batmobile fires a pair of heat seeking torpedos which burrow into the snow on either side and disappear
the driver looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears to be a black shark fin plowing through the snow behind him gaining fast
he takes evasive action but the shark fin always seems to follow
just as he approaches the crest of a hill
the torpedo slams into the rear of the snowmobile
the force of impact knocks the robber cleanly off
his loot lands in the snow beside him but the snowmobile keeps going sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks beyond with a deafening explosion
this robbers a little smarter than his buddy
when he sees the shark fin on his tail he noses his snowmobile off into a grove of trees
the trees are too closely spaced for the torpedo to maneuver it strikes the nearest tree trunk and explodes harmlessly
the robber is feeling good about himself because the batmobile cant follow either
but batman has a plan b
as he drives alongside the grove he hits the accelerator passing the snowmobile on its left
a steel spike attached to a cable launches from the side of the batmobile and wedges itself into a distant tree
the cable goes taut and the tree topples directly into the path of the second snowmobile
the vehicle crashes into the trunk and the hapless robber goes cartwheeling head over heels into a drift
in the distance cops appear racing to the scene on foot ready for mop up duty
batman kills the flamethrower hits the brakes and fishtails doing a quick on the snow
hes just spotted fresh quarry snowmobiles three and four whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance
were at a makeshift campsite where a cluster of homeless people are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm
they look on in puzzlement as the two snowmobiles whiz past and disappear over a crest of a hill
they bounce down the hillside and skid arriving at the edge of a frozen over lake
with the roar of the batmobile behind them the two drivers get the same idea simultaneously
smiling they rev their engines and set out over the surface of the lake
now the batmobile crests the ridge
the cars weight tips suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake
batman sees whats happening and kills the flamethrower just in time but he cant brake the car on the snowy slope
the prow of the batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake and under its weight the ice begins to crack
the left front tire takes a sudden dip and worse yet the car is sliding forward
he shifts frantically from drive to reverse trying to rock the car out of its predicament but his rear wheels find no purchase
he can hear the ice cracking beneath him
grimacing he throws a switch on the dashboard and the trunk pops open
an industrial strength grappling hook shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of the hill and a concealed winch assembly begins to grind away hauling the
batmobile uphill out of danger
suspended just above the icy lake he sees the snowmobile vanishing into the distance
he opens yet another panel on the dashboard
the robbers give each other a big thumbs up
theyre almost halfway across the lake now and the batmobile is disabled
all at once they hear a strange whistling overhead
no its a thermite bomb rocketing past them hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and exploding gaudily
jagged chunks of ice break free and shift in the frigid water and the robbers are skidding into the drink before they know whats hit them
the last of the robbers is santa claus his big sack filled not with toys but precious stones
he approaches the edge of the park negotiating his way through a maze of rocky outcroppings
he squirts out from behind a boulder into a clearing
and gasps in panic as a searing burst of flame erupts behind him
the batmobile speeds out from the other side of the boulder santa twists his accelerator desperately trying to build up speed
as it is hes barely managing to stay ahead of the flamethrower
but the jet of flame suddenly dies the hood of the batmobile rises half a foot and twin projectiles launch into the air
a heavy net is strung between them and it lands smack on top of santa claus entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his tracks
immobilized he watches through the net in horror as the batmobile barrels down
when the great black machine is almost atop him it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily padded frame
the cops are spread out near the entrance
theyve rounded up the other robbers and returned most of the loot
they hear a dull roar in the distance
and a few seconds later the batmobile streaks into view dragging the net behind it santa his loot and his snowmobile all tied up in one tidy parcel
at the entrance to the park the net detaches itself from the batmobile dumping santa into the hands of the waiting cops
without stopping the batmobile roars out of the park and vanishes whence it came
a mildly humiliated cop turns to his colleague and shrugs merry christmas
the second cop points to santa still struggling in the net
gift wrapped and everything
tv minicam crews are camped out on the steps of city hall with a sizable crowd watching from the street
commissioner gordon is reading from a prepared statement
after a high speed chase over in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force working in concert with batman
at the sound of batmans name a chanting goes up in the crowd gordon winces and lets out a sigh
the chanters are a group of pugnacious well muscled kids late teens and early twenties all dressed in identical garb black batman sweatshirts and little red guardian angel berets
theyre obviously members of the same club just like the guys we saw in the park
gordon waits for them to shut up but they dont so he grabs the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly trying to be heard over the din
i would like to stress that while this city enjoys a special relationship with batman louder we do not condone vigilantism practically screaming its no use
hes totally drowned out by the red berets who continue to shout and shake their fists
giving up he returns the mike to a reporter and marches up the steps in a huff
the red berets cheer
the evening news a live on the spot interview from gotham square
a superimposed graphic identifies a surly kid in a red beret as mike sekowsky spokesperson order of the and hey
where does this bleep expletive deleted gordon get off calling us were not breakin any laws
were a group of concerned citizens thats all just like batman you people are nothing but hoodlums
hey lady were out here on patrol riskin our necks to protect old biddies like you
into mike if this lame o gordon could do his job more catcalls from the crowd
the picture jumps suddenly as a minicam is jostled some sort of scuffle appears to be breaking out
before it does camera pulls back from the tv screen placing us in where alfred the butler is watching the sekowsky interview with extreme dismay
as he trims the crusts from a pair of hearty watercress sandwiches he slices his finger open
alfred makes a pained face its all sekowskys fault
onscreen the fracas continues sekowsky has recommandeered the mike
sekowsky on tv were provin that the spirit of batman is alive in this city
were gonna take back the streets sekowsky raises a fist
behind him his cronies begin to chant take back the streets
take back the streets
incensed sucking on his finger alfred moves to the tv and flicks it off
he turns on the radio in search of something more soothing
good king wenceslas pipes through the manor smiling alfred sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a sterling silver tea service
the carol continues underneath as alfred white linen draped over one forearm sets the tea tray down on his masters big mahogany desk
he digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a side drawer
the drawer contains a stack of yellowed aging newpaper clippings among them one which reads thomas wayne murdered prominent doctor wife slain in robbery
unidentified gunman leaves child unharmed
alfred digs around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed switch at the rear of the drawer
gears grind and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the wall sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a stone stairway which descends into darkness
descending the stone stairs alfred arrives in the batcave
good king wenceslas is on the speakers down here as well
across a catwalk the batmobile rests on its little plateau wrapped in a tarp
alfred clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea service down
he glances up at the bank of video monitors and sees sekowsky still babbling on several channels simultaneously
he scans the cave but theres no trace of sir
as if in response bats screech and flutter in the distant recesses of the cavern
alfred turns suddenly and sees bruce behind him suspended from a thin filament wire rising out of im not deaf alfred
i hear you
hes wearing his civvie tweed pants and cashmere sweater but hes got the utility belt with its spring action reel buckled about his waist
clutching a bundle he hangs in midair for a moment dangling over the void
alfred slowly regains his composure i took the liberty of preparing tea
indicating tbe monitors i take it youve been watching the news
bruce still dangling glances up at the sekowsky interview and nods
lot of crazy people in this world
bruce rocks back and forth to build up momentum
he kicks off on the nearest stone outcropping lands gracefully on the batcave floor and unbuckles his belt
preoccupied he drops his mysterious bundle on the lab table a roll of black fabric and a cluster of lightweight hollow aluminum rods connected by what appears to be surgical
i should inform you
christmas is approaching and weve received our annual solicitation from the firemans toy fund
eyeing the equipment if i may inquire
bruce hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the tubing
the tubing inflates and the rods spring erect stiffening wing like into something which looks remarkably like the skeleton of an umbrella
most ingenious sir
what exactly it
what does it look like
to the untrained eye sir it looks remarkably like
the skeleton of an umbrella
bruce eyes his new invention thinks it over smiles slyly
good guess alfred
thats exactly right
bruce hits the trigger and the rods wilt with a hiss
he sits at his lab table alfred unfolds a napkin on his lap pours a cup of tea
splendid sir and if i may say im glad youre putting your time to such productive use
beat now the toy fund
our contribution last year was a half million dollars
we can do better than that
then theres the foster parents program
the gotham homeless crusade
bruce nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich
he seems oddly preoccupied not exactly melancholy but his thoughts are obviously a million miles away
alfred looks on concerned alfred cont
is something troubling you sir
the holidays i guess
always gets me thinking about
he changes the subject and to tell you the truth im a little concerned about vicki
anxiously miss vale sir
ive been thinking about it lately
thinking about it a lot
gravely shaking his head and i still cant figure out what to get her for christmas
bruce shoots alfred a solemn perplexed look and alfred heaves an audible sigh of relief as we tight on a stack of coops and cages piled high against a bare
each cage and there are at least two dozen of them contains a twittering bird starlings pigeons cardinals titwillows
camera pulls back from the bars of the cages to reveal a very odd figure in prison greys
a canary perched on his shoulder sings happily as he stands in front of a grimy cracked mirror plastering back his hair buffing his nails with quick birdlike strokes
boniface is beak nosed epicene and so fat that it seems his skin should burst the adjective that comes to mind is obscene
despite his eccentric appearance he comports himself with overblown theatrical dignity
fastidious and preening he does not suffer insults lightly
camera pulls back further through another set of bars and we realize that mr
boniface is himself caged
a prison guard arrives to slide back his cell door
up and at em pengy
boniface pointedly ignores the guard refusing to acknowledge the odious if wholly appropriate nickname
boniface finally turns
with an expression of extreme distaste he affixes a monocle over one eye returns the canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out
boniface and his attorney sit at a long table across from the warden and the members of the parole board
you want to return the money you stole
the map will show you where its buried
the parole officer stares skeptically at a hand scrawled map
all of it
forty two million dollars
boniface stares down humbly at the table as if he finds the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to bear
why this sudden change of heart
gentlemen i want my debt to be repaid in full
i want to be a part of civilized society
oozing sincerity prison life is not for me
the guilt the fear the constant shame
one meets a disturbingly low class of people
sure but forty two million dollars
boniface nods plaintively
its quite a perfomlance
he dabs at his face with a handkerchief its hot in here and hes the delicate type
his records clean
thirteen years without an incident
id like to point out my clients put his time to good use
a student of ornithology
articles published in several respected journals
the parole officer thumbs through a stack of magazines bird world ornithological review beaks and feathers nest egg birds yes
my only source of solace
in light of this rather extraordinary gesture i see no reason not to endorse your application for parole
thank you sir
you wont regret it
boniface shakes hands with the members of the parole board
as the guards escort him out a black mynah bird squawks loudly from its cage in the corner of the office chuckles all around
on his way out the attorney gestures toward the mynah and beams at the parole board personally trained by my client
free time the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area
t bone lbs
of dumb hulking beef saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate mr
boniface staring at a stack of empty cages
boniface whirls on him suddenly his face beet red apoplectic with where are my birds shit pengy
i let em go hermione
its the dead of winter
t bone flops casually on his bunk obviously enjoying mr
bonifaces profound distress
they were all cooped up
with you leaving and all seemed like the humane thing to do
bonifaces gaze falls on a corner of the cell
he spots a scattering of yellow feathers a patch of fresh blood
with a supreme effort of restraint he turns and forces a smile
you might as well have this
i wont be needing it
he tosses a sony walkman to t bone who flicks it on
the dim strains of classical music are audible through the earphones
well thanks pengy
no hard feelings
chuckling to himself yknow im gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours
t bone tunes the walkman to a rock station slips the headset on grins from his bunk
two guards arrive
as they escort him out mr
boniface mutters you wont miss it long
its fifteen degrees outside as mr
boniface aka the penguin waddles forth from the prison gates regally attired in cutaway and pin stripes
he pauses to inhale a deep lungful of the icy air then with a smile of exhilaration he removes his coat and stretches spreading his wings reveling in the cold
a stretch limo pulls up
two identically gaunt and vulture like dandies formally dressed with bowler hats and umbrellas step out to meet him
these two gentlemen frick and frack serve as the penguins general factoti and business managers
welcome back mr
our years of planning are about to pay off
now that hes loose the penguins rapacious side is beginning to show
his eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his own ingenuity
i take it they found the money all right
we buried it exactly as you specified
how much have we got left
frick reaches into his coat for a balance sheet
lets see an initial capitalization of million and change compounded over thirteen years at an annual return of just under sixteen percent fine fine
how much seventy nine million
excluding the sum we buried
the penguin lets out a dry heaving chortle midway between a normal laugh and a ducks quack
he checks his watch and reaches into his pocket for a small electronic device
speaking of burials
t bone on work detail
hes got the walkman on and hes shoveling snow to the beat
he winces and removes the headphones
the music he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie high pitched whine
hes twisting the knob trying to find the station he was tuned to when a pigeon dives down straight he drops the shovel as the bird strikes glancing off his
before he can react three more pigeons have swooped down at him pecking at his head and shoulders in a frenzy
he lets out a howl and staggers through the prison yard in a frenzy
dozens of pigeons are pouring over the prison walls shrieking hideously descending on him
he falls to the ground screaming for help but the other prisoners run like rabbits terrified
by the time the guards come racing across the courtyard t bones no longer even visible
theres just a swarming man shaped mass of pigeons pecking away flapping their wings insanely
covering their faces as they move in the guards blow their whistles beat at the pigeons with billy clubs
all at once the pigeons take off en masse leaving t bones mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard
a guard notices the walkman picks up the earphones to listen and hears nothing but rock music surfin bird by the trashmen
bird bird bird bird is the word
an aerial view of the limo as it cruises down the deserted road leading away from the prison
it disappears from view and all at once the frame is filled with pigeons great squalling flocks of them dutifully following their master as he makes his way back to
alfred opens the front door and finds a bundled up vicki out on the portico red cheeked flushed and happy
she pulls him forward gives him a quick peck on the cheek
guess what alfred
i think i found a present for bruce
shes got a long skinny gift box propped up against the exterior wall
at first it doesnt want to fit through the door it must be eight feet long but with alfreds help she gets it inside
the faithful butler stares curiously at this odd shaped gift
dont let on okay
he wont hear a word of it from me
hes such a nightmare to shop for
what do you get him year after year alfred
conspiratorially i find you cant go wrong with surveillance equipment
let me put this under the tree
not so fast
she reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another small gift
alfred stares at the tag to alfred love vicki and tries to suppress a huge grin
why miss vale
whats all this
alfred and vicki turn
its bruce dressed for dinner marching down the long stairway in the entry hall
vicki waves frantically
its your present
vicki rushes over to embrace him
he gapes at the long skinny box whatd you get me
kareem abdul jabbar
vicki frowns and gives him a kiss
she nestles up against him
whispers in his ear im going to give you the happiest christmas youve ever had
still in the clinch bruce shoots a look at alfred
taking the hint alfred clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box
he backs out of the entry hall dragging the box before him
fires burn in garbage cans
tents and lean tos dot the snowy landscape
men women and children wander aimlessly huddling against the cold
an army of the homeless has set up camp in gotham park
on the nearby periphery picketers half concerned citizens half down and outers are marching the sidewalks keeping a candlelight vigil
hand lettered placards read save the the source of the protest
a towering sign posted in a corner of the park announcing the imminent consuuction of a new luxury highrise the gotham park towers a project of shaw construction inc
a lamborghini sits at a traffic light nearby
bruce and vicki dressed for dinner stare out at the demonstration
beat i was just down here tuesday
seems like theres more every day
bruce starts to say something but cant think of anything to say
and they say theres over a thousand people living in the park already
the light changes
bruce throws the car into gear and at the next intersection turns the car right into the park
despite the name its a tony little bistro catering to gothams elite
a panhandler underdressed for the cold has been hustling the customers as they come out a couple of parking attendants are trying to drag him discreetly away as bruces car
a valet opens the car for bruce and vicki who look on in concern as the panhandler gets the bums rush
the liveried doorman shrugs apolagetically sorry for the inconvenience as they enter
vickis got a sheaf of photos spread out on the table in front of bruce shots of gothams homeless being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings erecting their shantytowns in gotham
theyre already razing the tenements and sros downtown
these people dont have anyplace else to go
beat if the city starts selling off the park
bruce takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings
huge windows open on a serene and picturesque view of the park campfires flicker in the distance
i guess ill pass on dessert
taking his hand bruce you do a lot more than most people even dream of
comes off the top of my taxes thats not what i meant
they exchange a long silent look
of course shes referring to batman
still the argument doesnt hold much water with what i do doesnt come close to the root of the problem vicki
long pause im just a band aid
its been ages
vicki turns and rapidly closes her photo folder
millionaire construction magnate randall shaw is in the restaurant table hopping and hes just glommed onto bruce
you remember vicki
hows the construction business
the park tower
all systems go
if we can get the junkies and winos cleared out
a big grin not too late to get in on the deal
ill think about it
say walter barretts due back from europe
we should all get together at the club
clapping him on the shoulder nice to see you again miss veal
miss veal maintains a big phony smile as shaw moves off to the next table
she murmurs to bruce through clenched teeth what a pig
ive known him since he was seven years old
he was a pig then too
now he wants to gobble up the park shivering bruce isnt there something you can do about people like that
what tie him up with a bat rope
no you idiot
i meant you bruce bruce nods oh yeah
bruce and vicki emerge from the restaurant
he hands his parking stub to a valet
a crowds beginning to form in the lot outside
the red and blue bubble of a police car is flashing a short distance off near the entrance to the park
two red berets in full order of the bat regalia look on as a recently mugged woman jogger gives her statement to the investigating cops
bruce and vicki intrigued by the batman wannabes move a little closer within eavesdropping range we were on patrol
saw the whole thing
i was attacked
three men in ski masks indicating the red berets and these two broke it up
they ran like rabbits
i never saw anybody take off so hey
somebody had to go for the cops
shut up all right
to the jogger lady who was it that bailed you out
kid thirteen or fourteen tops
he just came out of nowhere and tore into em
shaking her head it was so quick i didnt even see his face
nearby vicki shoots a highly quizzical look at bruce who responds with a mystified shrug
her professional curiosity piqued she wanders over to introduce herself to the jogger
an exasperated cop leads the red berets away from the crime site dumb shit
shouldnta been jogging in the park at night anyway
sullenly look around you
its fulla bums bruce gestures at the red berets batman sweatshirt as he passes
piss off geek
snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming gotham harbor
foghorns blare in the distance as a pair of stiletto heels totally inappropriate for the weather click across the sidewalk and pause at mid block where a wide wooden plank
leads down from street level to a seedy hole in the wall bar the wharf rat
a roughneck joint about as trendy as the average bait shack
the clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo
a tv over the bar is tuned to the late news and tomorrow the citys power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist walter barrett who
returns to gotham after a five year stay in europe
the bartender switches to a hockey game because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about walter barrett
none that is except for a strapping young bruiser named ricky who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner
moments later the owner of the high heels enters she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler revealing exotic vaguely eurasian features
shes dark and elegant fine boned regal of bearing and her name though we dont know it yet is selina kyle
shes not the kind of girl who typically frequents the wharf rat and so her entrance creates quite a stir
a longshoreman at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt
two blowsy whores size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference
the regulars of course are all but licking their chops
the only guy in the joint who hasnt noticed her yet is ricky whos still on the phone yo
whats the haps
in mid conversation he notices selina
she smiles invitingly right at him
mildly startled he smiles back
see you then
he hangs up eagerly
then with a deep breath he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to selinas end of the bar
ricky is it
howd you know that
i heard you on the phone
talking to your girlfriend
that was business selina makes a big show of peeling off her gloves
if youve got time for a little pleasure maybe youd like to buy me a drink
she clasps his hand
his eyes bug out
three enormous rings a diamond bracelet there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone
ricky gapes at the sparklers bedazzled
jeez they look almost real
why wouldnt they be
ricky is not the smoothest guy around and his line of thought is all too evident
he swallows hard and tries not to stare
youd have to be crazy
nobodyd wear the real thing to a dive like this
oh theyre real all right
so are these
she waves her fingernails long polished and talon sharp in front of his eyes
with lightning speed before he can react she pins his wrist to the bar and with one quick stroke carves a thin bloody stripe in the back of his hand
selinas eyes flash as he gasps in shock
he tries to jerk his hand away but he cant break her grip
then her dominance firmly established she releases his hand with a coy cheshire cat smile
werent we going to have a drink
he blinks forces a chuckle smiles unsteadily
she takes his wounded hand lifts it slowly to her mouth and laps gently at the blood
ricky is hypnotized
shes got an odd way of flirting but ricky finds it somehow intriguing
he dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the bartender
just after midnight the snows still failing the waters are icy and the wharfs are deserted almost
a small steamboat is docked at pier and the deck is lined with thugs mean ugly and heavily armed
a similar contingent of gun toting goons is waiting to greet them on the dock below
the boys on the dock hoist assault rifles as the boat thugs extend a gangplank
something major is about to happen
the chief dock goon gestures to his lieutenant who grabs a black medical bag
hands raised the two of them start up the gangplank
throughout all this the dock goons keep their guns trained on the boat thugs covering their buddies
one of them turns to a colleague wheres that goddam ricky
probably out gettin laid
and here we are freezin our balls off
the lieutenant unloads chemical testing gear from his doctors bag
the lead boat thug gestures to a stack of shipping crates which rest atop a large net spread out across the deck
the chief goon selects a crate at random
two boat thugs tip it on its side and using a crowbar pry off a false bottom revealing a dozen packets of white powder
were now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a ramshackle boathouse at waters edge
down on the deck of the steamboat the lieutenant goes to work testing the merchandise
a black silhouette is peering down from the boathouse roof
the mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight the only details that register are a pair of ominously familiar pointy lets do it
he gestures to his boys on the dock
a crane and winch assembly rotates into place over the deck and the boat thugs gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to the big hook
lets see the money
down on the wharf a dock goon kneels beside a metal suitcase and opens it
lots of long green inside
the boat thug signals thumbs up and the crates rise into the air as the goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank
the goon with the suitcase marches up
beyond him in the distance a lithe black shadow vaults off the boathouse roof and makes a silent graceful landing on the long shaft of the the moment of maximum
tension grim faces all around everyone holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck and crane swings over the pier
razor sharp chrome steel talons slash suddenly through the air
the netting gives way and two dozen shipping crates rain down onto the pier crushing two dock goons underneath
the crates explode into splinters littering the dock with drugs and random art objects as the other dock goons scatter in panic
nobody knows quite whats going on
panicking the goon with the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the gangplank
boat thug i sees him and squeezes off a quick shot
winged the goon topples off the gangplank and hits the drink suitcase and all
all at once everyones opening fire
thinking hes been double crossed boat thug i turns on the chief goon and shoots him twice at point blank range
to another boat thug go after it
get the money
he raises his gun and the second boat thug dutifully obeys diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire
everyones ducking for cover
boat thug i barks orders at the pilothouse soltar las amarras
boat thug i whirls just in time to see a shadowy figure landing cat like on the deck mere yards away
clad in inky black leather from head to toe the intruders face is concealed by what appears to be a bondage mask
studded with openings for the eyes and mouth it spans one incongruous touch a pair of pointed cat ears
she bares her teeth and hisses
its a woman
boat thug i is momentarily mesmerized
in the time it takes him to lift his gun shes produced a cat o nine tails
she snaps it at him reels him in and with one lethal stroke rakes her steel talons across his face and throat
he slumps to the deck lifeless
the other boat thug rushes her she catches him under the jaw with a sudden upthrust lifts him into the air and sends him toppling into the water
the gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the pier
she hoists an abandoned assault rifle scatters the dock goons with a round of automatic fire and vaults off the boat landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of
most of the dock goons have taken flight but a few unlucky specimens remain behind
she somersaults forward takes one goon off his feet with a crack of the whip knocks another off the dock with a twirling high kick to the jaw sends two
more reeling with swift talon slashes
the whole frenzied mop up action takes just under ten seconds
alone at last she stands back to survey the scene
counting the stiffs on the boat which is now receding in the harbor there must be well over a dozen dead
the snow is speckled with red
a half dozen bodies lie sprawled in their own blood one of them the lone survivor is face down and softly moaning
retracting her steel claws the masked woman crouches amid the wreckage of the smashed shipping crates
bindles of white powder millions of dollars worth are scattered all about the pier but she couldnt seem less interested
instead shes checking the manifest numbers stamped on the sides of the crates
she finds crate bb and rummages among its contents until she comes up with a carefully wrapped parcel
she opens it carefully and holds it up for inspection
the statuette of a raven carved from solid onyx glistens in the moonlight
the woman pauses long enough to slip a small card in the moaning punks back pocket
then cradling the raven under one arm she dashes off on silent cat feet
a lantern approaches
its an old salt some kind of hapless night watchman and his face goes bone white at the sight of the carnage on the docks
he kneels beside the moaning punk turns the body over and gasps because the punks face has been clawed to shreds
the unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with the flutter and song of cold weather birds dozens of them all chirping flitting about in the rafters alighting
on special perches mounted in the walls
at the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken pool
arctic terns loll on the surrounding rocks as a lackey with a wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already frigid water
carefully landscaped it looks like the penguin exhibit at the gotham zoological gardens
a massive indistinct shape glides beneath the surface
its not a whale its too pink
it is instead the penguin and as he breaks the surface sputtering he sees frick standing in the open doorway
visitor has arrived
thank you mr
show her in
the penguin moves to the edge of the sunken pool
two of his lackeys swivel a crossbar which hangs from the ceiling by a long chain into place over his head
he grasps it with both hands and the crossbar rises hoisting his formidable bulk out of the water
frick leads the visitor down a long corridor lined on either side with bird cages exotic songbirds with brilliantly hued plumage
camera tracks along behind her and although we cant see her face there must be something distinctively feline about her because the birds are shrieking and fluttering in their cages
recoiling instinctively as she strolls past
frick opens a door and ushers her into
our visitor selina kyle enters the penguin pool room
her teeth begin to chatter
the big bay windows have been thrown open and snow is blowing in from outside
its freezing in here
she sees the penguin wearing a thin dressing gown and an apron outfitted with seed pouches scattering birdseed on the window ledge for the pigeons totally oblivious to the cold
he turns throws his arms wide in greeting kisses the back of selinas hand
ah miss kyle
at last we meet
at last we meet
yes theyre common birds dirty stupid unattractive but theyre very obedient and they do crap on peoples heads
she extends a shopping bag
the penguin removes a parcel and unwraps it revealing the raven statuette
he sets it on a nearby desk fondles it reverently
and beams at selina
i see your reputation was not exaggerated
ive located the others
all but one
shivering im surprised you dont catch pneumonia
with an apologetic smile the penguin pulls the windows shut
my normal body temperature is ninety two degrees
germs find me inhospitable
i see why they call you the penguin
they may call me that
but rarely more than once
he pours two glasses hands one to selina raises a toast
heres to the second biggest crime in the history of gotham city
commissioner gordon and another cop lt
eddie bullock are in darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room
it wasnt about the drugs
whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks
theyre watching through a two way glass panel as a terrified man with a heavily bandaged face tells his story
its the lone survivor of the dock massacre julio and his voice is audible over a concealed intercom julio filter un silueta negra con colmillos y garras el demonio
whats that he keeps saying
that dock looked like a slaughter house
batmans never committed murder
we did find this in his back pocket
bullock hands gordon a card
it reads those who feed on the soul of gotham will suffer my wrath and in lieu of a signature theres a little black bat emblem in the bottom corner
while gordons staring at it a policeman pokes his head in commissioner
weve got barrett
a cubicle down the hall
the splenetic walter barrett millionaire industrialist is fidgeting in his chair as gordon enters
these storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming home party
beat id like to know the meaning of this id like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects
gordon i come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in gotham
if you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs be my guest
long menacing pause ill have your badge before you leave this room
gordon weighs the threat
he nods to the cops in attendance
book the son of a bitch
gordon storms out
barrett jumps out of his chair but the cops restrain him
outraged he bats their hands away
i believe im still entitled to a phone call
vicki with her camera squeezing off snaps
shes standing behind a sawhorse part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown demolition site
surveyors and hardhats bustle about in a vacant lot a full city block in size fenced off and strewn with rubble
the only structure still standing is a lone decrepit tenement building a wrecking ball is poised above it ready to strike
a sign at one corner of the lot announces a forty story office complex soon to be erected on this site by shaw construction inc
down below is randall shaw himself in necktie and hardhat speaking into a walkie talkie come on
lets move it
were an hour behind as it is
a few moments later a cluster of people emerge from the tenement building a mixed team of cops and construction goons who are forcibly removing a destitute family from the
vicki watches angrily
a quick series of shots the squatters wailing and struggling clinging to the doorways unwilling to leave
their few belongings are packed in a couple of cardboard boxes which the cops heave rudely out onto the street
finally the handcuffs and nightsticks come out
a surveyor grabs shaw by the arm and points out the woman taking photos in the crowd
shaw recognizes her instantly
his face turns into a mask of outrage as if hes been personally betrayed
jesus christ thats bruce waynes bimbo
he makes eye contact with her
vicki stares back defiantly
hes about to stroll over and tell her off when a hardhat signals to him phone call mr
guy said its urgent
to tbe surveyor hold the ball
i wanna hear it crash
he climbs into the cab of a nearby truck where he picks up a barretts still in custody at the police station using his one phone call to contact the
its me randall walter barrett
i want you to call my attorney
that was my shipment they busted up last night
jesus walter i suddenly puzzled why are you calling me its worse than that
somebody took my raven
shaw stares at the phone in horrified disbelief
she watches as shaw climbs out of the truck numb in a daze
he signals to the wrecking ball operator a whistle blows and the great iron ball knocks a mammoth hole in the facade of the tenement
shaw doesnt even stick around to watch it
he scurries off to his car at the end of the block
vicki highly intrigued gets it all on film
vickis in a huddle with the managing editor schultz showing him her photos shaw orchestrating the eviction of the great stuff but were looking at a shitfight with our beloved
he and shaw
crossing his fingers old money sticks together
vicki points to a photo of shaw racing from the truck to his car
id sure like to know what shook him up so
he was out of there like a scared rabbit
just then a reporter wilk rushes up excitedly to schultzs desk
got a blind tip from downtown
you know that massacre on the docks
batman vicki reacts in astonishment
schultzs jaw drops this is hot whoa
is this on the level
cops even got a note
those who feed on the soul of gotham will suffer my wrath
grinning to vicki sounds like your pals cranked it up a notch
vicki starts to protest but thinks better of it
alfred opens the door
a banner headline stares him in the face industrialist linked to drug smuggling ring vicki whos holding up the afternoon paper for alfreds inspection peeks out glumly from behind the
seen the late edition
im afraid so miss vale
master bruce is sequestered in the cave
on their way to the batcave alfred and vicki pass through the library
they pause in front of the television which is tuned to a panel show with various experts discussing the hot issue of the day
environmentalist on tv walter barretts no saint
his factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years
if he is mixed up with drugs
pundit on tv thats not the issue
the issue is do we entrust our public safety to some
does batman have a license to kill shaking his head ah the public
vicki follows alfred out
we hold on the tv as the camera pans over to the third guest on the panel loudly demanding air time
hes wearing a red beret and a batman sweatshirt mike sekowsky on tv yo heres the tip man
drug dealers are scum if batman did wax these punks
they deserved it
end of discussion
alfred and vicki arrive bruce gestures for them to keep quiet
hes hunched over a tape recorder and commissioner gordons voice is blaring from a nearby speaker
filter anyone couldve written that note
gordons in conference with a number of city officials blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping
and i suppose anyone couldve taken out a boatload of armed thugs
a dozen men jim murdered in cold blood before we forget batmans saved hundreds of lives
hes still a vigilante
we dont know who he is where he comes from why he does it
street punks are one thing jim
this is walter barrett a personal friend of mine
as the conversation continues camera slowly moves in on a computer terminal in the corner
we see the tiny trademark embossed on the cpu wayne technologies
as he listens through his concealed bug
youve gotta bring him in jim at least for questioning
it would sure help if we could get that mask off
bruce shuts the recorder off
he turns to face alfred and ladies and gentlemen
ive been framed
the bat signal blazing in the night sky
after a beat the camera tilts down to a cluster of excited citizens who point and holler as the batmobile streaks past
two cops are parked in an alleyway watching as the batmobile whizzes past on the street
the driver pulls out behind it as the second cop grabs his radio mike
one delta niner on riverview north bound at rd repeat
voice on radio filter one delta niner thats a repeat
backup on the way
barreling toward us on the street
the squad car gains behind it
a siren howls a red and blue bubble begins to flash
the batmobile makes a hairpin turn and accelerates
as the batmobile rounds the corner and picks up speed two more squad cars scream down the cross street joining in the pursuit
all at once thick black smoke billows from the back of the batmobile enveloping the police cars blinding the two squad cars parked in a v formation a makeshift roadblock
anxious policemen mill about in front of them
they move into position as the batmobile still trailing smoke rounds a corner and careens directly toward them
the front fender of the batmobile detaches and extends itself from the body of the car
it bends in the middle wing panels flip into place forming an arrowhead shaped cow catcher
a shrieking horn blares
the cops see the batmobile speeding up and dive for the sidewalk
the cow catcher slams into the souad cars pushes them effortlessly aside and cruises through the gap
as the pursuing cars emerge from the smoke cloud and follow the batmobile through we tilt up to the roof of a nearby building and realize that the batmobiles on
automatic pilot because batmans been on the roof all along watching the action with some dismay
his relationship with the gotham pd appears to be on shaky ground
he speaks into his voice activated remote control evasive
sirens howl below as he strolls across the rooftop lost in thought
at this height the sirens are a distant insect drone
were in the palatial digs of randall shaw the construction magnate
theres obviously money to be made in real estate development because the walls are lined with art and the floor to ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
at the moment shaws posing casually in front of his new brancusi which rests on a pedestal near the windows
an unidentified woman in a slinky black dress looks on her back to the camera
its a fake
it cost me a half a million dollars
you see i
happen to know where the real one is stashed
the woman wanders out of frame as shaw smiles impressed
he seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal at the moment art is not the first thing on his mind
camera stays on him as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest
i guess youd know
i have some friends in the art world
they say that for certain hard to get items youre the one to call
they say for the right price
you could steal michelangelo off the sistine chapel wall
do you believe everything you hear
oh im not one to judge
i admire people who take what they want
im just curious how you do it
shaw hands her the wine and for the first time we see her face
its selina kyle perching seductively on the arm of the sofa
i find that the old methods work best
setting her wine down flashing her patented cheshire cat smile selina moves in on him and they go into a deep passionate kiss
her long red nails dig into his back shaw drops his wine glass which shatters splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor
the actions gone horizontal
selina peeled down to a sheer lace teddy is on the bed atop shaw tickling his throat with quick lapping kisses
she rolls off suddenly when he tries to sit up she pushes him back down with a single finger
sitting on the edge of the bed she peels off her stockings twisting them around into tight cords
with a coy smile she runs her finger in a circle around shaws hairy chest and then abruptly knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and ties it off on
hey what are you doing
he tries to break her grip
she backhands him sharply across the face
youre very inquisitive
youll just have to be disciplined an edgy smile spreads across his face as she binds his other hand to the bedpost
none too quick hes just caught on that all this is part of selinas kinky scene
she crosses quickly to the bathroom you know ive
ive never really done this kind of thing before
and reemerges wearing her catwoman mask
which seems perfectly appropriate in this context
i think people should indulge their fantasies
now that hes all trussed up she crosses the room and reaches into an oversized bag
she withdraws an odd looking chromium brace slips it on over her wrist and hits a trigger
six inch steel talons snick into place
shaws dopey smile fades
hey what are those what are you he lets out an awful shrill shriek as the camera whip pans away from the bed to a jackson pollack on the wall
a spray of blood spatters across it in an aesthetically pleasing way and the shriek ends in a low gurgle as we a security guard is working a crossword at
his booth near the entrance of the building
behind him a bank of monitors show various empty hallways throughout the building
he reaches for his coffee and sees a red light flashing on a wall panel nearby
the penthouse is throbbing with the clangorous sound of a burglar alarm
selina is standing by an open wall safe concealed behind a painting which has been swung away on hinges and shes holding her ears wearing a look of complete exasperation
oh shit the guards voice crackles over a nearby intercom guard o
whats going on up there
furious with herself she reaches inside the safe and extracts a black raven statuette identical to the one she took on the docks
she slams the door shut and swings the picture back into place
sirens echo in the streets
squad cars make sudden turns and streak off toward shaws building
watching the cars from his rooftop vantage batman raises an antenna mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his head
an earpiece concealed inside his cowl gives him the police frequency dispatcher o
filter possible in progress e
th at gotham park west
its randall shaw
repeat all units batmans eyes widen
he steps to the ledge and pulls a tiny metal cylinder from his belt immediately recognizable as part of bruces hydraulic umbrella gizmo
but its no umbrella
when batman thumbs the switch his black cape begins to spread and rise stiffening expanding inflating itself into a pair of rigid black batwings
he steps off the ledge into midair soaring silently across the street like a human hang glider as the cop cars cruise past far below
theres an awful banging at the front door
shaw lies under the bloody sheets hands folded staring lifelessly up at the ceiling
selina now dressed in full catwoman regalia slings a lightweight knapsack over her shoulders
she picks up the nearest chair rams it through shaws plate glass window and clambers out onto the ledge outside
ten seconds later the cops burst in
they rush to the bedroom spot the shattered window the inert gory mass on the bed but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall
painted there in blood
is a big red dripping bat
forty stories up
the catwoman in a surefooted crouch she scurries along the ledge springs at a cornice and in one lithe motion vaults up onto the roof
she scampers across the rooftops dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle like a mountain climber until she reaches the building at the end of the block
here she pauses to dig in her knapsack
she pulls out a retractable hook at the end of a rope swings it around heaves it at the rooftop across the street
police pile out of cars and race for the entrance totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead where the small barely visible figure of a woman clad entirely
in black leather is doing a tightrope walk across the intersection
the catwoman bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides shes out of danger
then weary and exhilarated she drops to her knees bathed in moonlight she preens stretches emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure
shes just made a kill and her blood is running high so shes stopped for a moment of quality time
she hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over
her whole body tenses and though her head doesnt move her eyes dart left
a caped shadow has just touched down at the end of a line
the gold bat emblem on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows
she acts like she hasnt noticed
but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same
his eyes widen his lips part as he watches her
if its possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask were seeing it now
she still doesnt let on that shes seen him
instead she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to strut like a gymnast on the balance beam posing for him in a little private show a strange
self infatuated autoerotic dance routine for batmans benefit
his jaw is down around his knees
whoa he edges forward slightly as if hypnotically drawn to her
she hears a noise
makes a big show of looking left and right
somehow afraid shell see him watching batman jumps back into the shadows
she gathers her things a small white card flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof and she vanishes over the edge
snapping back to reality he bolts across the roof just in time to see shes rapidly working her way down the side of the building flipping down from one fire
escape to tile next a master gymnast
three stories up she lands on a railing then stops launching herself out over the street making a perfect landing on the roof of a passing bus
batman turns and his eyes fall on the white card
he kneels to pick it up a brief three word message is scrawled upon it
he goes goggle eyed with astonishment
he rushes back to the edge of the roof and sees the bus just turning toward the entrance to gotham park
hes reaching for his grappling gun figuring to follow when a floodlight catches him full in the face
down below the cops are sweeping their beams across the rooftops
two of them catch a quick glimpse of batman just as he ducks back behind the cornice out of view
you see what i saw
this sends the astounded cops rushing to their radios
right on cue commissioner gordons car pulls up
bullock whos already on the scene fills him in as he climbs out
its randall shaw
torn to ribbons
we just made batman up on the roof
the bus rumbles deeper into the snowy park
a black silhouette springs off the roof into the trees disappearing among the branches
we track with the bus as it moves through the park arriving finally at the little colony of homeless people in their cardboard shacks and lean tos still occupying the
future site of the park towers
marchers and picketers are continuing their protest nearby and some charitable organizations set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables hot coffee and sandwiches
vickis on the periphery of the camp camera in hand
shes trying to persuade a homeless man to let his picture be taken
please just one
its important for people to see whats happening
they dont want to see us lady
they just want us gone out of sight and out of mind
mumbling as he wanders off get worse before it gets better
it always does
in the distance the picketers are shrieking and wailing
a vans just pulled up to the edge of the park and a dozen hardhats are elbowing their way through the crowd
all at once theyre swarming through shantytown with tire irons and baseball bats overturning the sandwich tables ripping down the shabby tents and lean tos
some of the homeless people run
those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence
a marcher jumps a hardhat and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble
vicki waits for the police sirens but they dont come she backs off toward the trees she begins snapping photos frantically capturing the carnage on film
a hardhat is dismantling a lean to with his tire iron sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow when he glances up and sees vicki taking his
he points her out to a colleague
and suddenly the two of them are rushing toward her with pure cold malice in their eyes
vicki turns to run but its slow going in the snow
she slips and falls her attackers are almost upon her
when a shadowy figure dives out of the trees and tackles one of the hardhats
the figure lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen hardhats jaw knocking him out cold
the second hardhat turns and lifts his tire iron
but the figure with surprising agility is already rolling out of the way
as he rolls he grabs the first guys hardhat off his head and brings it up in front of him blocking the blow from the second guys tire iron
in the same motion he plants a foot in the second hardhats belly and sends him reeling backward hardhat ii drops the tire iron and the figure snatches it out
of midair as he gets to his feet
he moves in on the second hardhat brandishing the iron and while hardhat ii is staring at it the figure high kicks him in the face
the figure has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground
the figure turns toward vicki
her eyes go wide with astonishment
its a kid thirteen or fourteen at the outside sunken eyed grimy looking in a torn and tattered raincoat
she stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless
she cant believe what shes seeing
the kid wades smack into the midst of the remaining hardhats and kicks ass spinning pirouetting kicking clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism
it seems like hes everywhere at once
theres only one other guy in gotham city who can handle himself like this
rallying behind him the marchers and homeless people snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen hardhats and the tide turns
the invasion is being repelled
faced with renewed resistance the few hardhats still left standing turn tail and race off to their van
triumph in shantytown
the marchers and homeless cluster together to lick their wounds and the kid satisfied that everything is under control turns and sprints off toward the trees
but one prostrate hardhat is only playing dead
as the kid runs past the hardhat extends a tire iron into his path tripping him sending him sprawling in the snow
the kid throws up his hands as the hardhat prepares to smash down at him
the hardhat drops his tire iron and topples over boardlike
the kid looks up and sees vicki standing there with a baseball bat
he gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet thanks for returning the favor
hes about to light out again when dont be afraid
i wanted to thank you
i cautiously twenty
vickis mildly taken aback but she reaches for her purse just the same
shes barely gotten her wallet open when the kid snatches the bill out of her hands
they stare at each other for a long moment who are you
and then hes bounding off like a shot
vaulting up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches
vicki starts to follow but theres no way she can keep up
instead she digs into her camera bag
using the long lens she tracks the kids progress through the treetops
she cant actually see him but occasional chunks of snow and ice are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb
for a moment it seems like shes lost him
as she sweeps the lens back and forth scanning the trees she catches sight of an equestrian statue in the distance
she ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal
the stone figure on the horse is union war hero gen
oliver wayne bruces great grandfather
as luck would have it the kid drops to earth not ten feet from the statue vickis got him in her sights again
he looks around cautiously to make sure no ones following then races toward a stone bridge which arches between two small hillocks over a frozen creek
theres a drainage tunnel four or five feet in diameter mounted in the bridge abutment the kid pries off a wire grate and clambers inside then pulls the grate back
into place behind him
home sweet home
as she lowers the lens
her face is full of conflicting emotions
shed love to corner this boy vigilante and find out what his story is
but on the other hand even the homeless are entitled to their privacy
a canary sings in its cage as a black cat watches transfixed from a nearby chair
the cat arches its back waits and springs at the cage batting at it in midair
the canary shrieks the cat yowls a woman snatches it up off the floor cradles it in her arms
you dont want that scrawny little bird its selina looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble
at the desk behind her is the penguin in his customary cutaway and waist coat polishing his new raven
he bares his teeth do you want me to wring that creatures neck
you try it ill do the same to you
as he grumbles bemused i saw him you know
he was dreamy she strokes the cat in a reverie
the penguin drops his polishing cloth startled
dreamy are you insane
my god sputtering wildly are you sure it was him what did he do
he stood on a roof and watched me
he didnt realize id seen him
i dont think he knew quite what to make of me
smiling but he was definitely interested
this sends the penguin into a frantic round of pacing
this scheme of yours is backfiring
we dont need him on our tails
do you know how much money is at stake here
money isnt everything
casually whats the point if we cant enjoy ourselves
she chuckles to herself
he stares at her in disbelief and the big sign over gotham square tells us there are only shopping days left until christmas
down below bruce is walking vicki to work
six on one and he took em all out
then vanished into a drainage pipe right next to the statue of general wayne
my illustrious great grandfather
think its the same kid we heard about
he reminded me of you bruce chuckles
they pass a newsstand just outside the globe building pausing to stare at the headlines which scream batman suspect in slaying of millionaire developer commissioner gordon refuses comment the accompanying
photo is a full color spread of the bloody red bat painted on shaws wall
bruce scowls at vicki you work for this rag
snatching up a paper your boss is calling for gordons resignation unless he brings batman in for questioning
vicki nudges bruce and points at a storefront across the street
the owner is in the store window hastily removing all of his batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to teenage mutant ninja turtles and the simpsons
a mother drags her squirming toddler past the entrance the kid smells heavy markdowns on bat shit but mom clearly doesnt approve
looking on in dismay
bruce crumples the paper in outrage i need a good pr man
hey pal you buyin or borrowin
with a sullen look bruce tosses the paper back on the rack
vicki pulls him off toward the entrance of the globe thats what happens when you go after the rich and powerful
hey it wasnt me remember
i am rich and powerful as hes talking bruce glances back at the newsstand
he sees an ad flyer tacked up on one side looking for love
find it in the gotham globe personals
looking for love eyes widening he digs in his pocket for a quarter and races back to the newsstand
vicki keeps walking
maybe its almost
in a weird way
i mean shaw and barrett if people like that were really scared maybe theyd she suddenly realizes shes talking to herself
she turns around and sees bruce back at the newsstand hurriedly unfolding a copy of the globe she marches back and tugs at his sleeve
hey im late for work
you can read that later
im looking for a personal ad
her face screws up in confusion as bruce frantically scans the page
tall dark and handsome you saw me on the roof
i was in black you were too
is this some kind of bad joke
that cat woman or whatever she is
reading aloud i jumped a bus into gotham park hoping youd follow but you were too shy
what does she want a date
shes trying to contact me
says shes gonna leave me another ad
the two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity
bruces mind is racing he seems bizarrely aroused in a way that makes vicki just a trifle nervous
vicki arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down
she spots a message in the in file
she takes one look at it and her eyes go wide with rage
she storms out in a fury
barging past a phalanx of secretaries vicki bursts into the inner office of harrison j
provost publisher of the globe hes just opening his mail
he heaves a weary sigh as vicki barks at him close the door
waiting for her to calm down your story isnt news with shaw dead but the projects still going ahead
if attacking homeless people in the park isnt news id like to know what is theres a psycho out there in a mask and cape killing off gothams most prominent
beat ive known randall shaw all my life
his family is in mourning
and it just so happens i dont believe in slandering the dead vicki fumes
she turns and stares provost straight in the eye
provost how much money do you have tied up in the park tower project
im going to forget you made that remark
for the sake of your job i suggest you do the same
vicki stalks of and provost goes back to his mail
he finds an envelope addressed in a shaky psychotic scrawl with the word confidential underlined three times in ink
he tears it open and his face turns pale as he stares down at the contents a small business sized card signed with a bat emblem
walter barrett and his attorney emerge onto the front steps of the courthouse
barrett is instantly mobbed by reporters
any comment on the arraignment
is it true bail was set at two million dollars
my client has nothing to say at this time
the attorney clears a path for barrett who climbs into a waiting car shielding his face
reporters cluster around it
as the car pulls out into traffic we see a flock of pigeons taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the hall of justice
pigeons fill the frame swooping down toward the car which is idling at a traffic light far below
the liveried driver drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change
barretts in the back speaking into his cellular phone
its time we called an emergency meeting of the raven society
get back to me
looking troubled he hangs up
a fat white glob of pigeon shit splatters across the windshield
seconds later another splat
just washed it too
the driver reaches for the wiper switch
they hear a tiny dink as a solid pellet bounces off the windshield
barrett and the driver exchange a mystified look
a small blinking capsule has just lodged in the wiper blade assembly
just as the light changes the car explodes into a million fragments leaving a blackened crater in the middle of the intersection
tight on a video monitor showing fire trucks in the intersection weve just left hosing down the wreckage of barretts car
bruce is watching intently when alfred appears behind him
the fluegelheim called again sir
they want to know if youll be attending the opening of the new egyptian exhibit
bruce still engrossed in his news broadcast waves alfred off
cancel anchorwoman on tv and citing new evidence in the so called string of millionaire murders police commissioner j
gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of batman
beat we go now live to mike sekowsky spokesperson order of the bat
talk about gratitude
at the sight of sekowskys face bruce kills the sound in disgust
alfred looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of the batcave
well alfred its official
im a wanted man
beat new evidence
ive gotta find that woman
did you check the personals
as alfred shakes his head no a buzzer sounds
theyve got a visitor
bruce hits a switch on a monitor and sees commissioner gordons car sitting outside the wrought iron gates of wayne manor
he throws a nervous look at alfred
alfred speaks into a microphone whos there
jim gordon alfred
ive got to see bruce
a spooky development
does gordon suspect
after a moments hesitation bruce nods to alfred let him in
wayne will see you sir
a curious bruce ushers gordon into the library gestures toward the liquor cabinet
the commissioner nods his head no
hes fidgety ill at ease he obviously doesnt want to be here
sorry to bother you
bruce ill get right down to it
you knew shaw and barrett i saw them occasionally
we all sat on the board of the fluegelheim
did you have any
dealings with them or no
i never liked the way they did business
the thing is bruce youre all lumped together in the public mind the five families of gotham that sort of thing and uh
taking a card from his pocket harrison provost got this in the mail
bruce examines the card those who feed etc
he stares at gordon in mock concern playing it close to the vest
then batman is behind all this
batman or a damned good imitation
hes changed tactics hasnt he
shrugging at a loss shaw with his high rises barrett a druglord major polluter they werent exactly model citizens
who knows it could be some crazy social conscience kind of thing
you mean hes going after
the root of the problem
gordon shakes his head and gets up to go
bruce hands him the card
let me know if you get one of these
well put all our resources at your disposal
bruce nods thoughtfully as alfred appears to see the commissioner out
a moment later the butler reappears
changed my mind alfred
ill be dropping in on the fluegelheim after all
its a party to celebrate the opening of the new egyptian exhibit and the fluegelheim is hopping
board members museum patrons and socialites mill about in dinner jackets and evening gowns making small talk
an open sarcophagus has been set up as a wet bar
on a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall rimmed by a decorative moat sits an ancient egyptian shrine
the temple of bastet has been moved to gotham and reconstructed in the fluegelheim sandstone walls fountains statuary and all
guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the goddess bastet who has the body of a woman and the head of a pointy eared cat
she holds an aegis and a sistrum four tiny kittens romp at her feet
bruce whos just arrived is taking an intense interest in the cat goddess
what is it
i just had a weird sense of deja vu he glances over by the sarcophagus and sees provost the publisher huddle with eliot tiptree iii transit magnate the remaining member
of gothams five families
the two of them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he cant quite make out
harrison we really ought to warn bruce
we owe him that much
bruce detaches himself from vicki and strolls toward them
provost and tiptree force smiles and wave affecting an air of nonchalance
the mans a space cadet
let him look out for himself
as bruce arrives cheerfully why bruce
what a delightful surprise
good to see you two
looks like the five families are suddenly down to three
looking around in fact if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now tiptree chuckles nervously
provost is even less amused
is that your idea of a joke bruce
not at all
commissioner gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards
oh thats absurd
i already have
the two of them glower at each other
its like an outtake from the newlywed game bruce shrugs it off and makes a vacuous face thing is i cant imagine why batman would be after us
provost and tiptree are about to go into another round of hemming and hawing when a new face joins the party
its selina kyle stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing dress slit up to the armpits
shes holding two glasses of you two look like you need a drink
and is this who i think it is
she flashes bruce her most winning seductive heavy artillery smile
he blinks temporarily speechless
selina kyle bruce wayne
our absentee board member
ive been wanting to meet you forever selinas the new curator of antiquities
she brought the temple over block by block you two wont be terribly upset if i borrow bruce for a moment will you
before he can protest shes linked an arm around his and dragged him off
a nearby fat man spots selina wiggles his eyebrows and waves brightly
his tongue is practically hanging out hes just dying to write her a check
selina sighs wearily to bruce selina cont
i always seem to wind up in charge of fund raising
i cant imagine why
tax years almost over you know
i hope we can count on your usual generous donation
indicating provost and tiptree someones got to set an example for those two tightwads
this string of murders i asked them if theyd consider including us in their wills
chuckling to herself they didnt seem a bit amused
shes making small talk with a bunch of stuffed shirts and their overdressed wives
she glances across the room at the statue of bastet sees selina draped all over bruce
a frown crosses her face
shes still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the statue
and this is my good friend bastet the egyptian cat goddess
i think weve already met
this is quite an expedition youve put together
im glad you think so
i have to say bruce youre not at all what i expected
sorry to disappoint you
oh its not that
not at all its just that id always heard you were
sort of a
smiling fascinated no
bruces state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered when vicki sidles up alongside him and territorially takes his other arm
the women exchange big toothy plastic smiles stranded in the middle bruce realizes theyre waiting for him to introduce them
selina kyle my friend vicki vale
ive seen your pictures in the gazette the globe oh thats right
the tabloid one
what an original dress
vicki still smiling cocks an eyebrow at bruce
he senses trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass
selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple
brought it back from egypt
stone by stone
she must be awfully tired
to selina howd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this
it was easy
i slept with the pharoah
she laughs at her own joke
vicki responds with a dry little chuckle of her own
selina gives bruce a sharp yank on the sleeve
excuse us wont you sweetheart
we have some boring museum business to talk about
bruce shrugs apologetically as selina drags him off out of earshot
pull in the claws okay
shes really terrific
im sorry bruce
sometimes i get a little
aggressive you know
handing him a card look i need to talk to you
come by sometime
ill give you the private tour
let me explain about vicki shushing him i understand
anyone whos that protective must have a pretty good reason for it
she shoots him one last smile sly conspiratorial unmistakably juicy then shes off in pursuit of another major funder
bruce is thoughtfully turning the card over in his hands when vicki rejoins him
i like you better
he scans the room trying to find provost and tiptree
if youre looking for your fellow millionaires they left some time back
the roof of the gotham globe a starling circles overhead for a moment then dives down an exposed ventilation shaft
two armed bodyguards are standing watch outside an office
brass letters on the door read j
harrison provost provost agitated working late
he speaks sotto voce into the phone dont worry about that
ive had the office swept for bugs
no ones listening
tiptree in his paneled study at home
theres an open bottle on the table and hes been hitting the sauce hard
his its just so unfair
it was over a century ago
its not like were responsible
hollow eyed how could he know how could batman know about the raven society
who knows and who cares
the point is its happened
he hears a chirp and looks up
it seems to be coming from a heating vent on the wall
but then it stops so he resumes his conversation provost cont
im clearing out of the country and im taking the raven with me
i suggest you do the same
in the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny bird the same one we saw flying down the air shaft
now that weve got a close up view we can see the thin battery pack wired to its underbelly
and the miniature microphone taped to its leg
ill tell you how to reach me
and dont repeat this to anyone the penguin stands over his indoor penguin pool
hes wearing rubber gloves feeding live fish from an ice chest to his arctic birds
the vents in the windows are open and the climate in the room is downright icy as selinas wrapped in fur stroking her pet cat hes just another rich idiot
chuckling to herself the odd thing is he didnt seem a bit concerned
then he is an idiot
he lives in some big sprawling manor
ill have to get inside scope it out
see where hes got the raven stashed
how do you plan to do that
how do you think
a feline smile from selina
the penguin chuckles to himself lobs a fish out over the pool
a swooping gull snatches it out of the air before it hits the water
frick arrives in the doorway
hes planning to embark on an unscheduled christmas vacation
that should save us a trip to the bank
a huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk archaeologists tools restoration equipment etc
plus a healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over
this is selinas private domain
camera tracks past a glass case full of ugly withered turdlike specimens
what have we got here
bastets sacred animal
they were buried by the thousands at bubastis
bruce freezes with his hand poised over a set of four earthen jars
each has a lid carved in the shape of a head ape jackal man falcon
in the process of mummification the internal organs were buried separately
pointing to each jar in turn lungs stomach liver intestine bruce withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder
youre in a gruesome line of work
keeps me interested
and thats not easy to do
bruces attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd beast a winged lion with the head of a falcon
this one i know
its a gryphon right
a mythical demon half bird half lion
sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice
he can dig it
he regards the gryphon for a long moment and chuckles
birds and cats you wouldnt think the two halves would cooperate
only under certain circumstances
beat im really glad you came bruce
i was afraid id given you the wrong impression
or maybe it was the right impression
what was it you wanted to talk to me about
your collection id love to see it
i mean everyone says youve got a fabulous she breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself
she toys demurely with her equipment
she looks up at bruce and switches tactics going for the direct approach
bruce braces himself
mainly i just wanted an excuse to see you again
does she know youre here vicki
it must be strange
having all that power and money never really knowing if thats what people are attracted to
what are you attracted to
i think youre a little bit nuts
beat i think youre a little bored with your life
having everything you want
no variety no
and every once in a while you need to take a risk
shake it all up
coming here today
she leans back against a crate moistens her lips
shes letting him have it with both barrels
thats one thing i can give you bruce danger a little something you cant get at home
bruce hesitates but the lure is irresistible
he moves forward slowly selinas eyes close their lips draw slowly closer
and he sneezes in her face
she backs off in shock as he covers his face
his eyes are watering and hes wheezing
she rushes over are you okay
is there a cat in here
right on cue selinas black cat hecate lets out a loud meow and stretches against bruces pants leg
he brushes the animal aside and it leaps into selinas arms
bruce sniffles uncontrollably
get it away
she drops the cat which scampers off
bruce rubs his eyes
ever since i was a kid
snorting and weeping look id better get some fresh air
maybe another time okay
he heads for the door before selina can stop him
hes gone but she knows shes left a dent in his armor
she smiles in bemusement as hecate jumps into her arms and purrs
bruce stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated
he marches down the front steps past a newsstand where he stops to buy a copy of the afternoon globe
he opens it to the personal ads and finds what hes been waiting for tall dark and handsome christmas is coming
why dont we trim the tree together
this puzzles him for a moment until he looks up the street
in the distance at the very center of gotham square workmen are stringing lights around an enormous christmas tree almost fifty feet tall
the lighting ceremony is an annual event in gotham
bruce smiles slightly tucks the paper under one arm and walks to his car
snow falls on a huge crowd gathered around the big tree
the tree wont be lit for another twenty minutes or so and so the onlookers are singing christmas carols from printed lyric sheets
a band is playing on a makeshift orchestra platform erected in front of the tree leading the crowd in a spirited rendition of god rest ye merry gentlemen
the square is rocking with good will toward men
when they get to the part about saving us all from satans power the camera tilts upward to batman watching the action from his usual gargoyles perch
hes scanning the streets and the rooftops waiting tor the catwoman to make her move whatever it is
he glances at the building directly across the square from him
on the roof is a neon sign reading gotham city globe in ornate old english letters and above that a rotating metal sculpture of the world turning
his eyes rove downward along the facade of the building
at street level an armored car has pulled up in front of the globe offices
three security guards with rifles climb out of the armored car followed by a fourth who has an oblong box handcuffed to his wrist
of course we cant see whats inside but to those of us in the know the box looks just about the right size for a raven statuette
the guards scan the street and enter the building without incident
as they do a newspaper delivery van crosses the frame mounted on its side is an advertising placard which reads read all about it in the gotham globe
he watches with some curiosity
an armored car is this some part of the catwomans scheme
the guards are safely inside the building and the car is leaving
he settles back to wait
the innocuous looking van rounds the corner of the globe building
frick is at the wheel frack is riding shotgun and the penguin is between them peering out eagerly through the windshield
they turn into the globe s basement garage where dozens of similar vans are parked at the loading bays
just part of the fleet
the quartet of security guards arrive at provosts office
the publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy getaway
the lead guard the one cuffed to the raven box sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at arms length while provost unlocks it and checks its
satisfied he slams it shut
he reaches into his top drawer for an envelope which he hands to his personal secretary
open this in an hour
phone my wife and tell her where to meet me
to the guards edgily no trouble on the way i take it
no sir mr
we came straight from the bank vault
copter should be just touching down
well have you safely out of here in no time
here comes santa claus echoes up from the streets
batman watches as a copter descends toward the helipad on the roof of the globe provost and the lead guard with the raven box are at an elevator bank
the other guards head for a stairwell
well check the stairs
see you on the roof
the lead guard starts to press the up button but provost pulls a key from his pocket instead no my private elevator
shooting down on the car as it rises
the shaft above it is filled with birds starlings crows pigeons and the like swooping and gliding among the gears and cables
in bg the helicopter on its pad idling noisily the rotors still spinning
in fg the small dormer like structure that houses the stairway
the metal access door opens and the first of the guards steps warily out rifle at the ready
he smiles back at his pal
they dont pay us enough to tangle with batm a black gloved chrome taloned hand snakes around the edge of the dormer and rakes across his throat
sweat beads up on provosts lip as the guard hits the up button and the car begins to rise
suddenly the lights go out
the car stops with a lurch
what is it
suddenly there in the darkness they hear a series of loud popping sounds
which could be gunfire
singing here comes santa claus at the top of their lungs
happy faces beam
no one hears anything unusual over the music
batman straining to listen
we get another faint series of pops barely audible over the caroling from below and the loud putt putt putt of the helicopter blades
he cant really be sure hes heard anything at all
he scans the roof of the globe building but he cant see whats happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon sign
the catwoman lets fly with another burst of automatic fire from the dead guards rifle
the helicopter is still idling but no ones left to fly it the rooftop is littered with stiffs
pre verbal groans and murmurings of fear issue from the darkness
an eerie red light kicks on the emergency generators and we see provost backed up in a corner of the car twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic
the guard in a futile effort to placate him points up at the light there mr
see the generators kicked in
its just an electrical problem
provost is only marginally consoled
they hear a strange twittering noise in the shaft above them
provost starts babbling again
the guard slaps him across the face
but the twittering has him a bit concerned as well
he stares up at the ceiling of the car as he punches buttons on the panel with another lurch the car begins to move
were fine its going down
were going down the birds in the shaft have all roosted on the top of the car
theyre patiently riding it down as it descends
the car stops again
provost is totally losing it
the exasperated guard grabs him and shakes him
provost im gonna have a look through the trap door
but i need you to help me
you have to help
provost nods and tries to get a grip on himself
the guard looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car
he cant reach it
he uncuffs the box containing provosts raven from his wrist and stands on it
unholstering his gun and using it as a prod he can almost reach the trap door
he jumps up and poking with the gun manages to dislodge the panel slightly
provost and the guard look up through the tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness
probably just some bird thats gotten in the shaft
now calm down
youll have to give me a boost
the guard climbs back atop the raven box
provost gives him a boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap door
okay help me out
provost wraps both arms around the guards wriggling legs and tries to hoist him upward
from a vantage level with the roof of the car we see the guards fingers clinging to the lip of the trap door
now his head rises into view pushing the panel aside as he pulls himself upward
he peers around
his brow wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight passels of squawking birds walking back and forth in front of him strutting and preening mere inches from his face
the bottom half of the guard dangles from the ceiling
provost still has his arms wrapped around the guards knees
all at once the guard begins to scream his body jerks and his legs kick wildly
still provost struggles to hang on even as blood spatters across the top of his bald dome
finally the guards violent spasms are too much
provost trips over the raven box stumbles backward and lands on his ass in a corner of the car
the guard tumbles in a heap to the elevator floor his face pecked and clawed beyond recognition his eyes gone altogether
provost lets out a series of shrieks
he peers at the open trap door sees the birds staring curiously down at him and the emergency telephone rings
he stares at it
it rings again
shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage provost crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver
filter sixteenth floor
linens housewares ladies lingerie
w who is this newspaper delivery vans are parked in neat rows all driverless
frick is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of elevators all the cars have been locked open here in the basement except for one provosts
private elevator the doors to which are still closed
the penguin stands beside it speaking into a red phone
if you want to get out of that car alive i suggest you follow my instructions to the letter
as he talks we see various newspaper employees sprawled on the concrete nearby dead
a corrugated metal door has been lowered over the loading bay separating the newspaper production staff from the van pool
theyre trapped on the other side
banging away loudly on the door
calmly into phone you should see a cord hanging just behind you
provost looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned cord descending through the trap door
yes yes i see it penguin v
o filter tie the cord to the handle of your box
provost lets the phone drop
he grits his teeth but hastens to obey
as hes knotting the cord around the handle of the box a dinky bird flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic
practically weeping he reaches for the phone
filter when youre done i want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord
cowering in terror provost reaches for the cord and yanks it twice
who are you
why are you doing this
behind him frick and frack are pulling on red berets and batman sweatshirts order of the bat gear
frick climbs into a newspaper delivery van and starts the engine
provost i guess you could call me an irate reader
and to be perfectly frank im doing this because i hate garfield
chuckling the penguin holds a sonic device up to the mouthpiece of the phone
a shrill whine emanates from the receiver
all at once the elevator car is full of birds squawking wildly flinging themselves against the wall going insane in the tiny confined space
provost is screaming like a madman
the birds are in his hair his face everywhere
he fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy
all at once the car plunges downward
its as if the floor has drops away beneath provosts feet hes in free fall
he hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the elevator doors
the raven box dangles from its cord in fg as the car rockets uncontrollably downward
a steady stream ot birds are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof
the catwomans on a landing near the stairwell just below the dormer that leads to the roof
she pries open a pair of and a flock of birds pours out of the empty shaft making for the open access door a half story above
she reaches inside finds the cord attached to the raven box and reels it in
she rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy
its there all right another raven just like the first two
an awful crash from twenty five stories down she makes a disgusted face grabs the raven and bolts for the roof
he watches in puzzlement as a vast flock of birds takes flight from the globe roof across the square
something weird is definitely going on
hes about to abandon his post but down below the carolers have stopped caroling
the big trees about to be lit and theyre counting off the seconds ten
a ramshackle kiosk at street level
the news vendor has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities
a globe delivery van its side bearing the batman hero or menace
advertisement cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb
excitement is building as the seconds tick off three
the christmas lights come on and the crowd breaks into cheers
the orchestra strikes up a sprightly version of the news vendor is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past
i aleady got a he spots two masked men in the doorway of the van wearing red berets and bat shirts
they shove a body out the door the mutilated corpse of harrison provost lands on the sidewalk with a thud right beside a bundle of newspapers which read the news
vendor chases after the van but its already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of gotham square
the crowd is still singing merrily unaware of its presence until the back doors fly open and a swarm of rabid chittering bats screech out into the midst of the
the carolers break into mass hysteria as hideous bats swoop down from above clawing at their heads and shoulders
orchestra members drop their instruments and stagger off the band platform falling into the branches of the giant christmas tree
christmas shoppers are teeming in and out of nearby stores
they drop their shopping bags and race about in utter chaos as the bats attack
men scream a man staggers backward through a glass storefront and lands on his butt in a window display a big mechanical santa claus on his north pole throne chuckling
merrily in a prerecorded voice ho ho ho
the man struggles wildly as the bats converge on him
horrified shoppers scatter through the aisles as the bats pour in through the broken window
women lined up for a free makeover squeal in panic as bats arrive to rearrange their hairdos
he stares down stunned at the pandemonium raging below
he glances across the street
and sees the tiny silhouette of a woman standing atop the cast iron globe sculpture laughing at the chaos taunting him
a few blocks away from gotham square
theres a steady stream of cop cars speeding toward the site of the disturbance
one vehicle is moving in the opposite direction against traffic a newspaper delivery van
batman touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the corpses strewn across the helipad
a dying guard raises a shaky hand
batman crouches beside him
a gurgle comes up from his throat and a bubble of blood swells on his lips
all at once he hears a womans voice from the shadows of the globe some people just cant take discipline
beat go ahead
finish em off
his head jerks up
he cant see anything
a sudden whooshing noise and now the voice is coming from the other side of the roof
you might as well
youre going to get blamed for it anyway
he gets a quick glimpse of a feline shadow springing past a skylight shes jumping all around the roof clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures
he reaches for a batarang
oh come on angel
you know you want to
purring loudly besides i want to see how you do it
who are you
hes barely gotten it out when she slams into him from behind feet first knocking him to the rooftop
he tries to get up but she comes at him with a couple of cartwheeling kicks knocking him back into a cornice
he ducks right just as a sharp spiked heel strikes the exposed brick a mere three inches from his throat
he catches her leg upends her but she somersaults away and lands on her feet
cats always do
my arent we frisky tonight
he flings the batarang
it clangs into the big neon sign as she springs up into the darkness out of reach
glass tubing shatters and sparks fly as she calls down from the shadows i should tell you ive got nine lives to play with and youve only got one
he turns she drops directly onto him and locked in a death grip they stagger backwards across the roof directly toward the helicopter
the huge rotor blades are still turning
batman ducks instinctively and the catwoman breaks free falling backward onto the roof
its a strategic move when he rushes at her she braces herself against the ground and kicks upward with startling force
this time the spiked heel connects lifting batman off his feet knocking him backward into the tail of the helicopter
he slumps there stunned and before he knows it shes on him
she grabs his throat with one hand and clamps the other around his crotch
he tries to break her grip but shes just as strong as he is and shes lifting him forcing him upward toward the rear stabilizing rotor on the tail of
the rear rotor blades whine like a buzzsaw as his head rises perilously closer
at the last possible instant he grabs a handful of her hair yanks it as hard as he can with a yowl she releases him
they tumble to the roof and she dives atop him
her talons click into place he sees them poised directly above his eyes but manages to slam an elbow under her chin before she can strike
now theyre disentangled they get up groggily and circle each other
someone is banging on the metal door that leads up to the roof trying to break it down
batman turns for an instant a sudden crack and he finds himself all wrapped up in the catwomans cat o nine tails
which is also outfitted with a taser
she sends a paralyzing electric charge through his body and he collapses to the roof in a jittering heap
the banging on the door is louder
did i tell you i invited company
keep em busy angel ive gotta scat
she kneels down and plants a big wet kiss on his twitching face
then she scurries to the edge of the roof just as the door gives way and an armed swat team comes crashing out onto the roof
just coming around batman tries to roll out of sight but the cops are swarming the place
they spot the bodies on the tar and gravel see batman scuttling for cover and draw the obvious conclusion
pulling guns they open fire
bullets ricochet off the big metal globe
batman as is customary in these situations shoots a grappling hook at the roof of the next building over which is a couple of stories taller than the globe and
reels himself upward along the side wall
the swat cops score a couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough to
reach the roof
frlck and frack still in their order of the bat garb are in the front seats the penguin is leaning out the side door
someones obviously tipped the cops about the source of all the ruckus because a pair of police cars are on their tail and gaining fast
still hanging in the doorway the penguin raises his umbrella peers down its length like a rifle sight and pulls a sonic dart one of the penguins bird magnets lodges
itself in the grille of the foremost police car
the cops in the car react in astonishment as pigeons begin hurling themselves at the windshields
a dozen kamikaze birds bounce off in rapid succession
cracks begin to spread across the glass
the cops cant see where theyre driving
the car swerves wildly
and still the pigeons keep coming covering the the first car completely covered with birds smacks into a lamppost and skids
the second car crashes into it
and the pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens swarming onto the immobilized squad cars
the penguin grins with delight as the van speeds off unmolested
look at that boys they do flock together
ambulances are pouring into the square as the bat attack continues
cops are firing their guns blindly into the skies as they try to evacuate the citizenry
paramedics drop the stretcher theyre carrying when bats swoop down at their heads
batman is still pursuing the catwoman whos perched one roof over in a squat wiggling a finger for him to follow
the roofs are icy and treacherous but he matches her step for step leap for leap as she vaults from one building to the next leading him on
finally she reaches the edge of a building on the corner of the block theres no place to go but down
she squats on the ledge and smiles beckoning to him ooh
where have you been all my life
he edges closer
suddenly she does a backflip directly batman hears glass shattering
he hesitates a second moves closer to the edge of the roof peers over the icy cornice
staring down he sees a narrow ledge running around the facade of the building some ten or twelve feet below
the window of a corner apartment has been smashed the curtains are flapping in the chill wind
shes obviously making her getaway through the apartment
batman climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop to the ledge below cautiously because its a long way down
a sudden crack the catwoman hasnt entered the apartment
instead shes followed the ledge around the corner of the building silently doubling back onto the roof behind batman
he turns just as her whip wraps itself around his left leg
she gives it a sharp tug his feet skid on the ice and he topples over he plunges downward for the briefest of seconds then jerks up short slamming into
the wall of the building
the whip has coiled itself around his leg and for now its holding tight
hes dangling upside down bat like he bounces away from the wall he spins in midair as one loop of the whip unravels dropping him another foot or so
he manages to brace his left foot against the wall
its a massive strain but hes momentarily safe if he can keep from moving
the alternative is a twelve story drop straight down to the pavement
shes wrapped the handle end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof anchoring batman in place
with a cheshire cat grin she removes the raven from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice
batman hanging immobile
craning his neck he can just see the raven statuette on the ledge above him bouncing slightly and apparently talking to him
now the catwoman appears beside it elbows on the cornice chin propped up on her folded hands like a chatty girl at a fern bar
i think itll look nice over the fireplace
maybe you can drop by and see it sometime
demurely i hope you wont think im too
aggressive or anything but i find you very attractive
she toys aimlessly with the whipcord batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn
she speaks in a low soothing seductive tone almost a purr
behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes
its just so hard to meet interesting men these days
dont you think so
sighing i have trouble with relationships
men find me intimidating
kind of predatory you know
really im not
really im just playful
batman huffs and puffs trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip
she frowns and yanks on it
his foot flies free of the wall and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself
im trying to open up to you
angrily she holds a steel claw to the whip ready to cut him loose
hes palmed the grappling hook launcher from his belt
holding it close to his body out of view he works it around into firing position
hell shoot it right through her if he has to
i always seem to fall for the wrong guys
most men are rats she withdraws her hand from the whip reverts to her philosphical mode
its disgusting they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it
once youve had your fun theres not much you can do but kill them
beat but you seem different
i mean you obviously understand about dressing up
that saves a lot of explaining
i think people should indulge their fantasies dont you
batman is sweating profusely
he cant hold his position much longer
and the catwoman is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly
so i think ill let you live
cute boys like you are hard to find
standing up bye angel
ill be thinking about you
and just like that she vanishes moving silently off with her raven leaving batman to dangle
he hangs there a moment tries to twist himself around without moving his foot
he braces one hand against the wall with the other he lifts his grappling gun and fires
the hook snags somewhere on the roof
batman yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when the catwoman reappears over the edge of the cornice
im so fickle a quick swipe of her steel talons and the whipcord is neatly severed
batmans foot slips out from under him but hes still got hold of the grappling gun
he drops eight or ten feet
watching with amusement as batmans weight causes the hook to dislodge
it skitters across the gravel surface of the roof and catches at the last instant on the edge of the which promptly crumbles and gives way
fascinated the catwoman leans over the edge of the roof and peers down
he flails wildly tangled in his cape as the ground rushes up toward him
he gets a last ditch inspiration finds the gas cylinder on his belt and hits the switch
the rods in his cape begin to inflate
six stories up his batwings spring erect slowing his plunge
five stories up an updraft hits him and he suddenly inverts
four stories up he rights himself
three stories up he goes into a downward spiral out of control gliding in great wide arcs over the street
and a moment later there are no stories left
with an ugly crunch he smacks into the slush covered pavement and bounces
face down he skids some twenty feet to a halt right in the middle of a busy intersection
a delivery truck hits the brakes and screeches to a stop two feet away from batmans head
he doesnt move
pedestrians are already gawking and pointing as the driver climbs out and peers down at the inert caped figure lying face down in the street what the hell is this
cars are backed up due to the panic in gotham square a few blocks over
horns are honking
a traffic cop marches over awright whats the problem here
spotting batman jesus
he tries to clear the crowd away
a full fledged gridlock is forming around the prostrate batman
the cop blows his whistle tries to maintain order as two unifonned patrolmen rush up to join him
they manage to roll the unconscious batman over on his back
the assembled cops stare down at the mask the scuffed body armor
still waxy they finger the guns in their holsters
cowan get to the car radio the commissioner
by now there must be two hundred people in the intersection all surging forward to get a look
more cops are arriving to beat them back
is he dead
what do we do the mask
get the mask off
they hunker down over batman
one of them tugs at his mask but the helmet like cowl doesnt want to give way
he feels around some kinda seam here on the neck
the patrolman nods okay and the cop tugs at a velcro like fastening under batmans chin
the instant it comes open a burst of fine green mist spews forth from concealed jets in the gold and black bat emblem and the cops reel backward shrieking gasping
for breath and clewing at their eyes
booby trap theyve just been maced one of the onlooking cops steps back in horror and confusion
on impulse he draws his gun and fires twice at batman
the body jerks and the bullets ricochet off dont shoot you idiot
the crowd before he can finish a black boot kicks the gun out of the onlooking cops hand
batman is back among the living
sirens blare as he spins and rolls into a crouch lashing out with elbows and knees driving the cops back fuck the crowd
two more cops pull their guns and open fire in absolute panic
batman slams backward into the delivery truck and crumples to the ground
as he falls he grabs a couple of smoke capsules from his belt and flings them to the pavement
seconds later a thick cloud of black smoke is spreading through the intersection
batman emerges into the midst of the crowd weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles a mounted cop rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam drawn
by all the confusion
he rears the horse back turns it in a circle blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute the incoming cars
suddenly a wire wraps itself around his chest and arms
he looks down
he sees a batarang in the instant before a sudden jerk pulls him cleanly off his mount
batman climbs up on the hood of the nearest car vaults over to the next and the next then hops into the saddle of the mounted cops waiting horse
he digs in his heels maneuvering through traffic
eddie bullock and another plainclothesman are a few blocks off trying to get through the jam
their siren is on but the cars blocking their path have no room to pull over
bullock grabs the radio mike hell of a mess up here commissioner
well have to go in on foot
as they wait for a response they see a horse charging past in the opposite direction
on the back of the horse
gaping bullock nudges his partner who throws the car immediately into reverse
as they watch batman kicks the horses flanks and turns right toward gotham park
two red berets members of the order of the bat are on night patrol strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to the park
this is wack man
nothing ever happens around here anymore
the other red beret lets out a whoop of fear and yanks his partner out of the way
they tumble into a snowdrift as batmans horse vaults over the stone wall of the park and gallops past nearly trampling them in the process
by now squad cars are roaring into the park
sirens blare and red lights flash in the distance as the cop cars spread out along the winding roads that run through the park
batman reins the horse in suddenly as a black and white whips past on an access road just ahead of him no more than twenty yards away
he turns the horse in a circle
more red lights appear in the distance another contingent of squad cars has just entered from the opposite side of the park
its going to be tough getting out of here
then his eyes fall on the statue of his great grandfather two waynes on horseback not twenty feet apart
he thinks back to his earlier conversation with vicki and gets an inspiration
he rides past general wayne to the stone bridge which spans the little frozen creek
there he finds the drainage tunnel vicki described obscured by the wire mesh grate
this must be where the boy vigilante holes up
he dismounts ties his cape to the pommel of the horses saddle and sends it off with a slap
he pries the grate loose and crawls inside
a dank but cozy hideout warm steam hisses from a grate in the floor
rumbling sounds fill the little chamber as a subway train passes directly underneath
a little farther back theres an access shaft with a jacobs ladder leading to the train tracks below
poking around he finds a couple of cardboard boxes the boy vigilantes stash
the first contains tins of food plus various odds and ends
the seconds more in line with what he needs its full of old clothing
a train rumbles past underneath
bruce removes his cowl and sets about putting together a civilian disguise thatll get him out of the park
a wool hat and a long moth eaten topcoat perfect
as hes pulling them out of the box he spies something extremely odd its a costume a spangled red and green gymnasts outfit with a little yellow cape neatly folded
and in pristine condition
he removes it carefully from the box and holds it up in front of him
stitched on the vest is a single initial r in a black circle
he stares at the whole mystifying ensemble in complete befuddlement
the roar of the train subsides and he hears a scuffling someones in the tunnel with him he lowers the costume abruptly revealing dick the boy vigilante whos crouched in
front of him not three feet away
the kids just crawled up through the access shaft and hes not at all happy to see an intruder messing with his stuff its mine
he lunges furiously at bruce
the two of them tumble back into the grate at the tunnel entrance knocking it loose a police car streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds before bruce and
dick roll out into the snow still grappling
bruce flings the kid into the bridge abutment
dick lands hard when he looks up his eyes widen and a weird crooked smile comes to his face
out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent
the body armor the gold and black emblem on the breastplate and above it all the face of bruce wayne exposed to view
as a siren howls nearby bruce flattens himself against the bridge
like it or not his fate rests entirely in a strange little boys hands
the kid sizes up the situation immediately
he nods his head up and down
then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws it to bruce
bruce is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth
he pulls on the coat gives dick a nod of acknowledgement and starts to move off
bruce turns uncertainly
dick throws him his woolen ski cap
the kid giggles oddly uncontrollably
then he sprints off into the woods dancing leaping
as he disappears from view he lets out a shrill piercing almost feral shriek which is obviously intended to divert the cops
bruce makes haste in the opposite direction
bruces horse gallops through the trees the black bat cape still attached to its saddle and billowing behind it
two cops scanning the park
the caped horse charges past in front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the headlights
from a distance it looks like batman is still in the saddle
the cop at the wheel makes a sudden turn
a moment later he a man has just stepped out onto the road directly in the squad cars path a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen ski cap
obviously one of the homeless
a cop leans on the horn and shouts out the window dumb son of a bitch
the man bruce steps back out of the squad cars path
the cops take off in hot pursuit of a riderless horse
a doctors bag rests on the kitchen table
alfred in robe and slippers rummages inside it and comes up with an ace commissioner gordon called
he wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor in round the clock shifts to protect you from batman
bruce is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair
his shirt is open and hes holding his arms aloft while alfred wraps a full roll of adhesive tape around his battered ribs
whatd you tell him
i told him that since you were batman youd require no protection from batman
bruce makes a face how droll
alfred tears off the tape with a brisk yank and bruce lets out an involuntary yelp of jesus alfred
in future sir
i strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty story buildings
its just a few bruises
one bruise sir
which covers your entire body
bruce gets up stiffly and buttons his shirt in gingerly fashion while alfred packs his first aid gear in the doctors bag
im getting too old for this line of work
beat cops placed me at the scene of the crime that weird kid of vickis saw my face i shouldnt worry overmuch
i doubt the two of you move in the same circles
and i got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman sir such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming
in a lavishly appointed guest room on gothams upper east side or equivalent thereof we find a pair of plainclothes cops settled in for a stakeout rumpled topcoats thrown across
antique chairs french fry bags and greasy burger wrappings littering the carpet
high powered rifles propped against one wall
they peer through venetian blinds at an elegant old brownstone across the street
a uniformed cop also carrying a walkie talkie is keeping watch on the roof of the brownstone
he signals all clear to his counterpart watching from the house opposite
two more plainclothesmen are parked at the end of the block munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone
they spot a postman lugging his sack up the tree lined street on his way to the brownstone
one of the plainclothesmen picks up his radio mike mailmans coming
the postman marches up the front steps of the brownstone sorting through letters and packages
he hasnt even rung the bell when the door is opened by another cop who snatches the mail delivery from his hands and slams the door in his more cops
at least half a dozen are milling about inside unshaven ties loosened shirtsleeves rolled up
theyre in for the long haul
the first cop gives a handful of letters to a couple of colleagues then hands over a parcel wrapped in brown paper to a pair of bomb disposal experts
they carry it gingerly into the kitchen
into the midst of all this bustling activity strides commissioner gordon anything suspicious
in the parlor where all the shades are drawn two cops are examining each letter in turn holding them up to a light bulb creasing them carefully before slitting them
christmas cards and bills
he anxiously watches their progress
a voice calls from the kitchen
the bomb disposal boys have their equipment scattered all over the kitchen table
theyve slit the brown paper wrapping of the package exposing a round decorative its a fruitcake
he lifts the lid for gordon to have a look
have it analyzed
a bleary eyed elliott tiptree marches down the stairs carrying a pair of oversized suitcases
his wife and two kids are behind him all bundled up preparing to embark on an extended vacation
the cars here
tiptree fighting back tears embraces his wife for a long wordless moment
their little girl aged six tugs at mommys sleeve
i dont wanna go to grandmas
i wanna stay here with daddy
shes got a nice tree just like ours honey
daddyll be up as soon as he can
she doesnt even have cable
what about our presents
he gestures toward the gifts piled high around the tree in the parlor
ill bring em up with me
well open em when i get there
tiptree forces a smile for the kids
he clutches his wifes hand
sorry folks but wed better move along
tell your daddy goodbye
tearful hugs all around then a cadre of uniformed cops escort mrs
tiptree and the kids to the door
tiptree pulls gordon aside
theyll be safe wont they
as safe as we can make em
beat sternly it would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about
i told you
tiptree shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes
gordon is convinced hes holding something back
you have no idea what was in that box that provost had delivered from the bank
tiptree shakes his head wearily
gordon glowers as he turns to go
all right mr
tiptree wanders listlessly into the living room pulls back the drapes and watches as his wife and kids ride off in a convoy of police cars
one of the cops tries to pull him away from the window but he refuses to move
until a phone rings
everyone jumps at once
a technician hits a switch on a loudspeaker and tape recorder assembly then gestures for tiptree to pick up the receiver
listen weve got a chance to grab a good sized block of atlantic teledyne at twenty six and an eighth the cops heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment
not today andy
lets talk after new years
tiptree hangs up and starts to bawl right there in the middle of the room
the cops turn away in sympathetic embarrassment as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff jolt
wallowing in despair tiptree sits at an antique secretary composing a letter
he takes a long pull on a glass of scotch signs his name and inserts the letter into an envelope
he opens the desk drawer takes a long look at a automatic stashed inside then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope
he addresses it to bruce wayne
a moment later he hears a noise at the window tink tink tink
he peers through the blinds and sees a carrier pigeon on the ledge outside pecking at the glass asking to come in
he raises the window and the pigeon hops fearlessly inside onto the sill
the bird well trained struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny capsule from its leg and removes a folded note
scrawled across it is a handwritten message he opens the note and begins to read as the pigeon takes wing
bruce is at his desk examining the morning editions
a banner head line shrieks bat attack panics gotham square j
harrison provost leaves distinguished legacy he hears a visitor arriving in the entry hall
he gets up
bruce ambles out and sees selina whos just arrived doing her patetented thing on alfred
english accents are so stimulating beat you have the most beautiful silver hair
alfred stammers as she reaches up to stroke his hair
hes about to break into a sweat
hes eminently relieved when she turns and sees selina cont
what are you doing here
alfred affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as selina slinks over and takes bruce by the arm
shes on him like a barnacle
i wanted to see your things remember
and i got tired of waiting for you to call me back
gesturing toward alfred hes adorable
how long have you had him
bruce leads selina down a hallway to the armory
he glances back over his shoulder and sees alfred peering snoopily around the corner
you heard about harry provost
its incredibly awful
it got me a little worried
sidling up closer i hate to think of something happening to you same here
its odd though
danger the thought of suddenly dying in a weird way it gets you sort of
dont you think
bruce cocks an eyebrow at her
everything gets her sort of aroused
selina beams at the fantastic collection of armored gear and exotic weapons
shes like a kid in a toy shop
bruce this is incredible indicating a suit of armor malaysian
sarawak warrior caste
its like everything in here is another little piece of your mind
i was right about you
turning to face him promise okay
promise youll show me every inch of this place
alfred is at a printer scanning page after page of computer printout
he delivers his findings to bruce whos seated at a nearby terminal scanning data and tapping away at the keyboard
the police have no files whatsoever on selina kyle
what exactly are you her credit card records
looking up every major art theft in the last five years shes been on the scene or close to it
you mean shes some sort of collector
cat burglar or could be
museum curator authenticator shes got the perfect cover for it
beat what would she want with that stupid raven
thats what the catwoman took from provost
a little raven statuette about so big
shaking his head but it couldnt have been that valuable
he continues to scan the screen
alfred is suddenly lost in thought
how very odd
long pause im sure its nothing but what alfred
your father had a raven sir
a small statue of the very sort you describe
it used to sit on his desk
this piques bruces interest
he swivels around in his chair and stares directly up at alfred
what happened to it
after your fathers
tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it
as a keepsake
i saw no harm
shrugging that was thirty years ago
wait a minute
your friend elliotts father
tiptree has an oversized suitcase open on the bed
its empty except for the balled up wads of newspaper which hes stuffing inside it
his head turns suddenly at the sound of the doorbell
tiptree emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister into the entryway below
standing there is an unexpected visitor bruce wayne holding his arms aloft while a battery of cops pat him down
what are you looking for batarangs
come on up
to the cops i want to talk to mr
the cops look on suspiciously as bruce ascends the stairs
tiptree lets bruce inside and shuts the door behind him
bruce hands him a gift box
i brought you a christmas present
sorry about the wrapping the police made me open it
tiptree opens the box and pulls out a diamond studded tie clasp
he looks up at bruce with an odd mixture of bewilderment and gratitude
bruce nods for him to try it on and he obliges
im afraid i dont have anything for you
i think you may have something that belonged to my father
he stares at bruce astonished
his head sinks into his hands
itll all be over tomorrow
one way or another itll all be over
looking up despondent ive decided bruce
im gonna give him the last two ravens
hes already got the others
what are you talking about
i dont know how he found out but tiptree reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a drink but bruce angrily knocks the glass out of his
its time you told me whats going on here didnt you ever wonder where it came from bruce
all the privilege all the power all the money beat the ravens are a
a kind of map bruce
the key to an incredibly vast fortune
the cobblestone streets of th century gotham
a massive explosion blows open one wall of a municipal building and total chaos erupts fires starting bystanders screaming police rushing to the scene
in the gotham city treasury was looted
it was a fantastic operation perfect military precision
the robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion
a horse drawn cart weighted down with gold bricks careens around a corner
atop it are two men in masks firing a gatling gun into the crowd
police and onlookers tumble to the pavement shot dead as another cart emerges from the wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite direction
city officials in a boardroom trading papers back and forth arguing furiously with five calm distinguished looking gents one of whom is the bushy bearded civil war hero gen
oliver the city was going under
until five rich men stepped in to bail it out
in exchange they took the land rights the mineral rights the service contracts the five families
they bought gotham city carved it up and ran it into the ground
in five years they were rich beyond imagining
pause weve just been following in their footsteps
and in all this time no ones ever suspected that they were the ones behind the robbery
the five patriarchs in front of a roaring fireplace at wayne manor raising a celebratory toast
camera pans over to a nearby table on it rest five raven statuettes
they had five ravens made
five ravens which combined would reveal the location of the treasure theyd stolen
beat but they never touched it
they never needed to
its still there to this day
the ravens and the secret have been passed down through generations
father to son
shaking his head your father died before he could tell you
so they stole his piece of the puzzle
ive got it bruce and im going to hand it over
hes right you know
weve all been feeding feeding on the soul of gotham
bruce stares at him stony faced
theres one part of the story that doesnt quite add up
i dont believe you elliott
my father was a decent man an honorable man
he would never have taken part in a scheme like this
it wasnt his doing bruce
it was that doesnt matter if he knew that his fortune was based on a crime a crime against the city
violently reputation or not he wouldve tried to christ bruce
do you want me to spell it out for you
bruce backs off
an awful shiver of anticipation runs down his spine
he was a decent man
he was an honorable man
thats why they had him killed camera zeroes in on bruces horrified face as we get a quick almost subliminal glimpses of bruces primal trauma a mugger snatching at his
thomas wayne lunging at him
the young jack napier firing at thomas
pearls showering down on the rain drenched sidewalk
a second bullet felling his mother and finally young bruce himself face wracked with pain and grief an expression which perfectly matches the one which the adult bruce is wearing
as he relives it all thirty years later
staggered and glassy eyed he stares off into space as tiptree finishes his tale
they killed him
to protect their secret and now the bills come due
now the bills come due
the wrought iron gate outside bruces vast estate and beyond it wayne manor itself rising bold and stately against the setting sun
a county sheriffs car cruises past
bruce lies motionless on his bed
scattered about him are scrapbooks family photos and yellowed newspaper clippings which describe the murder of his parents
disoriented he gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings which no longer seem quite so familiar
he folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at the ceiling inert as if the very weight of his heritage is crushing him down
somewhere a phone rings
he makes no move to answer it
vickis at the kitchen table drinking coffee
alfred whos in his apron preparing dinner picks up the ringing phone
thank you yes everythings fine
ill expect your next call in an hour
hanging up to vicki the police are becoming an awful nuisance
i feel so awful for him alfred
there must be something we can do
i realized long ago that there are places in mr
waynes heart which no one will ever penetrate or share
pause he loves you miss vale
but in certain ways he will always be alone
thanks for the testimonial
alfred turns and sees bruce standing in the doorway staring at him
he starts to say something but thinks better of it
he returns to his dinner preparations as bruce sits down across from vicki
she extends a hand and he takes it making a visible effort to hold himself together
tiptrees planning some kind of rendezvous with batman
i think batman ought to be there when it happens
i see sir
when shall we expect you back
get your cap
its late and the house is dark as tiptree treeds silently downstairs carrying an oversized suitcase
the lights are on in the kitchen where the cops are playing poker and watching christmas tree lights twinkle in the darkness
tiptree kneels beside the tree and digs around among the packages
he pulls out an oblong gift box with a tag addressed to daddy from with a glance back at the kitchen he soundlessly unwraps the package and opens it to
reveal a matched set of raven statuettes
he transfers them to the big suitcase then slinks into the hallway
the two stakeout cops are chuckling at a charlie brown christmas special on a portable tv
one of them glances out the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the brownstone suitcase in hand
shit thats tiptree
the cop grabs for his walkie talkie
tiptree is halfway down the block when two cops burst out of the brownstone
what the hell are you headlights flash on as the surveillance car revs its engine
tiptree breaks into a run and the cops from the brownstone follow suit
at the end of the block he vanishes down a a violinist is panhandling outside the token booth as the cops come racing down the stairs
the cops trip over his open violin case scattering small change across the conrete floor
they flash their badges at the booth and vault over the just in time to see tiptree with his suitcase scuttling down a stairway which leads to the train platform
tiptree steps onto an express train
the doors slide shut behind him and the hapless cops curse under their breath as he rolls off
weve gotta get back to the radio
tiptree takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively
being fabulously rich bes probably ridden the subway twice in his life and at this time of night every face in the sparsely populated car looks vaguely menacing
derelicts prostitutes teen gang members all of them eye this well heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor
an odd gaunt figure enters at the end of the car
its a deafmute
he shambles down the aisle passing out little white cards
one side is a guide to international sign language
the other reads two young toughs take a card and tear it in half chuckling shining the deafmute on
a hooker the heart of gold type stuffs a buck in his tin cup
he reaches tiptree and extends a card tiptree ignores him refusing to make eye contact but the deafmute shoves the card insistently into his face
now tiptree looks up
this card bears a personalized message tiptrees eyes widen
the deafmute who is in fact frick glowers down and holds out his cup
tiptree digs in his pocket the smallest bill hes got is a twenty but he hands it over anyway
smiling at this act of generosity frick moves on to the next car
tiptree stares down tremulously at the card
he fidgets with his tie clasp the one bruce gave him earlier
tight on a hand held electronic tracing device
a small blip moves across a shifting grid not unlike a radar screen
bruce is in the back of the limo eyeing the tracer intently
alfreds up front at the wheel
according to this hes directly below us
the subway sir
take a right
its slightly more crowded here in the hub of gotham
tiptree emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of transit cops thirty or forty feet away speaking into walkie talkies as they scan the crowd
sticking close to the tracks he turns swiftly toward the nearest stairway blending in with the crowd trying to hold the suitcase out of view
tiptree is running for the b train just as the doors begin to close
he manages to thrust the suitcase inside but the doors slide shut on his hand and he drops it
he stands there on the platform his face turning bone white as the train lurches forward
the train stops and the doors hiss open again
tiptree clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations
as the train pulls out a couple of rough looking but helpful street types show him to a seat and hand him his precious suitcase
he sits there panting
moments later a deafmute enters the car
tiptree does a take its the exact same guy who was riding the other line
of course he doesnt know about fricks malignant twin having changed trains twice more since we left him tiptree debarks at a deserted local stop
the station is empty except for one other passenger whos gotten off here as well a woman in a long fur coat
tiptree watches as she approaches on her way to the stairwell stilleto heels clicking across the floor
theres something familiar about her but shes wearing a big broad brimmed hat and she tilts it down as she passes obscuring her face
it is of course selina
tiptree stands there expectantly with his suitcase awaiting further instructions
they arent long in coming
a black mynah bird swoops out of the tunnel lands on the platform and struts in front of him
the bird flutters its wings and takes off again into the tunnel
tiptree stares after it in disbelief
then the bird caws again its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of the tunnel tiptree clambers over the edge of the platform dropping awkwardly to the tracks below
suitcase in hand he begins to walk
alfred tearing up the streets as bruce consults his tracer
hes slowed down
looks like hes under the park
how do you propose to get down there sir
we cant have batman strolling up to buy a token
i know another way in
beat step on it
theyre down there waiting for him
alfred turns the limo hard right into gotham park past the statue of general wayne atop his horse
a local train roars by filling the screen
when it passes we see tiptree with his suitcase walking along the express tracks at the far wall of the tunnel more frightened with each step
its dark and eerie down here in the tunnels the only illumination comes from dim lanterns spaced at fifty foot intervals
he sees the lights of an express train behind him and quickly switches to the local tracks
the train rumbles past with a deafening blare and the car lights briefly illuminate his surroundings
tiptree glances over at the inside wall of the tunnel
where he sees huddled in an alcove just off the tracks a small gathering of homeless people
theyve set up camp down here in the tunnels away from the elements
surrounded by bags full of old clothes dining on canned food and cheap wine they stare curiously at the well heeled stranger with the suitcase whos invaded their domain
tiptree eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace hastening down the tunnel
the homeless make no move to follow with one exception
a kid thirteen or fourteen in a ratty topcoat climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively as tiptree vanishes into the shadows
his face is familiar
its dick the boy vigilante from the park
in this stretch of the tunnel the lanterns dont seem to be working and the mynah is completely invisible
when he comes to a fork in the tracks he has to wait for the sound of the birds shrill voice to guide him tiptree stumbles ahead blindly in the
he trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase
as hes getting to his feet a flashlight shines directly in his face
the mynah bird flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an unseen figure
tiptree cowers and squints trying to make him out but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open umbrella
ive done everything you said
open the case
tiptree lifts the lid revealirig two ravens in the suitcase
a cackling laugh echoes in the darkness
the other one is bruce waynes
trembling he doesnt know anything about this
youve got what you want
theres no need to thank you mr
you may go
he backs away from the suitcase warily
you wont well certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration
shielding his eyes youre not batman
im his brother in law birdman
now move out tiptree marches slowly down the tracks toward camera silhouetted in the flashlight beam
the beam shifts slightly as the penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light down and we catch sight of the catwoman perched on a steel cross girder above
the rails her chrome steel talons glinting as she waits for tiptree to pass underneath
looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross girder
he slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat and brings up his
automatic firing three quick shots at the penguin
the shots ricochet loudly off the umbrella which happens to be a bulletproof job
the penguin lifts his brolly fire spits out of the shaft and tiptree staggers backward
shot in the chest
he spins into a steel upright and topples face forward onto the electrified third rail frying himself in a shower of sparks
the smoke is still clearing when the catwoman drops to the tracks
the penguin rushes to her side to check tiptree for signs of life
that idiot another six feet so sorry to spoil your fun he brought two ravens
weve got a complete set
theyre in the suitcase an awful rumbling fills the tunnel
they see the lights of a train approaching on the center track the same one theyre standing on the one tiptrees body is slumped across
the penguins first impulse is to run back toward the inner track where the ravens lie but the catwoman is trying to drag tiptree out of the trains path
they pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the train arrives
they stand against the outer wall waiting for the train to pass
and when it does they see dick the boy vigilante standing on the inner track directly across from them
holding the suitcase
the kid takes off like a shot
the catwoman and the penguin exchange quick looks of utter disbelief and bolt after dick
the bulky suitcase is slowing his progress
he looks back over his shoulder although the stubby legged penguin has fallen well behind the catwoman is gaining fast
watching in the light from the train as the two costumed figures grapple in the distance
he races back toward the scene of the melee
where batman and the catwoman are trading punches blow for blow
he knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook and she sprawls on the track dazed and bleeding
she lifts a hand no mas he looks back toward the suitcase on the center track
before he can make a move toward it he spots another train approaching on the outer tracks right on the heels of the last one
he crouches to pull the catwomans limp frame out of its path
but as he does so a horn blares and a second train comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite direction now hes got trains approaching on either side
and theres no place to go the catwoman is groggily getting to her feet
he lunges at her thrusts her backward toward an alcove in the outer tunnel wall
the outer train is already speeding past obscuring batman and the catwoman from view
the center train is bearing down fast
a split second before it arrives dicks hand snatches the suitcase out of its path and he tumbles to safety on the innermost local track
he stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite directions
he doesnt know if batman is alive or dead
batman and catwoman are flattened in the tiny alcove theres not two inches of breathing space between them and the passing train
shes come around now and shes flailing and clawing at him trying to push him out
her hand closes around his utility belt
as they struggle she hits the trigger of a small gas cylinder
its bruces hydraulic batwing device the one that saved him when he fell off the roof
but this time the results are altogether different
he gasps in horror as the wings of his cape stiffen and inflate forcing him away from the wall of his outer wing strikes the train flapping wildly against the
passing cars snagging finally on the ralling of the rearmost car and batman is suddenly ripped out of the alcove dragged off down the tracks by the passing train
hes still there with the suitcase waiting apprehensively to see whats become of batman
finally the center train passes and he sees catwoman standing alone in the alcove smiling at him advancing menacingly
dick turns to run
a gunshot rings out and the last thing he sees as he slumps to the tracks is a whiff of smoke pluming from the shaft of the penguins umbrella
the penguins panting soaked with sweat
the catwoman snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him
she peers off into the tunnels after batman exhilarated
god did you see him
isnt he hot havent you got anything else to think about
mopping sweat from his brow im hot
that was exhausting no pain no gain
suck it up
were not out of here yet
she sprints off down the tracks
squawking he waddles along behind her as fast as his fat little legs will carry him
as they vanish into the darkness the camera tracks back past dick who lies unconscious on the tracks bleeding heavily from his shoulder wound deeper into the maze of arriving
finally on the ragged black figure of batman as he staggers forth from the shadows dazed and bloody
he scans the tunnel finding no trace of his enemies and then his gaze falls on dick
he limps over and kneels at the boys side cradling his head protectively staring helplessly into the blackness all around him
the stark outlines of the city bathed in moonlight
camera zeroes in on the glowing ornamental dome of city hall
a pentagonal balcony girds the interior of the dome
we tilt down to ground level where two aged security guards lie sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor fatally shot
the penguin closes his gun umbrella and waddles across the atrium of city hall past a statue of blind justice to a point directly under the dome
there encased in a plexiglass case is a scale model of gotham city circa when city hall was erected
he shouts up the catwoman frick and frack are already up on the balcony
lining its periphery are various display cases of historical interest and positioned along the wall at each point of the pentagon are five arched niches each one containing a bronze
the patriarchs of gothams five families
the catwoman and co
go to work quickly
she removes the five ravens from a gunny sack as frick and frack work their way around the balcony yanking the busts from their recessed bases
she follows along behind them replacing each bust with a raven
when theyre done the penguin yells up now
give each raven a quarter turn
his pals in the dome oblige twisting each raven in its recessed socket in quick succession
the moment of maximum tension
he stands there frothing at the mouth with anticipation
seconds tick off and nothing happens
what happens now
i dont know
he looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him from above
he really doesnt know whats supposed to happen next
suspecting the worst he throws his umbrella to the floor and begins stamping about in a rage sputtering flapping his arms like wings
weve been tricked
its a hoax
its a he shuts up suddenly at the sound of a loud chunk
somewhere behind him ancient gears are beginning to grind
he spins and stares at the scale model of gotham in its plexiglass case
the city model is trembling slightly
as he watches the dome of the miniature city hall in the dead center of the model city pops off on a hinge
a metal strongbox rises into view
the catwoman frick and frack stare down at the little metal box
the penguin is already clambering atop the plexiglass case of the model smashing at it with his umbrella trying to get at the box
thats the treasure
its a map she affixes a rope to the balcony railing and climbs over
the plexiglass case finally shatters and the penguin falls through landing atop gotham city
he snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet bestriding the city like a colossus
hes climbing down off the tabletop when the catwoman on her rope touches down behind him
he hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box
he opens it and stares greedily at the contents a map and a bunch of old crumbling photos
the catwoman creeps over to his side bruce wayne so he doesnt know a thing about the treasure eh
handing her the map look at this
its right under wayne manor its been there all along now the catwoman snatches at the photos
they show progressively closer views of ancient gnarled stalactites an odd distinctive subterranean rock formation
looks like some kind of cave tight on the face of dick
he lies unconscious in a big soft frilly bed a womans hand wipes his feverish brow with a damp cloth he moans slightly
his eyes snap open suddenly
he sits bolt upright with a yelp
no no dont try to get up youre hurt
he pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway
his shoulder is bandaged his arm in a sling
the pajamas hes wearing are three sizes too large
he paces about staring at his unfamiliar surroundings
its all right
you can stay here as long as you need to
i dont belong here
you cant keep me here
vaguely unnerved he goes to a window pulls back the shades looks out at the grounds
its dick isnt it
or do you prefer richard
he stares at her as if shes nuts
vicki opens a closet door all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside including the red and green gymnasts suit with the r insigne on the breast
r for richard right
see all your things are here
staring at the costume what is it some kind of gymnasts outfit
its none of your business
what is this some kind of home
no not that kind
theres a swimming pool tennis court you can have anything you want
lady youre rich
how the hell would you know what want
vicki tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder
he bats it away pushes her aside and turns toward the door in agitation im not staying
you cant make me and sees bruce standing in the doorway looking at him
i can make you
dick freezes as if bruces mere presence has mesmerized him
the hint of a smile plays across his face ohhhhh
im in batmans house
wanna go at it
no response look kid like it or not youre my guest and long as youre here you might as well enjoy it
alfred appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a bedside table
dick edges toward it and sits down
he waits for alfred to leave and then tucks in hungrily eyeing bruce all the while
will you two be okay in here
vicki nods yes
bruce backs out of the room
bruce pulls the door shut
alfred follows him down the hall
what do you propose to do with him sir
keep him in the room for the rest of his life
i dont know alfred
ive got other stuff to worry about
the child is hurt sir
at the very least we should attempt to locate his parents
he hasnt got any parents
how do you know that sir
bruce turns and fixes alfred with a steely gaze
the phone rings as bruce starts down the long stairway
alfred picks up a hallway extension
he covers the mouthpiece sir its miss kyle
bruce rushes back upstairs to take the call
arctic birds chirping all around in the penguin pool room
a snow owl struts across the penguins desk as selina makes a phone call with the penguin frick and frack hovering over her
tall dark and handsome
are we still on for tonight
he covers the receiver and stares intensely at alfred
on his look we christmas carols playing
vickis got dick helping her trim the tree
bruce is getting dressed for his date with selina
is this necessary sir
it is christmas eve
bruce reaches for his utility belt
he empties the contents of one packet onto a dresser a dozen tiny red glassine capsules
he scoops up a handful of the capsules and deposits them in his jacket pocket
stuffll knock out a moose much less a cat
i dont like to see you going out on a date
shell be ready for batman but not for me turning to go its the only way alfred
ive got to take her out tonight
dick watches from the front parlor as vicki meets bruce at the bottom of the stairs
the two of them exchange a few brief words he embraces her strokes her hair gently then glumly sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door
vicki reenters the parlor trying to force an expression of cheer as dick turns discreetly away
this is one weird household hes landed in
soft music plays in the background as selina preens in front of a vanity doing her eye makeup taking great pleasure in her own reflection
shes looking especially sultry tonight in a glittering low cut gown
she lowers one shoulder strap and strikes a pose in the mirror better
she runs a hand through her hair tousling it for that recently ravished look
the doorbell rings and by the time selina crosses over to answer it shes lowered the other strap as well which means she has to hold up the top of
her dress with one hand
bruce finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in
she pulls up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly youre early
im afraid im not quite dressed
bruce enters and takes a long look around
its a big open loft only partly finished filled with egyptian artifacts
the walls feature modern paintings with cat motifs
the finished section is dominated by a huge bed on a raised platform three or four cats are walking around on it yowling at bruce
selina chuckles as he scopes it all out
if youre looking for my bondage gear its at the cleaners
ive been a bad girl this year
bruce takes a seat on the sofa while selina goes to a nearby wet bar
im surprised you kept this date
i thought you wouldve lost interest by now
what makes you say that
youve got what you want dont you
i do now smiling weve had this date for a long long time
with that she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in to kiss him a long slow wet kiss
but bruce seems strangely unresponsive
she breaks free and gives him a funny look
how much is it going to cost me
to get the ravens back
he watches her closely for a reaction
selinas shocked but she conceals it well chuckling in apparent confusion
youre the oddest man ive ever met
moving in on him lets talk later bruce
ive got kind of a short fuse
bruce tenses slightly as she kisses him again leaving a crimson lipstick smear on his cheek
she works her way downward kissing him around his neck and throat
his hand reaches into his jacket pocket
he withdraws a tiny glassine capsule
but before he can use it he jerks back suddenly pushes her away
his free hand goes to his neck where a thin trickle of blood is oozing from between two bright red lipstick lips
shes bitten him
now she shushes him reaches over to the tiny wound and massages it gently with one hand
did i hurt you
just relax youll start to enjoy it
bruce pulls away again
his eyes are strangely glazed
he tries to speak but his tongue feels thick and swollen
bruce you look faint
it must be the cats
bruce stands suddenly
its as if hes mired in a slo mo nightmare
his legs give way beneath him and he topples to the floor inert
his fingers go slack and the capsule rolls out he tries to reach into his pocket but his arm wont seem to work
selinas cat hecate strolls across his prostrate form purring and stretching
a worms eye view selina looms over him with a predatory smile on her face shifting in and out of focus
what di what did you d she runs a finger across her lips and holds it up bright red
i guess ive
gotten under your skin
his hand goes to the bite on his neck and he realizes selinas lipstick is spiked with a fast acting paralytic drug
he writhes helplessly on the carpet his whole body gradually going slack
the penguin frick and frack stroll through the doorway and stand over him all laughing
a county sheriffs car cruises past the manor right on schedule
alfred on the telephone checking in with the county sheriffs boys
everythings fine thank you
well talk in an hour
behind him vicki is waiting up for bruce
shes curled up on the sofa reading a book throwing the occasional anxious glance at a big grandfather clock which strikes eleven oclock
dick opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall
hes got all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed he opens a window and throws the bundle outside
theres a nice strong tree branch some ten or twelve feet from the window just close enough that he should be able to make it
he climbs up onto the windowsill crouches and springs
a car full of trouble selina wearing a fur coat over her catwoman garb at the wheel the penguin riding shotgun and frick in the back seat next to bruce
whos semi conscious and stone limp
the car idles outside the wrought iron gates of wayne manor
try his mag card
frick digs in bruces pockets and finds a bunch of red look at this
hes a pillhead
now frick finds a mag striped card and inserts it into an electronic device at the edge of the drive
the gates magically part
theres a large van just behind the car driven by frack and carrying two random goons
both vehicles pull in before the gates slide shut
vicki hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen announcing what should be bruces arrival
she heaves a huge sigh of relief then rushes to the door and flings it open
she sees bruce standing there and her face lights up
am i glad to to her horror bruce topples forward and lands on the floor flat as a board
vicki shrieks as the penguin enters throwing his arms wide
dick has shimmied down to a lower branch
he lets go and drops to the snow wincing his shoulder wound is bleeding again
as he grabs his bundle he hears raucous laughter coming from around the house
he races over to peer around the corner
he sees the two cars out front
he sees the last of the goon squad barging in through the front door
his face full of confusion and conflict he moves to a window
in the entry hall he sees bruce on the floor and vicki surrounded by gun toting intruders
one of them grabs her and twists her arm behind her back
vicki shrieking and struggling as she stares down at bruce
what did you do to him
selina gives her a catty little smile
first time jitters i guess
everything was going great and then
he just went limp as a noodle
drawn by the commotion alfred rushes down the stairs to the entry hall pulling a robe around him
he freezes in his tracks when he sees frick dragging vicki into the front parlor holding a gun to her head
youd be the butler
why dont you come on down and attend to your guests
alfred hesitates until the penguin pulls a gun on him he marches down the stairs slowly pausing by bruces prostrate form
you know how it is
some guys just cant hold their egg nog
the penguin marches alfred in where the rest of the gangs already assembled
frick throws vicki down roughly on a sofa just next to the christmas tree while the goons drag bruce inside
i should explain the occasion of our visit
theres a treasure underneath this house and i dont plan to leave until you tell me how to find it
now whos going to talk miss vale
i dont know what youre talking about
the cave under the house
how do i get there
the penguin gestures
frick holds the gun to her head
i dont know
i swear i would tell you turning to alfred then maybe youd like to tell me
youre no more than a common thief
wrong you old idiot
i happen to be a very un common thief
beat are you going to tell me or does miss vale get an early present this year
frick cocks the gun
vicki stares aghast at alfred who scans the room weighing his options
trembling he shuts his eyes i
then go ahead mr
decorate the tree fricks finger tightens on the trigger
alfred starts to blurt something out
but a split second before he can speak wait
crossing over to vicki we dont know how to get down there yet
we may need her when bruce wakes up
the penguin sighs and waves frick off
alfred and vicki heave simultaneous sighs of relief
he throws her a shamefaced look but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement you made the right play
besides i want this one for myself
im going to give her a brand new face for christmas
the penguin throws a look at bruce whos still out cold on the floor
he turns to frick and frack
why dont you two tie up our host
alfred sits beside vicki while selina wanders off to tour the premises
frick and frack meanwhile drag bruce into a back parlor which opens off the room theyre in
they dump bruce face down on a sofa then rip the telephone cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands and feet
still holding his gun on vicki and alfred he wanders about the room admiring the various furnishings and expensive objects its all so plush and tasteful isnt it
just the sort of setting in which ive always imagined myself
alfred on the sofa cant resist letting out a snort of disgust
you think im vulgar
you think im
nouveau i think youre a dirty little man with a the penguin silences him by sweeping one arm across a tabletop sending a bunch of priceless china figurines crashing to
he points to alfred as frick and frack reappear
see boys thats old money talking
after a while they actually start to believe theyve earned all this
smirking i dont mind
someday ill be old money too when the statute of limitations runs out
guess what i just found
face full of anticipation he turns just in time to see selina returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of
the penguin is crestfallen but that doesnt stop him from cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet
selina graciously serves vicki and alfred who munch away with limited enthusiasm
lets spread out and see what we can find
to frick and frack you two keep an eye on our friends here
give me a yell the minute wayne comes to
frick and frack post themselves at the doors to the front parlor as selina the penguin and the goons fan out through the house
camera tracks with them as they move past bruce and in a quick closeup we see his eyes open his hands struggling against his bonds
quick glimpses of the intruders enacting their depredations as they search for the entrance to the cave
selina and the penguin are flinging open doors moving clocks looking for secret panels as they go they systematically tear the house apart smashing bruces possessions ripping paintings out of
meanwhile the two goons are outside prowling around the grounds looking for an exterior entrance and back in the parlor frick and frack are keeping their guns trained on alfred
camera tracks down a long empty hallway arriving at a locked door with curtained off glass panels
suddenly an elbow smashes through the glass a hand reaches inside and fumbles for the lock frick and frack start at the sound of a security alarm blaring from the
vicki looks at alfred
better check it out
frick stays behind as frack rushes out into the entryway and down a long hall to the kitchen
he tosses a glance back at vicki and alfred then steps out into the entryway himself
what is it
whats going on
vicki and alfred look into the back parlor
dick grayson has sneaked in behind the sofa and hes busy sawing away at bruces bonds with a letter opener
both of them stiffen simultaneously if frick steps back inside hell have a clear view of dick and bruce
frack has opened a panel on the kitchen wall revealing the security system from which the alarm emanates
a red light is blinking indicating dicks break in
frack throws switches frantically trying to kill the sound
finally he succeeds and shouts some kind of security system dicks gotten bruce free but bruce still under the effects of the drug isnt much use
he tries to get off the sofa and crumples in a heap
can you move man
library got to get me to the library dick slings an arm around bruce and drags him to a door opening onto the hallway
theyre just about to step outside when frack comes marching back on his way from the kitchen
faces wracked with utter desperate tension as they watch the situation develop
frick and frack conferring ignoring vicki and alfred for the moment
by now the penguin is waddling in from a hallway what is that ungodly racket
a security alarm
it went off in the kitchen
is someone in here
he struts over to huddle with his cronies
bruce and dick are still poised in the doorway
it looks bad
alfred looks at bruce and dick then at frick and frack bickering with the penguin in the entryway
he pats vickis knee gestures for her to keep her seat and lunges at frick making a play for his gun
a moment of confusion ensues giving dick and bruce just enough time to dart out into the hallway duck around a corner and vanish but alfred is a frail old
gent and he cant keep it up for long a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor
frick instinctively pulls the trigger and shoots him at point blank range
vicki rushes into the hallway screaming crying
the rooms a mess books all over the floor
the groggy bruce props himself up against his desk
he manages to pull the bottom drawer open gropes frantically for the secret switch
ill go back
get down there
to his amazement the sectional bookcase is swinging open revealing the secret passage to the batcave
we will all be pleased to know that alfred has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm
vicki is on her knees beside him the penguin is watching them with utter contempt
what an extraordinarily stupid thing to do
help me with him
the penguin rolls his eyes and orders frick and frack to give vicki a hand without him
they carry him into the parlor lay him out on the sofa
vicki reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the penguin pulls frack aside
you and i had better check the ground floor and see whats going on
frick do you think youll be able to manage this pair
that does relieve my mind he turns glances into the back parlor and sees a pile of cut cords on the love seat
the blood drains out of his face
wheres wayne dick has just entered another world and hes looking around him in pure unalloyed amazement
bruce is fumbling with a packet on a spare utility belt he shakes out a fistful of pills and swallows them dry
then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping switches
they blink on one by one dick moves up behind bruce and looks on dazzled
the screen shows the penguin in a sun room shouting to his two armed goons through a pair of french doors
check the grounds
the shape hes in he cant have gotten far
he turns to his main control panel reaches for a switch and waits
the two goons outside with guns and flashlights roaming cautiously around the grounds
they turn suddenly as corrugated steel security panels slam into place over every ground floor door and window in wayne manor
the penguin sees the same thing happening only from inside
he listens helplessly as his goons pound on the steel panels from outside
its just occurred to him that hes trapped in here
dick is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of wayne manor
bruce shouts up to him from the control console down below
as soon as he gets to the east wing
wait for my signal
you know what to do
dick nods yes and bolts off
vicki and alfred are still sitting at gunpoint
with the commotion going on all around them frick is getting itchy fingered
suddenly the stereo begins blaring at top volwne santa bring my baby back to me
frick turns and stares at it in confusion goes over to fiddle with the controls and suddenly bruces voice is coming through the loudspeakers
filter shes off the sofa like a shot diving for the entry hall
frick turns and takes aim but before he can squeeze the trigger dicks come out of nowhere to high kick him in the face
the shot goes wild and the two of them tumble into the christmas tree knocking it over
vicki hits the floor of the entry hall
huge oaken sliding doors are already slamming shut behind her
the same thing is happening all down the hall the east wing of the house is sealing itself off
dick cartwheels across the carpet catching frick high on the chest and ramming him backward into the hearth
before frick can regain his balance dicks beaned him across the back of the skull with a fireplace poker
he bends and picks up fricks gun which he tosses to alfred whos been watching all this with some fascination from the sofa
you might need it
thank you master dick
bravo vicki has made it to the wall phone
she cant seem to get a dial tone do you really think were that stupid
vicki turns and realizes to her horror that the voice is selinas
i tawt i taw a puddy tat
with that she raises a hand and her claws pop out
vicki turns grabs a carving knife from a wooden block but before she can do anything with it a whip cracks and wraps around her wrist jerking the knife loose
selina tugs on the other end reeling her closer
you know ive got a great recipe for sliced bitch vicki lunges forward suddenly causing the whip to slacken and throwing selina off balance into the center island
while theyre tangled up vicki grabs a meat cleaver and tries to bring it down on selina but selina rolls effortlessly out of the way and returns the favor swiping
at vicki with her claws
vicki brings a calphalon skillet up just in time to block the blow clang
vicki sweeps her arm across the countertop showering selina with knives and appliances
it buys her enough time to make for the door but selina comes flying after her
another downswipe with the claws but vicki shoves a butchers block into selinas path and her talons wedge a half inch deep in the wood
vicki rushes out while shes trying to pry herself loose
selina enters but finds no trace of vicki
i love a good old fashioned catfight but this is pissing me off
vicki charges out from behind a sideboard pushing a wheeled cocktail cart before her
it slams full force into selina who lands on her back on the great long dining table
vicki is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up
vicki races up the stairs
she has a good lead but selina makes up the difference in a hurry
she takes the stairway in three giant bounds reaches the landing just as vicki ducks down the hall and into a bedroom slamming the door behind her and locking it
here kitty kitty kitty
here kitty kitty
she kicks the door open
selina enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door behind her
vicki has opened a pair of french doors leading to a balcony but its too long a drop
she stands there paralyzed as selina advances
so this is where you earn your keep
she grabs vicki holds her out at arms length and shoves her roughly back onto the bed
vicki flails wildly as selina kneels atop her
selinas claws shred vickis blouse revealing a frilly section of bra mmm
fredericks of gotham
she plants a talon against vickis sternum and rakes it downward drawing a red stripe on the exposed flesh of vickis belly
now vicki just loses it
she begins to shriek uncontrollably
not so loud honey
the neighborsll get the wrong idea
laughing santas coming
time for all good girls to go to sleep
she raises her claw hand and prepares to slash down at vickis neck
but an instant before she can strike vicki goes wide eyed and shuts up
a black shadow falls across the moonlit bed
selina tenses as a black gloved hand grabs a fistful of her hair miss me angel
he yanks her bodily off the bed
before she knows whats happening he delivers a powerhouse uppercut
she flies into the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges
batman steps out after selina whos only now picking herself up
okay lets do it huh
you and me
all the way this time
she hisses and jumps him
they grapple a quick flurry of fists and he knocks her ass over teakettle down the long stairway
she gets to her feet limping and darts around a corner
batman marches implacably down the stairs taking his time
vicki rushes out of the bedroom
she looks down the hall and sees frack flying out of the guest room upside down slamming into the wall opposite
he slumps to the carpet out cold
a moment later dick strolls out
vicki rushes to his side come on
well be safe in the cave
batman pauses outside the door to the armory which is slightly ajar
he pushes it in cautiously
and a halberd smashes through the wood frame slicing down mere inches from his face
its the penguin wielding the ax he backs off in seeming terror as batman advances on him
but then selina springs down from a perch above the doors landing on his back and the two of them are going at it again
its a room full of exotic weaponry and most of it gets a good workout in the next thirty seconds
batman dodges a lance which embeds itself into the wall behind him quivering and swings a mace squarely into selinas ribs
its a crippling blow she flies backward knocking over a suit of exotic armor which topples knocking over another and another until the various suits of armor have all fallen
over domino style the last of them landing squarely atop the cowering penguin
selina is badly hurt now
she makes it out of a rear door to the armory
batman pauses to check on the penguin he seems to be out for the count and sets off in pursuit of selina
several moments pass before the groaning penguin comes around enough to dig himself out
as the penguin stumbles around a corner he peers into the library
vicki is crouched by bruces desk reaching into a bottom drawer
a hidden panel in the bookcase pops open
as she helps alfred into the secret passageway vicki turns to come on
come with us
i can still help
the penguin flattens against the wall as dick sprints out of the library and heads off in the opposite direction
theres a flabbergasted look on his face he recognizes this kid
at the monitor bank watching batmans pursuit of selina are vicki and alfred
they pivot suddenly at the sound of a such primitive entertainment
hes holding a gun on the two of them
he stares about delightedly taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave
his eyes light up at the sight of the batmobile parked on its little plateau
so bruce equals batman
it seems ive discovered two treasures
an evil smile dont move
id be only too happy to shoot you both
he pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave
he spots the distinctive rock formation in an upper vault of the cavern
its a couple of plateaus over a long narrow catwalk runs past it some ten or twelve feet below
the gotham city treasury
its about to be stolen twice
dont be absurd
youll never be able to get it out of here
oh ill manage somehow
you two are my guarantee of that
nudging vicki with the gun lets have a look shall we
you go first he shoves her
she starts across the catwalk his gun at her head
selinas made it back upstairs but shes moving at quarter speed favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway
shes just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when batman appears dead ahead in her path
hes ready to rumble but instead of responding she packs it in
she stops slumps against a wall and begins to laugh
it couldve been so nice you and me if only you werent so screwed up
i dont want to hurt you any more
tell me something one thing
if you dont enjoy all this
why do you do it
he just looks at her
he doesnt have an especially good answer
ill never understand men
she spins suddenly delivering a high kick to batmans throat
as he reels backward into a wall she leaps up onto the narrow bannister railing some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a crouch preparing to
spring at the enormous crystal chandelier mounted to the ceiling but just as she launches off batman rolls and brings up a gun from his belt
he fires a razor sharp disk which sails past her head cleanly slicing through the chain which suspends the chandelier
the chandelier falls just as catwoman catches hold of it and she finds herself plummeting to the floor of the entry hall
on impact the chandelier explodes into a thousand fragments the catwoman lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage unmoving
batman advances slowly down the stairs
her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles she lets out an eerie whimpering yowl of pain a cri du chat he stands over her she glares up at
i cant move
i cant move
her face is cut and bleeding
she tries to lift an arm and cant quite manage it
he crouches down beside her still cautious
pleading do me baby
do me now
thats what i want
batman looks up
dick is standing on the balcony overlooking them highly curious as to what hell do
batman slowly rises to his feet
she lets out another gruesome whine
dont stop now
finish me off
almost weeping with pain son of a bitch
youre all alike
her steel claws snick into place
with an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm bends her wrist
shes trying to slit her own throat
he reaches for his belt extracts a glassine capsule and breaks it open with his thumb
he drops it amid the shattered glass around her face
a tiny cloud of green gas plumes out and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness
batman stands over her for a minute as dick marches down to join him
you shouldve done it man
you shouldve killed her
batman gives him a long hard look but says nothing
theres a radio in the cave
well send for help
the penguin and vicki are on a catwalk just below the rock formation
a stone outcropping extends toward the catwalk and he forces her to jump for it
now he has to follow the prospect makes him nervous but its a short hop and he clears it okay finding his footing on the rocky slope
theyre cautiously making their way up toward the rock formation when batman appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk sizes up the situation and freezes in his tracks
ah the illustrious mr
look at you now
whatever would your friends say
smiling youve been an exceptionally congenial host but i must ask you to back off the penguin grabs hold of vicki and holds her close as they climb the last
few feet toward the grotto
batman swings his cape around concealing his hands from view
he takes a cautious step backward
his free hand closes around a batarang flicks it open
theyve pulled almost even with the rock formation
a large dank grotto is visible through a small gap in the rocks
no sudden moves
its a long way down
gun at her head he peers into the grotto
a vast fortune in gold and silver bullion undisturbed in all these years
glinting in the darkness
hanging upside down above it like silent guardians are bats dozens of them their tiny wet red eyes glimmering at the penguin
he dislodges a rock
it tumbles into the grotto
and a startled bat comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks flying directly at his face
he backs away in horror as the bat streaks past him
he fires his gun wildly
the sound of it rouses more bats and they come flying out of the hole a vast chittering swarm
vicki shrieks the penguin stumbles and the two of them fall back onto the rocks hanging on for dear life
an instant later batman lets fly with the batarang
clean hit the penguin staggers back and his gun skitters down across the rocks
with bats screaming all around her vicki takes a deep breath and vaults toward the catwalk
shes a foot short she grabs hold of the railing and hangs there over the abyss trying to pull herself up
batman races toward her but the penguin clambering down across the rocky outcropping has managed to grab hold of his gun
the bats have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern and hes able to draw a clean bead on batman
thunderous echoes reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes batman and knocks him backward
as the second spins him around
as the third sends him toppling over the vicki screams
batman manages to grab the rail with one hand
now two of them are hanging from the catwalk sitting ducks and the penguin is determined to empty the clip
the echoes are cacophanous
ancient stalactites drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern plummeting downward like deadly projectiles shattering agaist the cave floor
and then batman pulls a tiny device from his utility belt and flings it
it lands in the rocks at the penguins feet
he stares down at it and two beats later it begins to emit an eerie electronic whine
within moments every bat in the cave is in a frenzy homing in on the signal
the penguin looks up sees them coming
a choked wail emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there paralyzed
hes just been beaten at his own game he lets out a last awful howl as hundreds of bats engulf him and he plunges down into the pit his hideous
scream dwindling to a faint echo then vanishing altogether
batman manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk
he rushes over to vicki pulls her up drapes his cape around her protectively
gradually as the bats recede to their distant perches he stands and helps vicki to her feet
they embrace on the edge of the abyss
on the far plateau dick has hooked up with alfred
the butler is slumped against a lab table weary and exhausted clutching his wounded arm
dick slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway
squad cars everywhere
frick and frack emerge in handcuffs flanked by cops
paramedics carry the still unconscious selina past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an ambulance
the place is an utter mess
amid the carnage we find bruce conferring with commissioner gordon and lt
a police doctor is dressing alfreds gunshot wound
and then batman showed up
he saved all our lives jim
i cant say for sure but id bet shes the one behind the murders
god i pray youre right
beat one thing before we go bruce
whos the kid
bruce looks into the front parlor where vicki and dick are righting the fallen christmas tree
oh thats vickis little cousin
hes in town for the holidays
well he picked a hell of a time to visit
turning to go merry christmas bruce
good luck cleaning this place up
gordon and bullock file out followed by the police doctor
bruce smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front parlor
alfred loads silent night on the cd
vicki ambles up to what are you going to do with all that gold
might be a good start on a place to live for some people who dont have one
she hugs him
dick plugs in the christmas tree lights they blink to life just as the grandfather clock strikes twelve
maybe you should open your present
she runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly
oh bruce presents doesnt matter
none of it matters
were all safe
you might as well
he digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny gift box which he hands to vicki
she unwraps it opens it slowly and sees a diamond ring inside
she gazes up at him speechless
he gazes back
camera pulls up and away until we can see the whole of the devastated room and all the people in it vicki falling into bruces arms dick off to one
side watching them alfred tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace
