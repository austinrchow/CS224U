dick may thirty feet square
cris johnson wearing a jail uniform sits in a heavy chair that is bolted to the floor
mid twenties jaded rebellious handsome as a statue cris radiates a serene if somewhat scruffy charisma
he faces a plasma screen monitor on a bare wall
to the left of the screen an unframed mirror to the right a digital a womans face appears on the plasma screen
kate hepburn ish

ferris on monitor homeland security
ferris face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of random video clips
ferris on monitor now if you would please look at the monitor and tell us what you see say five minutes from now
cris looks at the clock
he squints and the clock speeds up a little
are you there yet
in a few seconds the clock reads
on the monitor
ferris image has been replaced by footage of surfers riding big waves in hawaii
now can you move ahead ten minutes
varied images fast forward on the plasma screen
he arrives at and reports on what he sees
cris ants crawling up a tree
can you get to hours
cris looks ahead and squints
minutes whiz by
clips play and change almost too fast to be recognized
clock cris gets to and keeps going
mirror cris has a five oclock shadow
clock hours tick off like an accelerating metronome
mirror cris sports a three day stubble
he struggles to get out of the chair but he is now strapped into it bound at the wrist and ankle
his face fills with rage
plasma screen the evening news zips by
mirror like a window into a time machine
cris beard lengthens
he grows pale
his clothes change every few seconds
rage gives way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train
plasma screen the news dissolves into a blur
mirror cris ages before his own eyes
wrinkles etch into skin
hair greys recedes
outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as cris watches himself waste away
womans voice sir
cris tired old eyes look up confused
a perky young waitress stands over him holding a pot of coffee
on cris young again
just the check
she sets it on the table with a flirtatious smile
he takes it to the register and pays cash
the future aint what it used to be
ever hear that expression
a moment later a second cris follows the first cris to the register repeating his every movement
its a joke but its true
the future changes every time you look at it
because you looked at it
as cris pays cash cris proceeds into the casino
cause once you see it youre different
cris follows literally walking in cris s footsteps
maybe just a little
a drunk bumps into cris and spills his daiquiri on him
and that changes everything else
cris the real cris follows a moment later and sidesteps the drunk who spills his daiquiri on someone else
its got something to do with quantum physics
cris reaches the gaming tables and merges with cris
thats why i stay away from roulette and craps
it only takes a millionth of an ounce to change a roll
just placing a different bet can throw things off
a roulette ball skitters indecisively between two grooves before settling into one of them
ive got other rules too
i dont play against people like at poker
only against the house
and my goal isnt to win big
at least not any more
the idea is to go unnoticed so i can keep coming back to the trough
he passes the million dollar slot
stops like its calling out to him
so no jackpots
no big bets except when i want em to see me lose
cris notices a desperate gambler on the verge of tears
clearly hes dropped a bundle
cris approaches him and points to the million dollar slot
try that one man
ive got a feeling
gambler suspicious then you play it
against my religion
cris offers the guy a handful of silver dollars
do it quick before somebody else gets there
while the gambler dawdles a midwestern dowager plants herself at the mega slot and starts feeding it dollars
cris sighs and walks off
the gambler watches him go then reacts to bells flashing lights and shrieks of celebration
the dowager has hit the blackjack section cris takes a stool at a crowded table
mainly i stick to blackjack
boring but controllable
cris antes up
cards are dealt
hes got a four showing
taking a hit he goes bust with a jack
so in real time he sticks
and safe unless they think youre counting
the dealer turns over his cards
hes got a king and a deuce
so he has to draw
pulls the jack
the dealer pays cris then presses a button under the table
banks of video monitors display images from the multitude of cameras looking down from above the gaming tables
the surveillance supervisor hawkeye repositions in response to a red light so he can look over a surveillance operators shoulder and study cris
office of casino boss different casino day the stalin faced casino boss sits behind his desk
casino boss if you dont mind my asking why does homeland security give a damn about whos lucky in vegas
hes talking to callie ferris
we recognize her sardonic beauty from the plasma screen in criss pre vision
in person shes edgy confident and impatient with those who arent as quick as she is
ferris maybe theyre more than lucky
casino boss then we handle it
ferris im not talking about cheating
thats your problem
but if somebody wins consistently and you cant figure out how
she answers her cell phone
ill be there in fifteen
she stands disconnects and hands the casino boss her business card
call me like they did
and try to hold him till i get here
casino boss yes maam
shes already out the door
video monitor close on cris relaxed
the female dealer tries not to gawk at him as she deals from a shoe
nice looking guy
pull back surveillance room ferris and davis the casinos dapper chief of security stand behind hawkeye the surveillance supervisor and study cris on various monitors
ferris maybe shes in cahoots
davis hes beaten six dealers in a row
ferris youre sure hes not counting
hawkeye weve got five decks in the shoe
and he wins more off the top than the bottom
davis moves a lot from table to table
on a monitor cris pockets some of his chips
hawkeye keeps his stacks short
on another monitor a cocktail waitress takes orders from the players
whats your pleasure
grand dad rocks
ferris whats his name
davis shrugs not staying here
pays in cash
hawkeye were running him through face check
as ferris watches cris on the monitor he becomes still and attentive as if sensing danger
he squints a little the way we do when we try to remember something
ferris invite him for a drink
remembers her manners if you dont mind
as cris signals for another card two black suits appear behind him
black suit o
sir would you come with us please
cris takes in their grim faces
turns to see two more pairs of goons stationed nearby
snapback to thirty seconds ago the cocktail waitress approaches to take cris order
whats your pleasure
this time cris hurriedly scoops all his chips into his coat pocket jostling the waitress as he stands
scuse me sorry
hustling away he glances back just as the first two black suits reach his stool but this time its empty
they look around
one of them whispers into his mike
the three pairs of goons get instructions and split up
tracking shot eye level cris strides crisply through the casino
sees another pair of black suits scanning for him
he ducks into the maze of slots
zigs and zags from aisle to aisle seemingly at random
a moment after each turn a black suit appears ahead behind or to the side where they would have spotted cris
tracking shot high angle a clearer perspective as two black suits approach cris aisle from different directions
cris has no way to see them or know theyre coming but at the last moment he moves in between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they
surveillance room davis and hawkeye wince as the black suits keep missing their quarry
davis whats wrong with you guys
hawkeye hes right next to you
ferris watches the chase fascinated
phalanxes of slot machines black suits converge from various directions in that fake calm fast walk
cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby then heads to a particular spot where he is sure to be spotted except that a texas sized man repositions himself blocking
the black suits view
the black suit moves on
cris shifts to another spot just as a different black suit arrives at the other end of the aisle
this time three frat boys change machines and obscure cris from his gaze
surveillance room davis is throwing a fit
hes right there in front of you
walk toward each other
cris slips away in the shadow of the frat boys
hawkeye maybe hes on our frequency
i dont see an earphone on him
hawkeye hes heading to the convention annex
stands give me a headset
im going down there
convention annex arriving at the foyer cris sees five meeting rooms
he squints then decisively enters one of them
four black suits arrive an instant later
without wasting a beat each of them goes through a different door
all except the one cris went through
cris re emerges a moment later and heads back toward the casino
casino ferris arriving adjusts her headset
cris sees her
recognizes her from his prevision as the woman on the plasma screen
turns and walks away
she sees cris
takes off after him
ferris to head mic hes heading toward
reads sign the ipanema grill
security staff converge on the area
cris is in plain sight
suddenly a busload of tourists surge in through a door and clog the way
cris continues into the
kitchen area passing a room service cart he rolls it in front of him
a few steps on he takes the bottle of olive oil on the cart and pours some in front of one random closed door
cris then shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty intersecting corridor
a black suit barrels into the empty intersection just as the cart arrives and tumbles over it
behind cris a door swings open a black suit charges out steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil and falls on his ass
cris slips by him but gets cut off by an arriving group of four more black suits
they try to grab him
he evades their grasp almost magically and like a shaolin monk somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a pile on the floor
cris darts around them into the
lobby he co opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery
rolling it to the left a black suit on that side doesnt see him and moves on
cris switches to the right side of the card just as a second black suit would have seen him
abandoning the cart cris sets off across the lobby in a herky jerky rhythm
he walks four quick steps without being seen
then stops behind a column just as black suit turns his way
when black suit looks on cris resumes his journey cutting across the lobby at an acute angle
in this way he avoids being seen by black suit
cris now backs up three steps and avoids being seen by black suit
by precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his hunters will be looking cris achieves something like invisibility
the last obstacle to daylight is ferris
she sees him
he makes a run for the door
she dashes after him
i just need to talk to you
cris grabs a guests suitcase and keeps moving
the guest chases after cris and collides with ferris knocking her to the ground
which allows cris to slip through a door to the
hotel loading dock day where two laundry delivery men are flinging sacks of clothes into the back of a truck
cris steps toward the open tailgate with a steady pace
as if on cue both laundry guys turn and bend to pick up another sack of clothes
cris walks right by them without being noticed and climbs into the truck
a moment later the laundry guys pivot back around toss sacks of clothes in after cris and slam the rear doors
they get in the truck and drive off just as ferris davis and several black suits arrive to find a cold trail
davis you were right
this guy is a lot more than lucky
oddly ferris seems almost encouraged
ferris at least now i know he exists
department of homeland security las vegas regional office night ferris strides purposefully through hallways crowded with people hustling just as urgently as she is
she enters the large ante room of a bigshots office and addresses jeannie a civil service secretary
ferris jeannie i have to see him right away
jeannie hes on with washington
we just went on code orange
ferris whats the threat
we found a dirty bomb in east vegas
a barrel of c and a kilo of nuclear waste
but were getting chatter about a dozen more out there somewhere ready to blow
ferris absorbs the catastrophic news without emotion
ferris tell him i have a new source that could help with the case
snide another remote viewer
ferris stares her down
ferris have him meet me in imaging
leaves without waiting for a response
picnic in park day cris and a glowing young mother hold a baby boy
gazing into the babys eyes cris beams with perfect happiness
he plays with the babys fingers
the two middle ones are subtly webbed by a piece of skin that comes about halfway up the bottom knuckle
the image whites out as
sunlight pours into the back of the truck revealing cris lounging on a mound of laundry sacks
he composes himself and steps out nonchalant as james bond
cris thanks guys
not too heavy on the starch
computer simulation the pursuit of cris through the casino has been mapped into a d visualization
multiple camera angles have been merged so that a single pov seamlessly follows cris without cutting
its clear that cris avoids trouble before he sees it
male voice o
you pulled me out of a conference call with the secretary to show me a video game
imaging lab day eric wisdom stands next to ferris as they watch the simulation on a flat screen monitor
highly competent solidly masculine spencer tracy to her hepburn you can rely on him in your average emergency
which this is not
i need six men to bring him in
were on code orange
ferris he could help us find the other bombs
thats an ultra low probability
none of your specials have ever panned out and this isnt the time to experiment
ferris steps close to wisdom
come on eric you saw it
were flying blind and hes got radar
wisdom steps away from her
callie people are talking
they say im only funding your research because were involved
ferris thats because theyre
im sorry but theyre right
i care about you and i wanted to support you
but theres a limit to what i can
professional look we analyzed what this ability would look like if it existed
ferris contd i went screening for it in a highly scientific way
and now ive identified someone who matches all the indicators
so the next obvious step is to
wisdom let me do my job
dont you ever quit
beat ive got a country to protect
he finds her both infuriating and irresistible
use your charm on somebody else
he stalks out of the room leaving her more thwarted than sad
an elevated freeway
driving behind a pick up truck carrying a mattress and box spring
im not god
i dont see everything
just my own future
cris car day cris drives an old camaro muscle y but inconspicuous
to me it seems normal
the way lightning comes before thunder
cris changes lanes to get from behind the truck
most of the time im not paying attention
just making sure i dont step in a mess
in his rearview mirror cris sees the mattress fall off the truck causing an accident
sometimes i get a blast from far away
he sees a plume of smoke in the distance
or i can start with a glimpse of something close and keep pushing on
he takes the next exit
usually its none of my business
he turns into the parking lot of a bookie shop the finish int
the finish line day cris walks to the counter
addresses the manager
tell him its king midas
homeland security regional hq internal security office terry baines plainclothed head of protective services for the facility walks down the corridor with three of the better trained military police who
have been brought in to augment the regular staff of civilian federal protective service police
baines is a handsome former special forces lieutenant early forties who takes his work very seriously
ferris runs to catch up with him
he doesnt slow down for her
i know youve got your hands full but i was wondering if you might be able to spare a few warm bodies for an outside operation
she gives him a look
theres some mutual attraction but not a lot of affection
were strictly internal
thats why i need your people
everybody else is assigned
does wisdom know about this
he suggested it
while baines arches a dubious eyebrow an intellectual junior analyst amanda catches up with ferris
corrects herself agent ferris
ive got a face match on your subject
his name is cris johnson
ferris takes amandas printout and glances at it on the run its a photo of cris on a wanted bulletin
ferris slows to a stop never mind terry
pretty boy here is wanted for murder in nevada
she hustles off with amanda
a smoky office with a big screen tv and a poker table but no card players
cris is greeted by guy relaxed professional smartly dressed mid forties
hes classier than the joint he runs
guy well if it isnt the golden man
a look a hug
a lot of history
guy what brings you crawling back to me
i need to cash some chips
he starts setting them in stacks on the poker table
you burned through your stash already
ive been trying to lay low
state police station day computer monitor on a desk plays cris escape from the casino
i call him the road runner
cavanaugh middle aged hunter type beer belly but still a menace
ferris whats he running from
cavanaugh takes a videocassette from a pile on his messy desk
you showed me yours
ill show you mine
he pops the tape into a vcr
on the monitor low quality security camera recording of a liquor store at night
business is good
five people wait in line at the register
time code reads november
cris walks in unsteady on his feet
heads for the beer locker
suddenly runs toward the register at full speed and tackles a customer shoving him hard to the floor
cris prepares to hold him down but the tackled man just lies there a pool of blood forming under his head
cris looks up
the customers are gaping at him terrified
slurred he was gonna kill you
you all woulda died
cris sees that theyre afraid of him not the dead man
he runs out
back to scene cavanaugh studies ferris reaction
guy finishes counting cris chips
guy but you of all people
how could you have let it happen
that was the night donna broke off our engagement
i was so drunk i could barely see now
guy opens a drawer takes out a pack of a hundred s and counts out an additional sum from his pocket
well i hope you dont mind
i called neal to let him know youre here
christ guy did you have to
you say everythings inevitable so i guess i did
guy returns to his antique copper espresso machine and starts to make two cups
well you can save your breath
cause i know what youre gonna say
then youre aware that neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all
im sorry to hear that
but im done playing the market
while guy is distracted making espresso cris jams the desk drawer shut with a penny
neals got it all worked out
hell fly you out of the country on his jet
put you up in style
he pays taxes totally legal
you get cash squeaky clean
half the net
when your share hits fifty mil you can say finito
and its over
except last time neal didnt take finito for an answer
guy slams his fist
you need us asshole
the law is breathin down your neck
i can stay ahead of em forever
but why live that way
because i dont want to be used any more
what do you give a shit as long as you get what you want
cause what i want is freedom
and you dont get it by giving it up
guy calms himself and sets an espresso in front of cris
enjoy it while it lasts
cris picks up the cup and knocks it back
finish line parking lot day cris starts up the car
notices hes woozy
he prepares to back out
instead he blacks out as guy and three men drag him out of the car
guys office guy sets the cup of espresso in front of cris who picks it up
but instead of knocking it back he sets it down and grins cryptically at guy who senses something and reaches to open his top desk drawer the one cris pennied
guy cant get it open
guy reaches under his racing form
cris holds up a knife
looking for this
guy pulls his arm from under the racing form spilling the cup of espresso that cris just set down
guy knows thats not a coincidence
dont mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think em
cris takes his cash
the jetll be sold in a week
then there goes your ticket out
dont wait for me
cris heads out
guy you know what i think
i think i know the future better than you do
cris scoffs as he leaves
state police station day cavanaugh pours coffee for himself and ferris
hes just some gambler
lives completely off the grid
no bank account
no credit cards
no previous record
ferris so whyd he do it
must be a wacko
hed never met the victim
no connection whatsoever
ferris tries to make sense of it all
ferris and in fifteen months why havent you caught him
cavanaugh sighs woefully
hes got eyes in the back of his head
he can see around corners
i even had him in custody once and he disappeared
ferris must be very embarrassing
a painful subject for cavanaugh
and what is it you want him for
ferris stuff that hasnt happened yet
cavanaugh nods knowingly
well i guess homeland security trumps liquor store murder
how can i help
suburban home las vegas night a tract house cheap from the s could be anywhere
something sad about the place
cris stands at the door holding a bag of groceries
irv a sick old man opens the door wearing a knit cap and pajamas
hes hooked up to a little oxygen tank on wheels
when he sees cris his smile crimps the tube in his nose
what are you doing back here
i came to fix you dinner
irv pulls cris inside
closes the door
irvs house night they embrace like father and son
the oxygen tube gets in the way
this is what you get from two packs a day
cris but you quit ten years ago
it was already too late
i just didnt know it
sometimes not knowing is better
irv shakes his head
look where youre headed pal
the big decisions are over before you even realize you made em
the finish line back room night cavanaugh and ferris chat with guy
this time the poker game is in progress
cavanaugh any idea where he might be going
guy turns to ferris
ive got a little problem with the irs
think i could get some relief
depends how helpful you are
guy oh i know everything about him
he looks at ferris knowing
she turns to cavanaugh
i need to speak to him alone
guy and ferris sip cappucino
and another thing no woman ever turns him down im serious
mainly because he only propositions the ones he knowsll say yes which is most of em anyway
but does that make him happy
says hes bored
has to watch himself die over and over again
whyd he come back to vegas
didnt say but im guessin its this friend whos dying
an old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs
hes an orphan ya know
been on the road since he was ten
irvs house living room night the place is a mess
piles of newspapers
cris cleans up as they talk
irv sits at a table and plays solitaire
you want my advice
get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in
if i tell em the truth you know what happens
i end up with the feds
and you know what they do to me
make you a secret agent
cris dont laugh
they strap me in a chair and make me watch the news
dan rather or peter jennings
its not funny irv
thats all i do day after day for the rest of my life
watch the news until i lose my hair and croak
irv is moved by cris dilemma
irv theres no way around it
the best i can do is stay away from all of em
irv shakes his head with sympathy for cris plight
in that case youve gotta leave the country
i know i know but theres something i gotta do first
cris doesnt answer
his gaze is distant
shes coming here
you gotta go
shakes his head
lets play it out
irvs kitchen day cris makes a lamb roast studding it with cloves of garlic
ive got the place all picked out
its called palau
three hundred teeny islands in the south pacific
places roast in pan nothing ever happens there so theres nothing to foresee
then what the hell are you waiting for
cris puts the roasting pan in the oven
i havent met her yet
then find somebody else
it has to be her
whats so special about this one
shes the mother of my child
irv stops shuffling the cards
i thought you were shooting blanks
i guess the doctors were wrong
i dont mean to be indelicate my friend but how do you know the little bastard is yours
hes got my thing
cris holds up his hand revealing that the skin between his two middle fingers is webbed a little higher than normal
i still dont understand why you never got that fixed
then suddenly stops
cris shes here
he walks to the door and opens it to discover ferris standing there with her finger about to press the doorbell
agent ferris come in
she regards cris with appreciation
one step ahead of the game
tries not to be intimidated by his ability or appearance
sees irv watching them
ferris is there some place we can speak privately
lets go in the kitchen
ive got a roast in the oven
irv no you two stay here
ill watch the food
once out of ferris eyeline irv queries cris with his hand in the shape of a gun
cris shakes his head then turns to ferris and waits for her to begin
youre wasting your life cris
you have the most amazing talent and youre running from it
yeah people say i could have been a chef
ferris dont be cute
theres too much at stake here
her gravity anchors him
now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people i believe you
why else would you kill a stranger
cris guards his reaction
but no good deed goes unpunished eh
ferris contd and thats how its going to be in this world
people will either hate you or want to exploit you
everyone but you of course
i can fix your legal problems
more importantly i can give you a chance to use your gift
trust me its better if i dont
its better if i just mind my own business
ferris looks at him disapproving
ill be honest with you cris
thats not an option
your country needs you
and if we dont grab you somebody else will
nobodys grabbed me yet
ferris youre up against more powerful forces now
she lets that sink in
id like you to come with me for some testing
would you be willing to do that
criss expression grows dark
he looks at ferris accusingly then bolts away toward the kitchen
where are you going
cris covers his eyes and dives to the floor as stun grenades shatter windows and explode with a flash
temporarily blinded shit
gas grenades follow
cris scrambles to his feet as a nevada police swat team bursts through windows and doors wearing gas masks and goggles scanning with laser guided rifles
they find cris dashing for the back door
cris tumbles dodges a few bullets then takes a hit in the shoulder the back the leg
absorbs dozens of bullets
cavanaugh steps up to deliver the final shot
irvs house living room an hour ago in that case youve gotta leave the country
i know i know ive got the place picked out
but theres something ive gotta do first
cris doesnt answer
his gaze is distant
i have to go
you just got here
i know but theyre coming for me
cris takes the pack of cash he got from guy pulls out more than half the bills and sets them on a table
this is for nurses and stuff to make things a little easier
youre gonna need it
cris shakes his head and embraces irv
cris youre the only one i could trust
theyre both choked up
i dont suppose youve discovered any last minute escape for me
i looked irv i really did
i went down every path every treatment
sometimes theres just no
now i can relax
a last look
irvs street day cris approaches his parked camaro with his key out
cavanaugh and six troopers spring from hiding guns trained on him
camera pans to cris in irvs back yard watching this scene
alley behind irvs house day a state trooper keeps watch smoking
when he steps on the butt cris enters the frame in the background
when the trooper turns to a wall to piss cris crosses the alley unseen
when cris passes out of frame the trooper finishes unaware of what he has missed
outskirts of vegas night a route vintage highway with stop lights and tawdry commercial development
cris stands on the shoulder thumbing a ride
cars and trucks pass without stopping
fast foward through endless traffic until an old chevrolet pulls over
cris checks his watch
snapback to chris checks his watch
cris to himself twenty four minutes
he looks around
sees a donut shop
heads toward it
irvs house night cavanaughs state troopers guns drawn are searching the place on a hair trigger ready to blow away anything that moves
i need him alive cavanaugh
even if he resists
she points to cavanaughs troopers
as cavanaugh grudingly walks off to deliver the message irv approaches ferris
irv youll never catch him
he knows what youre gonna do to him
thats very helpful information
she walks off leaving irv to regret he opened his mouth
donut shop night cris steps in
goes to the counter
cris medium coffee black and a glazed
as he waits he sees a vague reflection in the glass display case a square cross coming into focus
puzzled cris looks up and around to see the object thats being reflected
he cant find it
cris turns back to the display case but the reflection is gone
the donut girl gives him his order
cris takes it turns and notices liz cooper sitting by herself at a booth circling items in the classified section
he recognizes her as the future mother of his future child
cris gazes at her face which is both childish and mature shy yet indomitable
she turns scowling from the staring stranger
cris approaches liz and gives her that smile that always works
mind if i join you
prickly yeah actually i do
cris seems disconcerted
the donut girl gives cris his order
he approaches liz again and tries a different opening line
is that cruller any good
liz looks at him like hes hopeless
he notices that shes reading the used car ads
the donut girl gives cris his order
he approaches liz
shopping for a car
what business is it of yours
the donut girl gives cris his order
he approaches liz
liz i dont want to talk about it
snapback to the donut girl gives cris his order
discouraged after all that rejection he approaches liz and bobbles his coffee spilling it on the floor
hes mortified but she smiles at him
the donut girl gives cris his order
now confident hes found the right approach cris approaches liz and deliberately bobbles his coffee
but not in the exact way he did before
when it falls it splashes on her shoes
look what youve done
im so sorry
im a spaz
yeah you are
she wipes her shoe with a napkin
it looked like you spilled it on purpose
why would i do that
i dont know
to impress me
look im sorry
if i could id do it over
disgusted she hands him a stack of paper napkins
she watches as he sops up the coffee and carries dripping soggy tissues to the trash
the miserable expression on his face finally wins the smile hes been working for
donut shop night a few minutes later theyre sitting across from each other laughing
liz divorce bankruptcy repossession
yeah id call that a bad year
well liz your lucks about to change
you met me
and what are you a leprechaun
an angel actually
and we always reward the people who help us
great what do i have to do

cris glances outside and sees the old chevrolet drive by without stopping
he checks his watch
but i could use a ride
she knows she shouldnt
jeep cherokee on highway night going fast
johnny cash on the cd
when does the luck kick in
it already has
i dont feel anything
not even a tingle
son i havent had a tingle in eight months
he waits for the other shoe to drop
liz cant hold it in since my worthless no good dickhead of a husband ran out on me
then youre way overdue
for a reversal of fortune
brake lights flare on the cars ahead
they pass an exit
off his look i teach fifth grade
i mean of your own
she shakes her head
i guess thats good
no that was the problem
i couldnt get pregnant
traffic is backed up
i didnt mean to pry
im just running off at the mouth
thats why i was in vegas
to see another doctor
flashing yellow lights a barricade
cris is getting nervous
he didnt want to adopt
no he had to have a randy junior
flashing blue lights parked cop cars
what is there an accident
the place is crawling with state troopers
cris is looking around for a way out
snapback to one minute earlier one mile back when does the luck kick in
it already has
i dont feel anything
brake lights flare on the cars ahead
urgent take this exit
just take it
the dotted lines on the road are now solid
its too late
no its not
cris grabs the steering wheel and jerks it to the right sending them over some speed bumps onto the off ramp
are you out of your mind
she slams on the brakes and they screech to a stop on the right shoulder of the exit ramp
cris scrambles for an explanation
looks sees a quieu of brake lights from the roadblock now backed up past the exit
traffic was piling up
you didnt see it
we coulda been stuck there for hours
i dont give a flyin goddamn
you dont grab the steering wheel
cris pauses for a beat
takes a different tack

cavanaugh knows hes about to hear something wild
gas station mini mart night gasoline flowing
liz still in a snit sits impatiently behind the wheel watching in the mirror as cris crosses behind the car and knocks on her window

cris smiles to himself as she proceeds toward the mini mart
roadblock night cavanaugh considers what ferris has just told him
id call your proof a little iffy
look from your own experience this guy cant be punched shot surprised captured or confined
so either hes got something special or youre an idiot
cavanaugh doesnt like her logic
lets say im not an idiot
and im not saying you are
weve got to think like he does
weve got to think ahead

lizs car outskirts of tahoe night cris and liz sing along with patsy cline on the radio

cris lays some money on the bar and they head for the door
but before they get there randy sees liz and bounds after her holding a pool cue
hes much bigger and taller than cris
randy i gotta talk to you baby

she tries to slide by him
randy blocks the way
ive left a dozen messages on your phone
cris steps between them

randy holds liz by the shoulders
liz let go
you still care for me i know it
cris grips randys arm
randy hauls off to slug cris
cris easily ducks the blow and answers with a solid punch to the belly
randy recovers and realizes hes up against a skilled opponent
he takes a stance ready to get serious
he sticks a few jabs at cris who easily slips from each one like he saw them coming a mile away
randy goes for a hook
cris feints and lands an uppercut to randys chin
most men would go down but randy is so big he stays up to take more punishment
cris delivers an elegant beating that humiliates the big guy and makes him look like an oaf
cris puts an end to it by breaking randys nose
the big guy falls to his knees bleeding
liz rushes to randys side holding her ex and glowering up at cris like hes a sadistic brute
get out of here
cris realizes hes blown it
you still care for me i know it
cris grips randys arm
randy hauls off to slug cris who this time makes no effort to duck
cris takes a sledgehammer in the mouth
randy follows up mercilessly punching cris in the gut then holding him up while he punches him again
liz grabs randys arm
stop it randy
randy flings her aside and finishes up with a solid right to cris jaw that puts him on the floor
randy pulls back his leg for a pointy booted cowboy kick to the ribs when liz rushes to cris side and glowers up at randy like hes a sadistic brute
get out of here
randy realizes hes blown it and lets himself be pulled out of the bar by a couple of buddies
liz examines cris with concern
oh god ill take you to the emergency room
i don nee hopital
god i hate that bastard
will somebody get some ice
she strokes cris hair
lizs cottage night in the foothills
lizs car pulls up
cris gets out holding a dish towel full of ice to his jaw
im sorry im causing you all this trouble
are you kidding
you stood up for me
actually i wasnt standing for that long
liz unlocks the front door
turns on the lights
sorry its so cold in here
the heaters broken
lizs cottage night cris looks around sore but pleased that he has managed to stay in lizs company
the place is cozy ranch like
i really shouldve left him a long time ago
god knows he deserved it
why didnt you
cause i dont leave
i never have
my boyfriends always left me
she wets a washcloth with hot water
i get attached to people and then ill put up with anything
what a terrible quality
youre too loyal
she returns with a wet washcloth
sit in the light
he lowers himself onto the sofa next to the table lamp
she comes close and gingerly wipes the blood from his nose and lips
i never minded that i was the more devoted one
somebodys gotta be more this or more that
he looks in her eyes
but they never appreciate it that youre there for them
she tries to stay on task but gets drawn in by his gaze
they just try and get away with more and more and figure youll just
he leans forward
their lips touch
it gets more intense
then abruptly she shies away freaked
christ i dont even know you
i have no idea who you are
she wipes the blood from his nose and lips
he looks in her eyes
she tries to stay on task but she gets drawn in by his gaze
he leans forward
their lips almost touch
but this time cris pulls back
liz is embarrassed
sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera
once you start watching its hard not to get involved
she goes back to tending his wounds
you ever been married
she wanted kids
and you didnt
cris no i did too
she looks at him curious
its just that
something about his revelation unsettles her
why are you telling me this
these personal details
i dont know
you asked and
i guess i felt like youd understand
tears well up in her eyes
liz i do
cris looks at her with sympathy
liz i cant either
cris comforts her
she looks up into his eyes expectantly
fighting the pull he looks away for a moment to see where this is going then glances back at her almost dizzy
that was incredible
liz what was
he kisses her with a quiet intensity that quickly ignites
their lovemaking unfolds as it would be experienced by cris
effect before cause
the pleasure then the gesture that elicits it
cris explores her body until she sighs then snapsback and goes directly to the sweet spot
he strings together a perfect melody of shudders and moans without striking any false notes along the way
moments are superimposed diaphonous played against each other in counterpoint
visual harmonics elastically out of sync
rising to a crescendo
until all the futures resolve into a single now
afterwards night floating in bed
her head on his chest
his eyes open sadly content like he wishes he could stop time here forever
like hes afraid it will all disappear if he takes his eyes off her
cris forces himself to look away into the distance
wisdoms office federal facility night wisdom exhausted quietly confers with a cadre of analysts and operatives
their voices are confident but their body language betrays their pessimism
expert we sent the payload to livermore and by measuring the cesium degradation theyve identified the reactor in smerlensk that it came from

ferris slips in and takes an empty chair
wisdom what do we know about the explosive

lizs house bedroom morning head on pillow liz buds from sleep
cris is gone
her eyes open fearful
she rushes in looking for cris
hes not there
she hears clanking from the laundry room
on the floor cris sits next to the heater which lies in pieces
he tries to adjust the remaining apparatus
what the hell are you doing
you said it was broken
well youre not leaving till its fixed ill tell you that
he smiles archly
cris im afraid that could take a while
now she understands his strategy
as long as its done right
homeland security workshop day ferris enters the area where weapons are stored and where mechanics build whatever the department needs

this one first
she hands him a sketch
he studies it perplexed
what is it
a trap for somebody who can see the future
if you say so
and then these
she hands him more sketches
lizs fifth grade class day liz stands before a map of the native american tribes of the lake tahoe region
and what was the main staple of their diet
smartie pants busts a button to get called on
instead liz points to a shy girl
shy girl trout
from the lake
from the rivers
and the washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other native americans came to trade for dried fish they were only permitted to remain one night
liz notices that her students are distracted and giggling
she turns to see cris standing in the doorway holding a box
embarrassed she blushes
liz ill be right back
liz pulls cris into the hall out of sight of the kids
what are you doing here
cris beaming i brought ice cream sandwiches for everybody
ice cream sandwiches
do you have any idea how much fat they have in them
dont you see how overweight half of them are
crestfallen i i didnt think of it
i thought youd be happy to see me
well next time exercise a little forethought okay
do you want me to leave these somewhere
all right then
ill just go
seeing his doleful expression liz cant help smiling
she glances up and down the hall then kisses him lasciviously on the lips
put a few in the freezer
i love ice cream sandwiches
with a mischievous grin she ducks back into class leaving cris reeling but exhilarated
chinese restaurant night liz and cris stuff their mouths with lo mein
she sets down her chopsticks picks up a red pencil and industriously resumes marking up a stack of papers
you have been such a bad influence
im gonna be up all night grading papers
cris watches bored
ive got a better idea

she picks up the chopsticks and takes another bite
i think youre serious
she muses tempted
lets go pack your bags
well leave tonight

she gets lost in the fantasy
he can almost taste the fulfilmment of his dreams
this is ridiculous
well first of all its the middle of the school year
theyll replace you
and im in charge of science fair
they can pick up the slack
his unbridled enthusiasm brings out her inner adult
it disturbs me cris that you think its okay just to duck your responsibilities
hes taken aback by her sudden shift
i i dont think its okay
im not that kind of person
but i have this feeling this very strong feeling that it has to be now
we have to leave soon or its not gonna work out
i dont believe that
if its meant to be between two people somehow itll happen
yes but sometimes you have to make it happen
you have to seize the opportunity before its too late
he tries to keep his desperation from showing but she sees right through him
what are you afraid of cris
why are you running away from yourself
liz contd whatever it is youre looking for i dont think youre going to find it on some island cut off from the rest of the world
he adores her more than ever and fears losing her even more
your students are very lucky
she puts her hand on his
now ive got to grade papers
church day liz and cris file by the pastor after the service and mill about on the lawn with the other congregants
kids release pent up energy in the adjacent park
randy approaches cris
randy a religious fella are you
ready to turn the other jaw
cris offers his profile for hitting
but then you have to sign the divorce papers
liz randy dont you dare
she drags cris towards a young couple with kids
liz paul janice

approaches rick a young local policeman whos not the sharpest knife in the drawer
randy theres something weird about that jerk

randy cmon rick help me out here
church day paul and janice are chatting with cris and liz
paul cris are you free on tuesday
cause id like you to be my guest at the rotary luncheon
janice im the first female member
cris grows distracted
out the corner of his eye he sees a sports car gunning it down the street passing a sunday driver to beat a red light
at that moment a kid misses a catch and a baseball rolls into a street where a twenty ish woman jogger runs over to get it just as the sports
car passes the sunday driver sees the jogger and skids forcing a bus to swerve and plow into a group of people standing at the corner
paul cris are you free on tuesday
cause id like you to be my guest at the rotary luncheon
janice im the first female member
cris is spaced out
ignoring them cris turns toward the street where he saw the accident take place
he sees kids but theyre jumping rope
he scans around and finds the kids who are playing softball
someone misses a catch
the ball rolls toward the street
the sports car is now coming fast
the woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it
shes wearing earbuds and cant hear him
hes too far away to grab her
hes closer to the approaching sports car
cris picks up a rock prepares to throw hesitates a beat squints
scores a hit
opens his eyes and hurls the stone
liz and the bystanders watch appalled as the rock shatters the driver side window of the sportscar which instead of skidding screeches to a halt
the bus drives by without incident injuring no one
the driver of the sportscar bursts from his car and furiously charges cris
cris im sorry
ill pay for the damages
the driver curses cris and tries to grab and hit him
but cris deftly deflects the blows so that they seem harmless
i said ill pay
realizing he cant land a punch the driver changes tack
youre damn right youll pay
i wanna talk to the cops
no need for that
ill give you cash
will you take cash
he pulls out his wallet
cris two thousand
that should cover it
make it three
he digs in his pocket and pulls out the stack of hundreds
on randy and policeman rick who have seen the whole incident
policeman rick ill run him through the computer
park a minute later away from the crowd
liz concerned and alienated walks a step to the side of cris
cris people shouldnt drive that fast around kids
they shouldnt get away with it
so you throw rocks at them
what do you want me to do
wait for people to die
liz is torn
i think you should move on
cris looks at her almost bereft and makes a tough decision
look theres something ive been wanting to tell you
it doesnt matter
shes afraid to hear it
hes afraid to say it
another church day cavanaugh is milling around after services when his cell phone chirps
he answers peeved
no you were right to call
ring ferris and have her meet me there
he closes his cell phone
turns to his wife
cavanaugh theyve located him near tahoe
cavanaughs wife if you let him get away again you may not have a job
cavanaugh takes his leave
liz reacts to cris confession with disbelief
what are you saying youre some sort of prophet
its not religious
i just happen to see my life before it happens
cris its sweet that you feel responsible for people
but i think you need help
she looks down
liz and im
im not the one to help you right now
ive got too much going on in my own life
cris cant let her go
he takes a quarter from his pocket and hands it to liz
just do it
she takes the quarter and flips it
cris calls it in the air
flip it again
calls it in the air tails
tails it is but so what
she flips again
she looks flips again heads
she looks flips again tails
now you believe me
she stares at him like hes the devil
and i dont want to have anything to do with you
she walks away
follows dont you see
i can get us all the money we need
she turns abruptly
dont follow me
dont talk to me
get out of my life
she walks on leaving cris bereft
walking in the park five minutes ago cris what do you want me to do
wait for people to die
i think you should move on
cris squints then chooses his words carefully
because i care so much about kids that sometimes i overreact
his words hit the bulls eye
lizs whole demeanor softens
although still troubled she takes his arm and they walk on
whos the woman
hillside overlooking park day ferris cavanaugh and policeman rick are each looking through a pair of binoculars
policeman rick liz cooper
nice girl but very erratic
cavanaugh think shell cooperate
hard to say
shes impossible to control
ferris sounds like youve tried
shes quite a challenge
park day liz and cris still walking holding hands
i swear i cant figure you out
believe me the feeling is mutual
sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive
but other times i feel like youre utterly calculating saying exactly what you thinkll push my buttons
what do you mean
dont you think its kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids
you want to talk to my doctor
ill get him on the phone
no really i mean it
ill have him send you my records
because i want you to trust me
he seems so sincere that she dismisses her concerns
then open up
talk to me
where are you going with your life
cris seems unprepared for the question
cris wherever it takes me
liz you never think about the future
all the time
but mainly how to stay out of trouble
theres only one thing ive ever wanted
she seems disappointed
just a family
well i was as they say left on a doorstep when i was two
makes light of it never found foster parents who could put up with me
so to me a family sounds like plenty
that certainly pressed her buttons again
youve got to be making this up
she rests her head on his shoulder
you poor guy
hillside overlooking park day still watching cris and liz as the couple get into her car
i say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass
ferris and by that time his assll be long gone
then why wont he see through your trap
ferris takes a deep breath
ferris lets try this one more time
old shopping center day grocery drug store hardware gas station
liz and cris get out of her jeep
he heads for the grocery store
ill meet you inside
i need to pick something up at the drug store
they split up
across the street unmarked car day ferris cavanaugh and policeman rick watch the couple go their separate ways
ferris gets out
stay in the car
if he sees your shadow he wont take the bait
cavanaugh we hear you
ferris im serious
this guy can smell your farts before you even eat the beans
rick miss i wont even think about beans
ferris gets out of the car
cavanaugh and rick stay put
rick sounds like a crock to me
you havent been chasing him for three years
drugstore day liz is in the female department trying to choose between various brands when ferris approaches
ferris miss cooper
ferris shows her badge
liz frightened is ready to listen
drug store day ferris and liz huddle in a quiet corner
liz is in shock from what she has just heard
hes not a killer
he needs help
ferris i agree
but he has a long history of resisting arrest and the state wants to hunt him down with fifty trigger happy cops
aghast youre not gonna let them
thats why i came to you
okay ill talk to him
ill try to get him to
ferris shakes her head lamentably
even his best friend says hell never turn himself in
at this stage theres only one way to keep him from self destructing
liz knows shes facing an agonizing decision
cris waits impatiently by her jeep
liz finally approaches carrying a couple of heavy bags filled with wine and booze
cris what took so long
i ran into a friend i hadnt seen in a while
liz holds out a single key on a ring
she said we could use her cabin up at the peak
ferris rejoins cavanaugh and ferris in ricks car
cavanaugh did you tell her about the future thing
ferris of course not
i wanted her to believe me
but i loaded her up with liquor to dim his headlights
mountain road day lizs jeep grinds up a steep winding road past a sign that says state line
she turns onto a dirt driveway that leads to a cabin and a glorious panorama
god this is gorgeous
inspired he kisses her but shes distant
she smiles wanly then gives him a peck
she hops out of the truck
stakeout site across the canyon day cavanaugh and rick look through binoculars
ferris peers through a telescope on a tripod
baines approaches with a half dozen tech and construction guys
baines okay when you press the remote the cabin will lock down like a big jail cell
but silently right
and thats when we go in
ferris rolls her eyes with exasperation
ferris you still dont get it
tries to be patient this has to be clear to your whole army
to baines and yours
after she comes out and we lock down the cabin
we dont do anything
policeman rick but if hes already trapped
gentlemen try to think like him
if the plan is to go in right after hes trapped hell see it coming and hell slip away before hes trapped
to cavanaugh like hes always done
cavanaugh how does your plan change anything
baines at least he wont hear it when the trap closes
and if he doesnt know hes trapped he cant foresee knowing hes trapped
that kinda makes sense
the eureka moment is when he realizes hes been trapped
when is that
ferris thats the point
we want to delay eureka for as long as possible
so by the time he sees trouble and decides to waltz away
baines finally gets it hes already been in the trap for hours
cavanaugh and rick nod with a kind of awe
baines looks at her with new respect
cabin bathroom sunset liz looks in the mirror torn
cabin parlor sunset cris is lighting a fire he has built
liz drifts in pensive
do you think we met for a reason
you mean do i believe a higher power brought us together
i think were just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the big bang
thats not very romantic
oh but it is
think of it for us to meet everything from the very beginning every sub atomic event every galactic cataclysm every step of evolution every act every accident every decision in
the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and i could be together right here and now
she is moved by his words but they make her strangely sad
cris pours two glasses of scotch
hands one to liz
to whatever happens next
she doesnt drink
thats why i went to the drug store
to get a pregnancy test
off his puzzlement she hands him a small plastic tab
a square cross is coming into focus
he recognizes the image from the donut shop display case just before he met liz for the first time
you know what this means
i do now
they look at each other equally perplexed
how did it
i have no idea
but that still doesnt explain
she struggles to make sense of it
liz i really did have this problem
i wasnt lying to you
he cant read her reaction
but this is good
this is amazing
i want this baby more than anything
she looks at him emotional
its like a miracle
for both of us
she lets him hold her
state troopers are camped out in twos and threes
fifty of them
plus baines six mps wearing different uniforms
cabin bedroom night liz and cris in bed
her head on his chest
this time hes the one sleeping while she lies awake
stakeout site night ferris and baines sip coffee and wait
they find each other attractive
baines think shell come through
ferris shakes her head with certainty
women hate good looking men
rejecting them makes us feel powerful
baines and thats more important than love
but she doesnt really love him
cabin bedroom night liz eases away from cris trying not to wake him
but settles back into slumber
she slithers out of bed and tiptoes to the bathroom
silently closes the door behind her
bathroom night liz stands there in the dark heart pounding
she sees that the window is open
she looks at it deciding
cabin day the morning sun on cris sleeping face
his foot slides in search of liz
not finding her he opens his eyes
checks the clock
he walks to the bedroom door
he tries to force it
tries the window
bars across it that werent there before
no ones around
hes about to shout but stops himself
runs into the bathroom
bars over that window too
as he stands there trapped ferris steps into view outside
cabin night cris eyes flash open in bed
liz isnt there
he throws off the covers pauses to scan ahead then rushes straight to the bathroom and throws open the door
liz is still there in the dark facing the open window
you lying bitch
you betrayed me
she darts for the window and starts to climb through
cris pulls her back by her robe
bars slide silently into place over the bathroom window locking them both in
blinding lights spike on throughout the forest converging like javelins at that cabin
snapback to int
cabin moments earlier cris throws open the bathroom door
liz is still there in the dark facing the open window
seeing the expression on his face she darts for the window
this time cris doesnt move
whispers liz please i love you
let me talk to you for one minute
i wont hurt you i promise
she turns around trembling
cris i know you dont mean to hurt people
but you need help or youre going to keep on hurting them
the man i killed was there to rob the store
he was going to panic and shoot five innocent people
how do you know this
because i saw them die
like yesterday with the car
you were afraid something bad might happen so you
those people died
they just hadnt died yet
his certainty is almost convincing
what if you hadnt done anything
have you ever waited to see what would happen
the trauma replays on his face
thats why i dont go out much
so i wont be there to see
liz doesnt know what to believe but she feels for him
stakeout site night ferris cavanaugh baines and rick are watching through night vision scopes
whats taking so long
we could just do this the old fashioned way
cabin bathroom night liz steps toward cris
cris youre a good man
and i will stand by you through this
but you have to
if they catch me theyll put me in a cell without a trial and theyll never let me out
they do that you know
i wont let it happen
ill get you a lawyer
suddenly distracted cris squints with that faraway gaze
he snaps out of it
theres one decent path
fixes her gaze but if were gonna stay on it i need you to do exactly what i say
how can she listen to this madman
will you give me one chance
one chance in exchange for a miracle
ferris cavanaugh baines and rick are getting worried
cavanaugh we cant wait any longer
weve got to go in
ferris looks at baines who doesnt encourage her
wait for my signal
cabin bathroom night liz listens dubious as cris crouches beneath the window sill scribbling a note on a scrap of paper
a few steps on your robe will get caught on a thornbush
you wont be able to get unstuck
ferris and a tough guy will come help you
shell say youve done your country a great service
surprise works to my advantage
and read this when youre safe
he tucks the note into her robe pocket
will i see you again
bet on it
she gathers her courage and steps to the open window
stakeout site everyone is coiled waiting for ferris to give the word
cavanaugh is on the radio with his men ready to pass it on
ferris takes a last look through the nightvision binoculars
thats when liz climbs awkwardly out of the bathroom window in her bathrobe
ferris shes coming now
to cavanaugh we stay put
disappointed via radio we stand pat till notified
dont make a sound
when liz is out of the cabin ferris activates the remote control
doors lock and bars slide into place almost inaudibly
stakeout site ferris shines a flashlight toward liz on off
she heads in the general direction of the light but stops behind a thick trunked oak tree which blocks her from their view
behind the oak tree cris backs out from under lizs robe
stakeout site ferris cavanaugh baines and rick shine their flashlights on the oak tree waiting for liz to reappear
whats she waiting for
liz steps into view from behind the oak tree
ferris shines the light towards her again
she heads straight toward them
as predicted the hem of her robe gets caught in the thorns
she tries to pull free but shes stuck
stakeout site ferris and baines wade into the thicket to extricate her
among the thorns ferris and baines reach liz
ferris youve done your country a great service
the predicted words hit her hard
then why do i feel like a traitor
ferris and baines free her and lead her up the hill
cris scurries away using the sound of their rustling to cover his escape
forest night cris scurries near a trio of state troopers
he steps on a twig which snaps loudly
pan back to find a second cris approaching down the same path
cris dissolves as cris steps around the twig and continues undetected
a few steps on cris slips on mud and slides noisily down a slope
pan back to find cris who detours onto stepping stones then rejoins the original path undetected
baines and ferris help liz back to their camp
ferris rick get her some coffee
liz pulls the note from her robe pocket and reads cris handwriting then why do i feel like a traitor
relays a message weve got movement in the canyon
to radio where are you
a flashlight shines up at cavanaugh from the canyon
ferris and baines scan their infra red scopes at the area
a hot human shape hurries over rough terrain with stealthy urgency
ferris and baines looking through their scopes
baines she told him
we tried it your way
ferris go for it
but i want him alive
cavanaugh picks up the radio with evident satisfaction
boys now its our turn
fifty searchlights blaze on and stab through the forest
i want him alive
cavanaugh afterthought to radio and the feds want him alive
ferris urgently takes baines aside
ferris we need to get to him first
spread out through the steep terrain
searchlight beams sweep over the landscape
moves erratically presciently in bursts dodging the streaking spots of glare
stakeout site liz is drinking coffee next to ricks police car
ferris approaches coldly knowing
youve made a very stupid mistake
i trust him more than i trust you
ferris i wouldnt swallow the i love you part
youve never even met him
but ive profiled him for months
and i can tell you this he doesnt love anybody
how could he
to him were not even human
ferris contd were the characters in a videogame and hes the player with the joystick
we say our lines and he practices his moves until we do what he wants
cris on foot running over rough terrain
state troopers converging
searchlight beams crisscrossing
a cone of light passes over cris
i got him
he finds himself face to face with two troopers guns aimed straight at him
cris tumbles draws fire serpentines through the woods feinting freezing unhittable moving closer
trooper take better aim
cris is within fighting distance
chop to an arm
punch to diaphragm
cris is now holding trooper s six shot revolver
cris does not fire after him
instead he takes aim at a searchlight at a great distance
then fires and scores a direct hit with the first shot
turns to a second search light
squeezes off a second shot
the lamp shatters
stakeout site night baines and ferris watch as around the mountain gunshots sound and searchlights go dark
baines you might be right about this guy
shakes her head i underestimated him
the searchlight next to her shatters
by a lot
cris gets pinned down behind a tree
a trooper keeps firing trying to drive him from hiding
cris boldly comes out from cover and runs giving the trooper a clear shot
but the trooper runs out of ammo at just that moment
stakeout site watching through binoculars speaking into radio
ferris be thorough gentlemen
if you leave a way out hell find it
baines well trained mps have set up a triangulated trap
they operate like skilled special forces commandos
one of them signals fingers to eyes that he has spotted cris
cris enters a clearing and continues straight into the trap
the team leader prepares to give the signal to shoot
cris movement flushes a stag from the hiding
it knocks over one mp and causes another to miss his shot
the leader sees the stag and scans around for cris
camera repositions to reveal that the stag now stands between cris and the leader
the leader shoots the stag killing him but not before cris dashes to cover in another stand of trees
two mps fire at cris
but shoot each other
team leader to radio ive got two men down
stakeout site ferris discouraged comes to a tough decision
to radio and baines change of plans everybody
ferris contd try to kill him
use everything youve got
is this a joke
no its an order
baines dont get emotional here
she wants baines to understand
theres only one way to beat this man
hes got to see his own death and not just maybe
hes got to see himself die again and again and know its inescapable
and then maybe hell surrender
baines and if he doesnt
thatll be his choice
and he was no use to us anyway
cris is suddenly the target of a turkey shoot
he hops around like a mountain goat while bullets ching off rocks and splinter trees
he stays alive but only by a hairs breadth
cris finds himself pinned down by four troopers
he rushes trooper one who fires and hits cris solidly in the chest
snapback to cris rushes the position of trooper two
before he gets there cris gets shot in the gut
cris rushes the third trooper who hesitates frightened then shoots and misses
cris charges up to him knocks his shooting arm away takes his weapon uses him a shield then fires at a fourth trooper as he charges out from the trees
its cavanaugh now covered in blood
cris uses trooper three as a shield but when cavanaugh comes charging from the trees cris doesnt fire
instead he shoves trooper three at cavanaugh sending them both tumbling down a slope
stakeout site another setback
fifty men might not be enough
somehow weve got to bring him down to our level
baines got any ideas
im workin on it
cris crosses a ridge that leads him into steep ravine
he cant get back up
stakeout site baines and ferris listen to the police band
liz stands nearby
she can hear the patter
hes crossed over into maxwell gorge
move in fast
keep him moving
dont let him rest
then it hits her
dont give him time to look ahead
thats the key
slowly making his way through the steep redwood covered slopes cris hears a noise
sees a state police suv crashing down the cliff across the gorge
cris catching his breath against a redwood opens his eyes and looks back toward his approaching pursuers
he looks around the gorge searching for the cliff where he foresaw the suv come crashing down
he recognizes the rock formations across the gorge
he heads in that direction
pan up and we see that the cliff is directly under the
stakeout site baines steps closer to the edge and looks down
hes heading this way
ferris suddenly confident shouts into the radio
weve got a fox hunt going in maxwell gorge right beneath the stakeout
throw everybody into it
we need to overload him
liz looks around for some way to help
she spots the state police suv that we saw crashing down the hillside
she sidles toward it
thirty troopers and six mps are converging on cris
gentlemen if he surrenders fine cuff him
but if he even shivers shoot to kill
stakeout site liz opens the door of the suv shifts into neutral and starts pushing
its too heavy to budge
cris moves toward a field of large boulders
stakeout site slowly with great effort liz gets the suv to inch forward
troopers and mps are closing in on cris
cavanaugh megaphone lie down on your stomach hands behind your head
youve got ten seconds
ten seconds and we shoot
cris climbs in among the large boulders glances up and waits for the future to happen
stakeout site liz gets the suv onto a slight downslope and it picks up speed
baines and ferris see the suv rumbling straight toward them
they dive out of the way as the suv plunges over the ledge
troopers and mps are advancing toward cris about to open fire
this is your last warning
thirty troopers and mps have their fingers on the trigger when the suv sails over the ledge and plummets straight down towards them
cris crouches down among the boulders just as the suv crashes on top of him then tumbles toward his hunters who scatter
cris makes a run for it just as the suv explodes in a fireball
ferris and baines watch the events below
ferris keep after him
stay on him
while they are distracted liz climbs into the front seat of ricks police cruiser cranks it up slams into reverse spins and takes off down the road
baines what the
fishtails down the twisting mountain road
cris practically mud skis down the slope
troopers and mps hurtle after him
at the bottom cris is carried by momentum onto the creekside into the path of a police car that comes careening around a curve
liz at the wheel
she swerves and slams on the brakes skidding and screeching to a halt
troopers and mps slalom onto the road from the incline and rush after cris
cris makes it to the car
believe me now
he climbs in and guns it
im getting used to miracles
three mps grab onto the cars mirrors and door handles
cris weaves violently until they lose their grip and fly off
in ricks police cruiser dawn liz and cris grin at each other
where were you going
i was just trying to be unpredictable
stakeout site dawn ferris urgently unrolls a road map and studies it
in ricks police cruiser dawn cris speeds down the treacherous curves
so whats the plan
bonnie and clyde
cris remember that place in the south pacific
its starting to sound really good
he pulls out his cell phone
ill check on our ride
las vegas penthouse dawn neal a ish tycoon with silvery hair finishes packing an expensive suitcase
a high maintenance showgirl puts the finishing touches on her make up in his marble bathroom
somebodys cell phone plays the theme from peter gunn
pan across eight large suitcases his and hers ready to go and find guy on the sofa watching cnbc financial news
he reaches into a coat pocket and flips open his handset
guy signals neal
this is the call they were expecting
guy no the jets not sold
im here with him now
of course hes pissed
i can ask
with a smirk of triumph he turns to neal
guy he wants to know how soon the jet can be ready
neal conceals his evident satisfaction
neal ill wait until eight oclock
but if hes not there im taking off without him
ricks police cruiser dawn cris driving fast on the treacherous winding road closes his cell phone
cris its arranged
but we have to get to the north vegas airport by eight
will we make it
he concentrates as he screeches around a curve
right now im just trying to stay alive
they hit a patch of ice
ricks police cruiser swings over the side and tumbles down a steep slope
there will be no survivors
hold on curve
ricks police cruiser speeds into view again
but this time cris steers around the ice patch skids dangerously almost goes over the side but continues safely downhill
ricks police cruiser liz palpitating tries to catch her breath
christ you live dangerously
just the opposite
i never take chances
cavanaughs car speeds into view skids on the same patch of ice and skates over the side of the road as cris did the first time
there will be no survivors
and no second chances
as a federal chopper idles ferris marks up a road map of the area with xs
to radio cavanaugh get all your men into town
baines hes dead
ferris winces then moves on like a general in battle
you take command of the chase
hands him the map have cars block these intersection
she heads over to the copter
get in the chopper
he follows her inside and the copter takes off
cris takes blind curves at high speed
did the doctors ever say why you couldnt have kids
i grew up at love canal
a neighborhood back east built over a chemical dump
a bunch of my friends had birth defects
looks back i always figured i was lucky just to be sterile
except youre not
and neither am i
were different thats all
we just had to find the right match
a look between them
and somehow we did
they approach the entrance to the town
hendersonville dawn police vehicles converge on the area systematically blocking the intersections that ferris indicated
ricks police cruiser cris threads his way through town zigging and zagging down streets and alleys
ferris sees cris maneuvering perfectly through the maze avoiding imminent traps and confrontation
discouraged he doesnt miss a beat
pleased to herself come to momma
cris dodges another trap
to radio stay after him
keep the pressure on
the bypassed police cars chase after ricks stolen cruiser which leaves town on a street that merges with a windy narrow incredulous hes driving right into it
up ahead beyond a blind curve the road leads to a one lane bridge over a deep chasm with raging rapids at the bottom
sometimes looking one step ahead isnt enough
on the far side of the bridge out of sight beyond a curve eight state police cars form a barricade across the road
ricks police cruiser day having escaped from town cris and liz share a glimmer of relief
you make it look easy
cris expression darkens
liz what is it
i blew it
they round a curve and the narrow bridge comes into view
behind the barricade ferris helicopter comes in for a landing
ricks police cruiser day cris checks his rearview mirror
a six pack of cop cars are right behind him
to his left a steep rock wall
to his right a vertical drop off into the canyon
cris drives on the blood draining from his face
ferris strides across the span baines in her wake
arriving at the barricade she approaches the biggest state police car a hummer and flashes her badge
i need your vehicle
she walks through the trooper and gets into his hummer
whats the plan
dont be stupid
he knows what youll do
but so do i
and for once that makes us even
she starts up the hummer
cris slams on the brakes
stops the car
police cars stop behind him blocking retreat
she hustles out
liz whats going to happen
cris well find out
a quick look good bye and he drives on
ferris gathers her determination and floors it
a game of chicken with a difference
fast forward to the head on collision
then a collage of alternate choices and outcomes cris swerves slams on the brakes gets shot making a run for the rail spins out on the roadbed crashes over the
side over the side over the side
but in every version the hummer is unchanging
theyre speeding closer
no doubts or decisions
the falling car crashes onto the canyon wall tumbles downhill explodes falls again this time crashing directly onto boulders at the bottom
he drives toward a specific segment of railing between two light posts
ricks cruiser crashes through the railing and plunges over the side of the bridge
liz runs to the rail and leans over the side watching the cruiser fall down down down through the narrow ravine
cris unbuckles his seat belt
opens the door
just before impact he leaps out away from the car
the car smashes into boulders at the shallow side of the river
a moment later cris splashes a few yards away in the deepest part of the rapids
ferris peers down into the canyon
cris bobs to the surface and is carried away by the fierce current
the smashed cruiser also gets carried into the river
fighting the current cris watches as the smashed police cruiser surges ahead of him then disappears
perplexed for a beat he suddenly understands and desperately swims for a rock and clambers onto it
camera pulls back to reveal that cris is stuck in the middle of the river about five feet from where it drops off into a waterfall
flies over him
cris looks for a way out
seeing none he jumps
and is swallowed up in dark thunderous death
snapback to still on the rock
looks up and sees a cable being lowered from the helicopter
he looks around
is there another way out
out of choices he reaches for the cable
loses his balance
at the last second he steadies himself
he wants to live
the cable dangles back into range
cris grabs it
the cable is hooked to a pair of handcuffs
watches through binoculars as cris snaps one cuff around his wrist and waits
she shouts into her radio
cuffs on both wrists
leave him if he doesnt
baines what can he do hanging by one arm
i dont want to find out
baines speaks to cris via loudspeaker
baines both wrists
on the rock cris defeated attaches the second cuff to his other wrist
he is lifted up into the air hanging by both arms
bridge liz sits handcuffed in the back of a second u
i was wrong about one thing
he is capable of love
descends with cris hanging below by a cable
mps are waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around cris then tape him like a mummy up to his neck
when hes bound as securely as hannibal lecter ferris steps close and gets her first good look at him
ferris cris johnson we meet at last
why does everybody have amnesia but me
i only ask one thing from you
give me a chance to earn your trust
cris i did and you failed
she seems genuinely surprised
then give me another chance
you get em all the time
she signals and cris is dumped into the waiting helicopter
the door is slammed behind him
helicopter day inside cris is surprised to find himself alone with liz
he edges closer so they can hear each other
dont let them know youre pregnant
the helicopter takes off
cris you dont have to raise him
but at least let him be born
can you do that
it might be the only chance either of us gets
they gaze at each other with intense longing
work with them cris
so we can be together
he shakes his head fatalistic
ill get us out of here
we can still make the plane
she knows its hopeless
homeland security vegas office day coming into view by air
homeland security medical lab day med techs perform a battery of tests on cris and liz
wisdom baines and ferris watch through glass in an adjoining room
wisdom are you out of your mind
did you ever play chicken before
this game was different
he knew i wouldnt flinch
baines covertly makes the big balls gesture with two clawed hands
wisdom nods knowingly
baines whats new with the code orange
its red now
and were out of leads
ferris then you better hope hes what i say he is
please make me a believer
size of an elevator
cris stands there bound ankle and wrist
click the metal shackles open automatically and drop to the floor
cris reaches down for them
struggles to lift them
observation room day ferris baines and wisdom peer down into the white vestibule through a window
technicians operate a control panel
wisdom arent you being a little over cautious
not possible with him
she leans forward flips a toggle
down below in the vestibule a door slides open
cris please step into the next room
cris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward
size of a squash court
cris enters gingerly and peers around
twenty feet up an observation window opaque
on the other walls rifle barrels poke through narrow slits
the door slides shut behind him
observation room ferris leans forward and speaks
cris well be firing at you with live ammo
are you ready
wisdom youre shooting your secret weapon
ferris signals wisdom to be patient
cris just stands there flatfooted arms folded unafraid
a techie presses a button
the three rifles cris is hit square in the chest
by three blue paintballs
cris youre paying for the shirt
wisdom unconvinced i hope youve got more than that
now we are going to use live ammo
not on my watch youre not
i promise you he wont be hit
wisdom looks her in the eye
sees her certainty
its your experiment
ferris leans toward a microphone but before she can speak
from now on cris the bullets are real
ferris sits back and nods to the techies to proceed
cris balances at the ready as the three rifles take aim at him
he lunges at the very instant that one rifle fires
a bullet zings by his ear
as the second rifle fires cris contorts and a bullet parts his hair
as the third rifles fires he tumbles away almost a blur
more shots in rapid sequence erratic rhythm
two at a time
three at a time
like a pinball cris pivots crouches dodges every bullet
then suddenly stops
an easy target
click click click the guns are out of bullets
hes almost impossible to shoot hit surprise capture or contain
mind if i try
be my guest
wisdom takes out his handgun carefully aims and discharges six shots at cris doesnt score a hit
wisdom how do you know its prevision
maybe hes reading minds
ferris shows the aiming gantries to wisdom
no minds to read
the guns are aimed automatically by infrared
wisdom impressed what other tricks can he do
ferris pushes a toggle and a pocket door slides open in a wall
ferris to cris please step into the next room
no need for a hotfoot
baines explains to wisdom the floor is electrified
he must have tried resisting and foreseen the result
cris walks through the doorway into
which is familiar from the opening sequence but not exactly the same
because its not exactly the same future
a heavy chair bolted to the floor faces a plasma screen monitor on the wall
to the left of the screen is a mirror to the right a digital clock calendar
ferris face appears on the monitor
ferris on monitor cris its time to get started with the next test
this wont be unpleasant
we just need to you sit in the chair
cris eyes the chair with suspicion
ferris on monitor i want you to look ahead tell me the time on the clock and then tell me what film clip you see playing
lets start with five minutes from now
then well press ahead as far as youre capable of
to wisdom the clips have been assembled at random by a computer so nobody knows whatll be playing next
cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected as an old man
he turns away
cris look ill stand here and tell you what i see
ferris on monitor im afraid we need you to sit
ferris on monitor why not
i know what happens
ferris on monitor tell us
you tie me down and never let me out
wisdom looks at ferris
she shrugs sheepish
ferris thats only because you wont cooperate
because youre trying to force me
ferris work with us cris and you can be a hero
fight us and things will get worse and worse
cris squints frustrated looking for a way out
ferris on monitor severe now sit in the chair
ferris switches the toggle
the sizzle of electricity
cris hops and jumps in agony
ferris turns away then makes herself look
whoa you are one tough bitch
were still in a code red if im not mistaken
she turns off the juice
he knew hed get shocked but he chose to resist
hes almost never had to face consequences
flips toggle cris are you ready to get in the chair
cris recovering shoots her the finger
she switches the toggle again and leaves it on
wisdom doesnt have the stomach to watch
we need information right
cris collapses unconscious
leave him there
well start again when he recovers
wisdoms office day wisdom and ferris are both traumatized by the torture
okay how do we use him to find the bombs
we make him watch the news and tell us about it
how far ahead can he see
i dont know
but i suspect we can increase his range with practice
especially if we restrict his future to only watching news
then hell be like a timescope
you were right
this is huge
this is just for starters
you want to stage a pre emptive strike he can tell you if youll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong
and you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin
wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential
wisdom and all hes ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud
ferris i know its amazing but hes not ambitious
wisdom damn how will we control this guy when he figures out what hes capable of
ferris we control him now
we just have to keep it that way
right now sweetheart we cant even get him to sit in a chair
dread suddenly washes over wisdom
weve got to think this through
your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists
ferris arent you running ahead of yourself
with this guy you have to
or itll be over before it begins
ferris so well keep him in chains
that may not be enough
we may have to cut off his arms and legs
then i might start to feel safe
ferris grins uncomfortably
ferris youre not serious
think about it
what were talking about here is the next step in human evolution
and im not gonna make the same mistake the neanderthals made when they ran across this good looking homo sapien fellow and all the lady neanderthals said hes so cute
lets keep him around
can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time
you mean after its too late
ferris seems to come around to wisdoms logic
ferris i wish youd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump
they are both filled with dread
wisdom you think he knows
white room cris on the floor
his expression hardens
corridors ferris and wisdom stride through the facility almost at a run
wisdom i havent made any firm decisions
maybe we will just keep him tied up
i told you he doesnt read minds
he sees the results
cris rises from the floor into a crouched position like an animal ready to pounce
the door flies open and a dozen armed mps charge in rifles at the ready and surround cris
cris checks the time on the digital clock
corridors ferris and wisdom getting closer hes on a cellphone
wisdom tell baines to meet us there
and bring a dozen men
motionless in a crouch
cris suddenly dashes between two mps shoves them aside makes for the door
he gets smashed by the rifle butts of the nearest ones then stomped by the full contingent
attempt area outside the white room ferris and wisdom arrive and look through the window
cris is alone in the room in that crouched position
what weve just seen
hasnt happened yet
baines arrives with the dozen armed mps we saw in the previous scene
wait for my signal then go in and surround him
wisdom and ferris hurry upstairs into the observation booth
we pass through the wall into the
white room where in some future cris is once again surrounded by the dozen mps who are actually outside waiting to charge in
suddenly cris pounces low at one soldiers hips shoving him into the soldier next to him which knocks over a third soldier
cris dashes for the door but four mps pull him away before he can get out
attempt observation room ferris and wisdom enter and look down at cris who crouches alone motionless in the white room
ferris prepares to speak to him
ill do the talking
wisdom goes to the microphone
cris this eric wisdom
im the director of this facility
wisdom contd were in the middle of a code red and wed like your help in preventing a major catastrophe
i dont believe you
outside white room baines and the dozen mps wait ready to charge in
i apologize for the way youve been treated
agent ferris got a little carried away
white room cris once again surrounded by the same dozen mps suddenly punches one of them kicks another and now has the mobility to start using his tai chi moves
but the other mps gang up on him and pile on burying him under their weight
attempt wisdom o
could i ask you as a favor to please sit in the chair so we can begin
observation room wisdom and ferris watch as cris still just crouches there motionless alone in the empty room
he checks the clock
just minutes before the mps will charge into the room
cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they cant enter
he gets shoved aside by the force of the mps as they charge in
attempt observation room wisdom and ferris watch as cris still just crouches there motionless in the empty room
wisdom flicks off the mike
wisdom whats he doing
ferris looking ahead
to microphone cris time is running out
white room cris is again crouched and surrounded by the dozen mps
wisdom plasma screen we need your cooperation right away
suddenly cris attacks using his tai chi skills
he outfights four of them but then is subdued by the others
attempt snapback cris is again crouched and surrounded by the dozen mps
wisdom plasma screen cris dont you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
your ability could save so many lives
suddenly he repeats the martial arts attack but refines it beating six mps this time before being subdued
attempt cris is again crouched and surrounded by the dozen mps
wisdom plasma screen cris dont you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
your ability could save so many lives
faster and faster over and over cris relives the attack perfecting his movements finding new opportunities
his skill increases with each iteration as he anticipates every soldiers action and counters it with the greatest economy of means
attempts the fight takes on the quality of choreography as the mps seem to step right into cris punches and kicks
cris flips and throws them into each other leveraging their movements to achieve his goals with perfect efficiency
but cris still cant quite get out the door
looking down at cris still crouched there alone
dont give him time
send them in now
baines do it
white room baines gives the signal and the dozen waiting mps charge in through the door rifles at the ready
the foreseen attack is now beginning in real time
white room the mps surround cris as foreseen
he remains in the center of them crouched motionless
for a long beat they just stand there rifles aimed at their frozen quarry
wisdom plasma screen cris dont you feel some sense of obligation to the rest of us
your ability could save so many lives
cris suddenly attacks
and with perfect economy of movement like a diver executing thirteen twists in the second before he hits the water cris executes the previous routine with a new finale and
elegantly slips past all the mps into the hall and slams the door behind him locking them in
the escape has the quality of magic
it takes a beat for the mps to realize what has happened
observation booth wisdom and ferris are agog
wisdom what happened
ferris draws her gun and charges down the stairs
outside white room cris is waiting for her and somehow he has her gun in his hand
cris dont make me do what i can do
cris spins and shoots wisdom in the shin as he starts down the stairs
dont get too attached to your arms and legs
cris spins and gets the drop on baines
baines sets down his gun
cris takes off
dont let him out of here alive
baines opens the door to the white room
mps stampede out in hot pursuit
baines isolate the building
if theres one exit overlooked hell know it
if theres one soft heart one slow shooter hell know it
ferris attends to wisdom bleeding on the stairs
ferris dont worry
i caught him once ill catch him again
i dont want anything to happen to you
they care about each other more than theyve let on
mps and general security police close behind
no place to hide
soldiers open fire
cris dives for the floor tumbles gets to his feet serpentines and ends up behind a door that opens at the moment as if by mental command shielding him from
security police pour out from the other side
cris reaches around and grabs someones gun
he opens fire buying himself enough cover to get to a doorway
cris stops thinks then charges out shooting fighting running completing a condensed burst of four impossible tasks that get him to the next point of refuge
he waits thinks charges and with another burst of choreographed action makes it into an elevator whose doors conveniently open at that moment
he darts inside keeps shooting presses certain buttons starting several stories up and waits for the doors to close
sergeant you five up
you five down
the rest stay with me
banks of monitors each containing a grid of mini frames containing the pov of a surveillance camera hundreds in all
leo the soldier at the console is twitchy and hyper alert
leo watches as the security forces split up
he scans the monitors to see where cris will resurface
cris climbs up through the ceiling panel
elevator shaft day when the elevator stops he rips open a ventillation duct and climbs inside
fielding approaches wisdom with a syringe
i need to be alert
get him a local
amanda ferris junior analyst rushes in with lab reports
amanda you asked for these as soon as they were ready
amanda you might want to check this result
she points to a particular page
impatient ferris reads
her eyes widen
ferris how pregnant
amanda a few days
ferris turns to wisdom
this is getting interesting
we have a mating pair
secure the female
liz sits in a waiting room by herself reading a magazine
she looks up at the camera
unscrew the vent
she moves a chair under the vent and prepares to stand on it
the door opens and several mps march in
to liz were here to protect you
without looking up at cris she moves the chair back against the wall and sits in it
cris frustrated shimmies back through the vent
leo checks all the video screens
cris is nowhere
leo he must be in the walls
settling in cris looks at his watch
he concentrates and time speeds by until a flashlight beam lights up the duct from a distance
i found him
as more security police and flashlights fill the shaft cris checks his watch
which is once again dark quiet and empty
cris looks at his watch
cris to himself sixteen minutes
cris takes a deep breath and crawls forward
remarkably he seems to be crawling out of his motionless body like a snake shedding its skin
in fact cris lies there in deep concentration while cris creeps onward
cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office
he opens the door walks into a corridor and strides forward preternaturally calm
he advances through an unfolding panorama of stage sets on which different hypothetical scenarios play out one at a time several simultaneously or layered in like the melodic themes in
a round or fugue creating the visual equivalent of harmony and counterpoint
cris encounters security police searching for him
when they discover cris they aim their weapons at him
he checks the time
snapback a few seconds
he hides before they arrive
he goes through a door into a room
people are there
hides in a different room
cris searches the room
looks in the desk drawers
puts things in his pockets
the door flies open
security police find him and shoot
cris treads down empty corridors
he multiplies into a legion of cris johnsons duplicated again and again as he explores room after room searching them sequentially
he spends much time in a handymans storeroom while other cris johnsons fade away
cris finds the surveillance room with leo in charge
cris scans the room
he is seen
he waits to see who will shoot him first
he is hit in the chest
cris gets caught by two security police
he fights them takes their guns but gets killed by reinforcements
cris waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door as his pov fast forwards and he charts the comings and goings of the search parties until
they discover him at which point he snapsback and hides in a different room
hes hiding in many rooms simultaneously
piecing together the schedule of the patrol in that corridor
the same situations repeat
scanning for security cameras
he goes down a stairwell
one version of himself exits at a landing
a second iteration of himself continues to the next floor down
at that landing two iterations of himself turn in different directions left and right
we follow the one that went to the left
he sees mps taking liz from her holding room and escorting her somewhere else
he is waiting in several locations watching to see where the mps will emerge with liz
the mps and liz emerge from an elevator in one of the locations
the other cris fade out
liz is ushered into a room and locked inside
four guards depart
two guards remain posted outside
they see cris
he runs down stairs
into the corridor
into the room directly under the room where liz is being held
cris enters a forensics lab where the captured bomb is being studied
there is a barrel of c plastic explosive
mps in the room turn on him and open fire
cris is blasted and falls to the floor dead
cris where he started motionless as a hibernating bear exploring his futures
camera passes through walls floors ceilings and finds baines rushing through the corridors
wisdoms office where wisdom paces with one crutch while ferris sits on a sofa like rodins thinker in concentration almost as deep as cris
baines he hasnt gotten out through any exit
the bad news is
wisdom youve lost him
im issuing infrared to all my men
we should have a fix in a few minutes
you realize if he gets away now well never get him back
hell be out there and hell be our enemy
ferris looks up
ferris i know how to flush him out
baines at a loss fine
tell me what to do
the thought crystallizes as she speaks
we dont actually have to do anything
beat we just have to decide to do something
ferris shudders at the dark brilliance of her own idea
ground floor of facility day guards stand in a solid line
no way out
cris off to one side in a niche just inside the door
camera pans and finds a second cris standing back away from an exit
pans and finds a legion of cris johnsons duplicated again and again trying each exit
at one dim exit he lies on the ground charred and dead next to the gauntlet of mps he has tried to outrun
wisdoms office wisdom and baines are looking at each other appalled then turn to ferris
you want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman
threats dont count
when he foresees that you actually did kill her that shes dead
beat he wont let it happen
hell come to us
and shell live
wisdom regards her with perverse admiration
but it only works if were not bluffing
because hell know
wisdom considers the decision that lies ahead for him
cris is still trying to get out the front door but theres one soldier call him crack shot who kills cris repeatedly
cris snapsback and tries various tactics but he cant get past crack shot alive
he gives up
turns and runs back into the heart of the building
cris mental pov expands to include the entire facility like a crystal doll house
simultaneously he is observing every room present in every room charting the place testing possible actions
the facility is a bee hive of activity
a bee hive that accelerates to fast forward until all times are simultaneous
until the simultaneous activity is made even denser by the accumulated layers of possibility
cris spies ferris and wisdom walking together
he follows them for a while until he is discovered
cris fades out
the ferris and wisdom who saw him fade out
but another ferris and wisdom continue through the building and their trail gets picked up by cris who has detoured in order to encounter them
as cris goals are accomplished superfluous versions of himself fade away
the surveillance of a sequence of ferris and wisdoms is continued by cris then cris who watches as wisdom and ferris approach two guards standing outside an interrogation room
we recognize them as the mps who are guarding liz inside
wisdom is let into the interrogation room by the mps
ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone
snapback to ventillation duct cris comes out of his trance
checks his watch
sixteen minutes have passed
cris composes his thoughts takes a breath then crawls forward leaving no cris behind
now its for real
a moment after he rounds a corner a flashlight beam stabs into the duct that he vacated
it scans around
the situations that cris has just previewed from the ventillator shaft constitute the raw material that he will now re craft into a single narrative the story of his actual
escape attempt staged in long takes unfolding in almost real time
when appropriate to illustrate cris ability we will portray several locations simultaneously via split screens which change in number size shape and placement
the ventillator grill pops open
cris drops to the floor
he grabs a backpack conveniently hanging on a hook
without the slightest hesitation he goes from shelf to box to drawer loading particular objects into the backpack
a door opens
cris steps out into the hall carrying the backpack and a foot stool
he stays close to a wall steps on the foot stool and spray paints over the lens of a surveillance camera
leo spots cris as he blinds one camera after another
leo ive got him
third level building c
pete brian get up there
kyle block off the west staircase
jason bring your dogs in from the east
soldier pete and soldier brian charge into an empty corridor and begin their search for cris
a door slams open bashing pete in the face
cris breaks his shooting arm grabs his m hides behind the door and sprays bullets low hitting brian in the shins
he runs to brian breaks his shooting arm takes his rifle
drags brian and pete into an open room
tapes their mouths
baines arrives and takes command
leo he was on third level seventy seconds ago
baines but where is he now
cris pours floor polish in specific places
soldier kyle and his troop charge out off the stairwell
each one steps directly into the polish and slips
as they fall cris punches them out or puts them in chokeholds utilizing the elegant minimum of force or violence
as soon as they are unconscious cris takes their guns tear gas and a gas mask
soldier jason and three troops are on the way each with a cris lies in wait for the patrol
when they appear he is perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a quick spritz
he goes back and sprays them again to keep them out of commission
surveillance room cris appears on several screens
hes on this floor
hes coming here
the door opens
a tear gas canister flies in
a moment later cris charges in wearing a gas mask
he opens fire at the video monitors shattering every one
by the time the mps are ready to respond cris reaches and grabs baines handgun
he swings out into the corridor with baines gun in his hand
without looking his hand aims and shoots several times
emerging into the hallway cris looks down at the end of the hall and sees two mps falling to the floor wounded
cris wraps electrical tape around the door handle and a pipe on the wall sealing the room shut then turns and maces the last of the dogs
as the tear gas clears the damage is visible
every monitor in the surveillance system has been shattered
leo coughing feels his way to a phone
wisdom answers on speakerphone
he blinded us
and the dogs are useless
ferris stares at wisdom expectantly
hes getting away
cris on the run encounters crack shot not where he was seen in prevision
crack shot reaches for his gun
cris breaks his arm before crack shot can fire
wisdom on the phone
ferris watching in suspense
any developments on the code red
let me know if there are
he hangs up discouraged
dials a number
baines bring the girl friend to the interrogation room
to ferris ill deal with her there
cris sneaks into room where he foresaw that liz will be brought
the door is recognizable by its industrial look
where liz is being baby sat by four mps
were moving her
cris writes a note
slips it onto a side table
opens the drawer of a desk
writes in it
puts something inside
baines and the four mps arrives with liz
baines liz and two mps wait while two officers carefully open the door and check out the room
we expect them to find cris
but they dont
outside in the hall a pencil rolls on the floor toward liz
she notices it and looks where it came from
sees cris hiding behind a janitors cart
he puts his fist over his heart
gesture of love
the two mps in the room signal for liz to be brought inside
two mps outside the room bring her in
baines stays on guard outside
while the guards stand on alert liz sits in a chair and discovers a piece of paper on a side table placed exactly where her hand has come to rest
on the paper in pencil a square with a square cross within
she flips over the note
it reads go crazy
she considers then screams as loud as she can while running around wildly
hearing the commotion baines opens the door
behind his back cris steps from hiding opens the door to a room and slips inside closing the door just as baines looks back
the mps force liz into a chair behind a desk
sit there and shut up
liz sees a drawer which is partially open
she looks inside
sees a hefty pair of scissors
inside the drawer a message is written on the wood
she looks at a clock in the room
but wisdom isnt there
wisdom and ferris walking
you understand whats at stake here
were playing for the future
not just what happens next but what the future is
what the rules are
ferris contd if one man will know it and control it and have power over the rest of us
or if well have power over him
by killing an innocent woman
she looks him in the eye
if you want ill pull the trigger
i think that might be
she accepts the terrible responsibility
ill join you in a minute
i need to take care of some details
wisdom turns to baines
get more men up here
ferris walks to a nearby office and goes inside
liz anxiously checks the clock
and still no wisdom
then the door opens
and wisdom enters
they study each other neither knowing the others plans
she glances aside at the clock
she picks up the phone
dials a number
this is ferris
ill need a chopper tanked up and ready
behind her cris steps out of hiding
by the time she sees him his forearm is around her neck
at liz grabs the scissors lunges at wisdom and stabs at his neck
he raises his arm in time to block the blow
the two mps in the room fight her off calling to the sentinels outside
baines and the sentinels rush in to help
when the corridor is empty and no one is looking the door to ferris office opens and cris emerges with ferris as his hostage
mps drag liz away from ferris
not listening where the hell did she get the scissors
cris and ferris make their way toward the entrance
they come across a patrol
the mps take aim
cris holds his gun to ferris head
hold your fire
gets on the radio weve got the target in plain sight in corridor c but hes holding a hostage
interrogation room baines on the radio turns to wisdom
you wont believe this
hes got ferris
i dont know but hes on his way to the front door
beat they want instructions
wisdom thinks hard
then how are we going to stop him
we let him go
its part of the plan
baines tries not to be insubordinate
youre sure about this
no but ferris is
wisdom takes a deep breath then grabs liz by the arm and aims his gun at her head
i hope he loves you as much as i love her
cris marches ferris through the building flanked by security police who aim at him but hold their fire
wisdoms voice comes over the public address system
ive got your girl friend
we know her condition
that gets his attention
something very bad will happen at six oclock unless youre back in custody
to ferris he hasnt got the balls
well find out wont we
interrogation room wisdom holds liz at gunpoint
she seems remarkably calm
youre not going to kill me
thats what the bad guys do
in war you have to be as ruthless as your enemy
emphatic cris isnt the enemy
i didnt mean him
near lobby where crack shot repeatedly nailed cris
this time crack shots shooting arm is in a sling and he crouches next to a substitute sniper who lies in wait
cris walks into view and fires one shot which wings the substitute sniper causing him to miss his shot at cris
cris pulls ferris to the next location
wisdom and liz
he watches the clock
now shes afraid
cant you just leave us alone
he shakes his head trying to gather courage
another sniper takes aim at a section of hallway that cris is approaching
as cris enters the snipers field of vision he shifts ferris to a different position blocking the shot
as they pass under him ferris sees the sniper above
cris takes aim at an empty space and fires just as a soldier charges from hiding and absorbs the bullet as if deliberately catching it with his body
god youre remarkable
cris breaks a window
tosses a grenade outside
i wish you had a little more sense of duty
id say you have way too much
the grenade explosion attracts many of the guards
cris and ferris slip out the front door where the guards were previously stationed
he addresses a soldier in a patrol car
give me your keys
the soldier obeys
cris shoves ferris into the car and gets in after her
to soldier if i see you ill kill her
they drive off
interrogation room wisdom agonized is about to pull the trigger
liz trembling sees that hes going to do it
car day driving away
ferris realizes that cris escape is going to be successful
she checks her watch
you know what our problem is
we got off on the wrong foot
he has taken the words right out of her mouth
all been a big misunderstanding
weve never meant you any harm
it sounds so insincere when you say it
i guess youre a better liar than i am
you know what im going to say next
itll never happen
she offers her card
my door will be open
we can start from scratch
he takes it
the phone number stands out cferris
flips the card out the window
the magic word is cooperate
thats all weve ever wanted to hear from you
a helicopter lands on the road ahead blocking the way
when are they going to give up
after youre dead
cris holds his gun threateningly to ferris head
two mps get out of the helicopter carrying something heavy
cris reacts to what he cant see yet
they are carrying a body
they remove the hood from its head
quaking with rage cris prepares to shoot ferris
homeland security corridors day twenty minutes earlier
cris is marching ferris through the corridors to the exit
ferris i wish you had a little more sense of duty
cris stops in his tracks quaking with rage
to a gang of murderers
ferris seems pleased
i see you got our message
he checks his watch
whats about to happen
youve brought it on yourselves
cris changes course and charges into a
which he descends at a run roughly dragging ferris with him
ferris its not too late cris
you can save her
im planning on it
cris shoves ferris in front of him as a shield
approaching a turn in the stairs he fires blindly
rounding the turn he sees his would be assassin collapsing dead
wisdom keeps his gun aimed at lizs head as he watches the clock pm
soldier hes heading this way
cris charges out of the stairwell shooting without hesitation forward left right back efficiently targeting security police in the precise order of their imminent readiness to fire at him
for each bullet one soldier dies
wisdoms voice comes over the p
johnson this is wisdom
you have five minutes to turn yourself in
cris and ferris keep moving
or your worst nightmare will happen
cris marches right up to the interrogation room where wisdom holds liz prisoner using ferris as a human shield
look ahead if you dont believe me
cris opens the door to the room revealing wisdom ferris and thirty security police and mps who take aim at him and fire
cris gets chopped to pieces
snapback to cris crouches on the floor outside the interrogation room reaches up and opens the door
he gets off a shot at wisdom who lives long enough to put a bullet in lizs heart
snapback to cris uses ferris as a shield gets off a burst of shots at wisdom killing him instantly
but a soldier at wisdoms side puts a bullet in lizs heart then the thirty security personnel blast cris and ferris to pieces
snapback to cris dragging ferris arrives at the level of the interrogation room and continues down one more flight
using ferris as a human shield he shoots his way into
where cris previously saw the seized barrel of c explosive
he guns down several armed mps whom he knows would be present then threatens the technicians
cris locks himself and ferris inside
cris goes over to the bomb
squints for a beat
in fast forward condensed time multiple snapback he goes through the whole learning curve on bomb detonation blowing himself up and snapping back to life several times before figuring out
the right way to set it off
wisdom holds liz at arms length with his gun pointed at her head
watching the clock count up to pm
cris moves the bomb
closes his eyes for a beat
moves the bomb again
closes his eyes
sets the detonator to seconds
mps wait preparing to gun down cris when he emerges
the door opens
ferris sprints out
ferris its going off in ten seconds
the crowd flees with her
wisdom watches the clock count advance
cris runs for it
as wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger the bomb explodes in a giant cataclysm
smoke and dust roiling
the center of the building is gone
a jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and up
to the side on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a wall
the only person remaining
she has survived by inches
as she recovers from the blast a door opens behind her
cris appears extends a hand and helps her from her perch
north vegas airport night a private jet warms up on the tarmac
private jet night cris and liz bound up the entry steps exhausted but elated
at the door no one is present to greet them
they continue into the main cabin where neal the showgirl the pilots and the flight attendant are glued to the television
neal sees cris and liz but hardly acknowledges them
hes in shock
they all are
cris and liz turn to the tv
tv newscaster o
the situation in chicago is not quite as severe as in the other nine cities where the dirty bombs exploded as prevailing winds blew the nuclear waste across lake michigan
rather than straight into town
radiation levels in detroit on the other hand may require the entire city to be evacuated
liz and cris look at each other ashen
this is what they wanted you to prevent
and you wouldnt help
they didnt explain
they were trying to force me
liz shakes her head incredulous
cris they were gonna make me a slave
she looks at cris like hes scum and heads for the front of the plane
where are you going
liz to the doctor
she walks out of the jet and down the steps
shes not coming with us
cris stands there bereft and watches her go
he has run out of futures
tears escaping from his eyes
rotate frame and discover that the previous cut was actually a
where cris lies in bed with lizs head on his chest the morning after their first night p
since that point cris has been up for hours scanning the futures
finding no path worth taking
wisdoms house dawn ferris sleeps next to wisdom
shes hogged the covers
her cell phone rings
drowsily she answers
this is cris johnson
she sits up
where did you get this number
lizs kitchen dawn cris is dressed
cris i want to cooperate
thats music to my ears
but i have conditions
im sure we can work something out
lizs bed dawn liz
cris sits next to her on the bed
her eyes flicker open
she sees him looking down at her like an angel
liz come back to bed
i have to go
incredulous youre not leaving
theres something i have to do
something youd want me to do
and i cant put it off any longer
what do i care
liz its not like that
i searched for you for a long time
i want to be with you forever
dont overdo it
we just met last night
but a lot has happened since then
while i was sleeping
he proceeds with difficulty
were going to have a child
then you really are an angel
i dont expect you to believe me
but when you do find out remember that we came together for a reason
that this wasnt just
it was a special chance for both of us
seeing his misery she softens
then why are you running away from me
he holds back tears
im taking the long way around
now shes crying
i dont understand
we got off to such a great start
he nods wistful
and i looked for a happy ending
but this was the best i could do
they kiss good bye and she makes it so wickedly sweet that he can barely pull himself away
liz watches mystified as he leaves stirred by feelings for cris that are just coming into being
i wouldnt be surprised
and he walks out the door
lizs house day cris walks down the driveway to the street
he stands there a beat then ferris car drives up and stops in front of him
cris opens the passenger door and gets in
ferris car day they look at each other coming from very different places
johnson we meet at last
i wasnt ready till now
ferris shifts into gear and drives off
we dont have time to waste
maybe you could start by telling me how your talent works
he thinks how to phrase it
the future aint what it used to be
ever hear that expression
front window of cottage day liz watches from inside as ferris car pulls away
its a joke but its true
the future changes every time you look at it
because you looked at it
cause once you see it youre different
and that changes everything else
liz puts her hand on her belly
