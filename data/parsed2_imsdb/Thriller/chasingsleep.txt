ed lies awake in bed
he is sweaty and nervous
his eyes are wide open blood shot and tired
he picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly
he looks over at the other side of the queen size bed
it is still made
he picks a long blonde hair from the pillow and examines it curiously
there is a noise outside and ed gets up to investigate
ed walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house
by the front door hanging on the wall is a framed picture of eve eds wife
ed passes by it and looks outside through the window
there is some wind outside but nothing else
ed looks longingly at his reflection
ed saxon is a morbid insecure man
his frustration with his life has tinged his sense of humor with an acerbic bite
his early success a few publications of his poetry has given him a professorship at the university
he is well read intelligent a bit pompous and occasionally condescending
but mostly these qualities are restrained and his outward appearance is a little sorrowful
there is an unquestionable charm about him and its effect is evident in the people around him
he searches through the medicine cabinet which is full of womens items and takes out a cosco sized bottle of sleeping pills
he reads the back and takes two
he hears something bang against the front door
he opens the front door and takes a step outside
he looks down by his feet and finds the morning paper wrapped in blue plastic lying on the doormat
he picks it up and goes back inside
ed stands helplessly in the empty living room
eds desk sits on one side of the living room crammed into the corner
he searches quickly through the stuff on the desk and finds a small address book
he finds a name in the book and dials the number
over phone hello
hi its ed
im sorry i woke you up
is something wrong
eve isnt there is she
shes not there
she didnt come home after work
didnt she call or anything
she was supposed to be home around six
i cooked her dinner
could she have gone anywhere else
i dont think so
i dont know
im a little worried
did you call harborview
do you think i should
if she got into an accident of something they would take her there
you dont think thats overreacting
dont be silly
just call them
it cant hurt
but if she comes home later and it turns out to be nothing dont tell her i called the hospital ok
call me back
ed finds the yellow pages and finds a page of non emergency numbers
his finger runs down the list trauma fire disaster etc
until he comes to hospitals and then harborview
he dials the number
i wanted to find out if someone had come in
in an emergency maybe
she transfers him and the phone rings again
i wanted to find out if someone had been brought in
whats the last name
are you a relative
shes my wife
no one with last name saxon
are there any other hospitals that i could check
well we serve as the emergency room for king county so unless they specified a hospital they would have been brought here
in an emergency
he calls susie back
did you guys have a fight
did you call the school
yeah a while ago
no one answered the phone there
its not like her to not call is it
no she would have called
why dont you call the police
maybe they know something
like if she was in an accident
its going a little far dont you think
i dont know
if youre worried
its not like the police have anything better to do
ill call you tomorrow
sorry to wake you up
call me tomorrow
he hangs up
ed looks around the kitchen searching lazily for something to eat
he opens a cabinet that is full of boxes of fat free skin ee chocolate marshmallow cookies
he opens the fridge looks around and takes the plate of food he made for his wife
he takes off the cellophane and starts to eat
he sits at the table but after a few more bites he loses his appetite
ed sits at his desk staring at the phone
he takes a breath and calls
i dont think this is an emergency
whats the problem
my wife hasnt come home and i dont know
i wanted to check with the police to see if there was an accident
when was the last time you saw her
she was supposed to come home from work but she didnt
when does she get off work
she hasnt called since then
do you have any idea where she might have gone
maybe to a friends house
i dont think so
i called the only place i could think of
but you were expecting her home
i cooked dinner
i could send a police officer to your house
do you think thats necessary
maybe i should wait
its five in the morning
maybe she went somewhere
i dont know
should i be worried
i would be
yes im worried
so do you want me to send an officer to your house
i dont think so
i think i should wait
do you think shes going to come home soon
i hope so
so do i
how long are you going to wait
a little longer
i think i may be overreacting
she might have gone somewhere i cant think of
sometimes i worry too much
its up to you
my name is paul
ill be here if you change your mind
ed hangs up
ed takes the sleeping pills from the medicine cabinet and takes two more
eve has a small room in the house that ed is cautious about entering
he walks in and looks around as if he hasnt been in there for a while
the room is painted sky blue and the ceiling has clouds painted on it
on one side of the room there is a console piano with some sheet music resting on it
on the other side of the room is a small antique writing desk
ed sits down and looks at some of the items lying on it
there are a couple of letters and an address book
there is a box containing paper clips etc
there is an open box of skin ee cookies
there is a drawer in the desk which he tries to open but finds that it is locked
he searches around the desk for a key but can find one
he presses a little harder at the drawer but it wont budge
he takes a letter opener from a jar on the desk and starts to fidget with it but he still cant open it
then he hears some distant voices coming from outside
he looks out the window where he can see the house next door
there is a light on in the neighbors window where the voices are coming from and some vague shadows move around inside
ed turns off the lights in eves room so that he can see more clearly
from the muffled sounds it is soon clear that the couple next door is having an argument
only the womans voice is clear
i hate you
stay away from me
dont touch me
just go to sleep
i am not screaming now
you dont know anything about me
then the noise dies down and the woman can be heard sobbing in the distance
ed picks up the phone and dials
i called before
i think i was talking to paul
paul comes on the line
this is paul
i called before
my wife hasnt come home
you want me to send an officer over
whats your address
he should be there in a few minutes
you did the right thing sir
ed hangs up
almost instantly he sees some lights pass by the window
he looks through the window and sees a police car pull up
he opens the door and watches the officer as he approaches the house
officer stewart is a youngish patrolman
he is relaxed caring and formal
you called the police
it was me
that was fast
stewart is led a few steps into the living room
he looks around
your wife didnt come home
is that right
when was the last time you saw her
when she left for work this morning
she was supposed to come home after work
i cooked dinner
and she made it to work right
i think so
i dont know
what time does she usually come home
what does she look like
shes blonde straight hair
what was she wearing
do you remember
i think it was a red sweater and a dress
what kind of car does she drive
stewart lets out a sigh of relief
well you had me worried
there was a blonde woman involved with a car jacking around six
apparently she was hit on the head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the incident in a daze
nobodys seen her since
when i got the call on the radio i thought that must have been your wife but this woman was driving a pathfinder and was wearing jeans so it probably
you had me worried
she drove a volvo
drives a volvo
thats a relief
do you know anywhere your wife might have gone
i called the only place i could think of
and i called the hospital
stewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them chasing them down with a coffee he has with him
im afraid theres not much i can do now
by law we cant put out a missing persons until hours has elapsed since the last time she was seen
usually in these cases it was something stupid
maybe she was upset about something had to get away
what i can do is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for some reason well give you a call
do you have your wifes license plate number
actually its easy to remember
and fec for every child
and whats her name
and your name
like i said it was probably something stupid
did you have a fight
not at all
well you should try to get some sleep and if she doesnt show up tomorrow give us a call and well see what things look like then
usually they come back
i feel much better now
thank you for coming
you have a good night
or morning i guess
ed shuts the door
hes a little wired so he sits at his desk and picks up a pile of his students papers
he reads the one on top marking it with a red pen as he does
he hears a gurgling noise coming quietly from the bathroom
he gets up and walks into the he looks around the bathroom tracing the sound to the bathtub drain
it gets louder as he approaches it but before he can investigate there is a knock on the front door
when ed comes out to answer the door it is now bright daylight outside
the sun is streaming in through the windows
through the washed out sunlight outside his window ed can see a police car parked in front of his house
someone knocks again and ed answers the door
as he does he picks up the mail that has been dropped through the slot in the door
detective derm stands outside in plain clothes
derm is above all a nice man
experience has given him a knowing stare but he is affable not suspicious
he is consistently professional and genuinely concerned
sorry to wake you up
i wasnt asleep
i called a few times and when there wasnt any answer i thought i better come over
what time is it
maybe i did fall asleep
im detective derm of the seattle police department

we found her car this morning
on capitol hill
actually somebody called it in
it was running

ed picks up the phone and dials from memory
why dont you let me
he hands derm the phone

he points to the answering machine
it is blinking full of messages

ed pushes the button on the machine
the first message is from eves work

the next message is derm
on machine hello this is detective derm from the seattle police department
derm takes a small pill box from his overcoat while the machine plays in the background

ed goes into the and fills a glass for the detective
when he comes back he sees derm casually looking over the womans magazines on the coffee table
derm picks up a filled in new york times sunday crossword and looks it over
your wife did this
the acrostic too
ed hands derm the water
meanwhile the next message comes on
it is a girl from eds class

so youll be in tomorrow

ed hangs up having been hung up on
he turns around to see derm standing right by listening to his call
the next message is from george simian a man who works with eve
his cautious voice makes it known that it is weird that he is calling
ed pays special attention to this call
this is george from school
you didnt come into work today and i just wanted to make sure everything was ok
i guess ill see you tomorrow
some guy she worked with
teacher i think
mr saxon does your wife have an address book
could i see it please
and a picture if you have one
ed heads into and picks up the small address book from the desk
he hands the address book and takes a picture of eve from his desk removing from the frame
derm flips through the address book and a business card falls out
derm picks it up and looks it over
is that the same george that called
this address this george simian lives on capitol hill where we found your wifes car
may i borrow this
ill call the numbers in here and see what i can turn up
try no to worry mr saxon

ed shuts the door and locks it
the phone rings and ed picks it up
over phone he mr saxon
hi its sadie crumb from your creative writing class

i used to volunteer at a hospital
yeah i was a candy striper
what i mean is im used to it
you know sick people
where do you live
ill be there soon

i eat anything
ed hangs up the phone
he walks into the he looks in the mirror
his hair is a mess and he is unshaven
he looks tired
he turns on the shower
ed takes off his clothes and walks back into the he puts his hand under the water
it isnt warm yet so he picks up his toothbrush and puts some paste on it
then he hears a piano playing behind the sound of the shower
it can hardly be heard
he looks around eves room quickly
there is no one there
ed goes back to the he comes back into the bathroom
the music has stopped and all that can be heard is the shower filling up the tub
the water is about ankle deep
ed reaches into the drain and pulls out a clump of eves hair
he throws it into the toilet and then gets in the shower
the drain is obviously still clogged up
he is up to his knees in soapy water
as ed comes out of the shower he sees that it is completely dark
there is a knock on the door
ed grabs eves robe from the back of the bathroom door
ed answers the door
sadie is the kind of girl who always has something to say in class who has always done her homework and who has definite ideas about her future and the
future of the planet
she is innocent and naive nice and well mannered
but also pushy and manipulative used to getting her way
hi its me
are you ok
i didnt think youd be here so fast
its almost eight
i seem to be having a little trouble with time
i know what you mean
im one of those people who is always late
i hope you dont mind me coming over like this
it didnt occur to me that it might be a little strange until after i hung up
its just well at my high school i went to boarding school and we were pretty close with our teachers
i brought you some soup
i better get some clothes on
make yourself at home
ed gets dressed
as he does he notices a pile of eves clothes on the floor
he picks them up and puts them in the closet on top of a pile of eves dirty laundry
when ed comes out sadie has put the soup in a bowl and set a place at the table
i put it in a bowl for you
i hope you dont mind
ed sits down and tastes the soup
i got it at my favorite place
you dont mind me hanging out for a little while do you
i could use the company
like i said i havent been feeling very well
sadie notices the pile of papers on eds desk
oh you graded our papers
some of them
can i look
sadie looks through the papers
she finds hers marked with a c minus
what is it
i guess i though this one was better
let me see
ed looks over the paper for a second
he takes a pen and crosses out the c and changes it to an a
i was in a bad mood when i graded these
dont change it if its not good
its just a grade
sadie takes the paper away from him
i didnt mean to
i dont think youre doing me any favors by letting me off easy
i mean im hear to learn
it means a lot to me to do well in your class
youre the best teacher ive had since i came to the university
how long has that been
well im still a freshman but ive met a lot of teachers and im very discerning
before i took your class i went to the library and looked up your work
i read all your poems or all they had
the ones in the new yorker and in poetry magazine and two short stories
what did you think
i loved them the poems especially
i mean theyre dark but theyre so
i really got into them
i photocopied one and put it on my wall
i hope you dont mind
the passion of my youth
it is so intense
her eyes blew gently purposefully by my ears echoing gentle pulses of bliss which bounced and fired like a chill on my whole being leaving just a trace to fuel
my wife like that poem
wheres your wife
shes at her mothers
shes gone for a while
there is an awkward silence
may i use the bathroom
sadie takes her purse and goes into the bathroom
ed finishes his soup
the phone rings and he picks it up
is this ed
this is george simian
why do you want to talk to eve
what have you done
youve done something
i know you have
what are you talking about
the police found her car near my house
they think i have something to do with her disappearance
maybe its because you were fucking her
you son of a bitch
what did you do
if you hurt her i swear im going to kill you
look she disappeared
i havent seen her
why do you think i called the police
ill kill you
ill kill you you bastard
ed hangs up
he is shaky but also strangely exhilarated
he turns off the ringer on the phone and turns down the volume on the answering machine
he brings the rest of the soup to the sink scrapes it into the garbage disposal and flicks the switch
when the food has gone down he starts to wash the dishes
he stops and looks back to the bathroom
ed walks over to the bathroom door
there is no answer
he knocks on the door
is everything alright
there is still no answer
im coming in
ed opens the door
sadie is lying on the floor passed out
her pants are around her knees as if she passed out while standing up from the toilet
her nose is bleeding like she might have hit it on the way down
it has bled on her sweater
the air from the open door wakes her up but she is in a heavy daze
are you alright
ed comes over to her and lifts her head
she stares at him strangely
can you stand
do you understand me
ill help you to the bedroom
sadie notices her pants are down
ill wait outside
ed waits outside and a second later sadie comes out still reeling clutching her purse
she leans on ed who leads her into the bedroom
sadie lies down on the bed
you want some water
ed goes into the he takes a glass from the cupboard and fills it up
he stops having noticed something on the glass
he holds the glass up to the light
eves lipstick is clearly marked on the rim
he puts that glass down and fills another
when he comes back he finds sadie digging through her purse
she pulls out an asthma inhaler and takes a couple of big hits
then she sits on the bed and drinks a little water
im so embarrassed
no dont be
god my nose
does it hurt
no but the blood
maybe you hit it when you fell
it was so weird
i heard someones voice a womans voice
like a scream
and then it was like all my blood left my body
sometimes you can hear the neighbors
it was like it echoed around the bathroom
maybe i imagined it
ive been taking these caffeine pills to stay awake
i should go
i cant let you leave like this
i didnt mean to be such a burden
im such a loser
i am so sorry about this
it seems that her nose has stopped bleeding but her sweater has a surprising amount of blood on it
ill get you a towel
ed leaves and then comes back with a wet towel
he starts to wipe the blood off her nose
i feel better now
do you want me to drive you home
ill be ok
maybe you want me to call your roommate
my roommate moved out
she hated me
she said i was immature do you believe that
your friends then
i dont have any friends
i dont know what it is
people dont like me here
i thought it would be a good idea to go to a school far away from home but since ive been here its like i spend all this time on
at my high school my friends and i were so close
i just dont get along with people anymore
i dont know what it is
you get along with me
youre the first person ive met since ive been here that talks to me like a real person
ed walks over to the closet and takes out a sweater
you can borrow this if you want
its my wifes
she wouldnt mind
i bled so much
ed gets up to give her some room
she slips out of her sweater and puts the other one on
sadie looks at a picture next to the bed
is this your wife
thats my mother
that picture is older than it looks
shes so pretty
she was young when that was taken
she died a few years ago
howd she die
it was quite an ordeal
she died very slowly
thats so sad
i better go huh
its getting late
ed walks her to the door
im sorry about everything
dont be sorry
im glad you came
ill see you tomorrow
youll be there right
ill be there
sadie kisses him on the cheek and then leaves
ed locks the door after her
ed looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water
he sticks his finger deep into the drain trying to free whatever is in there
there is another tuft of hair and again he throws it into the toilet
the gurgling sound that he heard before has come back resonating through the soapy water from the drain
ed follows the gurgling sounds into the basement
he takes a flashlight from behind the basement door and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain
he can hear the gurgling sound running through them
it sound like they ate something they cant digest
he reaches up and touches the pipe
it seems to be leaking a little or maybe it is condensation
ed traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe that runs down into the basement floor
he watches the pipe but slowly his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe
as he stares intently into the darkness of the shadow a figure begins to emerge in the distance
the darkness begins to change into a long hallway
a small figure is walking towards ed and his footsteps echo in the distance
ed watches mesmerized
the basement fades into the blackness and now the hallway becomes more clear
it is a very long hospital hallway and the figure walking toward ed is a doctor carrying a clipboard
theres nothing we can do for her now except to alleviate any pain she may be feeling
we have her on a morphine drip and well keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain
can she understand me
at this point probably not
she has so much morphine in her i doubt she can even recognize you
but you never know
actually in cases like this where the end is inevitable i recommend that we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated rate
theres no point in making this last longer than it has to
whatever you think is best
the doctor nods then walks into the hospital room where we see now eds mother is lying in a hospital bed hooked up to a digital iv
she is old but looks older shes been through chemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll
she stares at ed with confused and desperate eyes
it is hard to tell if she is looking at him or not
the doctor at the door has a few words with the nurse who then looks into the room
ed sits next to his mother and takes her hand
she stares at him
the nurse comes in and pushes a button on the digital iv
ed watches the led numbers on the digital iv go up
the nurse smiles an attempt at comfort then leaves the room
mother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine
her eyes get wider and more delirious
she sits up a little and tenses her muscles
she lets go of eds hand and starts moving her arm up and down
she starts shouting something
at first it is completely unintelligible but slowly it becomes clearer
ed stands up and backs away
he backs out of the hospital room as his mother continues to scream
ed backs into the hallway which is now blackness
as he backs away another noise starts to echo around him
a loud banging is coming from upstairs
ed backs away and then runs upstairs
as ed opens the basement door he sees that it is bright daylight again
ed opens the front door and before he can react a fist hits him hard in the face
ed falls to the ground next to a pile of letters that has been dropped through the slot in the door
george simian walks in wearing a track suit
george is a stronger man than ed
he is better looking too or at least younger
he has a genuine honesty about him like a big boy
it is this boyish quality that makes his anger seem uncontrollable
you son of a bitch
ed staggers to his feet
he tries to get a swing in at george but george grabs him by the collar hits him again then throws him over the coffee table
ed hits the phone and the answering machine on the way down
when ed doesnt say anything george starts searching around the house
ed can hear george searching around in the other rooms
he gets up and sits on the couch nursing his wounds
after a minute george comes back into the living room
what have you done
dont hit me again
you son of a bitch
george sits down on a chair across from ed
you son of a bitch
what did you think would happen
you did something
i did what i always do
i woke up went to my shitty job came home and cooked dinner for my wife who was too busy bouncing up and down on your bedsprings to cook it
not exactly what i had planned for my life
the same boring shit as always
why dont you leave
i love her
i know shes your wife
george is crying
ed despite himself is moved
am i supposed to feel sorry for you now
well i wont
people think they can just carry on
they dont think that there might be consequences to their actions
you wont find sympathy here
why dont you just leave
what did you do
i didnt do anything
she didnt come home after work
george gets up and starts to leave
dont come back here again
george stops when he hears this and turns towards ed with and angry look on his face
he grabs eds collar picks him up from the couch and slugs him hard across the head
ed lands on the floor stunned and not moving
if i find out you did something to her ill kill you
ed watches george leave and stays lying on the floor as georges car can be heard driving away outside
the telephone is lying on the floor knocked off its cradle just out of eds reach
ed stares at it for a few seconds
it is making that beeping noise that phones make when they are off the hook too long
he slowly gets up and limps into the bathroom
he looks in the mirror
his eye is swelling up already and his lip is bruised
he washes his lip off and then takes a towel from the bathroom
he fills the towel with ice and holds it to his head
he picks up the phone as he walks into the living room and places it on the coffee table
he sits on the couch and stares at it for a second
then he brings the phone over to his desk and finds derms business card
he sits down at the desk and calls derm
ive been trying to call you
you found her
i need to talk to you
george simian was just over here
he hit me
are you ok
i think so
do you want me to call an ambulance
i dont need an ambulance
ill be right over
he hangs up the phone
he sits at the desk resting the ice on his forehead
then he notices something under the sofa
it grabs his attention
he gets up for a closer look
there are dust bunnies and dust under the edge of the sofa like it hasnt been swept for a while
ed kneels down and tries to peer under the sofa
it is dark underneath and he cant see anything
he reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies
then he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out eves pinkie finger
he recoils at the sight of this
the finger has been neatly cut as if by a sharp blade
dust has clung to the clotted blood around the stump but it is unquestionably a womans pinkie finger
he stares at it for a second curiously disgusted
he goes to pick it up decides he doesnt want to touch it then uses a tissue to pick it up
he hurries to the bathroom
he drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it
he hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the small amount of blood and dust left there
he squeezes the sponge out until it is clean then puts it aside
he lets out a huge sigh of relief
much of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now soaking wet
he takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out
then he looks over at the toilet
the finger is still there floating like a cigarette butt
the water is pink from the blood the tissue is gone but the finger floats there defiantly
he flushes the toilet again but this time stays to watch
the water goes down but the finger stays buoyant and wont go down
there is a knock on the front door
ed takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll and tosses it over the finger
he flushes again but the tank hasnt filled up yet and if anything this makes it longer until it will fill up again
there is another impatient knock at the door
ed sits there waiting listening to the toilet tank filling
the knocking outside is becoming more impatient
the tank finally fills
ed flushes and watches
this time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly fills up with water
ed reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water stopping it from overflowing
he looks in the toilet and cant see the finger through the mess of toilet paper
there is another knock on the door
ed closes the toilet lid
ed shuts the bathroom door firmly takes a breath and hurries out to meet derm
ed answers the door
derm comes in with two assistants mazurek and snyder
snyder is holding eds morning paper
you did take a couple of blows didnt you
i was just putting some ice on it
thats the best thing for it
try to keep the swelling down
its going to look worse tomorrow
you dont want to have a doctor examine you
its not necessary
mr saxon officer mazurek and officer snyder
theyll be assisting me
hows it going
i brought this in
snyder hands ed the newspaper
you say it was george simian who hit you
yes he did
he came barreling in here and hit me
do you have any idea why he would come here
because hes a fucking asshole
i should say that im concerned that he would come here
mr simian has a history of violent behavior in regards to domestic disputes
what kind of history
nothing too serious
but enough i think to warrant some concern
with your permission id like to fill in a complaint report for his assault on you and as soon as were finished here ill send these two over to arrest
him assuming he can be found
you think he did something to eve
we dont have any evidence that hes even seen your wife she left her office and disappeared
well be arresting him solely for his assault on you
but eves car
you said you found her car near his house
it does no one any good to jump to conclusions
i guess i misunderstood
were going to have to take some pictures of you for the complaint report
the pictures will be used as evidence against mr simian if this matter does eventually go to trial
derm turns to snyder who has heard this conversation and snyder begins to take pictures of ed
these investigations can be quite demanding especially when experiencing the trauma of loss
do you understand what i am saying
if you feel that you need someone to talk to at any time there are people sometimes victims of similar situation themselves who are will to listen and would like
he hands ed a business card which reads human support services and has some address and phone information on it
are you aware that your wife has been having an affair
with george simian
i guess i should have known
apparently your wife has been seeing him for some time
almost a year in fact
do you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship
i dont know
we get on each others nerves have sex a few times a year order pizza on fridays
weve been married for ten years
it doesnt stay rosy forever
maybe it isnt paradise but that doesnt mean that i dont love her
are you having any other relationships
does your wife keep a diary
she isnt the type
may i be frank
cases involving missing persons are not uncommon
in many cases and that is not to say in every case but in many cases the results are unfortunate
im not saying that you should give up hope but my experience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst
now having said that we will do everything in our power to find your wife
now its best if we can gather as much information as possible as quickly as possible
im sure you understand the urgency here
it will be necessary for us to search through some of your wifes personal items
im sure i can find whatever it is that you want
its really in your wifes best interests if you allow us to do it
we wont disturb anything or touch anything without your permission
how about we start in the bedroom
ill show you
ed stands up and leads them into the bedroom
they pass by the bathroom
the gurgling noises from the plumbing echo around the hallway and while the police dont seem to pay it any mind ed can definitely hear it
ed looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in
here you go
its sort of a mess
do you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts
ed leads derm to eves room leaving the two assistants in the bedroom
ed goes over to eves writing desk and looks over the papers lying on top
you like it
its like a nursery
i guess it is
i always through it was more of a conservatory
with the piano
she plays in here sometimes
we always wanted to fix up the whole house but this is the only room we got to
things always cost more than you think
yeah i dont know what happened
anyway we share a credit card but she mostly uses her own
if someone has taken your wife theres a chance they might have used one of her credit cards
or she might have used it herself
ed pulls at the locked drawer in the writing table
i think she keeps the receipts in here but i dont have a key
derm looks at the lock
let me try
ed gets out of the way and derm sits in the chair to examine the lock more closely
he presses his thumbs against the desk and breaks the wood around the lock forcing the drawer open
there we go
i could have done it if i wanted to break it
im sure shell understand
ed sits back down and searches through the drawer
he finds some credit card receipts and sorts through them
mazurek comes into the office carrying sadies sweater which has blood all over it
snyder follows mazurek in and looks over mazureks shoulder
it was under the bed sir
derm takes the sweater and looks at the blood on it
is this your wifes
theres blood on this sweater mr saxon
yes i know
detective this is going to sound awkward i guess but a student of mine came to the house yesterday after you were here
she was nervous i suppose
she had a bloody nose
why would she have been nervous
i dont know but she seemed nervous
that is awkward isnt it
i suppose it is
i gave her one of my wifes sweaters to wear home
she must have left that one by accident
under the bed
i dont know
what was her name
derm finds a small printed name tag reading sadie crumb sewn into the collar
derm shows it to mazurek and then indicates for him to go back to the bedroom
derm shows the label to ed
do you have this girls phone number
id like to talk to her
i dont think so
ed gets up and walks into the where his desk is
he searches around and quickly finds a photocopy of a hand written list of phone numbers
i should call her
he hands him the phone
derm dials the number
i didnt tell her about my wife
i didnt see any reason to
derm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of tums
he takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a bad taste in his mouth
could i trouble you for a glass of water
ed walks into the he passes by the bathroom and stops by the bedroom door
he looks into the bedroom where the officers are searching through his stuff
they find a copy of hustler magazine and they chuckle about it before they notice ed watching them
as he watches he can hear derm talking to sadie
may i speak to sadie crumb please
this is detective derm of the seattle police department
can i ask you a few questions
the officers turn and stare at ed until he leaves
ed takes a glass from the cupboard
he takes it over to the sink and fills it with water
the tap makes enough noise so that he cant hear anything else
as ed passes the bathroom door the gurgling noises from the plumbing get louder
he makes sure the door is firmly shot and then brings the glass of water to derm
derm hangs up the phone and drinks the water
she sounded very nice
you know i think she left her sweater under your bed on purpose
why would she do that
so that shed have a reason to come back
derm sees an open box of skin ee cookies
my wife loves those things
i swear she eats them by the box
i think they taste like shit
i hate them
sometimes i think she eats them just to spite me
derm looks at ed then goes into the other room
did you go to work today mr saxon
i guess i didnt
if youd like i can call the university for you and explain the situation
it might help
im sure they would understand
i dont think its necessary
well the offer stands if you change your mind later
its just that i dont want them to know anything about all this
at least not yet
they walk into the mazurek is holding a small fabric bound writing book
looks like a diary sir
lets have a look
derm looks it over reads the last couple of entries quickly
whered you find this
behind the bedside table
i didnt know
we have to keep some things to ourselves or wed go crazy
this is your wifes handwriting
he shows him the diary
can i look at that
ed takes the diary and wanders into eves room flipping through it as he walks
ed flips through the last pages of the diary
he reads for a minute
some distant noises are coming from the neighbors house
while we cant hear exactly what is being said it is clear that a man is saying something funny and a woman is laughing hysterically
ed reads for a minute until astonished he puts it down and looks up at derm who is standing in the doorway watching him
i guess you never really know anyone
you didnt know that youre wife is pregnant
i talked to her doctor yesterday
i thought you knew
mazurek comes up behind derm and says something inaudibly in his ear
is it alright if mazurek uses the bathroom
may we use the bathroom
we might be here for a while
the toilet is stuffed up
do you mind leaving
i just would like to be alone
im sorry about the intrusions into your privacy but you must understand my first priority is finding your wife
there is still a great deal to go over
we might want to notify the press
in cases like this when we dont have many substantial leads getting a picture of your wife on tv can be invaluably helpful
i dont know if im comfortable with that
we still have options left but without a thorough search of your wifes belongings those options are extremely limited
i want to be helpful but i really dont see how if you think she was kidnapped i dont see how it helps you to search around our things
we dont know that she was kidnapped
we cant draw those kinds of conclusions
she could have simply decided that she needed some time alone
we have to consider every possibility
i just dont see how it helps
i dont want to argue with you
were trying to help you
this is our job
it is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job without impediment
i dont want to get in the way
i just would like some time alone
you can comes back tomorrow but please
im very tired
i know it might seem irrational but i havent slept in a long time and this is all extremely overwhelming
i need to be alone
if i could just take those receipts
take them all
the receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to derm
derm reaches out for the diary
id like to keep this
there are some things it may be better not to know especially if your wife comes back
i can give it to you tomorrow if you still want it
ed leaves the diary on eves writing table and walks the officers out
is there something wrong with your answering machine
it broke when i fell on it
you havent been answering your phone
it hasnt rung
derm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off
the ringer is off
i must have turned it off
what if your wife calls
i wasnt thinking
could you please leave the phone on from now on
i thought i was
ill be calling to let you know how things go with mr simian
derm and the officers leave
ed lets out a sigh of relief
he touches his forehead and it obviously hurts
he goes back into the bathroom
he opens the medicine cabinet and searches through the plethora of over the counter medicine crowding the shelves
he takes a bottle of midol or some other feminine pain killer
he takes a few of them and chases them down with a handful of tap water
then he turns to the toilet lifts the lid and looks at the stuffed up mess
he rolls up his sleeve and sticks his hand in the bowl
he searches around for the finger
the phone rings
he gives up searching and with some wet toilet paper stuck to his arm hurries to answer the phone
ed picks up the phone
this is mrs mastrioni from the deans office
you are supposed to call us when you plan on missing class
there were students waiting for you
im just having some personal problems
anyway the dean wants to see you
can you come in today
what does he want to see me about
i dont know
is it about me missing classes
it might be
whats that supposed to mean
it means that if i was the dean and i wanted to see you that is what it would be about
what kind of bullshit is that
theres no need to get upset mr saxon
am i being fired
is that it
look i dont know
the dean said he wanted to see you
well i cant see him
thats too bad
yes it is too bad
because i know what youre trying to do
you know what
why dont you tell the dean to go fuck himself
and you go fuck yourself too
does this mean that you wont be coming to class tomorrow
ed slams the phone down
ed takes the bottle of midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few more
then he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet along the bathroom floor and into the hallway
he follows the trail
the trail leads up to the pinkie finger
ed watches while the finger moves inchworm like across the floor toward eves room leaving a wet trail behind it
ed watches for a second while he decides what to do
he quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the kitchen sink
he drops it in the sink pushes it down the drain and flicks the garbage disposal on
he turns the water on and leaves it running until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger
when he turns it off he sticks his hand in searching for any remnants of the finger
it appears to have gone down
he takes the sponge and wets it
he wipes up the trail of the finger following it back into the bathroom
he looks at the toilet which is still stuffed up
ed searches around the basement for a plunger
the basement is full of strange sounds all ruminating from the exposed pipes
he finds a plunger among some other tools and starts back upstairs but on his way upstairs he finds that there is a puddle of water on the floor
he traces the source of the puddle to the pipe that was only moist before
it is now dripping slowly and a large pool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement floor
ed stares into the murky black pool
there is a knock on the door upstairs and ed turns to answer it
ed answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside
geoffrey costas stands outside
geoffrey is a wise patient man
he is formal and calm in his manner but these qualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability
physically he is not small or weak
one gets the impression that he wasnt always so kind
my name is geoffrey costas
im from human support services
im not interested
detective derm asked me to stop by
he hands him a business card
ed takes the card and looks it over
youve been hit
i dont need a doctor
he tries to hand the card back
oh im not a physician
im a psychiatrist
but im not here on business
this is my time off
this is a personal visit
i dont understand
human services is a volunteer organization
we offer assistance to victims of traumatic crimes
what kind of assistance
advice support a shoulder to cry on
why would i want to cry on your shoulder
maybe you just want someone to talk to
it can be a lonely world when those you love are taken from you
i dont think so
well you have my card
if you feel like talking at another time please feel free to call
actually there is something you can help me with
ive been having trouble sleeping
thats understandable under the circumstances
is there something you can give me
you mean a prescription
youre a doctor arent you
i cant seem to find anything strong enough
i cant sleep
it makes me anxious
or maybe i cant sleep because im anxious
i dont know
how long has this been going on
a long time
you must have slept some
maybe i do
but i dont seem to get the benefits
i never feel rested
there just doesnt seem to be the time to relax anymore
im always two steps behind
i have to stop the thinking
the longer i stay awake the more my thoughts become frantic irrational
if i dont get some sleep soon nothing is going to make any sense
may i come in
geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table inside
there are times when the pressures of everyday life become overwhelming
as a doctor i notice more and more of my patients experiencing similar symptoms
im afraid its a sign of the times as much as anything else
can you help me
like i said im not here on a professional basis
your insomnia is merely a symptom of a greater unwholesomeness
a lasting treatment may be extremely hard to come by
theres very little we can hope to accomplish with pharmaceuticals alone
however under the circumstances i can give you something to help you sleep
do you have health insurance
yes through work
geoffrey takes a prescription pad from his briefcase and scribbles out a prescription
the prescription im going to write for you is expensive so i recommend you save the receipt for your insurance company
im sure theyll cover it
these pills are quite new
ive been prescribing them to my patients who travel a great deal for their jet lag
they will help stabilize your internal clock by chemically suppressing certain amino acids in your brain
will it help me sleep
now take two at night and dont take more than six in a day
geoffrey shuts his briefcase and starts to leave
im glad i could help
how about i check in on you tomorrow afternoon
to see how youre doing
i dont know
for what its worth i understand your position better than you think
dont shut it all out
sometimes that fragile connection to the rest of the world is all we have
i sincerely hope things turn out for you
ed shuts the door behind geoffrey
ed works the plunger in the toilet
the water is still pink from the finger but also might be pink from the pink toilet paper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water
he plunges the toilet a few more times and then stops to see if it is working
the water slowly goes down
he reaches behind the toilet and turns the water back on
he flushes it and it seems to be working again albeit weakly
he sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a breath
the water in the tub hasnt gone down so he takes the plunger and starts to work it over the drain
after a minute he sees that it isnt working
he reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum filled hair
it is repulsive to ed
he throws it into the toilet
the water in the bathtub still hasnt gone down
he searches under the sink through an exhaustive supply of cleaning supplies
he eventually pulls out a king size container of drano
he reads the back of the container quickly then pours the whole thing down the drain
he watches it for a second waiting for it to go down
slowly then softly the piano can be heard playing in the other room
ed listens to it before following it down the hallway
the lamp on eves writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the hallway
the music still seems to be coming from her room
ed comes in and looks around the room
there is no one playing the piano but the music continues over the rest of the scene
eds attention turns to the diary which is still sitting on the desk where he left it
ed sits in the chair and starts paging through eves diary
the piano continues playing
we hear eves voice as it must have been when she was writing
more than three weeks late
im so stupid
i havent told george because im sure he would use this as an excuse to pressure me to leave ed
and how can i tell ed
theres no way he could be the father
we havent had sex in months
he would know it isnt is
ed flips back a few pages
as he does the camera starts to travel around the room passing the piano and then a few pictures from eves past then some souvenirs on a shelf
saw a movie last night with george
it was awful just the kind of movie ed hates
i wanted to tell him about it but i couldnt
i told him i was at susies
george loved it of course
i think he likes every movie
still it was nice to go out on a date like that
it was fun
now the camera has turned to the empty hallway
it slowly moves toward the bathroom
ed came home in a shitty mood and started picking a fight with me about a coffee cup i broke last week
it was the last thing i needed today especially
sometimes i fucking hate him
he can be such a shit
the camera pans over the glass that has eves lipstick on it
i cant believe what a jock george is
i knew he worked out but he really takes car of himself
after we had sex i was embarrassed to let him see me naked
how could i have gotten so fat
im going back to the gym tomorrow
ive really let myself go to pot
maybe ill get him a softball bat for his birthday next week
the camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of eves things sitting on the back of the toilet
ed doesnt sleep anymore
hes beginning to scare me
he takes all these pills to help him sleep but they only make it worse
and he hates me
i can see it in his eyes
he blames me for everything that went wrong in his life
maybe hes right
maybe it is my fault
i feel so guilty about george that i cant argue with him anymore
i cant keep this up much longer
im going to tell him about george tomorrow
he knows anyway
he must know
hes been acting so weird
he used to have so much ambition
and hes so talented
i just wish things had turned out better
the camera turns toward the bathtub and focuses slowly in on the drain
a few bubbles pop out from under the water and the water starts to drain out
as the camera dollies in on the drain the last of the murky water disappears
ed now standing in the bathroom strikes a match and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on fire
he fans out the pages so that it will catch more
when he cant hold it anymore he drops it into the bathtub and watches it burn
he watches it until it has burnt itself out burning into a pile of thick black ashes
ed looks up at the smoke alarm
he tries to pull it down but it is out of his reach
ed grabs a chair from the living room and stands on it so that he can reach the alarm
he pulls the cover off the alarm and then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced
then he hears voices coming from outside the front door
he approaches the front door cautiously then puts his ear up to the door and listens
the voices are muted and whispered but ed can still hear what is being said although it is hard to tell who is talking
you are so crazy
what about you
hes going to hear you
so what if he hears me
who is he anyway
god you are being such an asshole
ed opens the door quickly
sadie and harvey freeze like caught children
harvey looks younger than his is his facial hair isnt capable yet of filling out his meager goatee
he seems hurt like a spoiled child who hasnt gotten his way
whats going on
im so sorry
is this him
will you shut up
hes so old
can we just go inside
ed lets sadie inside
so thats it
youre going with him now
you really dont understand anything
you said you loved me
would you shut up
you are so embarrassing
ill tell you whats embarrassing
you with this fucking geriatric old man
you little shit
ed makes a move toward harvey but harvey backs away quickly
dont touch me
lets just go in ok
sadie slams the door on him
sadie stands staring at the floor
i cant believe that
you know he followed me here
he followed you
do you believe it
oh my god
what happened to you
somebody hit me
are you alright
who hit you
i really dont want to get into it
i nearly had a heart attack when the police called me
what did they ask you
just about me being here
about what happened
but nothing happened
thats what i told them
they found your sweater
it has blood all over it
you left it under the bed
i dont know why i do things like that
what if my wife had found it
is she here
i dont want you to get the wrong idea
dont be mad
its just that i worry too much
you didnt come to class again
and you said you would
i started getting all these ideas
i called you but nobody answered
i meant to bring your wifes sweater back but i forgot it
actually im glad youre here
can you do me a favor
i have to get a prescription filled
ed finds the prescription on his desk
id go myself but im expecting a phone call
he hands her the prescription
theres a twenty four pharmacy on market
i know the one
i go there all the time
its like my second home
ill give you my credit card
ed finds his wallet and hands her the card
ill be back in a minute
sadie skips out the door and ed shuts it behind her
ed turns on the shower washing the ashes down the drain
after hes watched them go down he takes a sponge and cleans off the burnt mark in the tub as best he can
he turns the shower on rinsing it out
he turns the shower off and hears the phone is ringing
ed picks up the phone
i wanted to let you know that weve taken mr simian into custody
we found him at his place of work
at the school
we arrested him there
hell come up for arraignment tomorrow morning and then as far as i can tell hell probably be released on his own recognizance
its just standard procedure but i thought id keep you informed
did he say anything about eve
try to rest mr saxon
we have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow
ed hangs up the phone
then he hears some sounds coming from eves room
ed takes a few steps into eves room
he traces the noises to the window and looks out at the neighbors house
the light is on in the neighbors window and there are some vague shadows moving around on the closed curtain
as the noises get louder it soon becomes clear that the neighbors are having sex
ed peers out at the light in the window listening to the womans increasing moans
the woman seems to be in some sort of painful orgasmic delight
in other words it mostly sounds like she is having a good time but there should be a growing suspicion that not all is right
ed backs slowly away from the window
he hears someone knocking on the front door
ed opens the door and sadie comes in holding a colorful paper bag
ed takes the bag from sadie and goes into the kitchen
sadie follows him in
ed opens the pills quickly and swallows three of them with a glass of water
those pills cost a lot
they must be strong
theyre sleeping pills
ive been having trouble sleeping
you must have anxiety
i can never get to sleep when im anxious
i am anxious
sadie takes some other stuff out of the bag
one of the items is an individually wrapped skin ee fat free cookie chocolate chocolate chip
i got you some peroxide and stuff
and a cookie
i havent eaten today
you put it all on my credit card right
actually i paid for it
they wouldnt take your card
they said you hadnt paid your bill on the phone
they called the credit card people when it didnt go through
well ill pay you back
i charged it to my dad
i dont even pay the bill
no those pills are expensive
and my insurance will cover it anyway
pay me back later then
really its ok
are you sure
sadie looks at the cuts on his face
your face must hurt
i dont seem to feel anything
sadie takes a closer look
she sits ed down at the kitchen table under a light and sits across from him then takes the peroxide and some cotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and
starts to dress his wounds
ive never been hit before
its not so bad really
its humbling but i like the effect it seems to have on people
it seems to make them more compassionate
theres a competitive market for suffering in the world
its difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and the politically oppressed
sometimes a little advertising helps remind people that youre a human being
it does make you look sort of cute in a pathetic kind of way
are you really married
you think i just made it up
i dont know
some people just say theyre married you know because maybe they think its more respectable or something
im not one of those people
i didnt mean to imply anything
its just that you act sort of weird
i act weird
not weird really
worried i guess
like youre worried i might find out something about you
you dont want to get involved with my problems
maybe i do
believe me you dont
i didnt mean to pry
well maybe i did
ill just put a band aid on it
would you like a drink
im going to have one
tt he finds a bottle of wine
youre not supposed to mix wine with sleeping pills
it increases the amount of medicine thats absorbed into the bloodstream
tt ed searches for a corkscrew and starts to open the bottle
i need all the help i can get
its just wine
ill only have a glass
tt he offers her some and she nods
he pours her a glass
sadie takes her glass into the living room
ed downs his glass of wine and refills it quickly before following her
tt she sits down at his desk
are you working on anything new
i dont write anymore
i just dont have the time
i have to work all day
time just slips by
i know what you mean
theres not enough time in the day
not as much as there used to be
there used to be more
before i had to work there was plenty of time
but you had all that stuff published
sure but it didnt pay very much
i had a lot of debts from school that needed to be paid off
and then credit cards
and then i got married bought a house
life comes with all these expenses
and poetry just doesnt pay
i thought working at the university would at least give me summers off
tt there is a knock on the door
the idea that someone else might see them together makes it awkward for both of them
tt ed freezes for what seems like a long time long enough for whoever it is to knock again
i better see who that is
tt ed goes over to the door and opens it cautiously
it is eves friend susie
hi its me
oh hi susie
tt she is about to walk in when ed blocks her way
she can see sadie sitting at eds desk holding a glass of wine
eves not here
she came back though didnt she
no she didnt
can i come in
tt ed rather than let her in pushes her outside and shuts the door behind her
im busy right now
i called the police
what did they say
theyre working on it
you can call them if you want
tt ed finds derms card in his pocket and hands it to her
arent you worried
of course im worried
im just working right now
this girl is one of my students
she wanted some help on an assignment
she doesnt know anything about eve being missing
what happened to you
george simian hit me
you know him
tt susie starts crying
ed stares at her helplessly then goes back inside
tt ed stops
can i come back later
i just took some sleeping pills
i havent slept much since this all started
why dont you come back tomorrow
good night susie
ed walks back in leaving susie standing on the porch
ed waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away outside
sadie stands up looking nervous
t is that your wife
it was a friend of hers
t i should go
t you must be tired
those pills must be working
t i dont think theyre working at all
youre married right
t yeah but please dont go
time has a way of slowing down when youre around
for me too
t so youll stay
t if you want me to
ed comes over to her and kisses her
t can i ask you something
t do you think my writing is good
t youve done some good work
c minus good
t i told you i was in a bad mood when i graded that
t i guess so
she is unresponsive at first
to herself t what am i doing
they kiss for a minute then ed slips his hand under the back of sadies sweater
she kisses him again
sadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in from the hallway
ed lies on the bed and sadie lies next to him under the covers
ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and fiddles with her bra while they kiss
the gurgling sound starts up again and while sadie doesnt notice or doesnt hear it it becomes increasingly distracting to ed
he looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming from
the camera focuses in on the drain
the water in the bathtub starts rising again
sadie breaks away from him sits up and takes off her sweater
ed takes off his shirt
eds kisses move around the side of her neck
as he reaches her ear he looks up and notices eves clothes sitting on the chair
the water is rising slowly but we can see solid stuff the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck seeping out of the drain with the water
it is a cloudy dark disgusting water which probably stinks too
ed is trying to concentrate on sadie but he notices the closet door is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside
and the noise from the bathroom is getting louder
he turns sadie onto her back turning himself away from the closet
his kisses run down her chest until he gets to her jeans
he unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off kissing as he goes
ed has taken her pants off but his passion and enthusiasm has faded and he stops and stares off into space towards the bathroom
he is spooked
t whats wrong
he looks down and sees sadie staring at him
t i dont know
maybe its those pills
i dont know
t just relax
sadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him
ed get more uptight
she keeps trying until ed is forced to push her away
t its just not working
sadie turns away
t maybe i should go
its my fault
t damn im so stupid
t no its me
t this was a mistake
sadie gets up and puts on her shirt
she grabs the rest of her clothes and goes into the living room
ed stares after her listening to her finish dressing herself and then leave
the clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the ticking continues of the next few scenes as indicated
ed pours a few more pills into his hand swallowing them with some wine from the bottle
ed looks at the bathtub which is full of the murky water
he picks up the plunger which is still by the toilet and starts working it on the drain
more stuff is coming up making the water darker but as he relaxes the plunger the water doesnt go down
if anything the gurgling sound is louder
he works the plunger some more more vigorously and then again relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully
the gurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down
then he hears something hit the front door
ed opens the front door and picks up the newspaper which has just been thrown
he puts it with the other newspapers which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk
he comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub
he puts the plunger over the drain and works it much harder and this time after a few seconds there is a loud knock in the pipes as if he
he takes the plunger away and watches the drain
suddenly a large air bubble bursts out of the drain
he watches but the water shows no sign of draining
then slowly blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain
ed is naturally terrified by this
he watches until it is clear that it is blood and not just more gook
he puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a few more frantic times
more blood seeps out of the drain
he seems to be making the problem worse
he shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom
he spills the pills on the kitchen counter and counts them quickly
there are about ten left
he pours them into his mouth and swallows the rest of the wine
then the ticking stops
ed looks at a clock on the wall
the second hand has stopped
he hears voices in the other room
he looks out of the window in eves room
he sees that the light in the neighbors window is on
the couple next door are having another argument but this one is much more intense than the last
t why do you care
you dont care
you know nothing about me
i hate you
stay away from me
i am not screaming now
you think youre the only one
yes i do
i love you
you never do that
you do not
you never do anything
you think that nothings wrong
you think we live in paradise
this is what i think of this fucking house
there is the sound of things breaking
this ends with a loud terrifying shriek
it seems to echo around the room as ed watches
then the voices stop
ed watches the window and sees a featureless man stick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening
then he closes the window and curtains
the phone rings in the other room
he hurries to answer the phone
while he is on the phone a new sound is coming from the bathroom
it is like the gurgling sound but also subtly different
its detective derm
im sorry to call you so late but i thought you would want to hear this
im afraid i have some bad news
what is it
its your wife
weve found her
you found her
we found her body
in the woods near george simians house where we found her car
im afraid shes dead
ed drops the phone
he walks trance like into the hallway
he follows the noise into the the noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human like a baby gurgling
as ed walks into the bathroom he can see that there is something in the bathtub
the shower curtain is closed but behind it there is some sort of body moving
ed pulls the curtain back
he reveals a baby just born lying in the tub
most of the murky water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub
the baby is a newborn except that its eyes are maybe larger than they would be
the baby is also six feet tall
its immense frame fills the bathtub
it is naked its a boy
ed watches with amazement
the baby looks incredibly real except for its size
the stare at each other for a minute
the baby looks a lot like george simian
it has his eyes
other than this it behaves like a baby
it is lying on its back gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his left hand gripping the shower curtain
the baby reaches out for ed lovingly
ed backs away
seeing this the baby starts crying
ed panicking approaches the baby
it is still crying
ed reaches out to touch it
he touches its arm and the babys crying starts to subside
the baby moves with typical quick chaotic movements that because of the babys size are almost threatening
ed puts his hand in the babys hand
the baby grips it as babys do but this babys hand is about the size of eds
the baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling
ed tries to pull his hand back but the baby wont let go
the baby it seems is incredibly strong
ed pulls harder
he still cant get the baby to let go
ed tries to pry the babys fingers off and this time manages to get his hand out of the babys grip
but as soon as he does the baby starts crying again
he backs out into the hallway
ed is in a panic
the babys cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom
ed finds himself in the kitchen
he looks at his hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub
he washes them off in the sink
he looks over at the kitchen knife which has been drying in the dish rack
ed walks slowly purposefully to the bathroom
the crying baby gets louder as he approaches
he comes into the bathroom but in the tub instead of the baby there is a grown mans body
it is ed staring up at himself from under the water
we only see a very tight shot of bathtub eds head and part of his neck
his head is under water and he looks up unable to move
we then see the reverse shot of this and it is also of ed so that ed is in effect looking up at himself through the cloudy water
the baby cries continue although the baby is no longer in the scene
from bathtub eds point of view we see the other ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right off camera
bathtub ed who can move his eyes tries to look to his arm where the other ed is cutting
soon blood starts to mix with the water diffusing over bathtub eds face
the blood also diffuses over bathtub eds p
as he looks up at the other ed cutting him
when the other ed is finished cutting bathtub ed sees him put the knife aside and then reach down off camera
after a short struggle the other ed pulls up bathtub eds severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already prepared
the blood from bathtub eds cut fills the water with dark blood turning the film red
the red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway
ed with a bucket and sponge is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls
he is crying while he does this
he squeezes the sponge for the last time then inspects the hallway as closely as he can searching for any spots he might have missed
then he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom
he dumps the water from the bucket into the bathtub
the water is pink and dirty
he sits down on the edge of the bathtub and watches the water go down the drain
he stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door
he turns to listen to it in the other room
as he opens the bathroom door he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room
geoffrey stands patiently outside as ed opens the door
he carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work
his appearance is a stark contrast to the half dressed blood shot ed
i wanted to see how you were getting along
i have to say you dont look well
im not well
have you slept
i dont know
its difficult to tell
i have these lapses but id hardly call it sleep
did you take the pills
the pills are fucking useless
but you took them
may i take your blood pressure
geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table
he takes a stethoscope and the rest of his blood pressure kit and starts to take eds blood pressure
i feel like a lab rat
like one of those lab rats they drug up and study
you know what i mean
you feel like a rat
they put them in a maze and they give them shocks and drugs and they see what they do
they try to prod them in the direction they want them to go
try to relax
i feel like a rat who took all the turns took all the drugs went down the right path and then when i got to the end they shocked me
anyway right up the sphincter like it was all just a big joke
i guess they thought id be too drugged up to notice
its been a few days hasnt it since your wife disappeared
has there been any word from the police
havent you talked to them
but if youd like me to i will on your behalf
they know me and ive been through this before
with others and myself
my wife was taken from me about three years ago
it was a similar situation to yours
the police found her car in the parking lot of a mall
they found her body about a week later in some woods nearby
she was murdered
did they ever catch the man who did it
why would somebody do that
sometimes a man when faced with his own problems or inadequacies takes it out on someone weaker than themselves
do you feel responsible at all for your wifes disappearance
people often blame themselves for events that they have no control over especially when the events seem so random and cruel
action leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant
details weigh on the conscience
i do seem to be having problems with my conscience
do you think thats why i cant sleep
is there anything you can give me
for your conscience
of course not
then whats the point
there are other ways i can be of help
a shoulder to cry on
would you like me to call the police
there might be some news
the police called last night late last night
they found eves body
they found her buried in the woods near where they found her car
i didnt know
geoffreys watch alarm goes off
he looks at the time and then habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his pocket
he takes two pills out
i never knew i could feel so alone
geoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase pours some hot tea into the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea
he hasnt called since last night
its been a while
why dont you let me call him
maybe theres some news
when ed doesnt object geoffrey takes his address book from his briefcase along with a cellular phone and dials the number
detective derm please
hi charlie its geoffrey
im over at ed saxons house
he was hoping to get some information on his wife
well he said you called him last night and told him that you had found her body
in the woods near where you found her car
i dont know
well i did give him something to help him sleep
then geoffrey turns away from ed and says a few words quietly so that ed cant hear
ill tell him
geoffrey hangs up and turns back to ed
he says he never called you last night
he told me to tell you to wait here for him that hes coming over
i dont understand
it is possible that you did fall asleep that you dreamed the phone call
i have to say that i was surprised when you said you hadnt slept
those pills are very effective
still this is better isnt it
i mean now theres still a chance
your wife could still be
theres still hope
but why is he coming over here
he said he had some questions to ask you
he didnt say
if he had some questions to ask me he could have asked me on the phone
calm down mr saxon
why did you turn away from me when you were talking to him
what did you say
i said you were very tired and anxious and that you seemed to be under a great deal of stress
i have no reason to lie
why do you think im lying
because youre scared
geoffrey does look scared
he has quickly packed up his briefcase
i understand youre under a lot of stress
you dont understand anything
i came here to help you
then help me
ive done all i can now
i cant do any more
but youll come to see me again wont you
i dont think i will
ed shuts the door
the phone rings
ed picks it up
is this ed
what did you do to eve
i didnt do anything
i know you did
i saw her before she left work
we met in the parking lot like we always did
she told me she was leaving you
she was going to tell you when she got home
you dont know anything about it
yes i do
i know you
eve talks about you
she tell me things
i know about the fights you have
shes my wife
we fight sometimes
i know what kind of a son of bitch you can be
shes told me
what dont you tell it to the police
you think she was some sort of angel
she was cheating on me
i love her
i loved her
ed listens to george break down
there is a long pause
its not enough
george hangs up
the bathroom is completely clean
there is no sign of any of the activity from before
ed finds the bottle of prescription sleeping pills
it is empty
he takes a couple of midol and swallows them dry
ed sits down at his desk
he looks over the papers on his desk
sadies is on top
he looks it over
the phone rings and he picks it up
i wanted to apologize
it was me
i shouldnt have left like that
i dont know what came over me
it was understandable under the circumstances
i really wanted you to like me
i wonder if youll still feel the same way when you find out what kind of person i really am
ill still keep your poem on my wall
i think its a beautiful poem
i really do
are you still there
i wish things had turned out better
she hangs up
ed stays on the phone listening until the dial tone clicks back in
then ed hears a car pull up outside
he follows some quiet footsteps as they walk up to the front door
he sees the door knob turn quietly in the door
the door is locked
ed approaches the door slowly but suddenly there is a crash against it
someone is trying to knock the door down
the door is strong and doesnt open but the wall around it shakes
after a few seconds there is another crash against the door
this time the wall shakes so much that eves picture which hangs by the door almost falls off its nail
ed looks out of the window
the window is positioned facing the street but not the porch so he cannot see who it is but he can see a car parked out front with the door
inside the car there is a softball glove lying on the passenger seat along with something that george simian was wearing when we last saw him
george crashes against the door again
this time eves picture falls off the wall
it hits the ground and smashes spreading broken glass around her picture
the door is starting to loosen around the lock and jamb
ed backs into the hallway
as he passes the bathroom he can hear the gurgling sounds from the plumbing starting up again
ed backs into the kitchen
he searches around quickly finding the kitchen knife
he grabs it out of the dish rack and starts walking toward the front door
theres another bang on the door
ed passes slowly through the hallway watching the door holding the knife in front of him
the gurgling sounds in the bathroom are deep and resonant echoing out of the drain around the bathroom and into the hallway
there is another hard crash against the door which breaks the jamb
the door is only being held on by the splinters around the lock and george starts kicking the door with his foot
ed backs into the basement door
he opens it and goes into the he hurries down the stairs into the darkness of the basement
the pipes surround ed with hysterical thick watery sounds
there are metallic creaks and strains which reverberate around the walls of the basement as the pipes seem to expand and contract
a couple of inches of dark dirty water have collected on the floor and eds feet get wet as he steps off the last stair
ed finds a place to hide in the shadows behind some boxes
he stares up as he hears the door breaking open upstairs and someone walking into the living room
with his eyes he follows the footsteps as they search the apartment
ed has hidden under a large pipe which is dripping drops of dirty water onto his face
in the darkness of the basement the color of the water is unclear but as he wipes some onto his fingers he can see it is murky and dark
the basement door opens slowly and from the light upstairs ed can see the silhouette of george simian standing with a softball bat
ed grips onto his knife and watches as george comes down the stairs step by step
the water keeps dripping on the top of eds head running down the side of his face but he holds still
ed watches george come down the stairs
george reaches the bottom and steps into the shallow water
he peers cautiously into the shadows
he starts walking toward ed
ed withdraws as much as he can into his corner until he is in complete darkness
he watches george approaching him and he slowly raises his knife
george raises his softball bat
he takes a few more steps up to ed but then steps blindly past him and into a deep dark shadow
ed watches him disappear into the shadow and then makes his move
he rushes into the shadow with his knife raised and both he and george are engulfed in darkness
after a few seconds ed emerges from the shadow
he drops the knife into the water at his feet
as he does blood runs out of the shadow mixing with the water in the basement floor
ed walks slowly upstairs
the noises around him in the basement are now at their loudest
ed takes a long look at himself in the mirror
he is wet with blood and dirt
he opens the medicine cabinet and finds the sleeping pills he was using before
he opens the bottle and empties it into his hand
there are only about five pills left
he takes the two toothbrushes from a toothpaste crusty glass and fills it with water
he takes the pills
unsatisfied he searches through the rest of the medicine cabinet
the selection though not particularly toxic is a good representation of standard over the counter pills and tonics
he finds the midol and takes the last few from the bottle
there is a bottle of cold medicine which he finishes off
he drinks down a nearly full bottle of pink diarrhea medicine
he finds a bottle of multi vitamins and takes a handful of those
as he finishes each one he drops the empties onto the floor of the bathroom
when he stops he notices blood seeping out of the bathtub drain
it is pure thick dark blood
he backs away into the hallway
ed backs into the wall and then losing strength in his legs lowers himself to the floor
he keeps watching the bathtub
piano music starts to seep through the gurgling noises
ed turns towards eves room
on the other side of the house outside the broken door ed can hear derms car pull up
ed watches the living room as derm comes in carefully flanked by mazurek and snyder
derm comes over to ed and kneels down in front of him
ed looks up at him helplessly
it wasnt me
derm looks at eds hands which are covered in blood
it wasnt me
ed watches derm looking at him
then he notices behind derm blood seeping over the rim of the bathtub
ed turns to eves room where the piano can still be heard
the camera continues on where ed cant go down the hallway to eves room
as it approaches all the other noises fade out and the piano is all that we hear
ed watches from his position in the hall so that it all seems like his point of view
the camera comes into eves room and turns to the piano
eve is sitting at the piano playing some music
we watch her for a few seconds
she turns to the camera as she plays then continues playing
then the camera turns toward the clouds painted on the ceiling
a crack appears in the plaster and starts widening until there is an empty black space behind it
the sound of the baby crying seeps in from the crack
the camera zeroes in on this black until it fills the frame
over the blackness we can hear the baby crying until it fades out
