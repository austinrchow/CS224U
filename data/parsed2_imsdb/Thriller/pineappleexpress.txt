written by judd apatow seth rogen evan goldberg november in black and white a black s cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland
the road curves sharply ahead the car accelerates
ignoring the turn the caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness
the car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field
general brat a patch covers one of his eyes and agent black suit an agent in a black suit step out of the car
although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles the general scans his surroundings with concern
agent black suit crouches down and pulls open a metal hatch in the ground
both men walk down the hatch and into the earth
they descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor
the hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone scientist standing in the middle
the scientist immediately begins leading them across the room
when did it start
were seven minutes in
the three men enter a large room divided by a one way mirror
on their side numerous scientists utilizing several archaic devices are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror
the subject private miller naive and dutiful sits at a small table with a microphone on it
miller raises his hand revealing a smoldering joint
he takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit
the scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically
general brat and agent black suit exchange a concerned look
the general lights a cigarette as the scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner
into microphone private miller we are now going to ask you several questions
how do you feel
his voice booms through large speakers on millers side of the room
miller leans towards the microphone
uh i feel a little queer sir
good queer sir
the scientists scribble madly
one of them mumbles into general brats ear
even though i feel queer sir i should mention that im also feeling quite gay
so a little queer but mostly gay
when you think of your superiors what emotions do you feel
holding out the joint this went out
we will send someone in
now answer the question
a door opens beside private miller and an agent steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit an air hose leading out the door that
he came from
he slowly walks toward the private who looks at him in shock
through speakers private miller
answer the question
what was the question again
the agent in the strange suit reaches the private and holds a lighter up to the joint
through speakers what are your emotions towards your superiors
miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again
the agent exits the room
cough cough fucking shit
beat well now that i think of it its strange that they are called my superiors
does that make me their inferior
i mean thats pretty fucked up
general brat scowls
curtly to the scientists ive seen enough
shut it down
bury the hatch sell the land and dispose of him
this never happened
instantly the scientists start packing up their equipment
staring at miller general brat grabs a red phone and dials
two agents in the scuba like suits emerge from behind miller and start aggressively dragging him away
freaking out hey
what are you guys doing
let go of me
desperately looking at the mirror sir
into phone this is general brat
weve reached a final conclusion on item
he hangs up the phone
dale denton late s out of shape slightly unkempt looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits in his cluttered and worn old lady car
he smokes a joint while listening to talk radio
well lets look at the facts
financially coins are better because theyre cheaper and environmentally forget about it coins win hands down
for those just joining us were with caller dale denton discussing if america should lose the paper dollar bill
we see that dale has a wireless ear piece in
of course not
who wants a pocket full of coins
weighs down your pants clangs around
with all this unnecessary new security everywhere well be setting off alarms left and right
we certainly do mr
crude but to the point
dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice house
dale wearing a name tag that reads garth holding a clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat knocks repeatedly on the door
a woman cautiously answers the door
um i didnt order a pizza
excuse me miss
are you sandra danby uh
yea dale shoves an envelope into her hand
sorry miss but youve failed to show up to your divorce proceedings times under court order
youve been served
thanks a lot asshole
go fuck yourself
dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to open the envelope
dale is driving and smoking a joint
he looks at his check list it is a list of people he served that day
hes only got a few left
he listens to a different talk radio dj while playing music from a tiny ipod boom box that sits in his passenger seat
forget about area roswell sightings atlantis and the boogie man lets talk about real threats threats to our home and security
his ipod starts playing hot steppa by ini kamoze
dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his joint he enthusiastically dances in his car while singing along
singing you think you know chico i know what bo dont know touch them up and go uh oh
chi chi ching chang
dale wearing a zerox hat walks into the building
can i help you
just here to check out some units
the secretary nods and goes back to her work
dale casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the names on the doors
he glances down at his clipboard it read walter tandum
he finds the office and knocks on the door
dale enters to see walter a year old accountant seated at his desk
are you here to fix the fax machines
dale drops a blue envelope on walters desk
you owe american express dollars
sorry but youve been served
dale turns and walks away
as he does he notices a small kitchen
he enters and is delighted at the array of snacks and beverages
he helps himself
dale is parked at a look out enjoying the food smoking weed and has his ear piece in
what gives you the right to say that
they should be able to collect garbage twice a week
as a tax payer cant i say that
come get my garbage a bit more
is that so f ing crazy
im not asking for free beer tuesdays or anything
and the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better
and dont pretend you cant smell it
ever been to new york
great place smells like piss though
takes a hit and starts coughing twice a week cough might fix that
starts coughing harder hold on one sec
dale gets out of his car followed by some plumes of smoke and goes to his trunk
he chuckles as he takes out a lab coat and walks towards the hospital
dale looking very professional in his lab coat rushes to reception
i need dr
the receptionist immediately picks up the phone
terrence runs towards reception where dale is still waiting
to dale hi there i dont think weve met im dr
youre the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property
and now because of that youve been served
dale hits a pipe
it is clear he strongly disagrees with what the dj is saying
stay in your own country
five simple words
and stay the hell out of mine
im not a racist per se but im not some hippy tree humper
we see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold
let me through damnit
dale wearing a chauffeur hat stands by the main entrance holding a sign that reads josh corber
a man walks out of the hotel and seeing the sign approaches dale
my names corber
youre joshua aaron corber
overjoyed get out of town
clarice did this didnt she
i was just telling her before i left how ive never been in a limo
can you believe it
and ive never been in a limo
its not stretched is it
dale hands him a blue envelope
sorry but youve been served
dale walks away
corber opens the envelope and reads it
reads more fuck
you fucking asshole
dale completely ignores corber as he dumps the sign and walks out of the airport
then a huge smile comes across his face
he has noticed a nearby burger king
new chicken fries
he happily walks toward the food
dale sits in his car outside a high school
an array of burger king wrappers surrounds him as he rolls a joint with the last of his weed on top of a batman comic
he lights the joint and turns on the radio
in the pm and we dale turns off the radio takes one last haul and then snubs out the joint
he then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through its contents handi wipes hand sanitizer a little vial of cologne visine mouthwash and breath mints
dale vigorously wipes his hands face and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes
frustrated he squirts visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes
he uses the mouthwash chews up a mint dabs on some cologne and then gets out of the car
dale walks towards the school
dale turns to see his attractive year old girlfriend angie anderson walking towards him with her group of friends
she kisses him
to angie so should we head back to my place and finish up the trilogy
whose it gonna be angie
man or machine
but can we just head to my locker first
i left some stuff by mistake
dale and angie walk hand in hand towards the locker
so are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow cause my parents are beginning to think i made you up
well yeah i really want to meet them
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
let me think
you dont have to feel weird about it
they know how old you are and theyre fine with it
they just want to meet you and see that youre a cool guy and that im not dating you just because youre older
i know that
ive got a whole bunch of cases that i can finish tomorrow
its probably going to take me into the night
well then you have to just come over sometime this week or something okay
cause its getting weird for them
im not trying to avoid this for real ive just been crazy busy
can i help you
dale and angie turn to see a teacher a guy about the same age as dale
you cant just waltz in here and hit on the students
get out now before i mr
edwards hes my boyfriend
edwards looks at dale then shoots angie a confused look
this is your boyfriend
how old are you
and youre dating an year old
i moved here from morocco
dale doesnt know what to make of mr
edwards comments and looks
alright well this school is for students and faculty only
friends cant just stop by
dude you may be a teacher here but were about the same age so dont get all high and mighty
its not that weird
frankly its natural
well in that case get off school property or im calling the police liaison officer
angie no offense to you but if this guys dating someone your age its because nobody his age will date him
then four handsome and fit students walk by
you were hilarious in drama today
angie smiles at the guys
dale doesnt like how all this is going down
ill wait in the car
dale and angie sit in the parked car making out
so do you want to get some food
actually i cant
i have to go serve a guy
we can hang out later though
you can come over
well see if neo is truly the one
they share a long kiss and angie gets out of the car
dale watches her walk away then whips out his cell phone and hits speed dial
over phone yo
mind if i come by and pick up some shit
saul silver is constructing a cross shaped joint two joints that intersect one another
pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table
a large scarface movie poster hangs on the wall
there is a knock at the door and dale enters
whats up saul
unpleasantly surprised what the fuck
i didnt buzz you in
how the monkey did you get in here
someone just let me in
i thats fucked up man
this building is filled with fuckin assholes
what else is the buzzer for
ill buzz next time man
im real sorry
im just not familiar with your uh
hey stuff your sorrys i n a sack bro
were always cool
its those fuckin jaggoffs
dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch
ive got this new bud
unfortunately its a few more bones but fortunately its hands down the dopest fuckin shit i ever smoked
and ive smoked some dope fuckin shit
better than that blue oyster weed
its like if that blue oyster shit and the afghan kush i got had a baby and meanwhile the craziest northern lights and that red ass espresso snowflake had a
baby and then by some miracle those babies met and fucked then this would be the shit theyd birth
saul pulls out a big bag of weed
he places it on the coffee table as though it was his child
he pulls out a large bud
dale takes the weed and looks at it
it looks spectacular
bright red hairs and large crystals huge purple and blue leaves just spectacular
dale smells it and is taken aback
what is this
its called pineapple express
my guy red told me its when this hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit
its pretty scientific
and im the only guy in the whole city who has it
and its only ten bones more for a quarter
can i get a quarter
just let me grab my scale
saul walks into another room
dale looks around anxiously he clearly wants to go
a moment later saul comes back into the room and sits down
dale notices that he didnt bring anything back from the other room
saul notices dale looking at him strangely
whats with the look
wheres the scale
be right back
saul hustles into the other room
from other room you know whats weird
how sometimes your brain just chooses to like not keep things in it you know
beat fucking scale
where is it
dale checks his watch and then looks at the door suddenly something catches his eye its the cross joint saul was constructing
what the fuck is this thing
saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table
nonchalantly ah the cross joint
youve never seen one of these
they are like the apex of the vortex of joint engineering
nasa built the first one in the eighties
saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale
you can actually smoke that contraption
saul puts dales weed in a baggie
you light all three ends at the same time then you smoke it as it resonates the main section creating a trifecta of smoking power
its like three times as powerful as a normal joint
dale hands saul some money and saul gives him his weed
dale lingers for a moment
well be careful with that thing
dale gets up and heads to the door
you wanna smoke this thing with me
dale turns around
he clearly wants to smoke it but he tries to play it cool
i cant even light it on my own
dale sits back down on the couch giddy as a schoolgirl
so like uh
so like so like what do i do
saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table
firstly you light these two ends
then i will light the tip making the trifecta complete
are you ready
dale nods and they light the joint
saul tokes hard plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a coughing holy
dale takes the joint and hits it exploding into a coughing fit
uh its good to cough
cough it opens the cough capillaries
gets you twenty five percent higher
and that combined with the pineapple weed and the cross joint cough youre a good thirty to forty times higher
i dont know the exact math but pff youre pretty fucking gong showed
you know what i mean
saul takes a toke
dale coughs harder and harder
he seems like he might throw up
the better the weed the more i wish i could think of how to explain whats so good about it but the
uh the better it is the less shit i can think of in total you know
saul passes dale the joint obliviously dropping ash all over his suit
slightly agitated dale brushes it off
okay so like youve been buying from me for like a few months now and i really gotta ask
beat whats with the suit
im a process server
you re a servant
like a butler
no process server
saul looks confused
im hired to give people papers they dont want
its pretty much the easiest job on earth
whered you get that job
dale takes a big hit from the joint
uh i got a totally useless degree two years ago then i did nothing for a year then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up
they both revel in the thought
i got it pretty sweet though
i smoked like five joints gave out some pieces of paper and i ate some burger king hey man did you get those new chicken fries
dale passes the join to saul
id get on that shit
theyre fucking mind blowing
so then i hot boxed my car and then
got some action from my girlfriend
saul laughs at this
does she smoke pot
shes in high school
thats fuckin sweet
youre like jerry lee lewis
i just read his biography
its still cool i guess
yeah its awesome although i think shes getting old enough where shes realizing i dont do much
and these high school guys these days
theyre all roided out and going to harvard
even on my best days i look like a fat dumb piece of shit next to them
it sounds like you got it pretty good
i wish i had a job that easy
youve got like the actual easiest job in the world
youre right man
i never thought of it like that
you can actually do whatever the hell you want
you get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night
dale passes saul the joint
thats totally true
thanks to that bitch daylight savings i gotta go change my grandmas clocks forward at am
i seriously cant figure it out
sorry to hear that
saul passes dale the joint
yo so like what have these people done that you go after
tonight im going after dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket
he forgot to pay his dude
my guy red gets his weed from a ted jones
hes like supplier in town
maybe its him
i doubt that man
theres probably a lot of ted jonesess out there
yeah but not like this one man
hes what i want to be one day
hes like the jesus of weed
i guess hes like jah
saul points to his scarface poster
the joint ends
after a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint
they sit in awkward silence
dale gets up
well saul that was crazy
no worries dude peace
they slap each other five and dale exits
saul turns on the tv
saved by the bell is on
it makes saul chuckle
dale cruises down side streets and locates teds house
it is a large well to do home
having difficulties dale parks in between two cars across the street
he turns off the engine and starts smoking a joint
two head lights appear up the street
its a he sits still holding the joint between his legs as the cop car drives past and
parks a few cars down
the female cop walks up the block towards dales car
oh shit on me
fortunately the cop crosses the street and walks towards teds house
confused dale watches as she is let in
dale waits a moment and then re lights the joint
he tries to see into teds house as he takes a massive toke
a silence shattering blast comes from teds house
dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window
suddenly the drapes are torn down by an asian man as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window
dale watches in horror as a large grey haired man and the female cop step forward and shoot the asian man
dale starts coughing uncontrollably
he starts the car and in a panicked fit tries to pull out
he smashes directly into the car in front of him
he flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse crunch
he backs into the car behind him
still hacking his lungs out dale drives away
the grey haired man and the female cop sprint out of the house in time to see dales distant tail lights vanish into the darkness
something catches the grey haired mans eye a trail of smoke rising from the grass
he lowers his blood stained hand and picks up
he brings it to his nose and sniffs then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely
saul is laying on his couch watching saved by the bell laughing so hard that hes crying
suddenly the buzzer sounds repeatedly
mumbles fucking hell
he grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk
he presses listen
through intercom me in
let me in
let me in
let me in
let m saul casually presses the talk button
annoyingly casual denton
he smiles to himself then presses listen
through intercom the love of shit let me in
pleeea annoyed saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door
to himself fucking dont smoke that shit if you cant handle it
a moment later dale completely freaking out bursts through the door and slams it shut
startled dude whoa
what the fuck are he fucking killed him man
be quiet man i got neighbors quietly he killed him
loud somebody killed somebody
i cant believe it
a lady and a guy
somebody killed a cop a lady and a guy
a cop killed a guy
a cop and a guy killed another guy
the lady and the guy
no a fucking woman a police woman and an old guy shot a guy a younger guy in the fucking window at teds house
was the guy ted
i dont know the old guy who shot the guy
i dont fucking know
he was this big old grey haired guy with a gun and he fucking took him and he shot him
right there in the fucking window
i heard teds got grey hair
and they saw me
they saw me see them shoot the guy
saul jumps to his feet
they saw you
why the fuck did you come here
did they follow you
saul dashes to the window and peeks out
did they follow you here
i was having a coughing fit i crashed i crashed into a car
fuck two cars
they mustve heard at least
they knew someone was there
but they dont know its you
i dont think so
theyre not coming here
dale shakes his head on the verge of tears
saul shrugs sits back down then picks up his joint and re lites it
so whats your game plan
you gonna call the cops
cause if you do id appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit
im not calling the cops one of them was a cop
they could all be cops
did you see any blood
was it sick
i saw some blood
i wonder who the guy he shot was
i dont know who do drug dealers kill
it was probably another drug dealer
he was asian
are there asian drug dealers
hell yeah man
the koreans teamed up with like the vietnamese or some shit
theyre crazy mother fuckers
number two in town
teds cappin the competition
yo you want some of this
saul passes dale the joint
dale takes the joint and frantically smokes as he paces
so like exactly what was the sequence of happenings
im sitting across from teds smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me oh the pineapple express
its so rare its almost a shame to smoke it like killing a unicorn
with like a bomb
when i threw it
dale stops pacing and stares at saul
he then looks down at the joint of pineapple weed
saul notices wheels turning in dales head
dale continues staring at the joint
this weed is actually that rare
proudly yeah its like the rarest
so you are actually the only guy in town with this weed
fuckin rights i am
red told me he was giving me an exclusive sneak preview
and am i the only guy you gave it to
so were the only guys
but like another dealer couldnt identify it the pineapple weed
like if they found a roach of it right
saul thinks for a moment
panicking we should go we shouldnt be here
we should go
i left a roach of this weed in front of teds house
i leave roaches all over fucking town
no listen they could find the roach and say this is pineapple weed sauls the only guy in town who has pineapple weed therefore he must have witnessed the murder
or know who did lets go kill him
finally saul understands
mother of fuck
he springs to his feet and bolts for the door
dale grabs saul and stops him
let go of me
lets get the fuck out of here
grab anything we might need like your weed and money and stuff
saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack
they run for the door
are you sure youre not forgetting anything
saul and dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button terrified for their lives
i forgot something
saul runs back to his apartment leaving dale alone and frightened
saul bursts back out of his apartment holding his cell
dude i was so scared going back i thought there was gonna be guys there and then youd be gone and there was this music in my head well take
the stairs itll be faster
they scramble towards the distant stairwell
almost at the door they hear the ding of the elevator arriving
they dash back to the elevator
dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in
saul rapidly presses the lobby button as the doors shut
theyre both on the verge of hyperventilating
we gotta try to relax
we dont want to draw attention
freaking out whose attention
you think they could be down there
in the lobby
i dont know
just try to be cool
ding the elevator suddenly stops on the second floor
oh my god
the doors open
theres no one there
the doors close
what the fuck was that
that was bad calm
the elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open they step out bumping into two rough looking guys
dale and saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the elevator
the rough looking guys budlofsky and matheson kick in sauls door and dash into the room guns drawn
matheson spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray
budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial
hes gone but he was just here
i think he knew we were coming
dale peels out of his spot and down the road
okay what do you know about ted
for all i know hes tracking us with space satellites right now
hes got grey hair thats all i knew
saul checks behind them
lets go to your place
what if they did see my license plate
okay so lets got to a hotel or a motel or a holiday inn
well how much money do we have
all ive got is the seventy five you gave me
well how much money do you have
while dale gets out his wallet saul opens dales change tray
its full of roaches
well shut up then
ive got more than you
forget the hotel
a tense beat
i wish we could just go nowhere
the car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon lit woods
dale paces back and forth as saul walks over
so what do we know
we may or may not be followed because we dont even know if he found the roach or not
and we could just be completely crazy
but the question is this even if he found the roach how could he know where you were
thrilled he couldnt
cause im in the woods
unless hes like hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit but i mean no what i mean is if ted found the roach and identified the weed
how could he connect it to you
theres no way
he could only find out from red
who is this red guy
reds pretty much a middleman between ted and guys like me
and were mad fucking tight
one time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand job within like five minutes of me meeting her
but lets say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to hell say you because
why wouldnt he
he would have called me if that happened
a hand job dale
imagine if id gotten you a hand job by now
yeah but saul hes a fucking drug dealer
im a fuckin drug dealer
what you dont trust me then
saul stares at dale who doesnt know how to respond
yeah sure call him
pleased saul pats dale on the back
im just being paranoid
saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial
we hear someone pick up
through phone ow

stubbed my toe
red sounds nervous
dude watch the toes
wear shoes in the house
but red i gotta get straight to brass tacs i need a favor

so you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff

red swears it hombre

dale waves his hands in front of sauls face
louldy whispering no
we should do it tomorrow
covering phone talks to dale im in the middle of a convo man
lets just go and get this shit over with
come on man
im scared shitless
i want to think things through before i do anything
lets go in the morning
saul looks around the dark forest
less scary shit happens in the day
into phone red
talking to someone else i can hear him talking to someone so yo
so youre gonna come by in the morning
yeah right after i see my grandma

saul gives dale the thumbs up
well cool brother

we should definitely hit up the casino again sometime
we should definitely hit up the casino
saul hangs up the cell
now lets do some fucking stone cold chilling
ill role a jigga on the house
red stalky and short sits between the budlofsky and why isnt he coming now
what did you say
incredibly afraid i didnt say shit man
there was another guy there and he said tomorrow
why did he mention the casino
the asians run the casinos
is saul asian
this worries the thugs
this might be more than we thought
than you thought
i thought it would be more than you did
ill call ted
i always liked smoking weed in the forest
saul lights a joint and starts smoking
he passes it to dale
they look around at their expansive dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with paranoia
saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky as dale takes out his cell phone
im going to go call angie
make up some bull shit
as dale dials saul paranoid from the pot looks at his cell phone
he takes another hit and then looks up to the sky again
he looks back at dales phone
dale starts to walk off
saul snubs out the joint and runs over to dale
yeah the phone
i mean i dont know how this shit works but
you said they might be cops
could they triangulate our phones or trace em or some shit like that
i dont know
i feel like ive seen that
dale stares at saul then flips open his phone beep i mean shit dale maybe they can trace them when were not even on them
dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky
just then a loud rumbling noise is heard
what the fuck is that
the rumbling gets louder
are we on fucking lost
what the hell is that
the noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys dive behind a tree stump
a moment later a jumbo jet buzzes overhead heading towards the nearby airport
dale and saul pop up
that was close
clutching cell phone you know what
we should just get rid of them
we should just smash em
dale looks at his phone which is a new expensive razor
i just bought this thing
maybe i can just take the batteries out
dale sighs then smashes his phone on a rock
saul looks at dale then hurls his phone into the woods as hard as he can sending it sailing into the forest
what the fuck was that
dale tosses the joint aside
i was trying to throw it at that tree
saul points out a group of trees about feet away
it was a cheap piece of shit
came free with the plan
it mustve smashed when it landed
who the fuck knows
i dont know
why couldnt you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person
i was trying to smash it
how often does a guy smash things
did you at least see where it landed
over there somewhere
we could call it
i just smashed my phone
they look into the scary dark depths of the woods
both of them are clearly terrified
man its not like they got mcguyver workin on the case
i bet they cant even triangulate it
well then you shouldnt have said anything cause now youve convinced me that they can
lets just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin
horrified they cautiously inch into the forest
do you see it
dude this is the scariest place ive ever been in my life
they nervously walk on
you ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed
the blair witch project
that ones way scarier than the one i was thinking of
mine had arnold shwartzenegger in it
now im thinking of the fucking blair witch
they inch forward nervous
they both freeze
whispering what whispering sshh
whispering what is whispering sshh
can you hear that
whispering just listen
whispering i literally hear nothing
suddenly saul sprints off into the darkness
dale looks in horror as saul vanishes amongst the trees
screaming in pain dale hears a loud thud
scared for his life he sprints in the opposite direction
he weaves in between the trees avoids some rocks and tree roots stumbles on some loose dirt then slams half his body against a tree and falls hard
saul gets up covered in dirt
panting he looks around the forest and sees no one
he thinks he hears something and sprints off
he trips on a tree root and slams into the ground
dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe the dirt off his suit
saul hears dale and whips around breaking a twig dale looks towards the noise then sprints off
saul hears someone and bolts in the opposite direction
like chickens with their heads cut off they both scramble through the woods trying to evade their imaginary enemies
dale spots his car
he jumps in and slams the door shut
hes about to turn the ignition but stops
panting and wheezing he sinks into his seat
something slams into the car
dale sees saul banging against the passenger side door
muffled through the window let me in
let me in
dale unlocks the car and saul jumps in
is there anyone even out there
i dont know
if you dont know then why the hell did you run like that
i dont know
im freaking out man

theres nothing out there thats why were here
god man you scared the fucking shit out of me
well im not getting out of the car

a moment of silence
they both look around

dale turns on the car
talk radio comes on
white accent walls would go nice with a dark colored room say a burnt sienna but dont forget

dale and saul start rolling separate joints
dale slowly wakes up
he stretches and then shakes saul
saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is
whats the time
groggy its too early
saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes
saul stares at his watch confused
this cant be right
what does it say
it says uh
saul looks outside towards the sun
it couldnt be three in the morning could it
its three oclock
we were supposed to be there at noon
my grandmas clocks
its daylight savings
they go forwards an hour
dammit its four ofucking clock
i didnt go to my grandmas

dale digs in his pockets for the keys
well find a pay pho
his number was in my phone
dale notices the keys are in the ignition
you remember where he lives right
yes i remember
what the hell is that supposed to mean

he turns the keys
he tries again

he tries again
dale shoots saul an angry look
what the fuck happened
how did this happen
we fell asleep
with your stupid talk radio
no surprise that stuffs like made to put people to sleep
frustrated dale tries to gather his thoughts
well walk to a road and hitchhike to reds
dale opens his door and hops out
yeah for real
well be late but well get there
then we can fix this insane situation
dale and saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road each smoking their own joint
saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf
dale is grossed out
saul pokes the caterpillar and then blows weed smoke onto it
stop fucking around man
leave that thing alone
they emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride
dale notices saul has his thumb sticking out of his zipper
its like my thumb is my cock
dale doesnt laugh
bored and tired they wait
saul lights a joint
saul shifts his body away from dale
just then an eighteen wheeler slows for them
saul snubs out the freshly lit joint and puts it in his pocket
dale and saul get out of the eighteen wheeler
to the driver thanks a fucking ton sharid
saul shuts the door and he and dale run towards reds house a small dilapidated place in a rundown part of town
exhausted dale and saul reach reds door
so whats this guy like
i dont know
so hes like a tea pot
well do you think hell be there
i dont know i mean we are only
eight hours late
beat thats actually pretty late
through door who is it
red opens the door
he has a split lip and has clearly been crying
he tries to act normal
dale immediately suspects something is up
sniffling whos this guy

red ushers them in and shuts the door
i think its better if you dont know my last oblivious dale denton
hes with me
red notices their dirty clothes
to saul what happened to your clothes
whered you call me from man
dale notices red quivering as he lights a cigarette and becomes increasingly suspicious
we were in the forest laying low
uh is your lip okay
saul finally notices reds dishevelled appearance
dude have you been crying
oh i uh

i started crying
a cold sore

red i just dont want to pull you into the shit were in
its just trouble

if he wants trouble its his right to have it
i dont want trouble
thats why we only need to clarify one thing nobodys called about saul or the pineapple express or anything like that
look at that
we had a crazy night in the woods which i assume we can both put behind us like grown ups and now we can use reds giant bong to get
super duper high
dale doesnt seem convinced
saul picks up reds huge bong and starts to pack a bit of reds weed into it
alright well wicked
make yourselves at home
im just going to use the ol telephone o
saul sits down and picks up a lighter as red walks towards the phone
dale watches red suspicious of his odd behavior
red begins to dial
dale knocks the phone out of reds hand
what the fuck
saul jumps up
dale snatches the phone and backs up
what the fuck are you doing
to saul we cant let him call anyone
hes acting weird
fuck you man this is my house
i just i dont think i can dale
you fucking nut
youre stoned and paranoid
just chill the shit out guy
to red im sorry red
i shouldnt have brought this guy over here hes a total lunatic
without warning red grabs a large ashtray filled with cigarette butts and whips it at dale
it smashes him in the head
in pain ash explodes everywhere as dale drops the phone and clutches his head
red approaches the cowering dale
red punches saul in the face
saul screams and drops to the ground
dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom slamming the door behind him
disoriented dale scans the small bathroom
saul and red can be heard fighting outside
dude were friends what the fuck is wrong with you
are you fucked off that shit again
i have to
theyll kill me
please dont fight
a loud crash is heard from the other room
dale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down the seat
he runs back to help saul
red is beating the shit out of saul
saul manages to stand up when red boots him in the balls
he shrieks and stumbles backwards
dale dashes into the room and leaps onto reds back
red wobbles forward then starts running backwards
he trips on his coffee table and crashes dale through it landing on top of him
red gets up sprints into the bathroom and locks the door
with great effort dale and saul manage to get up
hes going for the phone
frantically searching for the phone red flips the toilet seat up and grabs it
he begins to dial as dale and saul sprint down the hall
just as red is about to finish dialing dale and saul crash into the bathroom door
they knock it completely off its hinges slamming it directly into red
the phone flies into the bathtub
pointing at the phone saul
saul jumps into the bathtub and begins stomping the phone
dale continuously slams his body against the door in an attempt to keep red pinned down
what the fuck red
what the fuck is going on
i dont know
theyre going to kill me
you didnt stub your toe did you
red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath
dale kneels on top of the door keeping him pinned
now tell us theyre gonna come back and kill me
in an impressive show of strength red shoves the door off him knocking dale aside
saul chases red and tackles him into a wall
dale follows seconds later and notices reds large glass bong
he looks back to see saul getting pummelled
dale grabs the bong and swings around crash
it shatters on the back of reds head
red falls to the ground moaning blood dripping from his head
dale and saul stand over him out of breath bruised and battered
red you motherfucker
dale lost in thought starts to seriously freak out
its actually happening
he knows my name
red knows my name
we should beat it out of his sellout brains
youre a shitty friend red
fuck the casino
this is fucked what do we do now he knows my name
he knows my name too
well what do we do
hes gonna tell them
were not gonna have to kill him are we
i dont think i could do that
dale stares at the almost motionless red
maybe we could talk him into killing himself or like make him promise not to tell
well we have to find out what he knows
in great pain i dont know anything
you broke my bong
dale trying to act tough grabs red by the collar
tell us everything
red looks to saul for sympathy
dont look at me you sellout bastard
now start talking
i dont know anything
dale pulls saul aside
what do we do
hes not gonna talk
i think we beat it out of him
heres the deal if you dont tell us everything were going to beat you up
dont beat me up
saul dude im red
you were red
now youre no one to me
youve got five seconds okay
five four dale raises his fist
red cringes as dale softly punches his gut
it doesnt hurt him
that didnt hurt
you didnt even hurt him
hit him hard man
like fucking hit him
dale takes a deep breathe and raises his fist
dale grabs a potted plant
dale swings the plant back to strike red
the pot flies off the plant and dale smashes the dirt covered roots of the plant against reds face
two guys came here they
they were here when you called seriously
who were they
dale raises his fist
they work for ted
budlofsky and matheson
fuckin crazy weird guys
they were here all day but you guys didnt show
they said theyd kill me if i didnt bring you to them they said id how many cops does he have in his
uh payroll or whatever
i know theres this lady cop
he could have more i dont know
hes got pretty crazy connections
hes also got a cool ass hideout
its crazy man
dale and saul exchange very worried looks
listen i dale swings the plant upwards prepared to strike red again
whos his competition
indians are technically asian
the koreans i think
everyone just calls them the asians
dale and saul exchange an even more worried look
i swear to god thats all i know
tie him up and
and get the fuck out of here
i made a gravity bong here once
i know where his duct tape is
saul runs off
dale puts on sauls backpack and looks at the battered red moaning on the floor
come on lets tape this piece of shit up
dale pulls reds hands behind his back
saul is picking at the tape
i cant find the edge
i cant find the oh
saul rips open the duct tape
he quickly binds reds hands and feet
suddenly theres a knock at the door
they stop silent
red starts thrashing and trying to scream
theyre actually here to kill him
whispering what do we do
whispering i dont know
frozen in terror they dont know what to do
whispering guys guys
listen to me whispering im fuckin sorry
i fucked up
im a son of a bitch
i forgot bros before hoes even though these guys arent hoes
you know what i mean
but i can fix this
i know these guys its cool
just head out the back ill stall em
wont tell em nothing
you can count on me
red frantically tries to wriggle out of his bonds while saul leads dale out the back door
suddenly the door is kicked open
budlofsky and matheson enter guns drawn
they see red
it was saul and some dude named dale denton
they just ran out the back
dale and saul run like hell
saul spots a dumpster
saul jumps into the dumpster
ive got to get to a phone
we should hide
but if red tells teds guys my name then theyll go to my apartment and find out about angie
i think we should stay
because im in the dumpster already
saul hops out of the dumpster and follows dale
budlofsky dashes back into the apartment
theyre long gone
matheson stands over top of red talking to ted on the phone
find out what he knows
red you gonna tell us anything helpful
i just did matheson
fuckin dale dentons the other guys name
he was with saul they kicked my ass
what more do you want
you hear that
ask if either of them were asian
what skin color were these guys
white theyre both white
i think denton might be a jew but i couldnt really tell
you hear that ted
matheson pulls out a gun and shoots red in the gut
clutching his bleeding gut oh fuck
you shot me you motherfucker
youve eaten dinner here man
and now im gonna fuckin die from this probably
get the fuck out of my house
ted the big grey haired guy puts his portable phone back in its charger
the living room windows are covered by black sheets
workers are busy scrubbing blood stains off the floor and walls
the dead asian man lies on top of bubble wrap in the corner
ted walks into the kitchen where carol brazier female cop from the murder in full uniform mid s is playing with her gun
carol theres another name to run
does he have something to do with our friend in there
if the asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home we cant be too cautious
the boys say denton and saul are caucasian
maybe after their assassin failed they hired this outside guy denton to finish the job
pondering also the boys said that saul mentioned going to the casino
going to the casino
i dont like that
carol holsters her gun
inside an escalade with tinted windows sit two frightening looking asian men
they have earphones on and an eavesdropping tool aimed at teds house
they hear every word
one of them writes down info in korean
through one of the asian mens ear piece ill be back in an hour with everything there is on dale denton
hell be dead by the time we make our pick up tomorrow
dale and saul are still running and are unbelievably exhausted
gasping and wheezing but my parents live in canada
you dont think theyre going to go to canada do you
how would they get a canadian phone book even
gasping and wheezing all i know is angies new number is on my fridge and they could see that so i have to get to her
my grandma lives here
they wouldnt go after her would they
shes got a different last name
dale hails a cab
dales apartment door bursts open
budlofsky and matheson enter guns drawn
they start searching the apartment
budlofsky presses a button on the answering machine
dales voice cough its dale
im probably at work maybe well talk later
beep matheson walks to the fridge and yanks off a note
budlofsky looks at the note memorize angies new cell go get weed dale and saul get out of the cab in a pleasant neighborhood
saul begrudgingly pays the driver
they walk towards angies house
dude stay here
ill be back in a minute
i dont want to be alone
i want to go with you
saul just watch my back
ill literally be five minutes
dale runs up to the front door and frantically knocks
angie answers the door
dale dashes in
angie opens the door with a smile the phone in hand
her attention is towards the phone conversation she is having
dale enters her apartment
dale freezes in horror angies parents shannon and robert are pleasantly eating at the dining room table
nice to meet you sit down and have some couscous
can i get you a drink
robert sees that dale is dirty dishevelled bruised and what the hell happened to you
what happened to you
robert and shannon exchange worried looks
nothing i was in the woods and
turns to angies parents hi im dale

i apologize for my appearance
robert charlotte not amused shannon

dale walks to robert and extends his dirty bloody hand
very nice things
robert smugly declines dales hand shake

dale starts gathering all their jackets and shoes

deep breath listen

the andersons stare at him dumbfounded
robert gets up and stands tall
get the hell out of my house
anderson look heres the deal i saw a crooked cop kill a guy while i was working
the cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off and i think they might have seen my license plate and so i ditched my car
in the woods so
they stare at dale as though he were crazy
saul sees a car nearing
he sees budlofsky and matheson are in it
no fucking way
he runs like hell towards angies
angie and her parents try to make sense of what dale is saying
who are these people
why are they i think their drug dealers
on the verge of tears why
well its complicated
it doesnt matter right now we just have to get out of here
lets go to the police
no they are the police
im getting my gun
we bought it for a reason
robert runs up the stairs to his bedroom
suddenly saul bursts through the front door in a panicked frenzy
completely out of breath you
angie grabs a fork off the table and stabs it into sauls shoulder
freaking out dale its one of the drug dealers
im dales dealer im s angie
what did you do angie
saul yanks the fork out and tosses it on the ground
now im gonna need a tetanus shot
they fuckin kill
dale who is dale theyre coming
then robert appears at the top of the stairs with his gun
he sees saul bleeding and screams
he fires at saul
budlofsky and matheson are walking towards the front door when they hear the gunshot and dive behind some bushes
what the hell
get out your fucking gun
what the fuck is going on
blasts through the front door and almost hits them
everyone is in shock
saul frantically pats himself down to see if he got hit
hes with me

except shannon and angie
so you two dont move

we have to get out of here
anderson whispers to dale its shannon
look we have to get out of here
im sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than
for real yes
dale and saul lead angie and her parents towards the back door
budlofsky and matheson are now at the front door
theyve each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in
budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge
budlofsky puts in the last few bullets
hurry the fuck up
chill out man
youre nagging isnt helping
budlofsky cocks his gun and nods at matheson
they kick open the doors and run into her house
no one is there
budlofsky cautiously walks over to the table and touches the food
its still warm
matheson bends down and picks up a bloody fork
its a bloody fork
what are these people doing
dale angie her parents and saul burst into the garage
robert is fumbling with the keys
he manages to open the car
saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound
look at that
fuckin mashed potatoes in my wound
get in the car quick
angie in the car
the andersons get in the car
dale get in the car
to dale you stay the fuck away from my family

you never know where they might be whoever they are
angie gets in the car
dale pecks her on the lips
i love you
angie gets in the car
dale pecks her on the lips
and nice to meet you guys
she shuts her door and the andersons pull out
dale watches them depart with great concern
why arent we in that car
lets run man
they start to sprint
huff huff where are we running
somewhere we can think
ted and carol are in mid discussion and rather distraught at that
behind them two henchmen take the dead asian mans body out the back door
a bloody fork
in his girlfriends house
and the blood was fresh
maybe he killed her to protect himself
or maybe its the asians fucking with us
what the fuck is going on
a frustrated beat any luck with the cell phones
they smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us
took us an hour to find it
and we found dentons car which was filled with all these strange disguises
these guys are for real
ted slams his fist on a table
i want to talk to the asians
get me cheungs number
cheung the leader of the asians has a lavish mansion which is covered in ornate decorations and expensive merchandise
it is immaculately clean and organized
several armed men with earpieces stand in strategic locations throughout the house
cheung is reading a korean book alone in his study
the phone rings and he picks it up
in korean hello
cheung sits up shocked to have his opponent calling him
he snaps his fingers and two guards run in
he covers the phone
in korean record this conversation
he uncovers the receiver
perfect english ted
this is surprising
what would you like
cheung i want you to call off your man denton
i dont know what he is a scout assassin and frankly i dont care
i just want him gone
i want him dead
if you do this ill consider it a peace offering otherwise youre asking for war
and just in case you forgot im number one and theres a reason for that
youve got hours to reply
we stay on cheung
he hails another guard
ted jones is slipping
our assassin failed to kill him but it did rattle his confidence
its earlier than planned but we should strike now while he is confused
let it be known he turns to a picture of the asian ted killed earlier
li youngs death will not be in vain
dale and saul are sitting in the branches of a tree
fast food wrappers lie scattered
saul is rolling a joint
victory joint complete
here ya go
saul passes it to dale who lights it
dale takes another puff and starts to seriously relax
a smile creeps across his face as he passes the joint to saul
tell us what you know
how fuckin balls was that
saul takes a puff
like really balls
and i think i fought pretty well dont you
you know for my first time
we were like tango and cash man
knocked the door right off its hinges
saul passes the joint to dale
and you probably saved angie which is fucking pimp
i probably couldnt have done it without you

saul passes the joint to dale

like you dont like me you like my drugs so fuck you buddy
and just so you know i totally could have lit that cross joint on my own
id just have to use candles but like ive never smoked one of those with anyone before
dale passes saul the joint
so do you think we should leave town
we could just get on a bus and go right
we only have like fifty bucks
i dont think that could even pay for one ticket
saul rubs the roach out in the dirt
what about your sack
saul rubs his balls again
its still fucking killing me
laughing no dude your sack of weed
cant we sell some
thats my bread and butter
we just have to go to a highschool
its the easiest market
arthur is like a block a way

i mean we got it from guys like us
well then not kids at that school
well theres a bunch of private ones nearby but theyre into way crazier shit than weed i cant do it man
im not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go
thinks then we could go to crackhead park
its a park
really close actually
full of crackheads
they smoke weed too though
there are several tarp houses set up garbage all over and crazy dangerous homeless people milling about the park
a deranged looking homeless man walks over to another one and starts pissing on his leg
they begin fist fighting
suddenly a half eaten hamburger hits dale in the face and a bag lady comes up to saul and starts poking him
hey stop it
you wanna buy some weed or like what
the bag lady runs off
see thats the problem around here
target demographic has a real uh fickle attention span
you gotta wow em
who wants some weed
fuck this place
at the same high school angie goes to dale and saul walk up to four thirteen year old students
desmond walt ack and blake yo
you guys want some chronic
dale and the four kids all laugh hysterically as saul marches around pretending to be godzilla blasting weed smoke out of his nose and mouth as though it was fire
saul passes ack the joint
he takes a puff and starts coughing
very stoned man this is great
cough cough whats it called again
they said it like eight times you fucking tard
oh so sorry if i come on man
puff puff pass

blake passes the joint to dale
alright gentlemen its time for me to teach you some business
brass tacs this is the best weed youve ever smoked agreed
the kids all nod in agreement

how much did you get between you
a hundred and seventy eight
saul pulls out his impressive bag of weed
the kids gasp
you gimme all your money you can each take two handfuls of weed
that treat ya right
the kids cheer as desmond takes two big handfuls
thats fucking awesome
keep it on the down low
they pay dale and take their weed
happy as hell they run off stuffing handfuls of weed into their pockets
to walt jasonll never believe this
until i show him all this weed
dale holds the un lit joint as saul takes the pot and the money
and we my good man are officially scott fuckin free
there are still people trying to kill us
but at least now we can afford to run
im gonna go buy some celebration snacks
lets have us a little mardi gras fiesta
saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around the corner
dale re lights the remaining roach and casually smokes
he blows some smoke rings coughs a bit stretches for a few moments looking completely relaxed but then a cop car screeches to a halt right in front of dale
a female police liaison officer who is not carol gets out of the car
dale freezes in horror
she walks towards dale
he seems prepared to run but she places her hand on a can of pepper spray
this stuff hurts
whats in your hand
im sorry maam
ill get rid of it right away i was just smoking this
i thought it was decriminalized
for medical purposes
i have epilepsy
selling pot to my students isnt decriminalized
im the liaison officer for this school and i just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends
they told me they got it back here
put your hands up
she cuffs dales hands behind him
i wasnt selling anything
all i have is this little joint
police liaison takes the large joint out of dales hand
you call this little
she throws it on the ground and smears it around with her foot
i dont even have any money
how did i sell weed if i dont have any money
i was just smoking it
she pats him down finding only his wallet
the police liaison sees he only has nine dollars
she pulls out his its possible youre telling the truth
im going to run a check and if it turns out you dont have any priors and all youve got is this small amount of marijuana ill let you go
with a fine
take a seat
she walks towards her car as dale sits on the ground
angle on saul saul merrily turns into the alley holding two red slurpees when he jumps back in terror
he sees the cop car up the alley
he ducks back behind the corner
they got dale
oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
angle on dale and the police liaison she looks at her car computer
the screen reads she looks back at dale and types into her computer
we see carol who is in fact teds evil accomplice speeding down the road
her police computer beeps
she looks at the screen
the police liaison stuffs dale in the back of her squad car
what is this for
what did that thing tell you
what did i do
hit and run mr
a double actually
you hit two parked cars two nights ago
a look of crippling horror comes across dales face as she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut
angle on saul he peaks down the alley and sees dale in the back of the car and the female police liaison getting in the front
the lady cop
shes gonna kill him
the car slowly makes a three point turn
you dont understand
you have to let me go
dirty cops are gonna kill me
the police liaison ignores dale
this lady cop and these guys budlofsky and matheson they all work for ted jones and suddenly interested ted jones
with grey hair
tell me you know what im talking about
he lives near evergreen heights
he are you telling me you saw ted jones and a police office shoot someone
an asian someone
the police liaison ponders as she finishes her three point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley
stay calm do as your told ill get you down to the station
ecstatic yes maam
saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car
he looks at the two red slurpees and thinks then suddenly jumps out and throws himself onto the hood of the cop car
the police liaison and dale see a body slam against the car and red liquid splatter everywhere covering the windshield
in the impact we clearly see sauls balls getting rocked on the car
the police liaison slams on the brakes causing dale to smash into the metal cage
oh my god
is that blood
oh my god
she puts the car in park
as the police liaison gets out of her car saul can be seen crawling around the back of the vehicle clutching his testicles
the frightened police liaison looks at the windshield
she notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and quickly turns around
she sees saul jumping into the drivers seat
saul sees a shotgun beside the passenger seat
the police liaison reaches for her gun
what are you doing
hold on amigo
tango and cash
saul slams the car into reverse
he speeds backwards up the alley as the police liaison runs after them gun no
she was going to help us
in pain oh
i seriously think i popped one
suddenly carol the cop from teds house whips her cop car into the alley
it smashes into the rear of their car
dale turns around and establishes eye contact with the stunned carol
horrified its her
the lady cop
saul slams down the gas
through the slurpee covered window saul sees the police liaison rushing towards them
motion at the police liaison then whos that
the police liaison raises her gun
she fires and the bullet punches through the windshield
the police liaison dives to the side as they zoom past her
they burst out of the alley
a moment later carol follows in hot pursuit
the car weaves through traffic
i cant see
turn on the wipers
saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car
he finally turns on the wipers which wipe away the slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he still cant see through it
carols car emerges right behind them
dude i seriously cant see
kick out the window
isnt that what they do
i dont know
saul with great effort keeps one foot on the pedals and with all his might kicks his other leg through the front window
his leg punches straight through the glass but he cant pull it back in
get it out of there
suddenly their car gets jerked to the side
carol is ramming them from behind
hysterical shes following us
shes gaining on us
her cars better
saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of the hole
he begins to accelerate and realizes he can see where hes going through the hole
i can see
through my leg hole
saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a large park
carol is right behind them
saul thinks hard then buckles his seat belt
ive got an idea
dale does what little he can to brace himself
saul slams on the breaks
carol sees saul screeching to a halt and slams on her breaks
she grunts and whips out her gun
both cars come to a full stop beside one another
she opens fire blam
bullets rip through the stolen cruiser
shattered glass flies everywhere
dale and saul desperately duck for cover
saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off
saul pops back up and begins steering again
oh shit man
i thought shed keep going
the car bumps back on to a main road
carol follows sirens blaring
turn on the sirens
sauls hand flails around grasping everything
he feels the shotgun and accidentally pulls the trigger boom
the blast blows through the roof of the car and hits an overhead traffic light shredding it to pieces
carol flies into the intersection on a collision course with saul and dale
a car smashes into the side of the carols cruiser
as dale and saul speed off carol emerges from the smoking wreckage a look of hate in her eyes
the stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and saul hops out
he starts running up the block at top speed
dale still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser starts thrashing and screaming
im locked in
dale continues to scream as saul obliviously bolts to the end of the block and just keeps going
you dumb fucking fuck
dale sits in the car helpless
he has a look of utter disbelief on his face
after a moment of silence he starts wildly kicking the door window
he soon gives up
just then dale notices saul over a block away running back towards the stolen car
saul soon arrives completely out of breath and opens the door
dale flops out of the car and onto the grass
saul tries to help him to his feet but dale pulls away
dont touch me you asshole
dale wiggles to his feet runs for it
dale and saul enter the hardware store walking very close together so that no one sees dale is handcuffed
they receive a few odd looks as they search and locate what they are looking for saws
saul quickly finds a sturdy looking hack saw
okay only one way to do this hard and fast
dale gets on his knees and bends over pressing his face up against the wall
saul begins to manically hack away at the cuffs
suddenly saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the saw underneath dales suit jacket
which saw do you like most
the brown ones nice but the metallic ones seems more
they watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to sawing the handcuffs
dale stretches his arms
the handcuffs are still on his hands but no longer attached
relieved okay im going to go call angie
be right back
a thank you would be nice
dale is on the phone
could i have the uh carlyle room please
angie is watching tv alone in a hotel room
the phone rings and she picks it up
thank god youre okay
how are you
are you okay
i miss you
so heres the plan babe
im going to leave town and contact a government official or something
from somewhere safe
i know this shit is all fucked up and i just cant apologize enough
ive realized some problems and i know theres a problem
thats the thing thats why i dale shut up and listen
people are trying to kill you and me
dale drug dealers are trying to kill me because of you
its fucking over man
are you kidding me
for gods sake
dont you get it
i was thrown into this situation i had no control but i am dealing with it
this kind of thing happens you know beat youre immature dale
im six years younger and im saying this
and the fact that you think youre some kind of fucking genius just makes it a hundred times more infuriating
youre telling me you think im a dumb guy
youre not how you think you are dale and its pathetic
call me when i can go home
angie hangs up
as dale walks out of his phone booth we see that saul is on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a pipe
alrghit ill see you soon
and im sorry again about the clocks
what a douche bag
beat yeah love you too
saul hangs up and exits the phone booth
yo so before we go on the lamb i gotta go see my grandma okay
she was worried cause i didnt show up to help with the locks
but before that ive got to smoke another bowl
are you joking
youre actually gonna smoke marijuana
how can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through
that clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana
it happened because those fucking kids didnt keep that shit on the down low
which is weird cause they really seemed like cool kids
if you havent noticed were not very functional when were stoned saul
when i saved you with those slurpees i was stoned
what do you gotta say to that
maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan
the beatles were high
you didnt save me
she was going to protect us and now were wanted for all sorts of crazy shit
saul lights his bowl
but you know how scarface ends
face down dead in your own fuckin water fountain
for one thing im done dealing pot
mostly because i dont know where i would get it now but still
and b fuck you man
you cant judge me
were exactly the same and this whole things your fucking fault
youre the one who dropped the roach
its not my fault
dale points at sauls bowl
its marijuanas fault
stop calling it marijuana
grow up you fucking two year old
this is why youre a douche bag denton
because you think youre better than others but youre just a dumb pothead burnout same as me
maybe i am a pothead burnout but at least im not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world
the only reason i ever bought weed from you was because youre shit is so good not because youre cool
but you said you bought when you already had a few times just to hang out
i just like
liked having lots of different kinds of weed at once
saul takes out his wad of cash and throws half of it at dale
buy yourself a good last meal
he throws fifty more cents at the shocked dale
super size it bitch
saul walks off
im sorry man
i didnt mean all that
a sad dale starts picking up the money
carol who is a little bruised up from the car crash sits with ted
they are both furious
guy drove like a mother fucker
it was amazing
this is not good
we should have this under control
we havent heard shit from the asians
got these lunatics after us
carol checks her watch
we should probably get to the farm
music up the end by the doors saul gets on a bus and sits down sad and deject
dale sits against the phone booth crying like a baby
he buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy of weed
he hurls it away
he gets up to retrieve it
saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant nearly crying as he eats his burger and fries
dale stares at a joint in his hands thinks for a moment and then crying profusely lights it and starts smoking
a solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly onto the tip of the joint putting it out
dale hears the sizzle and looks at the joint
he continues crying
he puts the joint down beside three large roaches
walking down the street saul sees the point grey retirement home
dale feverishly looks through the phone book
he finds what hes looking for belogus
saul hiding behind a bush across the street surveys the retirement home
seeing the coast is clear he walks towards the entrance
as saul enters the building budlofksy and matheson pull up
saul casually walks into the lobby
the elderly residents of the retirement home are milling around the massive common room
saul turns and sees an elderly woman
saul peers over her shoulder and sees budlofsky and matheson walk in
saul runs for it and they chase after him
he maneuvers through the elderly like a pylon course the thugs right on his ass
he bursts into another room
he tears through the room filled with old people eating
budlofsky and matheson pursue him
as saul runs through the hall budlofksy and matheson appear
matheson whip out his gun and fires blam
the bullet whizzes past saul and two elderly men who dont even flinch and then shatters a distant window
saul turns the corner and bam
he slams into someone sending the person crashing to the ground
ow ow ow
saul looks terrified hes hurt an old person but sees it is a young male nurse
he runs for it and sees an open door with chatter coming from inside
he runs into a dead end
several startled old women look up from their majong
one of them instantly recognizes saul solly silver
you gotta hide me
the budlofsky and matheson bursts into the room
saul looks around sees a teapot and grabs it
he hurls it at matheson and nails him in the face
the tea pot shatters and hot water pours all over his face and hand
budlofsky grabs saul and knees him in the balls
budlofsky punches saul in the face
dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he sees several police cars parked outside their lights flashing
he sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn
doing his best to avoid the cops he joins the cluster of elderly
oh god this is terrible
poor poor faye
hey uh whats going on here
it just happened
faye belogus grandson was kidnapped from right inside the building
we all saw it
they fought in the majong room and hurt the new nurse stefan
dale is terrified
if i was there i wouldve kicked an ass
dale looks circle of people comforting a crying old woman clearly faye belogus
he walks over
i wouldnt worry sauls going to be fine
dale walks off determined
saul wakes up but cant see anything
from his pov we see tape get ripped off his eyes and mouth
saul sees a budlofsky wielding a knife
he struggles and realizes that his arms and legs are bound
saul closes his eyes assuming hes about to die
whispers to himself fuck
i regret everything
budlofsky cuts the tape away from sauls legs
saul gets up and hops out of the car
he looks around and see that he is in a large barn
saul notices six thugs talking as they move bricks of weed and cocaine into a van
matheson appears and looks at saul with smoldering hatred
saul sees that his face and neck were burnt from the tea and the broken shards of pot cut his cheek
that looks painful
matheson walks over lowers to one knee and punches him straight in the balls
matheson whips out his gun and shoves it in sauls mouth
budlofsky taps matheson on the shoulder
ted wants him
matheson looks at the wheezing saul curled over by his feet and punches him in the back of the head
matheson pokes saul in the back with his gun ushering him towards the corner of the barn
they come to an old trap door
matheson opens the hatch and they descend
saul is led along a narrow tunnel
as they reach the end sauls eyes go wide
he enters the same massive metal room that the government used in the s at the beginning of the movie
only now it is rather worn down and filled with hundreds of huge marijuana plants
breath taken el dorado
matheson urges saul through the dense forest of weed passing several of teds thugs the hum of the giant grow lights filling the air
dude look at all this weed
shut the fuck up and keep moving
as matheson ushers saul through the foliage saul notices a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba diving uniform the one from the s intro hanging on a wall
what the hell is that
they arrive at a door
matheson opens it and shoves saul in causing him to almost trip
it is the same room private miller was in
matheson shuts the door
dale kicks open reds door and dashes into reds ready for anything
dale starts looking around
he hears music and then sees hes stepping in a pool of blood
oh my god
dale follows the music into the bathroom
dale enters and is shocked to see red lying on the floor clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and beer in the other
the music is coming from a small boom box
a little out of it what
who the fuck
red turns toward dale and picks up a kitchen knife with his bloody hand
stay the fuck back denton
i didnt do shit

utterly shocked i

red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint and a sip of his beer

cough red takes a hit and coughs
it clearly brings terrible pain to his bullet wound
red i need you to tell me where teds base is
he took saul and i cant bail on him
im going to get him back
red stares intensely at dale
fuckin eh amigo
red heroic ish ly rises from the floor
he hobbles over to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall
dale looks in and sees several hand guns inside
blaze of glory motherfucker
dale and red are in reds car a ford fiesta driving through the countryside
dale stops the car yards from the barn
this is awesome
were so gonna show those motherfuckers
think they can kill me
fuck no you cant
not how i roll
red gets out and walks to the drivers side
dale gets out gun in hand
red gets in the drivers seat
what are you doing
so this is the backside of the farm
if you stay low in the grass you should be fine
if someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon zig zag
it makes you harder to hit
youre not coming to help
ive been shot
by these guys
i was in shock before but the air on the drive cleared my mind i should get to the hospital
you saw reservoir dogs right

i could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me
full of possibilities

but how do i get out of here if i rescue saul
ive no idea
im sure it wont be that hard

good luck amigo
red drives off
dale takes a deep breath clenches his gun and starts cautiously moving towards the barn
he checks to make sure his safety is off and hes ready to fight
dale sneaks up on the building and pears in between two boards
he sees budlofsky supervising as the thugs load the van
budlofsky is about to light a cigarette when suddenly dale does a jumping role into the burn and then quickly scampers to his feet and puts a gun to thug
ill blow his fuckin brains out if you dont blam
budlofsky shoots thug in the chest
oh my god
dale drops his gun and puts his hands up
what the fuck was that budlofsky
havent you seen speed
shoot the hostage
in the leg you fucking moron
budlofsky points his gun at thug
two of the thugs grab dale and punch him several times
throw him in with the other guy and everyone stay alert
jared go watch outside
this is fucked up
somethings going down
the thugs start bringing dale towards the hatch
suddenly one of them motions for the other to stop feeling something on dales back
i think hes got a gun
thug lifts up dales shirt revealing that he has taped a gun to his back
youre kidding me right
i had to try
the thugs bring him down the trap door
hes got another one taped to his stomach
and his leg
saul is sitting against the wall with his hands bound and a look of complete defeat
suddenly the door opens and dale is tossed in by budlofsky
what the fuck
did you rat me out you shitty bastard
that what happened
i came here to save you
to save me
youre caught too
and now i have to die with some asshole
saul i deserved that because i fucked you
youre right this whole things my fault and they only way i can make it up to you is by rescuing you and thats why im here
to save my friend
tell ya what dale
you actually save me and ill consider forgiving you for this mad shit
cause i will
what you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick
were not gonna escape dale were losers and sinners and after we die were gonna go to hell
were not losers
we did that car chase
that was all you man
you got away from the cops
ive watched like nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and ive never seen a guy get away
but you did it
you did the impossible
suddenly they both hear someone coming
the door opens
matheson pokes his head and gun in
we can hear you out there and its annoying
shut the fuck up
he looks dale and saul up and down then shuts the door
dale sits down and thinks but is disturbed by his belt buckle which is digging into his gut
now rub your wrists against my belt
my belt bucklell cut the tape
this is it
saul is hesitant but awkwardly gets in position anyway
in an unavoidably sexual looking motion saul begins to gyrate against dales belt buckle
you know what this is called saul
this is called saving you
the barn door slides open
ted and carol walk in
you have them
got them downstairs
where did you find them
we found saul at his grandmothers and dale denton busted in here like a madman armed to the teeth and budlofsky looks over at the man he shot
yeah he just plugged frank and then i disarmed him
we got em both holed up downstairs
he shot frank
who the fuck is this dale denton
five asian men lay on their stomachs in the tree line dressed in black and armed with machine guns
one of them stares through a pair of night vision binoculars while utilizing a listening device
we see his view of ted and hear what he hears
well well torture these two bastards and find out everything they know
what about the shipment
ready to move out
well be good to in minutes or so
the asian leader nods and does some hand signals to his men
the acknowledge they understand
he holds up a flashlight and flashes three times
from the opposing side of the barn two other flashlights blink back
they all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn
dale and saul are still humping away
this isnt working
im using my mouth
dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on sauls hands
suddenly they hear approaching footsteps
whispering someones coming
whispering yo if i cough im going to make a move if i cough twice you take the lead
what if you actually cough
dale stands up just as matheson walks in gun drawn
dale looks at saul and notices that hes managed to free his hands
dale coughs twice
saul shoots him a worried look and shakes his head
saul coughs twice
dale shoots him a confused look
saul motions at him and hey man whatever youre doing i get it okay
so just stop it alright
just cut it blam
matheson shoots at dales head
dale falls to the ground specks of blood hitting saul as he dives forwards tackling matheson into the wall
the mathesons gun slides across the room hitting dales motionless body
saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it
matheson gets to his feet
saul turns and blam
he shoots matheson in the gut
holy shit man
matheson writhes in pain
saul turns to see dale lying face down
ted and carol talk as budlofsky and the thugs silently stands by
ted is holding a large hunting knife
has anyone seen my bigger knife
beat do you guys hear that
suddenly there is an explosion and a hole is blown in the barn wall
budlofsky is blasted back and badly torn up
asian assassins start pouring into the barn
one of them sees the wounded budlofsky and blasts him away with a machine gun
subtitled in korean rata tat tat
everyone opens fire
matheson moans and groans behind saul who is staring at dales motionless body
horrified he flips dale over
the top of his left ear has been blown off
saul analyzes dales wound
they got your ear
behind saul matheson tries to stand up but immediately falls back down
difficulty hearing my what
saul helps dale stand up freeing his hands
dale feels his ear
in pain dale turns to the injured matheson
to saul you shot me
to matheson well you kneed my balls
you shot him
dale notices saul is holding a gun
dale turns to matheson who has stopped moving
they walk out the door and cautiously enter the forest of weed
the asians riddle the barn with bullets as they scream at ted and his men in korean
the remaining thugs scamper about returning fire to the asians
ted and carol hide behind a vehicle
one two three
carol and ted pop up and unload their guns hitting several of their assailants
they watch in horror as several more creep in through the hole the escalade made
you go down
ill take care of this
ted nods as carol steps out from behind her cover and nails several assassins
rat a tat tat
carol is shot several times in the chest
she lurches backwards but does not fall
her bullet proof vest has taken the bullets
carol continues firing and kills another attacker as ted runs for the trap door
dale and saul slowly make their way through the dense marijuana foliage
look at all this fucking weed man
where the hell are we
is this some underground weed city we dont know about
saul suddenly grabs dale and pulls him down
whispering whats that noise
whispering i dont know
that guy just blew half my fucking ear off
pointing across the room theres some dudes in here
i saw them when i got dragged down
and theres some kind of super suit or something
were they armed
whispering i dont think so
dale and saul both scramble along a row of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them
they continue running and then stop
i cant hear them
saul spots an air vent in the middle of the room
you could boost me up
well sneak out
they are being shot at again
saul hesitantly takes aim and pulls the trigger
they run and turn several corners when saul suddenly trips over a dead thug
you got him
dale picks up the thugs machine gun
suddenly a thug appears behind saul
you sons of dale shoots right over sauls shoulder and nails the thug several times
i killed him
about time you killed somebody
youre the one whose supposed to be saving me and i ve killed two bad guys already
saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room
dale looks at the pipe sizes up saul and himself and takes a deep breath
youll never be able to pull me up but ill boost you up there and you just fucking run for it man
no fucking way dale
what about you
dale cocks his gun
dont worry about me
that was awesome
saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop dales shoulders and tears the vent off
youre a good man dale denton
saul lifts himself in
suddenly dale sees ted enter the room and immediately go for his gun
wha dale walks out from under saul raises his gun and unloads rata tat tat
ted ducks as the plants around him are torn asunder
dale runs out of ammo
ted shoots at saul who narrowly avoids the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent
ted redirects his attention to dale who is running through the bushes
ted blasts off a few shots before dale vanishes into the foliage
saul wiggles his way through the vent
he turns a corner and there is a skeleton wedged in the vent
a grate leading out is directly above the corpse
saul squeamishly crawls over the skeleton
a fuckin dead guy
he spots dog tags around its neck as he crawls by
they read private greg b
thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking out of the ground
the top flies off and saul emerges
he flops onto the ground then immediately scampers to his and pulls out his gun
saul looks to the open road to freedom then back at the barn
dale frantically runs through the rows of plants when suddenly he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner of his eye and swings his gun at it nearly
whispering oh god
dale slows down to catch his breath staring at the strange scuba suit
then he gets an idea
angle on ted quietly walking through the room ted raises his gun as he spins around a corner
where are you you son of a bitch
ted turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit
he starts to walk past it when he stops himself
he creeps back and looks at it suspicious
he walks closer breathing as quietly as he can his gun clenched tightly
he slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face hatch
he gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it when dale jumps out from behind him and swings a fire extinguisher at teds face slam
ted drops his gun as he falls to the floor
ted leaps upwards and uppercuts dale hard
saul inches towards the barn hearing a melee of gunfire and screams as he nears it
he cautiously peers in and watches as carol shoots an assassin in the chest then spins around and shoots at another assassin who desperately runs with a metal briefcase handcuffed
to his wrist
carol hits him several times he lurches over and falls through the trap door
she smiles and drops her empty gun
saul watches carol as she heads towards the trap door
he takes a deep breath and charges into the barn unleashing a barrage of bullets at her
blam blam blam
none of the bullets hit her
she turns and sees saul who drops his empty gun
fuck tha po lice
they both scream in rage and charge fists flying as they collide
carol whips saul around by his collar and hurls him to the ground
she runs up and kicks him in the gut time and time again
im a fucking cop you moron
saul leaps to his feet and punches carol in the face
he punches her again
she reaches for her mace so saul kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself then sprays her in the face
he punches her in the face
ted and dale are squared off
both are bloody lipped and bruised
dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot as they talk
you cant fucking take me
prime of my life
old and dying
i dont know who you are denton or why youre trying to ruin my life but youre fuckin dead
ted rips off his shirt revealing dozens of fearsome tattoos and scars
dale quickly picks a grow light up off the ground
ted does the same
the humming of the grow lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle squared off
they both swing and their grow lights collide sending shards of glass everywhere
both receive several small cuts
the immediately charge at each other and are soon grappling on the ground
carol writhes on the ground as saul runs towards her with a plank of wood
he shatters it over her head
carol drops unconscious
saul drops to his knees exhausted
crazy huff huff psycho bitch
saul turns around to see matheson clutching his bleeding gut with one hand and a loaded gun with the other
i owe you one
in the gut
then the balls and then the crash
reds car smashes through the side of the barn and slams into matheson pulverizing him
it lurches to a stop directly on top of the hatch leading underground
red steps out of the car
to mathesons corpse you just got killed by a ford fiesta motherfucker
how you like me now
dude me and that dale guy are rescuing you
and getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut
red gets shot in the gut and drops
saul spins around to see carol standing behind him a machine gun aimed
ted and dale grapple violently on the ground
his gut jiggles as he lunges forwards punching dale in the throat
dale falls to his knees gasping for air
ted kicks him in the head and picks up his gun
barely alive the asian assassin with the briefcase drags himself down the corridor and enters the grow room
he opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb
the assassin inserts a key
ted stands over dale aims the gun to his head and ka boom
the briefcase explodes
flames sweep over the room as dale rolls for cover
ted gets blasted back
saul tries to be brave as carol takes final aim
now prepare to eat shit and die kaboom
the explosion bursts up from the hatch with incredible force
saul and carol get blown back as reds ford fiesta is sent flying up in the air
the flaming car lands directly on carol and explodes
the entire barn is now engulfed in flames
the air thick with weed smoke dale slowly rises to his feet
he sees ted slumped against the wall dead partially aflame
dale walks over to teds body and takes the gun out of his hand
he pulls a small blue envelope out of his pocket and drops it on ted
but youve been served
dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire
the air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath
dale looks around desperately
he spots the fire extinguisher
he looks at the flames
he takes a deep breath picks up the fire extinguisher hurls it with all his might at the fire and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at it
he hits the extinguisher and it explodes blasting out the fire in the hallway towards the barn
dale runs like hell
as he bolts down the hallway the flames rush back in and chase after him
the barn starts to buckle when dale suddenly leaps out of the trap door flames licking his heels
coughing profusely dale stands in the barn then realizes his pants are on fire
dale wriggles out of his pants and kicks them away
cough cough he starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips over someone
he grabs one of the unconscious sauls feet and starts to drag him out of the barn
just a they exit the barn collapses in on itself crumbling into a massive heap of burning wood
dale pulls saul onto the grass
saul starts coughing
cough cough youre okay
confused cough cough what the fuck happened
we did it
we beat them
no fucking way
pointing at the fire how did that happen
i have absolutely no idea
they were fighting asian dudes man
maybe this is revenge for that asian dude i saw ted kill
so were like in a drug war
whats cool is that you came back for me man
you did right
you werent just captured again were you
i was scott free
but how the hell was i going to leave you there after you came to save me
they take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch
suddenly they see something moving in the rubble
red emerges lightly crisped with his clothes on fire
he roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out
light me on fire
kill my fiesta
red pats out the flames and stands up all charred and covered in dirt
fuck yeah im fine
youre makin me feel like a broken record
now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole
they all stand up
red puts his arms around dale and saul for support
they start to hobble towards the forest
what should we do now
can we go home
ive gotta get downtown try and win angie back
tell her you cut off your ear for her like that crazy artist
beat but seriously dude your joking right
shell never take you back ever
just grow up and date a woman your own age
do you think we should have looked for the ear
they probably couldve re attached it eh
i mean this ear thing kind of fucking sucks
oh my god they blew your ear off man
fuck thats gross
can you dudes switch sides
i dont want to look at it
dont worry man
look at evander holyfield he looks totally normal
and plus i saw this thing on the discovery channel they can actually grow ears like in a petri dish or even on the side of a mouse
and you only need half of one
itll be a fuckin cinch
i just realized ive lost my job by now
i havent called in for days

i totally agree with you man
i work out of my house and its like one of my main concerns garbage pile up
saul whatre you going to do
work at a bong shop
im still selling weed
fuck you guys
they walk together in silence delighted at their new prospects
after a brief moment saul suddenly seems afraid
he starts nervously looking back towards the barn
do you hear something
dale motions at his wounded ear
all i hear is ringing
dude im kind of freakin out
i dont know
like there might be someone out there
how do we know we got them all
what the fuck are you guys talkin about
i dont hear shit
dale starts getting nervous but tries to hide it
the barn did collapse in a ball of fire and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke so
its just you know dale suddenly looks over his shoulder but sees nothing
a little paranoia
saul grabs dale
whispering are you guys fuckin with me
whispering what whispering whispering sshh
whispering what is whispering sshh
can you hear that
whispering oh fuck
im freakin out
whispering just listen
dale listens intently
whispering i literally only hear ringing
they stand in silence
fuck this noise
red pushes himself off dale and saul and run into the darkness
im following him
with the barns flaming remains the only light in sight dale and saul run off into the endless dark country side
and as enchanting music fills the air we humbly
