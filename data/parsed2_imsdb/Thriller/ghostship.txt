href b b ghost ship by mark hanlon first draft formerly chimera by mark hanlon first draft crewman epps wearing a life vest and tool belt jumps down into the
she stands in a great hollow cavern oily wet resonant with the sound of creaking rusty steel and water moving over its hull on the other side
epps comes to a low point in the darkness shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead
as the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull
epps pulls herself onto the deck from below
she stands on a rusting ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a foot tow cable
it is a typical summer day in the southern bering sea which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north west
she closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward
up ahead the tug pulls steadily grey black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents
epps cinches and checks her body harness focused and professional
the product of a rocky childhood in the pacific northwest and a few years of hard living shes found her true calling now
and under some grime several polypro shirts and a pair of orange mens insulite pants she might even be considered pretty
she clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow
she climbs onto the cable hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her
she pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end
dodge and greer look on from the stern where the boats name arctic warrior is emblazoned on the transom
dodge scruffy chief engineer wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers is an expatriate texan and former merchant marine
greer is the boats first mate african american originally from some sweltering red neck hellhole now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north
they watch as epps pulls herself toward them the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it
epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor
its a slow leak
she unclips and drops to the deck
maybe twenty gallons an hour
amidships starboard at the beam
just under the waterline
i dont think its a problem
hear that dodge
epps dont think its a problem
ill sleep good tonight knowing that
the view from the pilothouse commands degrees as radar and gps navigation displays glow
murphy the ships master pilots the boat
he is at sea all his adult life and most of the rest a fact written on his face and one that every crewman whos ever worked for him has
been willing to bet his life on
a walkie talkie crackles awake
greer to murphy
lifting the radio go
murphy turns back to see greer epps and dodge looking up at him from the stern
the number nine on the starboard sides half flooded
epps says its a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour
they mustve pumped it before we left sitka
of course they did
let the buyer beware
what do you say dodge
taking the radio if it started out at twenty an hour the piece of shitd be at the bottom of the gulf by now
whether itll make st
lawrence is anybodys guess
high and wide as the arctic warrior pulls the barge against the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky
the shores of st
lawrence island open into a small port town of mainly pre fab buildings as the arctic warrior approaches with the barge now pathetically listing to one side as it moves
into the harbor
a smaller harbor tug helps the arctic warrior jockey the listing barge to the dock as epps and dodge jump off to tie her up
greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the turbines
murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat russian man vasili and a mechanic in grease covered orange coveralls approach from the dock
i thought you say tuesday
better late than never
seeing the listing barge whats this
you got a leak in the number nine compartment
you got leak
you pump it out and re seam the hull shell be good as new
that cost me twenty grand at least
fifteen at the most
you knock off twenty and then we see
after my guy looks at it
in a prefab office with a view of the shipyard vasili cuts a check as murphy and greer look on
he tears it out of the book handing it across the desk to murphy who inspects it
youre kidding right
you want fair pay make hamburger for mickey d
otherwise please to sign
vasili pushes a transfer register toward him
greer and murphy walk back toward the dock
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia
hell sell the scrap for three times what he paid
i must be in the wrong business
you got that right
imitating vasili better than making hamburger for mickey d
a typical port town bar
except this one is on an island in the middle of the bering sea
epps lines up a shot at the pool table as a couple of seamen check out her ass and a tattoo of wiley coyote poking out of her pants
greer reads a paper near by
murphy enters crossing to the bar where dodge nurses a beer and a cigarette
murphy throws down an envelope with dodges name on it
dodge picks it up thumbs through a thick stack of hundreds
much obliged skipper
the place is a little more crowded now as epps pushes her way through to the bar a cigarette dangling from her mouth
she buys two beers and pays the bartender from her envelope of cash
she takes the beers back to the far wall where a young off duty coastguardsman stands
he takes one they laugh
beers cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them dodge greer and murphy look on at epps across the room who is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her
looks like epps gonna get some tonight
with that coxswain dickhead
you arent jealous are you dodge
are you kidding me
gimme a break
greer and murphy trade looks as dodge raises his beer
what a laugh
a minor commotion can be heard as they sit there
ill show you bitch
they look over to see the coastguardsmans girlfriend late s hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair
you want to mess with me ill kick your bitch ass girl
epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered around her and the girlfriend anxious to see a girl fight
i dont know what youre talking about
i just bought this guy a beer
this guy is my man honey
darlene you shut up
starting off listen i dont want any trouble okay
stopping epps uh uh
were gonna fix this right now
stepping up what seems to be the trouble ladies
whynt you mind your own business chief
murphy turns to see a shipyard riveter a big man holding a beer still wearing his welding leathers
murphy turns back to epps and the girlfriend
as i said what seems to be the trouble
didnt you hear me grandpa
or you got your hearing aid turned down
i heard you
but im choosing to ignore you
epps lets go
epps starts forward but the riveter stands in her way taking murphy by the collar
these ladies was having themselves a discussion and youre interrupting it
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me tarzan
murphy cant help but wince as a pool cue breaks in two over the riveters head
dodge cigarette in his mouth takes a look at the cue half he still holds shaking his head
the riveters hands fall from murphys collar and his legs buckle
some of his buddies hold him up as greer reminds some of the others hes holding a pool cue of his own
he looks to epps like lets get the hell out of here
she grabs her coat
epps holds there as the coastguardsman steps up to his girlfriend
he gives her the ring from his finger
murphy rolls his eyes as the others look on
i dont love you anymore
darlene breaks into tears as they all look on some pat her on the back
to epps come on candy
lets get out of here
the coastguardsman takes her by the hand
epps looks to murphy and the others as he leads her out
murphy greer and dodge ready the tug to leave as epps approaches on the dock
she jumps down onto the deck a spring in her step and a song in her heart
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps
showed him a hell of a lot more than that
i bet you did
its my pen name
murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from the dock as greer studies the dawn sky
red sky at night sailors delight
red sky in morning sailor take warning
as the tug turns into the harbor channel the sun rising under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange
dodge and epps play cards at the galley table
he puts down his hand
epps takes another drag from her cigarette collecting her winnings
she gathers the cards shuffles
what is your first name
it just occurred to me i dont know your first name
all this time and i dont know it
she deals the cards in silence
she looks on at him as he holds there takes his cards
dodge takes a drag from his cigarette thinking about it
she wants to laugh but only studies her cards
you think thats funny lying no
she takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand
the song sos by abba blasts as the tug plows westward through a steady chop and a mild swell
the music comes from here
greer has the cd player cranked as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse
he checks the radar holds there a beat
he turns the music down and picks up a walkie talkie
into walkie greer to murphy
greer studies the radar display as he waits
theres a large vessel out about ten miles to the north west
murphy sits at his desk over the ships log holding his radio
i been watching it for close to an hour and it hasnt moved
i cant raise it on the radio either
makes me think it might be in trouble
ill be right up
close on radar display as the sweep refresh reveals a bright point of light in the middle of nowhere
merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west five seven seven five north
murphy holds the radio mic as greer looks on epps and dodge standing back
this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen
to radio merchant vessel at one seven four one five west five seven seven five north this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
again only white noise comes back as the point flashes on the screen
too deep to anchor out there
looks like its adrift
could be a fishing boat
more like a freighter
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here
its way out of the lanes
theres not a port for miles
a beat as murphy holds there
he raises the radio mic
merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west five seven seven five north this is tugboat arctic warrior
do you copy
again only the quiet hiss of static comes back
call the coastguard
steer to one eight five
lets check her out
the arctic warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water
close on radar display as the phantom point flashes closer
murphy looks on as greer pilots dodge and epps watching
back it off
greer throttles back and the boat slows
hit the lights
the halogen flood lights flare to life brilliantly illuminating the water in front of the boat
the four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the light
murphy reaches for the spot control sweeping a broad beam of light with a joy stick
as the tug moves along servo motors sweep the searchlight over the bow of the boat and into the darkness
they peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves when a shadow looms into view
greer throttles down all the way and they drift as the shadow looms bigger before them in the light from the boat
as they approach the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow rising up from the water disappearing in the darkness above them
murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of what appears to be a large darkened ship
as they come around the name chimera can be seen above the anchor alleys
murphy reaches for the mic hits the loud hailer
the tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the chimera rising above it
this is civilian tugboat arctic warrior
is there anyone aboard
the quiet rumble of the tugs turbines is the only sound
murphy raises the mic again
chimera i am hove to at your port bow
is there anyone aboard
they wait looking on at the silent darkened ship under the glare of their lights
epps come with me
you guys sit tight
epps and murphy in heavy parkas climb a hydraulic deck crane up to the chimera as dodge mans the controls against the movement of the water
greer holds the tug steady as epps and murphy can be seen making their way up under the floodlights
murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck
epps jumps down behind him
murphy throws his light up on the superstructure
all remnants of paint have been rusted over lending a still darker ominousness to it
murphy and epps move cautiously along shining their lights as they go
despite the omnipresent corrosion everything seems to be in order
the decks are clear and there is no apparent damage
they come to a hatchway
epps shines her light down the darkened passage
murphy moves in
murphy and epps move down the passageway
even the walls in here are rusted
they come to a flight of stairs
greer and dodge wait
greer reaches for his radio
into radio talk to me skipper
after a moment murphy comes back on the radio
were in a stairwell just under the main superstructure
murphy and epps climb the darkened stairway
this is definitely an old boat maybe sixty years old
she hasnt been in service for at least twenty years
probably a lot longer
they top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which takes them into an open area
their lights shine around them revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen equipment a few pots still hanging
they move through the galley and into another narrower passageway
greer and dodge look on
besides a little rust everythings pretty well preserved
greer and dodge look at each other
how she got out here is one hell of a good question
a long beat then jesus
dodge and greer hold there waiting
only silence from the other end
what is it
another beat in silence
what is it
murphy and epps stand at the top of a stairway looking over an immense ballroom
murphy raises his radio
its a passenger ship
its a damn passenger ship
though it is dark there is enough light to see its ornate opulence tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor and orchestra well and a magnificent crystal
chandelier hanging over it all
epps and murphy climb down the deck crane as greer and dodge meet them at the bottom
jumping down theres nobody on that boat
dodge epps greer and murphy sit around the galley table
probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current
what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now
somebodys probably looking for her as we speak
whatever the reason shes adrift and abandoned
weve got every right to salvage her
you mean tow her back
thats a thirty thousand ton ship youre talking about
weve done it before
yeah from one side of the harbor to the other
but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage
the fittings alone could go for a few million
if you get it back in one piece
its a risk im willing to take
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it
so we cut her loose and wait it out
a little weather couldnt be anything she hasnt seen before
its a bloody navigation hazard
one boat cant control a ship that size
the damn things been floating around for god knows how long and it hasnt hit anything yet
so we take it easy
a little of the old push pull
a long beat as they hold there
forget this jobs just a pay check for a minute
you know ive been good to you
but im prepared to offer you something better now
a beat if we do this right its worth a lot of money
a lot of money
they hold there looking on at him waiting
salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks
who knows could be more
could be a lot more
a beat what im proposing is
we split it four ways
dodge looks to epps and greer
think about it
a million bucks a piece
a beat you want to spend the rest of your days drag assing tank barges on the gulf coast fine
otherwise lets get to work
the tug is tied up alongside the chimera whose dark hull stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of day
murphy brings up the radio mic as greer and the others look on
to radio united states coastguard united states coastguard united states coastguard
this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
after a moment a distance warped coolly professional female voice comes back
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior
this is united states coastguard station north island
north island i wish to declare myself salvor in posession under section four two charlie of the international maritime convention
affirmative arctic warrior
what type of vessel

murphy looks to the others almost smiling
a passenger liner north island
what is the vessel name registry and present position
passenger vessel chimera
i will spell charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha
no registry information is available at this time
i have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west five seven north at

affirmative arctic warrior
please advise your salvage authority pending registry check
roger north island
arctic warrior over and out
dodge epps murphy and greer are standing on the stern of the boat under the power winch
were gonna use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows
a beat well tie off through the anchor alleys
and come down to the aft port and starboard pins
thus we need to get two of these
indicating the cable up there
he indicates the bow of the chimera
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it aint gonna be what youd call easy
a beat any questions
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow
then well all be doomed
any other questions
murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the chimera
greer operates the deck crane one of dodges mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern
epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the chimera
dodge pokes his face out from the other side
bring it on dude
dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable which epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable
she places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down with the effect of joining the two cables
dodge disappears pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys
finally hit it
epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow cable explosively drops banging loudly against the chimeras hull with a shower of black rust
dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck the pilot cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor alley
it is heavy and the winch shows the strain as dodge cranks it
he continues when something gives in the winch mechanism and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable entangling dodges leg and dragging him on his ass along the
the tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills out of the anchor alley before epps
dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat toward a sausage grinder when the winch slams into it and stops dead the cable continuing on with a
loud shriek dangerously close to his face until
the last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor alley in front of epps and splashes in the water below
a beat as she holds there
dodge lies tangled in the winch
two tow cables extend from the chimeras anchor alleys down into the water and come up again from the water to the tow anchor on the tugs stern
dodge looks on as greer and epps stand by
he raises his walkie
alright skipper real easy
murphy slowly throttles up moving the boat forward
he turns to see as the chimera drops back behind them
the tug moves slowly away from the chimera as epps greer and dodge look on
as the tug widens the distance leaving the chimera in place
murphy holds the helm steady as the chimera recedes
steady as she goes
dodge epps and greer look on as the tow cables begin to rise in their wake
into radio throttle back
the tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water
the tug slows still more
it slows still more until the tug just creeps along and the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water straightening as the slack is pulled out
some fifty yards behind the tug the tow cables come taught in the anchor alleys of the chimera
murphy holds the throttle
right there skipper
murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise in pitch
as the tow cables stretch and the bow of the chimera inches forward
the turbines grow louder as greer epps and dodge look on at the chimera behind them the massive tow cables bowing under their own weight
murphy eases forward on the throttle picking up speed
the giant ship creaks and moans as it starts forward a small bow break forming on its hull
the tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the chimera along behind it
dodge lets out a hoot exchanging high fives with epps and greer
murphy smiles as he looks back at the chimera following behind
close on a chart
the south bering sea and the gulf of alaska
a pencil traces a route
i figure we go through at the unimak pass here
refuel at sanak island
greer looks on from the helm as murphy dodge and epps stand over the map table
with a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make sitka in five days without another stop
hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away
i dont care what aint nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size
the laws on our side
if they want to challenge it let them try
they mustve scuttled it
nobody just lets a ship float away
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either
ever heard of insurance big boy
either way we found it
its ours now
an explosive thud shudders the boat
they look to each other
moving for the door what the
dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another loud thump shouting up to the pilothouse greer shoves the throttle back
the boat goes dead in the water thick black smoke billowing from the turbine vents
as the bow slows in the water the tow cables coming slack
dodge pulls open the door
the place is thick with smoke as he makes his way to the turbine gauges epps and murphy behind
dodge opens the number one turbine cover looks inside
what is it
threw a turbine blade
dodge looks over the smoking turbine pulls back an aluminum intake blade hot to the touch
son of a bitch
greer dodge epps and murphy confer on the deck
the number one turbines pretty well trashed
number two runs but its way underpowered
how long to fix
hard to say
i gotta get in there and have a look
at least a couple days
you think the extra strain caused it
everything was cool
its just one of those things
the arctic warrior floats tied to the side of the chimera
dodge has both turbines opened up as he works
lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade
murphy and greer stand looking on at it
some classy tub in its day huh
check this out
epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter as greer and murphy approach
everythings still here
ticket records receipts books of account
greer picks one up
one first class passage
dubayy to halifax
murphy takes it looking it over
flag ship of the dobbins kirk line
murphy epps and greer top a staircase out onto a long darkened corridor
they move down
some of the doors are open faint light from port holes showing small cabins with beds desks a few chairs
murphy epps and greer come to a hatchway marked bridge
the forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before them and the rusting foredeck about feet below
light from the windows illuminates the bridge as murphy greer and epps look around
despite a little corrosion and a layer of dirt everything seems in its place
looking through scattered charts and papers id sure like to get my hands on the general log
epps steps up to the wall where several framed photos hang
that must be the old man right there
the uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt stern looking man from another century with dark hollow eyes
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass
hed let you off at the nearest port thats for sure
a dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug floats under the bow of the chimera
dodge works up to his elbows in turbine as greer monitors a pressure gauge
how about now
thats what it says
geting up to have a look lemme see
through the pilothouse windows the hull of the chimera disappears into the darkness beyond the tugs work lights
murphy sits at the chart table as epps steps in
sitting up yeah
she brings him his cup seeing the documents he brought back from the chimera
taking a seat whatd you find up there
a crew manifest
looking them over looks like her last voyage was january
the question is where the hells she been since
she was sailing up north right
her destination was halifax yeah
well suppose she got a little further north than she should have
got stuck in the ice
the passengers and crew evacuated
she froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid
they write it off
fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens
the ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her
murphy nods considering it
as reasonable an explanation as any i guess
epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it
ever heard of the mary celeste
she was a two masted brig boat sailing out of new york in
one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel the dei gratia
as the crew of the dei gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste
on boarding they found her completely deserted
the captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone
the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble
the table was even set for dinner
and in the nine days after the last entry she sailed miles without anyone aboard
so what did happen
thereve been a lot of theories of course
but well never really know for sure
you think shes sailing without a crew
murphy looks out at the chimera off the bow
i think wed be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current
youre more practical than superstitious
only way to be
epps nods takes another sip of coffee looking on at the rusting hull of the chimera stretching off in the light
greer operates the crane arm as dodge directs him
the crane hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck
dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily
turbine rotors shot
i thought you said it was just a blade
gotta replace the whole deal
how much longers that gonna take
like i always say i know i know two ways to do anything the right way and the wrong way
but how long
hard to say
we gotta get outa here dodge
a storm blows up and were history
im telling you you dont want to be running that fan like it is
what about running number two by itself
its a full horses down
we couldnt drag that boat down hill on ice with it
how long then
i gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor
three four days
what do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened
cant do it skipper
a beat as murphy stands there knowing hes right
from the pilothouse arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior
this is united states coastguard
murphy enters the pilothouse as the distance warped voice comes back on the radio
arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior
this is united states coastguard station north island
murphy raises the radio mic as epps dodge and greer step in
to radio north island north island north island
this is tugboat arctic warrior
after a moment the same professional distance warped voice comes back
arctic warrior we have submitted your section four two charlie salvage notification
however the international maritime authority record for a passenger vessel chimera indicates it was lost at sea in the gulf of oman day two month two year one nine five
a beat as murphy holds there
north island please repeat
arctic warrior passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three
another beat as murphy holds there as the others look on
north island have you got any additional information
affirmative arctic warrior
the vessel chimera was registered to the dobbins kirk line halifax
date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two
a long beat as the static of the open channel comes back
roger north island
i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera
and she is afloat
repeat she is afloat
roger arctic warrior
i say again our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea
roger north island
please advise pending further information
affirmative arctic warrior
this is united states coast guard north island station
over and out
a beat as they hold there thinking about it
obviously its some kind of screw up
the shipping records arent a hundred percent accurate
man it gives me the creeps
we got no business towing a ship that size anyway
i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway
are you crazy
do you realize we got ourselves a ship
we own a ship dodge
yeah a ship thats supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago
you dont think thats just a little freaky
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot
yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong
thats a damn big boat
its either sunk or it aint
we all want to get outa here dodge
with that boat in tow
you got three days
make the most of it
a beat as dodge looks back then out at the chimera
a pencil point on a map follows across saudi arabia coming to the persian gulf and tracing the coast of the arab emirates to dubayy
murphy sits at his desk over the map
his pencil point follows the persian gulf from dubayy through the straight of hormuz into the gulf of oman
murphy marks an x there
a beat as he looks on at it
he opens a large envelope he found aboard the chimera
he empties it on the desk
he looks through it docking receipts from various ports of call bills of lading etc
he looks over the passenger manifest
he lies on his bunk having fallen asleep last night in his clothes still holding the envelope and some of the papers inside
dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as greer reads in the shade of the deck house
dodges hand slips and he skins his knuckles
take it easy dodge
its only a piece of metal
inspecting his skinned knuckles damn mind of its own
seeing murphy morning skipper
murphy has stepped out into the sunlight
youre up late
guess i mustve fallen back to sleep
she take a radio
epps steps from a passageway into a large public room
tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly light falling in from windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang
she walks on
a pair of empty glasses sit on a table an empty sherry decanter beside them
an ashtray sits beside that
epps stops reaching down
she pulls back a half smoked cigarette lipstick smudging the end yellowing and fragile from time
and as she stands there we see a figure in murky silhouette move past the doorway in the background
in an instant it is there and gone
she puts down the cigarette having sensed a presence
she turns to the doorway across the room but there is nothing to be seen now
a dolls white face eyes haunting and coldly blue stares into the middle distance
it lies on a love seat as epps steps up
she lifts it
several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it when the sound of a ticking clock a beat as epps holds there
she turns trying to locate the sound
from across the room epps stands listening
as the ticking clock sounds from here
she turns putting down the doll holding a beat
she approaches crossing the room coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock
all but its minute hand has fallen off its corroded face but from inside it emits a weak though steady ticking
epps stands there as the clock ticks looking on when the ticking ceases
a beat as she holds there as the clock faces her now silent
epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door where daylight falls from a small port
she looks through it
epps stands in a white tiled room
light falls from port holes high in the wall
running its length is a small swimming pool its rusted fixtures and stained surface creating bizarre patterns
epps comes to a row of changing stalls
old clothing hangs there unused for fifty years
a pair of womans shoes lie on the floor
epps moves along passing through a doorway into epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment circa a wooden rowing machine barbells and a medicine ball
she steps up to the wall where pictures hang
the chimera can be seen in better days sailing full speed on a calm sea
epps jumps down to a lower deck
she shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment showing a massive diesel burner
she passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ships power plant rise up to the ceiling
epps moves passing still more diesel burners towering over her in the cavernous space
she moves into a narrowing passage piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship
finally the passage opens into yet another compartment apparently a cargo hold
crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes
in the corner a rotting canvas drape covers something
epps comes to it
she lifts the canvas which crumbles away to reveal a ferrari sportster
for the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion it is perfectly preserved
mail bags lie in piles along the wall stacked between more wooden crates and palettes when something catches epps eye
a heavy metal door in the wall is twisted on its hinges as though blown back from some terrific explosive force
epps approaches coming to the twisted door
she shines her light inside
a clutter of debris shelving and wood are visible in the shadows when her light catches a glint of something
she swings her light back revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats
epps steps in
she kneels shining the light closer
the yellow glint is metal
epps pulls back a slat sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold
she reaches out
she raises it completely untouched by the years
she pulls back still more debris revealing a stack of gold ingots some having tumbled to the side
she slides away a large trunk that has fallen pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger perhaps four feet high and five feet across
a beat as epps stands there looking on at in gold
the debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean x x stack of gold ingots
what the fuck we gonna do with it
greer murphy epps and dodge all look on
what the fuck you think we gonna do with it
its ours baby
its all ours
murphy has stepped forward taking an ingot inspecting it
how much you figure thats worth skipper
still looking it over hard to say
maybe forty fifty million
thats a lot of money for somebody to just let float away
murphy looks up at her from the gold
yes it is
a beat as they all hold there
its a hell of a lot of money
what you think theres something funny about it
a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift
and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it
if they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off
not for fifty million
an ocean liner maybe
but fifty million in gold they come looking for
maybe they didnt want it back
maybe the whole fat deal was insured
but theres always somebody whose interests at stake
all i gotta say is it looks like that somebodys us right now
greer cackles as he high fives dodge
and it looks like somebody got here before us too
the steel hatch is twisted as from a great hand ripping it back from the wall
inspecting it didnt happen yesterday ill tell you that
torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat
then it happened before they scuttled her
you mean before she sank
cargo like this could make a crew think twice
that it could
a beat as they all look on at the gold
after dinner murphy greer dodge and epps sit around the galley table
then why didnt they take it
probably didnt have time
or somebody stopped them
either way they mustve had a pretty good reason
must be a damn good reason to jump ship and leave fifty million dollars aboard
a beat as they consider it
so whatre we gonna do
thats the big question right
a salvage claim to a vessels cargos as valid as a claim to the vessel itself
then were rich
were damn filthy stinking rich
it looks like it
a beat as they let this sink in
we gonna unload the gold and get a move on
we leave it where it is
stick to the plan
you gotta be kidding
what the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks
so we get a little more for the boat
besides the goldll be safer where it is
yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka
its worth the effort
besides were gonna need her to prove the salvage
why not call for help
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this
last thing we want is extra partners
or uninvited guests
i heard that
dodge you gotta get on those repairs
im on it
the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending whats ours
dodge wearing a welding mask and gloves braises an aluminum fitting over one of the open turbines
epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space beyond the twisted hatch
two hundred twenty
two twenty one
as epps stacks the last one two twenty two
greer makes a note
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold
thats what i call a payday
they slap hands
murphy moves down the darkened passage coming to a door marked captain
the door is ajar
he pushes it open
murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in dark wood
a large desk occupies a corner of the room by the windows
though dirty and worn with time everything is ordered and in its place
murphy comes to the desk
he sits down in the chair behind it
the surface is clear and uncluttered
he pulls out the drawer to reveal pens writing paper a ruler compass and protractor amidst other sundry items
murphy steps in
the room is undisturbed light falling in on the taught green bedspread through dirty tattered curtains
a robe hangs on the back of a chair
a pair of slippers lie beneath it
murphy stands in the bathroom
the tile has yellowed with time but everything is exactly as it was left
even the shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as murphy looks on at it
he looks up seeing himself in the mirror when an murphy comes to the railing looking out over the bow of the ship to see black smoke rising from where
the arctic warrior is tied
greer and epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising from the arctic warrior as murphy climbs down the crane to the deck
murphy jumps down to the deck
flames belch from an open hatch as murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker coming to the engine room door
murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke
he finds dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own
the flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well the heat searing paint on the metal covers
murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims but only for a moment
dodge grabs another extinguisher his leg burned face and hands singed
an explosion rocks the boat and molten flames hurl through the air catching murphys pant leg
hes so engrossed in fighting the flames he doesnt realize hes on fire
over the roar murphy
murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire as dodge turns a cloud of halon on him putting it out
propane tanksre gonna go
murphy crosses in the smoke coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames
he turns the extinguisher into them holding it there
the flames dim as dodge joins him on the other side turning his extinguisher on it too
the fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up
fire belches from a duct crawling across the ceiling
dodge fires his extinguisher at it pushing it back across to the wall again
murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck and finally out
they stand there in the sudden silence the air heavy with smoke
a fine layer of halon powder lies over everything but the fire is out
dodge smokes a cigarette now starting to feel his burned leg which is oozing as murphy and greer look on
one minute im minding my own business the next thing i know the whole place is burning up
taking a drag an oxygen tank mustve blown on the welder
started an oil fire
looks like it took out the backup genny too
epps arrives with a first aid kit
hows that leg
epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn
seen better ow
epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide
thiss gonna hurt a little
thanks for the warning ow
epps keeps cleaning as dodge bears it
we could call for help
and get a bunch of fools sniffin around here
what other choices have we got
i tell you one thing were not gonna be towing no ship now
a gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating murphy as he holds the radio mic
to radio united states coastguard this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
a moment then arctic warrior arctic warrior arctic warrior
this is united states coastguard station north island
your radio check is affirmative
roger that north island
arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
over and out
dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and takes it to the table where epps greer and murphy sit under the stark light of a
fifty million four ways
thats twelve million and change a piece
what you gonna do with your share skipper
not much at all i guess
live out my golden years and all that
im buyin me a nice outrigger
spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget
how about you epps
guess ill just keep working
whatre you crazy
i like my job
moving to sweden
whats so great about sweden
its a beautiful country
thats a good thing
i like it cold
colder the better
yeah but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about
well see whos dreamin mman
dreamins all any of youre gonna be doing if we dont get this boat running
what the hell is that
the shrieking continues echoing eerily as if from the sea
dodge epps murphy and greer emerge on deck
the distant shrieking is louder here but seems to be emanating from deep in the ship as they stand facing it on the bow
its coming from inside
they hold there listening as the shrieking continues
sounds like the hull
warm water current maybe making the metal expand
that shit is seriously bizarre
the distant shrieking echo continues as they hold there
the engine room is black with soot the turbines covered in halon powder
dodge stands there looking at it
greer goes through shelves of supplies finding a stack of sterno cans and warming candles
he throws them into a wooden crate of other supplies hes gathered
epps slowly pushes open the door
she holds a sack with a few items shes managed to scavenge
light falls from curtained windows onto the room
a divan sits against the wall
a table stands in the middle of the room a moth eaten velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top
two twin beds stand on either side
they are covered in dust and are moth eaten unmade as if the occupants had just gotten up fifty years ago
in one corner is an armoire
epps steps up to it pulling back the door to reveal a rack of womans clothing hanging there undisturbed
a pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair over which is draped a womans robe
epps lifts it the material crumbling in her hands
a drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects a mans billfold cuff links tarnished silver cigarette holder and case coins black horn rimmed glasses pocket watch and
fob and a room key
epps pulls back the billfold
she opens it
inside she finds a canadian passport a picture of a dark haired man with a mustache and black horn rimmed glasses circa
in the folds she finds three hundred canadian dollars
an insert holds pictures of a suburban home children and a woman presumably his wife
epps steps from the room
she turns to close the door but stops holding there strongly sensing something
the camera slowly comes around to her other side revealing the long passageway behind her each bulkhead hatchway creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame one another
and standing at the very end of this tunnel in the foggy light from a porthole a man in dark clothing
epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her
a beat as they hold there
the man only stares back at her then turns to walk away
epps moves off as the man walks around the corner
hey wait a minute
moving with epps as she breaks into a run going down the passageway
she comes to the corner rounding it out onto another passageway
the man is nowhere to be seen
epps moves quickly down the passageway coming to the next corner rounding it out to see only another long passageway
she turns back running right into murphy
take it easy youll live longer
did you see him
he just came this way
theres somebody else on this boat
what the hellre you talking about
i saw him
just a minute ago
are you sure
of course im sure
i saw him
you sure it wasnt me
it wasnt you
it was somebody else
theres somebody else aboard
a beat as murphy looks back at her
greer dodge murphy and epps stand around by lantern light
light in those passages aint so good
im telling you i saw somebody
i dont know who it was
but i saw somebody
whatd he look like
maybe six feet
i didnt get a good look
he was far away
but i saw him
i saw him as sure as youre standing there
wheres his boat then
wheres his crew
he aint gonna be out here by himself thats for damn sure
shes so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and wed never know it
maybe that is his boat
gimme a break
a beat as they sit in silence
if somebodys aboard her already she aint ours
that boat hasnt made steam for fifty years
we found her
not in the eyes of the law
so we find this guy and make a deal with him
we dont exactly have the best bargaining position
i say fuck the motherfucker
were a professional salvage crew going about our business
whats some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway
and what do you propose
that we knock this guy off
why the fuck not
a beat as murphy greer and epps exchange looks
fifty million dollars
we gonna let this guy just take it from us
so we kill him
im saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest
i dont know
lets just take it easy here alright
nobodys gonna kill anybody
supposing he wants to get bad with us
one guy isnt gonna be so stupid
maybe he isnt alone
they consider this a moment
i say we off load some of that gold now
would you hold on just a minute here please
look theres no reason to panic now
epps saw somebody
its a big boat
chancesre real good he doesnt even know about the gold
if we stay cool nobodyll be the wiser
a beat the gold stays where it is til were ready to go
like i said itll be a hell of a lot safer there than here
what if that fucker finds it before were ready to go
well stand a watch
four on eight off
low man first
guess thatd be me
dodge get on that turbine
i dont care if you dont sleep for a week
the sooner youre done the sooner we can get out of here
hows the food situation
pretty low all around
well have to take it easy then
i dont think well find much aboard the ship but its probably worth looking around
say we run into this guy again
a beat as they consider this
if hes reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal
well have to re consider our options
yeah reconsider fucking his shit up
epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a locker revealing a flare gun and a shotgun
epps pulls back the shotgun and a box of shells
murphy and dodge look on as epps loads the last of several shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel gauge
she expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand
dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as greer crosses from the deck house
pretty handy with that scatter gun epps
you raised on a farm
setting the safety seen a lota movies
no cowboy shit up there understand
no cowboy shit
greer extends a thermos to epps
pocketing it in her coat youre a pal
she checks the squelch on her radio pockets it too
got your light
her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings the shotgun on her back
see you boys later
to greer dont be late i need my beauty rest
she looks up climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened ship above them
a flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as epps approaches
if this place is creepy in the daylight it is terrifying now
she comes to a ladder and climbs down
epps shines her light as she passes through coming to the cargo hold
she crosses in the darkness her light catching the tarnished glint of the gold
she comes up to it stopping there looking on at it a perfectly symmetrical fortune
she looks around for a place to sit
she drags a palette to the bulkhead settling in to face the rest of the compartment
she puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos to pour herself a cup of coffee
epps has dozed off when a clattering echoes distantly somewhere in the ship
it is silent as she holds there not sure she heard anything when a distant booming sounds
she reaches out for the shotgun intently listening
as epps holds there another deep booming sounds distantly somewhere
epps turns her blood running cold
epps moves along in the darkness when the distant booming can be heard briefly again
she stops holding there in the silence
epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ships massive propeller shaft hangs suspended above her
epps moves along
finally she comes out into
where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine
she continues on past huge rusting diesel burners disappearing into the darkness above her when another boom sounds
she turns shinning her light back from where she came
not a sound but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest
another boom sounds again echoing distantly in the silence
she shines her light through the line of burners
epps moves quietly between the burners
she comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead
she steps through finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks
the booming sounds again closer as suddenly stopping
she moves on cautiously walking between the tanks holding her light out before her
she comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead
the booming sounds still closer
she turns the light into the recesses showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums
she approaches holding the shotgun up
as she nears the booming sounds again
it is coming from here
she tenses raising the shotgun holding the light as steady as she can manage
the booming sounds yet again
it is metallic and staccato
she stops in the corner beside an oil drum
several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair
she shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and
an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside
the booming sounds again this time coming from the pile of oil drums
she steps closer raising the shotgun ready to fire
a beat as she summons her courage then reaches out to push a drum with her foot when a blur explodes out at her
she fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she
looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom
murphy to epps
she settles back exhausted
murphy to epps
taking her radio epps
you just shoot at something
just a bird
just a stupid bird
she wipes her brow on her sleeve holding there a moment when she smells something really awful
she steps forward following the smell pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight
she steps still closer training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso
a large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds
she hesitates then steps still closer when she steps on something
she starts then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the bodys decaying head looks back with wide unseeing eyes
it takes everything she has just to hold there
she shines her light back to the headless torso
she shines her light beyond that and up to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck stained with dried blood a pair of legs dangling from the
pipe when just behind her a booted foot comes into frame lightly touching her
she spins around to see another body above her
except this one hangs in one piece suspended from another bent steam pipe
it has been impaled length wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth
one of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it
a few feet away a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe
a lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various rotting parts
ho ly shit
couldnt have happened much more than a month ago
greer dodge and epps look on as murphy kneels over the remains of the headless torso
bodiesre too fresh
fresh aint the first word that comes to mind
murphy checks the pockets finding a wallet
he looks through it
standing obviously we arent the first to come across this ship
they probably stumbled across it just like we did
and look what happened
damn barbaric is what it is
could be meant as a warning
because of the gold
thatd be my guess
so whoever did this might still be around
maybe eppss mystery man had something to do with it
a beat as they consider the implications of this
we report this
call the coastguard
another beat as they hold there
lets not be too hasty
hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later
we call this in now gonna be coastguard fbi who knows who all over the place
a beat as nobodys too sure about this
dodge if this isnt incentive enough to fix that boat i dont know what is
dodge fires up a compressor which feebly comes to life turning over the turbine then sputtering out in a cloud of smoke
all the seals and gasketsre shot
anything that was rubber burned up
murphy stands at the doorway looking on
cant you use something else
i might be able to find something on the ship
but its gonna take time
do what you need to do
just do it fast
epps sleeps in her bunk
dodge and greer climb down in the darkness
i need lag bolts especially one inch standard
and sheet metal
preferably steel about a sixteenth of an inch
aluminium even tinll do
i aint no mechanic just so you know
you find anything that even looks like a compressor
i dont care what grab it
murphy stands in the cramped room full of radios and communications equipment
he looks through the shelves and cabinets when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book
he pulls it back opening it to see that it is a radio call log
he takes a seat paging through it
greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism
he has difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench when he slips
a beat as he inspects his hand
in the silence a distant shriek sounds maybe metal against metal or maybe human somewhere in the ship
he holds there listening
he moves on shinning his light as he goes
greer moves along in the darkness when he hears the shrieking again coming from somewhere in the ship
greer walks up a stairway stepping into a darkened passageway
the shrieking sounds this time closer as it echoes through the ship
he stops holding there to listen
greer comes out onto another deck stopping there
he looks down the passageway a beat then moves on
he passes through a hatchway in a bulkhead when a music box can be distantly heard
the song is daisy daisy daisy give me your answer do
im half crazy oh for the love of you
he holds there listening intently
a door stands open at the other end of the passage
the music comes from here
he moves forward walking toward the end of the passage and the light falling from the open door
murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log book
on the page his finger runs down the columns of entries coming to transmission feb hrs gmt
engine trouble notification made to passing vessel st
his finger moves down to the next entry coming to transmission feb hrs gmt
dead in water
notification made to passing vessel normandy
his finger continues transmission feb hrs gmt
captain relieved of command
notification made to passing vessel china sea
captain relieved of command
he holds there a moment moving his finger down to the final entry reading transmission feb hrs gmt
general he turns the page to see only the words god save us scrawled in faded red ink
a beat as he holds there when a channel opens with a short burst on murphys radio
he looks to it but there is no response from the other end
another short burst and the channel opens again
this time it remains open but no one says anything on the other end until the channel murphy takes the radio
this is murphy
anybody trying to call me
he waits as no response comes then the channel opens again
only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there but is not saying anything
murphy presses the talk button
again there is no response until the channel opens
murphy holds there as he is answered by silence when a gravelly cock a doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
murphy is momentarily stunned
he hits the talk button
who is this
the radio channel opens
only silence comes back as if someone were there but not speaking
who is this
the camera pushes in as murphy listens
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
the channel closes as the camera stops close on murphy
murphy squeezes the talk button
only silence comes back from the radio when a mans blood curdling scream sounds from somewhere in the ship
murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio sounds
dodge to murphy
taking radio murphy
you better get down here quick skipper
im on c deck
what is it
i think you better see this for yourself
murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw greer in earlier
at the end the light from the cabin falls from the open door as he approaches
as murphy comes to the door to see dodge standing in the middle of the cabin
i found him like this
greer is lying supine on the floor
his legs are rigid and his trunk is extended
his arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away fingers splayed wrists quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other
murphy kneels beside him
greers eyelids are half closed his eyes rolled up into his head
his jaw is clenched face contorted in a bizarre grimace
and he speaks uttering nonsense words in harsh expulsions as though speaking in tongues
as a light shines in it the pupil is fixed and dilated
hard to say
greer lies unconscious on a bunk now quiet no longer seizing as epps shines a flashlight into his eye dodge and murphy looking on
she turns it off standing upright
im no doctor
but id say hes in a coma
i dont know what else youd call it
hes breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out
hes totally unresponsive to pain
a beat what happened up there
i heard a scream
when i got there i found him on the floor
he was having some kind of seizure
i didnt see anybody else
he mustve seen something
a beat as they consider this
other than the obvious theres nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside
then what the hell happened to him
another beat as they hold there
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio
i dont know
another long beat as they think about this
it was a mans voice
repeating some sort of childrens rhyme
i dont know it didnt make any sense
you didnt hear it
another beat as this sinks in
looking to greer he needs a doctor
ill call us in
dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up
to epps meaning dodge keep an eye on him
a gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating murphy as he holds the radio mic
to radio united states coastguard united states coastguard united states coastguard
this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
to radio united states coastguard united states coastguard united states coastguard
this is tugboat arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
again no response
he holds there then finally to radio mayday
to any vessel
this is arctic warrior
whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two
last known position one seven four west five seven north
i am afloat and drifting
require immediate medical assistance for one person possibly comatose
i am a one hundred twenty foot civilian tug hove to at port bow of disabled passenger liner chimera
i repeat chimera
only the desolate white noise of empty air comes back
greer lies unconscious as epps looks on at him
the door comes open and murphy steps in
hows he doing
ill try again later
a beat as they look on at greer
murphy and epps sit at the galley table
epps reads the log book murphy found in the radio room
reading it theyre dead in the water that morning
four hours later the captains relieved of his command
and that evening they issue a general possibly false
hence the ima record of being lost at sea
i dont think mutinys out of the question here
taking a seat on a passenger ship in
if they knew what they were carrying
youre saying they mutinied for the gold
if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats
only something mustve gone wrong
yeah way wrong
a beat as they consider it
i got a question
just from a you know purely technical standpoint
we call the coastguard
coastguard shows up
what exactly is the plan
how do you mean
well theyre gonna be asking a lot of questions
about those bodies
about the gold
seems like we oughta be prepared is all
i guess the best strategys just to tell them the truth
the truth is one thing
when theres more than a few hundred million dollars involved thats a whole new deal
what do you propose
for starters getting that gold off the ship
what they dont know about isnt gonna bother them
a beat as murphy holds there
theres no way were gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here
besides itll be safer where it is
with all due respect skipper
a beat part of that up theres mine
id kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it
a beat as murphy looks on
tell you what dodge
once we get back to shore you can do whatever you want with your share
but until then the gold stays right where it is
dodge holds there
he looks to epps a beat takes a drink of coffee
the sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the arctic warrior drifts alongside the chimera
murphy crosses to the deck house climbs the stairs
murphy opens the door stopping dead in his tracks
he steps forward crossing to the corner
the radio set lies before him dented in and completely demolished as if someone had taken a bat to it
dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from behind and shoved into the wall
murphy holds him fast
just what the hell do you think youre doing
i dont know what youre talking about
i think you know
maybe you can tell me then
murphy shoves him hard into the wall
not having a clue the radio
oh yeah the radio
murphy tightens his grip
take it easy willya
what about the radio
you smashed it
dont lie to me
what the fuck
you didnt want us calling anybody
too liable to ruin your big payday
i didnt touch the fucking radio
murphy tightens his grip still more
i didnt touch the fucking radio
a beat ever occur to you theres somebody else on that boat skipper
conveniently enough for you
look i didnt touch it
murphy holds there a beat longer
he shoves dodge back letting him go
dodge checks his throat as murphy looks on
they turn to see epps in the hatchway
greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a jug of water as murphy and the others step in
he turns to see them
never been more thirsty in my life
drink up then
greer smiles raising the jug to drink as the others take a seat looking on at him
howre you feeling
lost my sea legs
headache nausea lights
sudden flashes of light
i feel fine
what day is it
i dont know
a beat as they all hold there
greer takes a seat
you dont remember
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera
down somewhere in there scavenging around
youve been out for about a day
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins
greer only holds there
we heard you scream
any idea what you mightve seen
i wish i could tell you
id be real interested to know myself
another beat as they hold there as greer takes another drink of water
the radios out
somebody took it out of commission last night
a beat as they all hold there
smashed it up pretty bad
the skipper seems to think i did it
that im more interested in that gold than my own safety or the safety of my fellow shipmates
a beat as they hold there as murphy looks back
you think im crazy
another beat as they hold there
regardless of how it happened there isnt much of a chance to fix it
the odds of another vessel in range of the walkie talkies are almost astronomical
so as of today were pretty much on our own out here
epps and murphy carrying the shotgun make their way in the ship
greer stops before a mirror to see himself
he finds an aspirin bottle goes to open it
and as he does so he sees that his hand is shaking uncontrollably
dodge works over the turbine
he stops holding there
he looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses
he begins pulling out the hoses and wires grabbing at them yanking them loose breaking them off
the chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty assortment of tubes and condensers
murphy looks on at it
a tattered bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten corner
epps picks it up
the cover has been ripped off and the pages are torn
but as she looks through it she sees that it is the ships log
murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the very end
the last pages have been ripped out
looks like part of the general log
epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out
the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill
the same day she supposedly went down
must notve been the captains entry
he was probably out of the picture by then
epps continues to read
their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision
distress calls have been made
the pages missing
then their sos was real
but wheres the damage
maybe the other ship took the worst of it
if it was a ship she hit
a beat as they hold there when his radio crackles to life
dodge to murphy
murphy reaches down for his radio
to radio yeah
you better get down here right now
were taking water
murphy and epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is starting to list to one side
he crosses to the deck house and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly filling with seawater as greer and dodge scramble to set a pump
hose over the din of the pumps
what the hell happened
turbine chamber on number two mustve blown
took out part of the hull
were not gonna be able to pump it
everybody grab your gear
this is where we get off
the tug is listing radically to the side its deck awash with seawater as epps greer and murphy scramble with their gear to the crane
water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs precariously at the bow of the chimera
murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse
water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to one side
dodge wades through toward the door
epps pulls herself up onto the deck greer following behind then murphy
dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug which now lists at a near degree angle
dodge stumbles toward the bow slipping on the wet deck
he goes down sliding into the water that washes over the starboard rail
he pulls himself up using a cleat to push off
a deck locker opens and the contents tumble around him
he struggles to pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse
he climbs up and edges his way toward the bow
epps greer and murphy look on as dodge climbs up on the skewed deck crane
the tug is slowly lurching over as dodge climbs the crane the top of which is sweeping away from the chimera
below the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it sinks lower and lower
they look on as dodge climbs toward them the sinking tug pulling dodge and the crane away from the ship
greer pulls back a line tying it into the deck railing
as dodge makes his way up hes forced to climb onto the other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water
above greer casts a line
it falls near but out of reach as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and fro
dodge reaches out for the line again his hand coming close but not close enough
the swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and dodge reaches out his fingers just coming to the line coaxing it into his grasp
he pulls it back and hangs on as the crane sways back with the foundering boat
the crane falls away from dodge leaving him hanging in space by the line from the bow of the chimera
murphy greer and epps look on as dodge hangs over the water and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves
dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls still further to port the pilothouse dipping into the sea slipping lower and lower
as he pulls himself upward coming to the bottom of the rail well on the chimera where murphy reaches out just short of dodges hand
a screeching sounds and they turn to see the twin tow cables coming taught against the hull in the anchor alleys of the chimera as the sinking tug pulls them
with a concussive strike one cable is freed snapping against the chimeras hull like a giant steel guitar string
it starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts pulling the cable with it toward dodge as he dangles in mid air
dodge pulls himself up reaching for murphy but still short
a loud hissing sounds and dodge turns to see misty air escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water forces it out of the tug below decks
the tow cable loudly scrapes the hull in a shower of rust as dodge struggles to pull himself up
murphy reaches out as dodge extends as far as he can their hands barely reaching
the tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing ready to scrape dodge into the water or smear him across the hull like a bug on a windshield
when dodge pulls himself up with everything hes got and murphy grabs his hand
murphy pulls lifting dodge as greer grabs dodges other hand and they pull him up the tow cable sweeping by with a dodge turns to see the bow of the
tug dip below the surface slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation of misty air
the pilothouse is next to go the last of it slipping into the frothing water then the crane finally disappearing altogether into the depths
a long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence phantom bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood
a boot punches through a rotten wood hull
that just about says it all
greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards above the deck
rotten stem to stern
guess you couldnt expect much else
greer jumps down as murphy dodge and epps look on
we aint exactly in what youd call your high traffic neighborhood either
the coast guard has our last position
theyll send somebody out soon enough
a ship this size you cant exactly miss
its a good bet theyll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too
let em ask
this ships legally ours now
when they find out what its carrying they may not be so interested in whats legal
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat
dodge turns to see greer
the turbine blew
lemme see was that before or after the oil fire
dodge takes a swing at greer
grabbing dodge easy easy
murphy holds on to dodge as he will have none of it
gettin a little hot under the collar id say
must be a little too the truth eh dodge
dodge jumps forward again but murphy hangs on
i said shut the hell up
murphy shoves dodge back
both of you
i dont want to hear it again
a beat as greer and murphy hold there
so just stow it
a beat we dont need this right now
a fire burns in an oil drum as epps murphy dodge and greer sit around it in silence
epps steps in
she shines her light on the room
it is exactly as it was left
she crosses to the bed shining her light under it
she sits down trying it
dodge moves in the darkness coming to the corner where the stacked gold ingots rest
he looks on at them
you shouldnt be down here alone
dodge turns to see murphy standing there
just wanted to check on our little baby
a beat as they look on at the gold
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants
if money can buy what he wants
i dont figure theres much i want money cant buy
then youre a lucky man
murphy tosses the shotgun to dodge who catches it
well stand the watch on deck tonight
youre up first
murphy holds there a beat longer then turns to go as dodge looks after him
a grey chop gently rocks the chimera smoke rising from the top deck
greer and dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels adding broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke
murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case scavenging for food
epps scavenges for food in the semi darkness of the large open galley when a movement can be heard somewhere beyond the entry separating the galley from the outer passageway
no one answers
she looks off across the stillness of the galley
epps steps into the passageway
directly across is the entry to the swimming pool
she walks on
epps steps in
light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling every movement echoing off the hard tile walls
she holds there a beat then turns to go when she sees a girl of about facing her on the other side of the pool
epps holds there as the girl only looks back
she is porcelain white flaxen hair drawn behind her head her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body
you must leave
a beat as epps stands there
finally who are you
from this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girls features
theres great evil here more than you can know
leave now or you may never leave
but a hatch closes somewhere in the ship
epps turns to look
when she turns back the girl is gone
a quiet tick sound echoes in the pool
she looks down to see that the pool is now very very deep like a mine shaft falling away into the depths
and as she stands there dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom
she steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top
it is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible when the water begins to churn as from bubbles of air reaching the surface
epps steps closer looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles
as she watches the red glow grows in intensity
the glow spreads illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood
and as the light grows still brighter a figure is illuminated well below the surface as it seems to rise up
epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light
it is a man fighting desperately to reach the surface
the bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams
epps starts forward but another figure rises to the same point a woman also struggling
another man floats up then another and another people floating up fighting desperately to reach the surface unable to do so drowning in blood
epps reaches out over the edge plunging her hand into the blood reaching for the mans hand but they are too far apart
she struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the surface
the others are fighting for the surface too as epps reaches out near tears helpless to do anything
everything suddenly stops
a beat as epps only holds there
the blood is gone as are the people
the pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened epps looking on in disbelief
epps looks up to see murphy standing at the door
looking back to the pool yeah fine
a beat as she holds there looking on at the pool
greer murphy dodge and epps sit on deck around the fire
youd think on a ship this size thered be something left to eat
after fifty years there aint nothin left but shoe leather
tomorrow well see if we cant find some line and tackle
use some of those bodies below decks for bait
theres a charming thought
we can always start shooting birds
epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette
what say epps
you up for some roasted albatross
snuffing it out why not
the sound of someone breathing hard can be heard in the dark room
as the camera slowly moves into the room we see that it is greer lying on the bed
his body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest
his jaw is clenched and he expels harsh guttural utterances experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure
sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of morning
murphy stands on the bridge looking off at it coming down when greer steps in
looks like were in a strong current
closing the door must be making almost five knots full on ass backwards
greer crosses to the window stepping up
nasty little swell outa the north west too
murphy nods as he looks out
lets just hope somebody sees us first out here
a file drawer comes open revealing ticket receipts
epps looks on at it
the receipts are labeled full fare passages and are divided by first second and third class
she goes through them coming to a section that says she pulls out the folder laying it on the counter opening it
the first page is a receipt for a single passage to halifax for a tatterly stephen age
she pulls it back to reveal another wilson harold age
another vitti angela age
she pages through the stack looking at the ages until coming across a
she looks to the name klein david a boy
she continues paging through the receipts coming to another
she stops looking to the name nichols katherine age
she looks to the cabin assignment
she notes that it is the same cabin where greer was found when a reverberant concussion sounds through the ship
dodge runs to the side to see a feet wide by feet tall steel and concrete mid ocean buoy bounce off the transom as the ship drifts into it
they come to the side at the wheelhouse seeing the bright orange letters noaa emblazoned on the buoys float pod as the ship drifts by
its a noaa buoy
its got a transmitter aboard
dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as greer epps and murphy look on at the approaching buoy
lets go lets go lets go
dodge finishes as epps ties the other end off to a cleat
as it drifts along the side of the chimera
murphy drops the line down the buoy bouncing on the swell
murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears aiming to hook it on its wind gauge
the buoy approaches rising and falling with the swell
youre gonna miss it
murphy holds the loop steady
the loop is too low
its going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it when the swell drops and the buoy goes down
murphy yanks on the line
and the loop catches on the wind gauge
as the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time the line snapping hard against the rail
below the buoy heels over as its pulled
it drops with the swell the line stretching then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge booming clang
the line is smoking with the friction the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on
were still drifting
the mooring hasnt come taught
its not gonna hold us
as the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship
the water returns lifting it high
the ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught
the line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water
the buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring
the buoy rises fully from the water all three tons of it and as it does the wind gauges steel mount begins to bend
as they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable
no fucking way
the gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray whipping wildly from side to side
the buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself rising on a swell passing beyond the bow of the chimera
they look on in silence the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away
murphy stands watch by the fire as epps joins him
wish i could say the same
they watch the fire in silence for a moment
what do you think happened on this boat
i guess thats the sixty four thousand dollar question isnt it
before your time
a beat i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts
the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune
equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide
what happened after that is anybodys guess
but judging by our greek friends down below it doesnt look like the last time
are we smart enough to avoid that
i dont know are we
a beat as she looks back at him
she looks back to the fire watching it
when you found me yesterday at the pool
not our mystery guest again
hesitating a beat im not sure she was
she looks up to murphy
a beat as she only looks back
what like some kind of ghost
i dont know what else youd call her
one second she was there the next she was gone
another beat as he looks on at her
and i had a kind of hallucination
a beat there were others
i saw them in the pool
a beat as murphy looks back as she sees him
maybe hallucination is the wrong word
it was more than that
as though they were showing me
showing you what
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks
i think they are were just passengers
victims of what
something bad happened here murphy
that much i think weve already established
more than just a mutiny
more than just the gold
a beat as he holds there
she said the ship was evil
that we had to leave right away
that if we didnt we might never leave
whats that supposed to mean
i dont know
a beat as she looks back
how come the rest of us havent seen these people
just lucky i guess
another beat as he holds on her
getting off this ships exactly what were trying to do
short of that i dont know what else to tell you
she only looks back at him then into the fire
do me a favor and wake up dodge
hes next on
she starts to get up
she stands looking back at him
you can tell the others about this
but for my money i think its best you keep it to yourself
she holds there a beat longer then turns walking off
epps comes to the nd officers door knocks
no answer knocking again dodge
finally from inside what
epps sits down on the bed
she lies back not sleepy
a beat as she holds there in the darkness
murphy still sits by the fire as dodge groggily approaches from the officers quarters carrying a blanket and a jug of water
handing him the shotgun dont fall asleep
laying out his blanket right
greer lies asleep on the bed
but his sleep is fitful increasingly agitated tormented
it is as if he tries to speak but cannot
as the camera pushes slowly in his words are forced and garbled speaking in the same nonsensical language he spoke earlier when he wakes with a start
dodge dozes cradling the shotgun in his arms when music can be heard very distantly
it is daisy playing on a music box somewhere in the ship
dodge moves along as the music box distantly continues
dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another passageway
he approaches from the other end
he passes the open doors of stateroom after stateroom
the music box is closer here
he holds there in the darkness
he turns shining his light back down the passageway
it is silent when the he raises his radio
but no one says anything the channel remaining open a discernible presence on the other end
slowly moving toward dodge as he can be seen from the other end of the passageway
he gets no response then presses the talk button
this is dodge
he is answered by silence the channel remaining open when cock a doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
dodge hits the talk button
who is this
the radio channel opens but only silence comes back
identify yourself motherfucker
slowly moving toward dodge as he can be seen from the far end of the passageway
only silence returns on the radio as dodge holds there then penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
the camera pushes slowly in on dodge as he listens
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy dodge senses something behind him
he turns and before he can draw a breath to shout something heavy slams into him in the darkness his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle of light
as the shotgun clatters to the deck the muzzle resting in frame as the radio falls a few feet away
the shotgun muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing pulls it away
a grey overcast stretches to the horizon
murphy comes out onto the deck
dodge is nowhere to be seen
epps shines her light on something
check it out
greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods
they are industrial sized cans from the s
greer takes one
i dont even want to know what thats gonna taste like now
better than starving to death
epps radio crackles awake
murphy to epps
raising the radio epps over
either of you seen dodge
she looks to greer who shakes his head
hes not on deck and i cant raise him on the radio
dodges stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct as greer epps and murphy stand over it
a blanket a pillow and a plastic jug of water are all that remain
he took the shotgun and a light
mustve heard something below deck and went down to check it out
a beat as they hold there
we stay together
nobody goes any further than earshot
greer and epps move along as murphy raises his radio
into radio murphy to dodge
murphy to dodge
dodges radio lies in the detritus of the ship as murphys voice can be heard on it
murphy to dodge
do you copy
epps moves cautiously along in the darkness
as he moves along as well eyes open
as greer moves along too
epps jumps down shining her light over machinery and across bulkheads when a whispering can be heard somewhere
she holds there listening
it is echoey distant
no response as epps holds there
the whispering sounds again far off unintelligible
she moves on shinning her light
epps moves along in the darkness holding the flashlight before her when the whispering sounds again
epps stops holding there in the silence
she reaches for her radio
the whispering sounds again
epps turns to pinpoint it coming from somewhere in the cavernous space
epps passes under a catwalk
she moves on passing a row of standpipes
epps stops listening
somewhere the whispering can be heard then stops
it is absolutely silent
in the darkness behind her the epps holds there a beat then turns running into greer with a start
didnt mean to scare you
she holds there a beat looking around
i just thought i heard something is all
lets get outa here
they start to leave when epps notices something
beyond the standpipes a faint glow can be seen in the darkness
epps steps forward crossing to it
as epps approaches greer behind her
the light is dim and low to the deck
as epps starts toward it again
she and greer come up to it stopping there
she kneels the dim glow shining on her
she reaches out toward it pulling back dodges flashlight still on
she turns it off standing
she shines her light into the darkness and starts off greer following
epps and greer move along shining their lights as they go when something catches in the beam of epps flashlight
it is dodges radio
they stop over it
epps picks it up inspecting it
she looks to greer when a single dark spot appears on epps cheek
it begins to run a crimson tear
she raises her hand to touch it inspecting her finger to see that it is blood
she looks to greer
they both look up to see hanging suspended above them dodges face staring back down at them from the darkness
he has been imperfectly impaled the sharp point of a high pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck head hanging limp beside it
greer and murphy lower dodges body on a rope as epps guides it to the deck
they stand looking on at it a moment
cant find the shotgun
so whoever did this now has our shotgun
doesnt look like it much matters
what do we do with him
leave him till we can get some help
a beat from now on nobody comes down here
what about the gold
now hold up just a minute
lets be reasonable here
you think whoever did this is reasonable
all im saying is that golds worth a lot more to us now than it ever was
i cant believe you
dodges dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share
i didnt sign up to go home empty handed
and i sure aint gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this
nobodys going anywhere with that gold now
anybody tries to board well know about it
a beat you can do what you want greer
but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that
fine with me
epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight
she moves down the passage coming finally to the stateroom where greer was found room
she holds there a beat then reaches for the door hesitating
she opens it
the door comes open and epps steps in
it is dark though spacious
it is divided into two rooms
beyond the sitting room in the front is a bedroom
epps steps in
a dressing table sits against the far wall
a large bed is unmade
suitcases lie open on stands at the foot of the bed still half full as if they were in the process of being unpacked
from one she pulls back a womans gown a blouse
the other contains shirts trousers socks and underwear
across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on an ottoman in the corner
epps crosses to it
she finds a few shirts and a red print dress some books
she takes one of the books opening it
inscribed on the inside of the cover is this book belongs to and then written in by hand katie nichols
a page is marked with a purple ribbon
she opens it to see a childrens poem the rooster and the crow and a drawing of a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem cock a
doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
she puts it down
a tin penny whistle sits on the table
she picks it up examining it
she opens a small picture book thumbing through to see photos of a family a young mother and father at the beach the mother and a girl of about years
the girl and an older girl of about the girl she saw at the swimming pool katie
epps holds on this picture when a music box sounds
she looks up to the dressing table
on it a music box slowly plays daisy
epps crosses to it looking on at the music box as it slowly winds down then finally stops
she picks it up looking at it when she looks up to see greer standing there
the dirty white light falling into the room through the windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot see
his expression is empty hollow
he does not hear her as he stands there
she approaches stepping up
another beat as he looks off into the light when he slowly turns to see her
a long beat as she looks back
he holds there the same empty look about him when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes hard
she is stunned breathless but raises her hands to grip his wrists fighting him
his grip tightens
he is much stronger and her efforts make little difference
she hangs on starting to choke
she drops one hand searching with it
he speaks nonsense his face distorted in an ugly grimace eyes bulging as epps fumbles over the table a tray of glass and silver crashing to the floor as he
pushes her back still choking her
he backs her to the wall pushing in closing her windpipe the rest of the way
her hand searches behind her knocking over a small vase a basket some books
it comes to a brass desk lamp
it falls a little out of reach
she is going to black out any second as greer strangles her
her hand comes to the desk lamp grabbing it
she raises the lamp swinging with all her might connecting with greers head
he stumbles back a gash laid into his face as epps sucks in air gagging and coughing her neck purple with finger marks
she fumbles her radio up
into radio murphy
im on c deck cabin
get down here now
blood is running down his face as greer comes for her again
she throws down the radio
a bed stands between them
she feints right then left
hes dazed and has blood in his eyes
she manages to slip by but he dives taking her down
he drags her back along the floor spinning her around
he raises a fist to ram into her face when wham
epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch and he comes up screaming
he grabs her face striking her with his other hand
she swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the head
he swings yet again and connects knocking her across the floor
she lies in a heap as greer climbs to his feet enraged and bleeding
he unbuckles his belt as he approaches pulling it from his waist to do god knows what
epps looks around to see him approaching
and we see that she has unhinged her gill knife
as his foot steps near she lets go and drives the knife with all her might into his boot plunging the blade through his foot and into the floor
after a moment he stops looks to her
he is a bloody wretched enraged mess
he starts toward her as murphy appears in the doorway
just as greer is upon her murphy blind sides greer from behind at full speed knocking him down
greer and murphy struggle as epps climbs unsteadily to her feet
she staggers to them and raises the flashlight over greer bringing it down on his head
epps and murphy carry greers unconscious body
greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium
he stops at the bottom now starting to come to
murphy slams the door shut as epps looks on
she puts a steel pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened
greer sits in the tank visible through a large piece of armored aquarium glass amidst the fake coral
he sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language
mustve been him all along
murphy and epps look on from the outside in the promenade
smashed the radio
scuttled the boat
wouldve killed you
hes off his nut no doubt there
they watch him in silence a moment as greer mutters and bobs
what do you think
could be a stroke
a beat the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves
like wild dogs
over the gold
maybe it was more than that
greer gets up comes to the window looking out at them
he presses his face to the glass
they went crazy
crazy with greed
not like him
a beat as epps looks off
in the window greer drags his hideously distorted face over the glass the blood from his wounds smearing in broad red streaks
a partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame
epps and murphy stand over it
we lash a few of these together it might get us far enough into the shipping lanes to be rescued
a beat as they look on at the rotting hull
hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water
if the weather holds it might not be so bad
its not the weather im worried about
the wrong current could drag us as far as the aleutians before we come across another boat
epps and murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into a single usable raft
greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank the white light from the skylight falling on him from above
epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces making her way into the darkness when her radio crackles to life
the channel remains silent a moment then closes
she stops raises the radio
holding down talk button murphy
she waits holding there as only silence comes back
murphy this is epps
do you copy
again only silence comes back until after a moment the channel opens again
no one speaks though there is a palpable presence on the other end
raising the radio who is this
the channel opens again only silence returning
the sound of the music box can be heard daisy coming back over the epps walks along in the darkness as the music box continues to play over the radio
she comes to the end of the corridor stopping there
at the other end the light falls from the door at room
the music from the radio stops leaving in its absence the epps approaches the other end from where the music emanates coming to a stop at room
a beat as she holds there
epps steps in as the music box plays in the other room
the sitting room is dark as she holds there
after a moment she continues on coming to the bedroom
epps steps in
across the room the music box is playing
she crosses coming to it as it continues when her radio crackles to life
the channel remains silent a moment then cock a doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
she holds there a beat then crosses to the table to find the book of nursery rhymes
she opens it to the nursery rhyme the rooster and the crow seeing the same words on the page when the radio crackles again
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
penny whistle toy
on the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier
she takes it holding on it a moment
she raises it and the camera slowly pushes in as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows a c sharp which becomes a c sharp from a penny
whistle across the room
cock a doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
on the other side of the room the younger girl from the photo plays the penny whistle
she is sitting on the floor with the mother who reads from the book we saw earlier
cock a doodle doo said the rooster to the crow
where are you now
i know but wont say so
cassandra if you insist on playing that while i read ill just stop right now
the room is warm with light restored to its original condition some fifty years ago as epps stands there unseen no longer holding the whistle
a man the father from the photos steps from the bathroom wearing a new coat
what do you think
he certainly did shorten it didnt he
i thought this was all the rage
maybe last year
katie joins them from the outer room
what about this year
its not your color anyway
i like it daddy
well thank you
daddy how much longer before we start moving again
theyre working on the engines honey
as soon as they fix them well be on our way
epps steps from room into the passageway
it is lit with sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and objets dart stretching to the far end are all in their original condition
distant music from the ballroom can be heard as epps stands there
she moves along
epps walks in the passageway
doors are open and she looks in to see people doing various things some packing and putting their things in order
epps walks down the passage rounding the corner to see three stewards fighting with a fourth man in a tuxedo
they lift him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and protests
she moves on through a pair of double doors into epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the galley
a group of crewmen stand around at the other end and as epps nears she sees that four figures can be seen among them
they are four men officers swaying gently from the ships movement as they hang from ropes around their neck dead
epps keeps moving through doors at the other end
a commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway as epps keeps moving
a woman screams and is cut off when a door slams shut
the distant music has been replaced with indiscernible shouting as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere as she walks she passes an open door where several crewmen fight over a
steamer trunk which breaks open scattering the contents
epps walks along coming to another door where a dead man and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a steward takes money from a wallet
the steward looks up reaches over and slams the door shut
she continues on
another door stands open as she comes to it back at room
a repetitive sound can be heard coming from inside
epps steps in as the sound continues
she crosses the sitting room coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several mutineers some in stewards attire others wearing ships officers caps obviously taken from their rightful
the repetitive sound comes from here bed springs
and from between the men a womans bare legs hang over the end of the bed as a pair of mans legs in boots lie between them the bed rocking
the others looking on
epps turns to see the father
he is on his knees hands tied behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of the bed
a geometric pattern of a lotus on the persian carpet at her feet
when she looks up again she sees what the father sees
the mutineer finishes climbing off the woman
another of the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all but katie
the mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near by as one of the other mutineers steps up to epps
you like that daddy
ill show you something else now
the mutineer steps back to the bed
he sits katie down so that she faces us on the end of the bed
he raises an axe over her bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling blur the camera stops on katie standing on the other side of the room now
empty of people returned to its shabby abandoned state
it isnt real
epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands
many bad things have happened here
but you mustnt allow the evil inside
i tell you this because you can see me
the others cant
but you must leave
you must leave
a loud gunshot sounds somewhere in the ship
when epps turns back katie is gone
epps moves quickly along raising her radio
epps to murphy
only white noise comes back
epps to murphy
only white noise comes back as she rounds the corner out onto the promenade
at the other end the aquarium can be seen
as she approaches she sees that the tank is empty
greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out
a great booming shudder rocks the ship
a loud screeching of metal follows it
the ships hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged mid ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across
the ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands a mine field for a drifting ship
epps moves quickly along coming to the stairway moving up almost running into murphy on his way down carrying a canvas duffle
we hit land
were in an island chain
its only a matter of time before we hit another one
he broke out of the tank
epps and murphy move quickly along when another huge booming shudders the ship and the shrieking of metal follows
the ship bounces off another of the small jagged islands as it drifts past buckling the steel plate of the hull precariously
murphy and epps run toward the other end of the ship
as they do something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down
epps and murphy slow to see that it is a body lying face down in the passage
they step up
epps kneels as murphy looks on
she rolls the body over
it is greer dead
hes been shot
murphy kneels too looking on at greers lifeless eyes
lets get the hell out of here
murphy and epps come up the stairway crossing to the doors
as epps and murphy come out moving toward the make do raft
it should be enough to get us to one of those islands
gimme a hand wouldya
she joins him and they lift it off its stand taking it to the rail
prop it here
we need to pull these braces off
theres a hammer on the stand
epps crosses back to the stands
she pulls back murphys canvas duffle folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun the shotgun dodge had when he died
a beat as she holds there when murphys hand grabs it
ill take that
a beat as she looks to murphy
it was you
he only looks back at her as she stands there
you killed them
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody
a beat you saw it coming as well as i did
dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat
and greer too except he went nuts
couldnt take it i guess
couldve happened in the middle of downtown anchorage
but did it make him any less dangerous
i dont think so
so you killed them
the way i figure it it was them or me
i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch
bought a little time
made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around
but its just us on this ship
us and your
and now youre gonna kill me is that it
i didnt want it to turn out this way
murphy dont you see whats happening
i think i see it pretty well
its the ship
the ships making you think this way
i know a little bit about human nature and what ive seen only confirms that
its a trap
there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold
nobody ever does
its just the bait
this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo
theres nothing supernatural about greed
and thats what it comes down to pure and simple
i dont give a damn about the gold
i wish i could believe that
either way you know what ive done
ive got no choice
he raises the shotgun
he prepares to fire when a concussion rocks the ship
epps ducks and murphy fires a spatter of buckshot shredding the vent behind her
a screeching of metal deep in the ship sounds as she gets up diving for cover as murphy shuttles the gun again
epps scrambles behind a deck vent
the ship has bounced off yet another small island the jagged rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek
murphy crosses toward the deck vent
theres no reason to make this any more difficult than it has to be
as epps holds there she sees the vent opening
she pulls herself up and climbs inside
epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its width
she squeezes through the fan blades and drops down where several vent ducts lead in different directions below it
murphy comes to the vent duct where epps went down
epps crawls through
she comes to a vent that leads out to a passageway
murphy runs quickly down the stairway shotgun at the ready
the vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk
the clang from the vent sounds here and murphy stops
epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage
murphy rounds the corner moving on the same deck
epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her
footsteps sound at the end of the passage
epps pulls back into the shadows holding there
the footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end when the footsteps stop
epps holds there listening intently in the silence when at the other end the sound of creaking metal as from a hatch slowly opening can be heard
all is silent when the hatch creaks again at the other end
she begins moving toward it
as she approaches she can see that the hatch is half open swaying slightly with the movement of the ship
a creaking sounds behind her
she turns just as murphy steps into view
she ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her
she scrambles on her belly as murphy fires again
she swings down from the catwalk letting herself fall to the next deck
epps gets up runs
murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks
epps moves quickly along
murphy follows when a rumbling sound can be heard
epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the rumbling grows in intensity
though it seems to resonate throughout the ship it seems to originate from here from directly below as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom
she steps back as the sound grows still louder until it becomes absolutely deafening
the ship begins to shudder
the steel bulkheads visibly move and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back and forth
murphy slows and finally stops
a few rivets pop in the hull
then a few more as the rumbling epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away when the rumbling reaches a pinnacle
the rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way a massive crag of rock smashing through epps ducks
for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through the chimeras hull like a jagged claw through paper in a the chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious rock promontory of a small island
the giant claw begins to pull back as the ship drifts off water pouring in behind it
the ship is drifting free of the island with the current a huge gash rising on its port side
a massive torrent sweeps over epps as seawater pours in through the breach
murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end of the passage
he begins backing away
epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already half way up the side the ship listing with a great groaning murphy moves down the passageway coming
to the cargo compartment
epps comes up for air
a clatter of all manner of debris tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead as the ship eases over
a boiler breaks loose of its stays
epps looks up to see it coming right for her
she ducks under the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she was
epps is forced down by the boiler trapped between it and the bulkhead
the gold slides off the palette crashing into the far wall
murphy hurries to it collecting ingots and putting them in his pockets
epps struggles under the water to free herself but she is trapped the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her
the level of the water has now almost completely reached the deck above filling the ship almost entirely below decks
the water is threateningly high as murphy pockets one last ingot and makes his way for the exit
epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays without luck
she swims down lower finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays without luck when a form drifts into view in the murky water
several more forms appear
they are human suspended in the water
as epps looks the several forms have become many
they are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before
as they look on at her from where they are one form emerges
it is katie
she reaches toward epps as if beckoning her to take her hand from the other side
epps raises her hand taking it
the girl leads epps down into the murky darkness where she finds a way out
she takes her back further coming to the breech leading her out and into a cool green void of water
katie stops at the breach
epps turns to her
she only looks back at epps
epps turns away swimming upward toward the light of the surface
epps breaks through gasping for air
she looks to see the chimera listing heavily to one side its bow decks fully awash
murphy staggers through the flooded passage
the chimera is getting lower in the water the bow submerged and the stern beginning to rise
epps sees another small island some distance off
she begins swimming toward it
water runs down the stairway as murphy struggles toward the top
epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance
a river of water rushes through as murphy crosses with difficulty
epps reaches the jagged rock of the island
she pulls herself up
water rushes in as murphy wades out onto the chimeras top deck
he is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under as he half wades half swims the length of the ships aft portion rising above him as the bow sinks
epps collapses on the rocks
as the ship moves lower murphy pushes off
he bobs under momentarily then comes back up with difficulty
the forward smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water the current from the rushing water pulling him toward it
epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher
as the ship dips lower the rushing water forms an eddy that pulls at murphy
murphy struggles too heavy to resist as he is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the smokestacks opening
the ship sinks further and murphy is pulled to the edge of the stack
he frantically grabs for something to hold on to without success until he is finally pulled into the smoke stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the
epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind looking on at the chimera her stern rising high above water as she goes down when the rumble of engines
can be heard
she turns to see a coastguard plane sweeping low over the chimera then banking back and flying right over as she shouts and waves her arms
the coastguard plane flies by one more time this time dropping a survival pack
the chimeras stern rises up out of the water almost vertical now slipping further and further under
epps looks on one last time as the ship goes down
the afterdeck of the chimera sinks slowly slowly down the camera pushing in to chimera as the name comes to the water then slips slowly beneath the surface
and the camera follows moving into the water to reveal that beneath the surface there is no ship at all only the vast empty depths of the ocean
