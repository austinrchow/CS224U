multiple dwelling between third and lex
the engine screams and honks through the city
flames roar from the upper stories of this slumlords shitbox
an engine and ladder company are on scene attacking the fire with hoses
gordys engine company arrives
gordy hits the ground moves to a battalion chief
the chiefs terse orders are drowned out by the noise of the equipment fire and men
gordy moves back to his company who have already hooked the engine up to water
top storys fully involved

two lines up the stairs
he points to junior and then to the channel surfer mike shea a veteran firefighter of irish descent
junior and mike he points to the chess player sal dibiase another fd veteran mediterranean descent and then to the rookie ronnie book a new york melting pot mutt
sal and ronnie
the chauffeur art westphal german irish stays with the engine as gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two man hose teams into
gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy hoses
rats head past in the opposite direction deserting the burning building
they meet fire on the third floor
on goes the water
gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants using the axe to open locked doors then taps junior and mike indicates up
begins leading the hose team up the stairwell
sees something and yells a warning stairsre screwed
hug the wall
they reach the fourth floor
theres fire everywhere
they see a firefighter from the other company
he has fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway above
hes pinned under a large section of heavy debris coughing and screaming for help as fire rages around him
to junior and mike knock it back
they turn the hose on the flames as gordy moves to the trapped firefighter
gordy tries lifting the debris cant budge it
he starts chopping at it with the axe
chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again
gordy hacks off a large piece of debris
he levers his axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter

gordy moves to the firefighter
two floors up
i heard screaming
couldnt get there
end of the hall
charges the next flight of stairs
reaches the fifth floor
tries to reach six but theres too much fire
hes beaten back
but not before he hears the faint sound of screaming
gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment door at the end
between him and the door is the gaping hole in the floor
its too big to jump
he starts running
hes gonna jump it
gordy reaches the edge of the hole
leaps with all hes got
at the same time he swings the axe point first
slams it into a spot high on the wall and
gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle
he hits the other side running
drives a shoulder into the door at the end of the hall
gordy bursts in
its an inferno
he looks up
knocks his axe on the ceiling
hears desperate pounding back
gordy climbs a table
starts whacking upward with the axe attacking the peeling crumbled plaster overhead
gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above but hes not doing it fast enough
he wont beat the fire
gordy calls down to his men
give me the hose
this place is gone
it could flashover any second
give me the goddamn hose
mike and junior pass the hose up
gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the ceiling
turns it on full jet
gordys barely able to hold the hose as the high pressure stream bites into old decayed plaster
bit by bit the ceiling falls away
gordys almost through to the room above when
falling debris severs the hose
gordys lost pressure
he hasnt broken through
the buildings coming down
hes gotta get outta there
gordys not going anywhere
picks up the axe
attacks the hole again furiously until finally
a small hole which he quickly widens to reveal
a terrified latino family gaping down at him their room ablaze around them
gordy reaches up
speaks to them in spanglish its okay
esta bien esta bien
come with me
gordy lowers the family through the floor hole
gordy carries the familys small child outside
he passes the child to its grateful parents while
the rescued firefighter sits on a curb looking at a hero and shaking his head in disbelief and admiration
anne pitt thirties reaches out and kills the alarm
she rolls over
the other half of the beds empty
we hear a childs voice from another room
anne opens the door to find an exhausted gordy sitting on the floor with their four year old son matt
theyre building a knex spaceship
look what we made
that took a while
he was awake when i got home
his throat still hurts
thats a bad word
she feels matts forehead
gordys done it already

she leans down and kisses him
theres passion in it

beat calls after her come back and let me see those legs again
gordy holds matt in his arms as water pours over them
its the second child hes held in the last few hours
this one is his this one is safe at home and unafraid what a father wants for his child
we see the deep affection gordy has for his son
he holds matt tightly skin to skin and kisses the boys wet head
anne opens the shower door

she leads matt out
closes the shower door
gordy sticks his face into the water
looks back finds
two bare butts annes and matts are pressed against the shower doors foggy glass
off gordy laughing it appears the entire neighborhoods crammed against the chain link fence around the court yelling and cheering as a team of local kids from the nyfd athletic
league plays a team of local kids from the nypd athletic league
gordys an nyfd coach exhorts his team at the top of his lungs
the rivalrys intense
the game close
the noise deafening
bets are going down
nyfd goes up by one in the final minute
gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team
luis is one of gordys kids
a small but talented fifteen year old
luis steals the ball
drives for an unguarded lay up to put the team up by three
an opponent recovers the ball
the flow shifts toward the other end but luis is slow adjusting devastated at missing the easy two
gordy yells at him to defend
luis get back
pick up your man
luis shakes it off
hustles back on d as his man gets the ball
the opponents a step ahead
and luis gets there to reject him
the crowd loves it
the buzzer sounds
in the games immediate aftermath
nyfd celebrating around them
gordys proud of luis
we lose win whatever
but one thing we never do
we never ever give up
off gordy smiling at luis
the crowds are gone
gordy checks his watch and starts off when a sound draws his attention
luis walks along the inside of the chain link fence around the court
a neighborhood gangbanger and his crew match luis step for step outside the fence rattling the fence clearly trying to intimidate him
gordy stalks walking toward them
seeing gordy approach the gangbanger and crew drift off
reaching luis what was that about
told em i wouldnt play with em anymore
but gordy sees luis is scared
and he sees the gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for gordy to go
through the window we see gordy delivering luis to a latin man clearly luiss father and the bodegas owner
we dont hear the words but we can tell gordys complimenting the boy to his dad
checks his watch
whistles up a taxi
traffic jam on park avenue south
checks his watch
to the cabbie try fifth
anne waits on the corner with matt playing with his spaceship
she checks her watch
its five of twelve
fifth avenues also a parking lot
he jams money in the pay dish
im getting outta here
gordy exits the cab and takes off running
checks her watch again
shes pissed now
a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket
a caravan of lincoln navigators passes anne and turns east on th
turns onto th
as he runs he jumps trying to see anne and matt over other pedestrians
the navigators pull up at a building flying the colombian flag
latin and american men in suits get out of the navigators
gordy dodges pedestrians
still trying to get a glimpse of anne and matt
the cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the other way
gordy nearly collides with him
at the last moment the traffic cop shuffles gordy aside
gordy reaches the corner
sees anne and matt
behind gordy we see the cop get into a brown ford
hear the whistle
matt sees gordy
there he is
waves back shrugs an apology to anne as he starts across the street when
suddenly lights up the intersection
in slow motion wave rolls up th past madison
erupts behind anne and matt
we hear the enormous bang of the explosion
are sucked into millions of fragments a hailstorm of glass
an engine block flies from the ball of flame
instinctively pulls her child to her
sees the engine block tumbling through the air toward his wife and son
his scream is lost in the thunderous roar all around
the engine block is about to hit anne and matt when
a fedex truck windows shattered skids past wiping out gordys line of sight
when the truck clears
anne and matt are gone
the corners empty
just matts spaceship slowly falling to the ground
theres a horrible screech
a taxi skids sideways to avoid the fedex truck and hits gordy
hes in the air tumbling then smacks to the ground
gordy looks up through the smoke and falling debris
then struggles to his hands and knees
he tries to stand then falls down screaming in pain a large shard of glass embedded in his leg
people come to help him but gordy only cares about finding anne and matt
he looks around desperately but cant see them when
his eyes go to the spaceship in pieces on the pavement
gordy screams out his agony noooooo
the blast detonated here
some men from the navigators are dead
mike brandt is not
rises from the devastation gun in hand as sirens wail in the distance
emergency personnel ems nypd nyfd swarm the area
two white plastic sheets cover two bodies
across the street paramedics work on gordys leg
were gonna give you a shot
gordys oblivious to the pain
shoves him away
i need to see them
we gotta help you right now
weve done all we can for em gordy
fbi agent joe phipps ducks under the police tape
reggie dray a young agent meets him
as they walk device functioned in front of the colombian consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived
who were the brass and why were they here
no ones talking yet but it smells high level
there were colombians and americans in the cars
three of em ate it
guy on the phone he indicates brandt talking on a cell phone

that gets phipps interest momentarily
then as they continue toward the consulate he notices security cameras on the building
check the surveillance cameras

theyre helping with shoe leather
phipps eyes go to the white sheets up the street
we got two dead bystanders a mother and four year old son

mike the veteran firefighter in gordys engine company looks under the sheets with a cop

junior spots a news camera crew focusing on gordys grief calls at a cop

the cop begins moving the camera crew back
phipps continues to gordy
a paramedic looks up at mike

gordy eases up
then after a moment defeated i didnt see anything except the explosion
phipps sees thats all hes gonna get
i know this is hard
im sorry i had to bother you
gordy looks over as the bodies of anne and matt are placed on gurneys and rolled away
chalk outlines are all that remain of his family
were gonna roll you to the hospital now and get that glass out
walking back to the consulate
he approaches brandt
counter terrorism task force
what got this place blown up
well have this discussion somewhere else more secure after i get your clearance
whatever it takes
but i got a bomber in the wind
i need everything you can give me and i need it now
gordys on a gurney on an i
his thigh heavily bandaged
junior and the rookie ronnie are with him but theres no chatter gordys shut down oblivious to everyone around him
mike is on a cell phone nearby as sal the other veteran from the engine company enters and approaches him
into the phone hang on
mike turns his attention to sal whos clearly blown away by the bad news that brought him here dammit
tell me about it
hows he holding up
hes shut down
we were hoping theyd keep him here and he wouldnt have to go home right away but theyre cutting him loose
want me to stay at home with him
rookies taking the first shift
im just getting the schedule at the firehouse rearranged now
mike goes back to the phone and sal crosses to gordy
he puts a hand on gordys shoulder grips it firmly
got here as fast as i could
gordy sees him but says nothing
i know it sucks
it really sucks
gordy cant go there
sal releases his grip
hows the leg
cuts deep but no major vessels were severed
hes got a load o silk holding it all together
junior who stepped off to talk to a cop now comes back
just came over the police radio
consulate surveillance cameras caught the bomber in the act
he was disguised as a cop
gordy looks over
what junior just said has triggered something
i saw him
i saw a cop
gordy yanks out his i
and starts to get up
but gordys already on his feet already moving
i gotta help em get the bastard
a well lit sectioned off area of the garage secured by a chain link fence
as he passes dray already there how long before we have a secure computer network
theyre building it now
phipps moves to a forensic expert hovering over a table of small fragments
what do you got
pieces of a pager oxidized with trace elements of semtex
probably the triggering device
they dial it up probably from a cell phone and boom
he picks up a microchip
this is the memory chip
i can build it into a working pager and maybe get a number readout
phipps moves to the next work area where another forensic expert studies video from a consulate surveillance camera
in super slow mo we see a cop the one who later bumped into gordy in front of the consulate
his hat is pulled down over his eyes almost concealing his tinted glasses
as the cop faces more toward the camera the expert freeze frames
to phipps thats as much face as we get
he was careful to duck the camera
run a total analysis
i want to know if this assholes right or left handed
i want everything you can get outta this film
phipps keeps moving enters an eerie recreation of the blast site
streets buildings etc
are marked out on the garage floor
pieces of the navigators rest in front of the area marked consulate parts of an nypd traffic scooter rest in front of the navigators xs mark where anne and matt
phipps crosses to another agent
any helpful information coming outta colombia
sat intel hasnt picked up any related data traffic either
dray walks up
gordon pitts here
he says he saw a cop at the scene
gordy accompanied by mike and ronnie sits in front of a video monitor
phipps and dray look on
a police cart pulls up outside the consulate
the cart was stolen from the central park precinct yesterday
the cop gets out of the scooter
thats the son of a bitch i bumped into
the cop tickets a vehicle then walks west out of frame
the bombs in the cart
reverses the video freeze frames on the cop
we think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone
the guy doesnt have one in his hands here
did you see a cell phone when you ran into him
how much time passed between then and the explosion
we think maybe he got into the brown ford
you see him then
all i cared about was getting to my wife and boy
to phipps guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in
beat then by way of ending it we might need to call you in again to look at some photos
gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop
i touched him
a bagpiper plays amazing grace
reveal gordy holding matts small coffin as annes is lowered into the ground
gordys men are around him along with many other nyfd personnel family and friends
a second bagpiper farther away in the cemetery picks up the song begins playing it in a round with the first
matts coffin is taken from gordy
as it is lowered
a third bagpiper farther away still begins playing the song with the other two
one by one the first and second bagpipers finish their rounds until there is just the third a haunting mournful wail off into the distance
theres only silence
gordy stands at an open closet door
he leans in buries his face in matts clothes and smells them
smells his son
the tv is on low tuned to the news
gordy is alone slumped in a chair
the bombing that left a mother and son dead and new york city numb took on a new dimension today when a notorious latin american terrorist took credit for the
has roused from his despondency turns up the volume as the report containing visuals continues in an e mail to the new york times a marxist extremist known only as
the wolf states that the bombing was quote not an act of terror but an act of war aimed at stopping your c
murderers and their fascist puppets from committing further acts of repression against the people of colombia unquote
two colombian officials and an american military officer died in last thursdays blast
also killed were anne pitt wife of a new york city firefighter and their only child four year old matt
the president has vowed that the united states will avenge what he called this monstrous act of barbarism and cowardice
intelligence sources say the identity and whereabouts of the wolf remain a mystery
they believe he has worked closely with radical elements in latin america for more than twenty years and have linked him to numerous terrorist bombings including the downing of a
peruvian airliner which killed forty two people eleven of them americans
the head of the latin america indigenous peoples committee a group known to be sympathetic to the radicals in colombia talked to news six in queens
watches as ephraim ortiz dominguez a latin man in his forties comes on the screen
i cannot speak for the wolf or his actions
i would only repeat that the leftist guerrillas in colombia are not terrorists but freedom fighters in a war being waged against them by the u
and colombian governments
governments who wish only to protect a system that lines the pockets of corrupt politicians and multi national profiteers
jump cut the deaths of the woman and little boy are regrettable but your government inflicts them all the time
you call it collateral damage
an fbi surveillance team has taken over the office
three agents work video and audio recording devices
a camera points out the window to a line of storefronts across the street
the lights are on in one building with a sign reading ipc indigenous peoples committee
the fbi agents listen to live audio from the ipc office
rosetta i said mustard on the side
youll have to go back
know what cracks me up about commies
theyre all equality this equality that and theyre all chauvinists
listen to that fucking guy
what they hear however is rosetta scream as a door crashes open
what do you want
things are broken
the video monitors show gordy wrecking the ipc office with a baseball bat
gordy smashes office equipment left and right
ortiz dominguez and rosetta cower as gordy vents his pent up end of the world rage using the bat the way we saw him use a fire axe
gordy approaches ortiz dominguez with the bat
backs him up against a desk
the fbi agents crash in
gordy just stares down at ortiz dominguez
this isnt the way to do things
gordy still doesnt move
these guysre only mouthpieces
then gordy swings the bat
destroys the computer monitor next to ortiz dominguez
gordy tosses the bat aside
to the shaking latin hows that for collateral damage
gordy sits across from phipps
dray is present
ortiz dominguez has agreed not to press charges if you make full restitution
ive already paid
with my family
phipps sees its pointless to insist
to dray take care of it
dray heads out passing mike brandt who enters
gordy this is mike brandt
gordy just looks at him
im very sorry for your loss
i lost people too
mike was in the motorcade that day
hes the chief u
intelligence officer overseeing colombia
dont worry mr
pitt were gonna get the son of a bitch
you know where he is
we believe the wolfs in hiding in an area of colombia controlled by the e
extreme marxist guerrillas
he thinks hes in a safe haven
brandt lets thinks sink in
i know its hard for you right now mr
were all sorry
but why dont you go home
were taking care of things
brandt proffers a business card
heres my card
call me any time
gordy takes it
just sits there a long moment then what kind of twisted people do things like this
brandt and phipps dont have an answer
gordy talks to a latin reporter ernie orosco
you interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details
my family died because of whats going on down there
i want to know all i can
orosco searches for a starting point
then well basically the situation in colombia sucks
as orosco continues
over the course of a week
gordy takes pictures etc
off a wall in his home
he pins up photos of anne and matt at the top of the wall
beneath them he pins up a large map of colombia
the governments been fighting different marxists factions for over thirty five years
for most of that time it was winning
at the new york public library gordy uses microfilm files and computer access to the web to search out information on colombia and the wolf
suddenly the guerrillas began chopping em up
high tech weapons and equipment well trained troops aggressive hit and run tactics all financed by extortion kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers
its big money and they put it to use
gordy pins up various colombia related articles and pictures on the wall including the surveillance camera still of the wolf from the front page of the new york post
the government got scared
in to jump start peace talks it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern colombia
the first communist stronghold on an american continent
gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone
but thereve been few talks and no peace
and the colombian military cant get near the guerrilla zone especially around the town of caguan where the e
kicks ass and takes no prisoners
gordy circles and labels the elc controlled area
and thats where we come in
supposedly to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone
but some well informed people think thats just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves since theyre wrapped around the drug trade
were there were involved
if we stay the only real question is which vietnam war were gonna have
the one some feel we couldve won or the one we lost
gordy watches a documentary about colombia which shows rebels army troops death squads firefights and with atrocities and bodies on both sides
the place is as dangerous as a snakepit
youve got the different guerrilla groups c
colombian military u
military right wing death squads and the only thing theyve all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people
hey im colombian and ill never go back
off gordys packed wall
as gordy closes the front door reveal mike the firefighter whos just come in and now stands staring at the wall clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this must
havent heard from you in a couple days
i can see that
gordys obsessed totally consumed by his project
he points at a picture of heavily armed guerrillas
these assholes kill innocent people all the time in colombia
gordy indicates a newspaper article
thirteen dead in a bus
indicates another a market
twenty seven dead
another a whole family
anne and matt didnt mean shit to them
indicates the wolf or him
mike interrupts trying to divert him to something else
hey we never turned down free beer and rookies buying you believe that
he certified today hes off probation
still looking at wall ronnie couldnt find a fire with both hands
lets go tell him that
gordy doesnt react
more serious now cmon gordo
gordy hears the tone
looks over and meets mikes eyes seeing the genuine concern there
we arent gonna let em drink all the beer are we
tv on in b
gordys with mike sal junior and ronnie
theyve emptied a few pitchers
low on beer ronnie

he gets up and heads for the bar
to gordy ill tell you whatll be great when you get back to work with us
yeah how long is it
week two weeks
shrinks say ten more days
like i said
fucking doorknob they put in temporary command
morgan the guy from right
what a jerkoff
even makes you look good gordo
ronnie yells over from the bar hey gordy the guys look over as the bartender turns up the volume on the tv
we see the presidents national security advisor step up to a podium to give a statement
today at hours eastern daylight time a joint united states colombian strike force launched a full scale assault at a base camp of the army of colombian liberation or e
in southern colombia
the purpose of the mission was to punish the people behind the brutal bombing in new york city ten days ago
we are presently evaluating after action reports from special operations group but feel confident that we have accomplished our mission
cheers throughout the bar
mike quiets them
at this time we believe the man responsible for carrying out the new york bombing the terrorist known as the wolf is among the enemy dead
big cheers now
toasts all around
everyone in the place is happy for gordy who sits there a moment trying to absorb the news then buries his face in his hands
the dalmatian whizzes on the hydrant outside
sal plays chess in the open door with the neighbor kid
ronnie polishes chrome on the truck
gordy holds up the broken remains of his ice cream maker as junior looks on
im gone three weeks and this place falls apart
the temp lieutenant put it out back and art hit it with his truck
calls to gordy were having problems with the portable pump again too
who backed over that
my tools still here
upstairs in your locker
figured you guys wouldve sold my stuff at a yard sale by now
gordy opens his locker
there are old pictures of anne and matt still taped inside
he glances at them quickly then pulls out his tools
mikes channel surfing again
gordy goes by the door carrying his tools and looks in
you ever stay on one channel long enough to hear what theyre saying
whereupon mike lands on cnn
a surprise today and then were on another channel
but gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from mike switches channels back to cnn
we see a cnn anchor with an over the shoulder graphic showing the still of the cop from the consulate surveillance camera with the wolf superimposed
videotape from the terrorist who calls himself the wolf
on screen we now see a homemade video of a masked figure wearing a camo floppy hat and a hunters mesh face mask with a strange smiling face painted on
it in camo earth tones
the wolfs body is hidden shadow the voice digitally altered to a deep bass growl
you thought you killed me
im still here
we see gordys demeanor shift retreating to the obsessive seething hatred he showed before
i swear that for every freedom fighter you killed ten americans will die
and i will pick the time and the place
and i will enjoy it
the wolf slaps his palm for emphasis
the tape ends
mike shakes his head
this guy quaddafi that bin laden
we never get these assholes
off gordy his spark of life suddenly extinguished
the four connected townhouses sit behind gates on a tree lined street in georgetown
a sign reads latin american institute
brandts on the phone
senator the failure of one operation shouldnt cause your committee to question financing everything else were doing down there
donald updegraf brandts number two enters
i know it looks bad and i appreciate your support
together well get it done
hangs up to updegraf without his fathers money that assholed be keeping bees for a living
gordy pitts on the phone
hes called every day
i dont need it
updegraf picks up the phone
brandtll have to get back to you
gordys mood is dark
its not improved by hearing the bullshit in updegrafs reply
tell him not to bother
he slams down the phone
rips up brandts business card
hes alone with his frustration with his rekindled hatred and rage
off gordy glaring at the photo of the wolf on his wall
armed police lead rottweilers through the newly arrived passengers
find gordy in line
he wears jeans polo shirt timberlands carries a backpack
gordy advances to an immigration officer hands over his documents
the agent studies gordys passport
business or pleasure senor
the agent looks up at gordy
looks back at the passport
one moment senor
the agent gets the attention of an immigration superior and the two of them confer out of earshot a moment
the superior looks over at gordy
if you would come with me please
is there a problem
the customs superior closes the door
we know who you are mr
says so right there in my passport
were aware your wife and child were killed in the bombing in new york
off gordys look we have c
then its better for you to visit another country
for your own sake
you giving me a choice
but not about staying in colombia
he opens the door addresses two armed policemen in spanish
turning back to gordy these men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish
he holds out gordys passport
gordy takes it starts out
as he goes
its the wolf youre after yes
gordy stops turns back
he says nothing but the look on his face speaks volumes
then ive just done you a bigger favor than you know
gordy doesnt respond
just turns and goes
gordys flanked by the armed policemen one with a rottweiler
as they walk a pa announcement in spanish is repeated in english
avianco flight to panama city is now open for boarding
avianca flight to panama city is now open for boarding
off gordy having heard the announcement the highway terminates here far short of colombia
the idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and drugs
from this point south lies the darien gap a thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail
a cab with a panama city logo pulls up at roads end
gordy gets out with the panamanian cab driver
the cab driver indicates a panamanian man waiting there with a mm on his hip
my cousin ever
ever and gordy exchange nods
how fars colombia
the cab driver indicates distant mountains
beyond those mountains
the trail is very dangerous but do not worry ever will get you there
you can pay him then
you can pay me now
gordy pulls out his wallet pays the cabbie
the driver gets back inside the cab
out the window que la vaya bien
he drives off
gordy looks to ever
ever smiles motions him to follow then turns south and starts walking
as gordy falls in behind
gordy and ever pass through pristine tropical rain forest
rushing fiercely through the jungle ever uses his machete to cut two lengths of bamboo
he hands one to gordy and indicates how theyll ford the stream
gordy nods then follows evers lead into the perilous belly deep water
they struggle to maintain their balance even with the sticks
when they reach the opposite bank ever signs okay to gordy and smiles
they pass the carcass of a crashed and burned out helicopter when
two dangerous looking men armed with assault rifles step out of nowhere onto the path ahead of gordy and ever
gordy and ever stop
gordy glances at ever
evers focused on the men and clearly doesnt like what he sees
gordy looks back
the armed men advance toward them carefully rifles in the ready position
gordy watches them approach wondering who they are and what theyre going to do
ever frightened takes a half step back then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard and
he smashes it into the base of gordys head knocking gordy out
the men run up
one man covers gordy while ever and the other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets
they take his passport wallet and an nyfd t shirt
and then theyre gone
hovering over gordy as he comes to
as it flies off
feels the bloody lump on his head
it hurts but its not serious
he searches his pockets and backpack realizes the passport and wallet are missing
hes in the jungle
he keeps heading south
gordy trudges on
the thick jungles hot and humid full of strange sounds and shadowy animal movements
gordys going uphill when he rounds a bend in the trail and
he meets a man coming the other way
alarm gives way to the realization that the man is followed by a number of people including women and children
as they pass gordy its apparent theyre refugees from their haunted expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions
gordy addresses the passing people
indicates where hes standing
no one replies
then a small colombian girl comes up and gets his attention
she runs back up the trail a short distance and stops
she draws a line in the dirt
she jumps backward over the line
she does it again
at the sound of a sharp whistle however she runs back quickly passing gordy and rejoining her family
her father hands her a machete and a zippo lighter says something to her
whereupon the little girl returns to gordy and holds the items out to him
gordy takes them
the little girl runs back again and gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend
then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt
looks down at it
crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives and
just as gordy charged into the fire engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way he now steps over the line and advances into colombia
where the rain forest of darien continues in colombia
darkness sets in as gordy follows the trail downhill
at night the jungles even noisier
everything goes quiet
and suddenly automatic weapons begin to pop somewhere
not close but not far either
a few bursts some single shots the call and response of an ambush and then silence
and then the nighttime jungle noises return
as gordy walks on
the sun is already cooking the jungle as gordy reaches a break in the trees sees a small town ahead
gordy has left the trail
he lowers his pants just enough to expose his injured thigh
a bandage covers the wound made by the glass shard
gordy unwraps the bandage revealing
a wad of cash is hidden inside along with a photo of anne and matt
a long livid scar marks the wound
gordy studies the photo of anne and matt a moment then removes some cash from the wad and re wraps the money and photo inside the bandage
gordy heads into the town
one of the colorful wretchedly overcrowded buses that ply colombias back country roads
as the chiva jolts and shudders over the dirt road gordy sleeps
hes an object of some curiosity not only a gringo but a virtual gulliver in comparison to the small statured colombians pressed in around him
a sprawling farm estate deep in the countryside
beyond the hacienda we see a military compound containing tents and three heavily camouflaged helicopter shelters
a recently arrived light observation helicopter loh sits on a chopper pad with its rotors still turning
full of manned hi tech command and control and surveillance equipment
a colombian military operations officer rocha waits with an aide
brandt arrives with updegraf
find your fucking leak
and it could be your fucking leak
all due respect noel its not likely
and we dont need the whole world looking into what were doing down here
we find the son of a bitch again were bypassing protocols
updegraf has had papers handed to him and interrupts check this out
he hands a paper to brandt
brandt reads it
to rocha the man whose wife and son died in new york
one of your units found his passport and credit cards on some gunrunners near panama
gunrunners say they left him alive
what he thinks he can get the wolf himself
we have too much time and too many people invested to have a loose cannon walking around
beat hands papers to rocha throw out the net
have him picked up
just make sure no one kills him
an enormous explosion
gordy bolts awake from the nightmare with a scream
he looks around at the startled faces in the crowded bus unsure where he is for a moment before he gets his bearings
the dream lingers depressing him
an oncoming bus flashes its headlights
as the buses pass the oncoming driver yells to gordys chiva driver
chequeo de papeles
gordys chiva slows to a crawl and the driver calls back
chequeo de papeles
various passengers gather their things and begin to disembark in a hurry
to anyone wholl answer habla ingles
a man in a yankees cap is among the people getting off
he answers in accented english
there is a military checkpoint up the road
they inspect everyones papers
starts to pick up speed again
gordy gets off just in time
to the man in the yankees cap where are all of you going
we walk around
the man heads into the forest
to the man in the yankees cap as they walk none of these people have papers
some have the wrong papers
some have none
the man puts a finger to his lips hushing gordy
theyve come abreast of the checkpoint which can be seen in the distance through the trees
colombian soldiers have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection
the chivas diesel growls loudly
we see figures moving in the forest between the group and the checkpoint
the forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of automatic weapons fire being directed at the soldiers at the checkpoint
in the same instant an rpg takes out a colombian army humvee in a bright fiery explosion
the man pulls gordy down as the group hits the dirt
the gunfire continues
on the ground to gordy guerrilleros
the attack rages furiously for twenty seconds then wanes to sporadic gunfire
other weapons are firing now too clearly the army is finally mounting a defense
we hear the sound of people crashing through the forest
theyre running toward gordy and the group
the crashing gets closer
and now gordy begins to hear the breathless panting of the guerrillas in retreat
boots thud past gordys head
one of the running guerrillas trips over gordy and goes sprawling
the guerrilla wearing the motley uniform of an irregular soldier whips a look back and
gordy finds himself staring into the battle hardened eyes of a fierce young woman
in a heartbeat
the woman jumps back to her feet and joins her comrades laying down a suppressing fire at the soldiers
spent cartridges rain down around gordy as the ak on full auto chops loudly over his head
the guerrillas are gone
the man in the yankees hat hauls gordy up yells vaya
the group is in the greatest danger now caught between the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers who are giving chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them
everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and begins to run
soldiers do notice them and begin to fire
bullets shred the foliage around gordy whipping past his head
he and others keep running
a man goes down when a bullet bites into his leg
gordy slows but the man in yankees cap wont let him stop to help
slams him hard on his back
keeps pushing gordy forward
a few moments later we hear m s on full auto back where they left the man
his trouble is over
the powerful torrent roars through the forest
gordy and the others reach the near bank where the path drops into the water to reappear on the opposite bank
the man in the yankees cap is in the lead
he plunges into the fast water up to his waist
gordy and the rest splash in behind struggling to cross against the swift current
the man in the yankees cap reaches the far bank
takes two steps and
an explosion rips into him
stop mid stream but one of the group a young woman believing the blast was caused by the pursuing military continues struggling to cross
an older man looks sees the blast hole
gordy realizes the old mans saying land mine
to the young woman no
gordy moves to catch her
just manages to stop her as she reaches the far bank
gordy points to where the land mine detonated
slowly the terrified young woman responds to the strong calm tone of command in gordys voice and the unpanicked reassuring look on his face
gordy brings her back to the group which fights to stand in the rushing river
he indicates for them to hold hands for stability
motions for them to stay
leaves the group in the middle of the river
the gunfire is now far off and sporadic
he crosses to the waters edge on the far bank
pulls the zippo from his pack and leans over
uses the flame to illuminate the mud and rock immediately in front of him
scratches lightly at the ground with the machete searching for mines
finds nothing in that spot
and steps onto it
searching the ground and scratching at it with the machete before each step gordy inches toward the man in the yankees cap
three steps from the river
he finds a small round anti personnel mine the size of a hockey puck
he inches past it
moves past another
to the writhing man in the yankees cap dont move
finally gordy reaches him
one of the mans legs is missing below the knee
hes bleeding from various other wounds as well
gordy uses the zippo to inspect the area for more mines
then kneels in a footprint
youll be okay
youll be okay
he takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet around his thigh
by way of distracting him guerrilla bastards
to stop guerrillas
gordy finishes the tourniquet when he sees
has left the group and emerged from the river in a different place to avoid the mines
gordys eyes go to something glistening in front of the young man a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground
the kids about to hit it
gordy shouts no
the young man hears the alarm in gordys voice and stops
but not before he plants his next step and
the trip wire bows against his shin and
gordy ducks covers the man in the yankees cap and
the young man just stands there frozen in position his leg still bowing the line
using the zippo again to light his way gordy advances to the young man
he follows the trip wire to where a coca cola can hangs from a nearby tree
on closer inspection gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade
theres no pin in the grenade
the can keeps the grenades arming spoon in place
the trip wires designed to yank the can off allowing the grenade to explode at chest level
and the cans almost off
gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire
then carefully slides the coke can back over the grenade
when gordy returns the mans dead
off gordy looking down at the ny logo on the cap
gordy sees a sign for a town as the chiva rumbles along
he pulls out his map
gordy finds the town which lies along a river
he traces a road from the town
the road runs south through the town of mompos and eventually reaches caguan the elc capital
a colombian woman is looking over gordys shoulder
no autobusses para este lugar
solamente el barco en el rio
she leans over traces the river which also runs to caguan
the ferrys whistle toots
lines are cast off
two plainclothes federales have been watching the ferry load and now relax their vigil
one man holds a xerox of gordys passport photo
the other bites into an empanada which breaks open and spills its contents down the front of his shirt
his partner finds it funny
and while their attentions occupied
gordy hurries by oblivious to the federales presence and just manages to hop onto the ferry as it pulls away
the ferrys the only means of travel south and its packed
gordy picks his way through
the only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says deerborn
the geek philip armstrong looks like a talker and gordy tries to avoid eye contact
hes too late
hey yo dude heres a seat man
no thats okay but armstrongs already throwing a bag off the bench
i was hoping for someone i could communicate with
he sees gordy hasnt moved
only rooms at the back near the bano and id advise against it unless you like poop
immediately philip armstrong
assiniboia sasketchewan canada
indicates his hat deerborn heavy equipment
hey howya doing
i love germany
i love america
never been to austria
where from in america would that be
new york city
i dont like new york city
buildingsre too big
what kinda work you in
hesitates then coffee
i buy beans
cant drink caffeine
makes my stomach do the rumba
i like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule though
headed upstream eh
youve never been to caguan eh
how do you know
cause no one in their right mind would ever go back
caguans in the guerrilla zone run by the e
as in extra loathsome communists
they dont care and they kill
im going there myself
but i have a get outta jail free card
armstrong doffs his cap undoes a safety pin securing a card inside the crown
shows it to gordy
i can go anywhere i want
by way of explanation everyone needs equipment fixed
armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat
and now his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone if you dont have one of these you dont want to be up there gordy
gordys contemplating the warning when his eyes go to a small sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped deck leaning against his father
gordy reaches over and taps the boy
the boy looks over
shrinks away at the sight of the large gringo
the father notices and looks at gordy who stands indicates his seat
the fathers also apprehensive doesnt move
con mucho gusto
finally the father accepts sits down with the sleepy boy on his lap
nods his thanks at gordy who then gazes down at the son
a kid about matts age
armstrong recognizes the look of a caring dad
got kids eh
off armstrong as gordy walks away
two colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms bearing a distinctive elc patch are walking a trail when the man in front notices something odd
leads the other man back a few steps
looks into the foliage along the trail
something doesnt seem right
he extends his ak
prods a hump of greenery with the rifle butt and in a flash
the greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing face paint and full body military camouflage gear and pointing twin cocked and locked car assault rifles at the heads of the
brandt stubs a butt as a colombian sog group does killer training nearby
updegraf opens the door
to brandt one of rochas infiltration teams just radioed in
we got our big break
gordy stands along the rail looking out at the lush beautiful countryside sliding past
armstrong joins him
that little kid and i had a nice long snooze
were almost to mompos
gazing out beautiful country
it better be
a lotta peoplere dying for it
looks overboard yknow i havent noticed one darn body floating downstream this whole trip have you
gordy doesnt respond
i was thinking
maybe we could travel together into caguan
you could show me around
shakes his head pass is only good for one person if thats your idea which i think it is
besides i cant risk traveling around up there in the company of a big gringo with a dumb ass cover story about coffee beans
gordy looks over
armstrong smiles back
ive got money
ill buy the pass from you
ive worked too hard for it
and you dont have that kind of money on you
ill be getting some life insurance money shaking his head its all cash and carry down here gordy
the ferry whistle toots
you want to have some fun well hook up later
i always schedule a stopover
to sample the local wares and such
winks life can be what you make it here on the frontier
gotta get off the boat anyway
mompos is the last stop
from here into the guerrilla zone you can only travel by panga
if you change your mind ill be at the tropicale later
its a gringo bar
just follow the cockroaches
they see the beginnings of mompos
two x trucks are parked on the riverbank
lean clean cut men in jeans tight shirts cowboy boots and sunglasses lean on the truck and watch the ferry pass
avoid those dudes at all costs
the ferry pulls up to the dock
the dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and amazon indian traders of big wheel suvs and mule carts
theres a definite air of menace
federales are looking for someone
gordy follows armstrongs look to two plain clothes federales one fat and one thin standing near the dock watching the boat pull up
when gordy glances back armstrong is gone
gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers when the fat federale confronts him
gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale backing him up
youll have to come with us
come with us please
he clamps a hand on gordys arm
gordy shakes it off and starts running
almost immediately hes tackled to the ground by the thin federale
two more federales join in
gordys not gonna go down easy though
even as only one against four gordys a formidable challenge
hes strong and hes committed all the way
hes not getting kicked out of this country again
its not a clean or artful fight
theres no karate
its four men trying to tackle a bull and
the bull gets away
gordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit
jukes into a local bar
gordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered courtyard where hes surrounded by ten foot walls
blast through the bar
runs jumps launches off a beer keg and
he reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up
hes looking out across a block long run of corrugated tin roofs
takes off across the roofs each step thundering as
burst into the courtyard
two men hastily build a stack of boxes etc
against the wall
runs as fast as he can across the rooftops when
a section of roof gives way beneath his feet just as
one of the federales finally mounts the wall looks across the rooftops
and gordys gone
lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice beans and coffee
the building is dark and dusty
he lies still and listens
footsteps approach across the tin roof overhead
gordy burrows into the bags of rice pulls them over him
on the roof peers down through the hole
scans the warehouse room below with a mini mag lite
sees the flashlight beam move past
he holds his breath
then the footsteps pass on recede down the roof
and gordy can breathe again
gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier town
a noisy neon lit strip of bars and brothels
everyones packing a gun
a new dodge city where death squad sicarios cruise past in x s blaring salsa
in here the musics loud rock n roll
gringo music for a gringo bar
the place is busy with plenty of local hostesses for the men
even armstrong standing half crocked at the bar is flanked by two scantily clad women
hes got a spoon hanging off his nose
so does one of the girls
armstrongs trying to hang a spoon on the other
gordy slips into the bar
spots armstrong through the crowd
sees armstrongs not wearing his cap when
the girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly revealing shes wearing the cap
its on backwards but now gordy can see the deerborn logo clearly
gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap
its a desperate move but hes got no choice
starts toward the girl when
gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door
the thin federale sees him at the same time
begins moving in on him
gordy moves faster toward the girl
the girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar where its easier to grab and then turns her attention to armstrongs
the thin detective fights through the crowd after gordy
gordys almost to the hat
armstrongs still having trouble with the second girls spoon
i never met a nose i couldnt hang a spoon on
gordy reaches the bar snags the cap
glances back sees the thin federale closing in turns to run out the back when
a strong hand stops him
the hand belongs to the fat federale
and now the thin federales there too wielding a stun gun where gordy can see it
people in the bar fall silent
everyone but armstrong whos finally hung the spoon on the second girls nose
and now armstong also realizes somethings up
turns and sees gordy
sees the cap in gordys hand as the fat federale addresses gordy come along mr
whereupon armstrong shouts drunkenly at gordy police catch you trying to steal my hat you asshole
he staggers toward gordy
grabs the hat
fucking hat thief
armstrong takes a drunken swing at gordy but
instead of hitting gordy armstrong accidentally on purpose clocks the fat detective
then hisses into gordys ear clearly not that drunk get outta here but then armstrongs legs wont work as the thin federale jams the stun gun against his neck and
volts surprise the armstrong neural network
gordy moves against the thin federale in anger when
the fat federale zaps him with another stun gun just behind the ear
and gordy gets to know the floor too
the buildings ancient constructed of wood and adobe
the jail might be old but the cells are secure enough
theyre also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant
gordy and armstrong are led in by the federales
the fat federale has armstrongs hat
he looks it over wondering why gordy wanted it
then decides he could give a fuck and tosses it to armstrong
clangs the cell door shut and locks it
leaves shaking his head
armstrongs still unsteady on his feet and sits down on the metal bunk
that stun gun wasnt cool
armstrong looks down at himself
havent peed my pants in a real long time
beat you shouldnt have helped me
yeah well i guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves
hes come up short
hes going home
so what the hell did you do to land us in here
and dont jerk me around eh
the wolf killed my wife and son in new york
oh youre that guy eh
im sorry man
and what you came down here to even things out
gordy just looks at him
did you even have a plan
go to caguan find the wolf and kill him
armstrong just shakes his head
federales lead in two men the two guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy camouflaged infiltrators
the federales are armed with batons and stun guns taking no chances
its clear the rebels werent brought here without a struggle either both are cut and bruised
the tougher looking of the two has taken a real beating
this beaten man is jammed face first against the bars of gordys cell
he makes eye contact with gordy while the other rebel is unbound and put into a cell
then the beaten man is shoved into the cell
a solid brick wall separates them from gordy and armstrong
armstrongs seen the patches on their uniforms
to gordy sotto beat
armstrong sees the look on gordys face
by way of a warning if you cant kill them dont even talk to them
the guerrillas are murmuring in the other cell
one of them laughs
off gordy listening to the laughing
two or three a
gordys still listening to the murmuring of the rebels on the other side of the wall when
theres a flurry of activity outside the cell area
the door opens
soldiers enter with some federales
gordy watches the soldiers move past his cell
rocha is with them
brandt appears at the bars looks in at gordy
enjoy your trip
gordy stands approaches
we asked you to leave it to us
and you guys still havent got him
its not over yet
the guys next door are in the wolfs elite bodyguard unit
where he goes they go
were gonna ask questions
and were gonna get answers
and youre staying right here till our bombers dead
moments later a tortured scream is heard on the other side of the brick wall waking armstrong with a start
in a field near mompos a canopied truck backs into position
men in guerrilla uniforms with elc patches get out and pull back the canopy revealing mortar tubes pointing skyward on a bed of sand
unit armed with ak s and light anti tank weapons laws infiltrates the town
sets up a single mortar position overlooking the town
one of the men checks his watch
the other man drops a mortar down the tube
go in the tubes on the truck
a water tower the mompos fire station and the towns power supply are direct hits
people react to the sounds of the mortar attack on the town
the lights go out
brandt rocha and their men quickly lock the guerrillas in their cell and head out
as mortars continue to fall on the rest of the town the unit of guerrilla infiltrators open up on the front of the jail with law rockets
the front door and wall of the jail disintegrate under the multiple law attack
brandt rocha and the soldiers approaching the front door inside are hammered by the massive concussion of the blast and flung across the room apparently dead
the powerful concussive shock wave channels into the cell area
gordys slightly protected by a wall
armstrong standing at the bars is thrown into the opposite wall and knocked unconscious
charge inside with aks blazing
surviving soldiers and federales shoot back
the blasts have caused fires in the building
severed wires spark creating more fire
flames begin to spread through the tinder dry structure
the guerrillas take out the soldiers and federales with few casualties to themselves
they make their way toward the cell area
exploding ammo and stored fuel cans accelerate the fire
the guerrillas reach the cells
two men see gordy and draw down on him
the others move to the next cell
guerrillas plant small explosive charges on the hinges of the cell containing their two captured comrades
the hinges blow
the beaten man and the rebel with him are freed and the guerrillas quickly retreat the way they came
gordy sees flames spreading into the cell area
exit the fiery jail past brandt
we see brandts not dead
a truck pulls up
the guerrillas get in
the truck screeches out as
full of sicarios skids onto the street far ahead of the truck
the sicario driving punches it and
roar toward each other
a game of chicken
men in both vehicles open up the sicarios with magnums and uzis the guerrillas with aks
slugs rip through automotive steel
casualties are taken
driving the x receives a round in the forehead cranks over the steering wheel and
does a paris to dakar road rally flip twisting and somersaulting and
the x catapults completely over the guerrillas truck disintegrating into spare parts and dead occupants as
a severely dazed brandt bleeding from the nose and ears slowly gets to his knees crawls out of the burning building and collapses outside
theres fire and smoke everywhere
gordy picks up the metal bunk and slams it against a wall
slams it again
breaks the metal apart
then levers a long side rail in the cell door
the fires licking at him but gordys undeterred
he heaves again and
this time the door gives
gordy picks up armstrongs cap then picks up armstrong whos starting to come around
puts armstrong over his shoulders in a firemans carry
weakly youre not running through the fire eh
close your mouth
because running through the fire is just what gordys gonna do
as he disappears into the flames
the towns in complete chaos
there are fires everywhere
still stunned and bleeding brandt looks from where he lies on the ground as
gordy bursts out of the inferno carrying armstrong
theyre singed and smoking but theyre alive
gordy drops armstrong pats himself and armstrong down knocking out the burning embers on their clothes and hair when
gordys eyes meet brandts
the two men hold the look for a moment
if brandt could speak hed be yelling at gordy to stop not to go on
and gordy knows it
but gordys not stopping
picks up armstrong again and moves off toward the waterfront
theres less chaos here
the fires are in the distance
gordy arrives carrying armstrong
sets him down
ill find a boat to take us upriver
he starts to go
armstrong stops him
i told you
the pass is only good for one person
and youre too dangerous to travel with
gordy reaches over and takes armstrongs cap
he looks inside
theres no pass
it hasnt been there since we landed
gordys at a loss
he tosses the cap back
just looks at armstrong
i was through with this place anyway
he takes off a boot
shakes out some money and the pass
he hands the pass to gordy
ill call ahead and tell felix im not coming and youre my replacement
hell meet you in caguan and take you to the plantation
what do you know about diesel engines
all the fire trucks are diesels
youll have to be austrian eh
they hate americans
names gotta change too in case theyre watching the news
beat itll buy you a little time to look around caguan
but youll never find the wolf
gordy sticks out his hand
my austrian name
armstrong shakes hands with gordy
armstrong doesnt let loose right away
luck got you this far
but up there luck doesnt make it
i hope you know youre gonna die
off gordy about to step over another line
as dawn breaks over the river find gordy sitting in a motored panga being steered by a local boatman
gordy reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of anne and matt
he looks at it for a few moments
then pockets it again
the panga passes a dead body floating downstream
the panga passes revolutionary banners and signs lining the riverbank
la zona guerrillera
the panga rounds a bend and
two souped up bass boats filled with heavily armed elc guerrillas move to intercept it
the boatman slows puts the panga in neutral and keeps his hands in sight
one boat of guerrillas pulls alongside
the other sheers off and stops a short distance away ready to open fire
gordy shows the guerrillas his travel pass
one of them takes it
looks gordy over
then starts to rip the pass in half when
its a big joke
he hands back the pass searches the boat quickly and waves the panga on
off gordys relief as the panga heads on
the panga arrives and gordy gets out
hes met by felix
felix has a mm in a shoulder holster
felix doesnt look the least bit happy
come with me
felix leads him towards a land cruiser
armstrong should have called sooner
we dont like changes here
if i didnt need the equipment fixed id send you back
they reach the land cruiser
but now we have to see the e
supervisor for caguan
its a prospect that seems to concern felix almost as much as gordy
off which as they get into the toyota
the elc supervisor for caguan may be a marxist but the clean well ordered office is nicely appointed with a big screen sony and leather furniture
the tvs tuned to cnn
a photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an elc patch and holding an ak
a brass nameplate reading supervisor rests on a neat desk behind which stands the man himself a hardened former guerrilla fighter proud of his position
hes not in cammies now his uniform now consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat rolex
felix is a subordinate here
he and gordy stand across the desk as the supervisor examines gordys travel pass
gordys nervous about what could appear on the tv in the b
but tries not to show it
your passport was stolen
mompos is a shithole
not like caguan
why didnt armstrong come
he was arrested in ecuador
he got drunk and fooled around with a police officers wife
the supervisor just looks at him assessing gordys face for signs hes lying
gordys expression stays the same
felix respectfully interjects
its almost a plea
in spanish we need to fix the equipment
we have delivery deadlines to meet
a long beat
the elc supervisor hands the travel pass back to gordy
in a hard tone to felix in spanish hes your responsibility
dont let him out of your sight
as felix leads gordy away
gordy and felix pull away from the supervisors h
felix resumes his former tone of command
the supervisor made you my responsibility
you dont go anywhere without me you understand
gordy peers out the window intently as they drive looking for a lucky break looking for the wolf searching the face of every man
he doesnt see the wolf but what he does see surprises him
the elc supervisor was right caguans no mompos
its a third world town armed troops are visible and theres a lot of bad shit behind colombias revolutionaries but here the streets are calm and orderly
its quiet almost eerie as people go about their business
off gordy seeing another side of the guerrillas
felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the plantation
the entrance is guarded by a x rat patrol assault truck and four heavily armed elc guerrillas
guards your coffee beans
felix thinks hes joking
until he looks over and sees gordys actually being sincere
armstrong didnt tell you much
they approach a hacienda and outbuildings
the accoutrements of agriculture are present tractors sheds cats etc
but clearly this is no family farm
there are lots of serious looking men around
more elc guerrillas stand guard
stops the car
he and gordy get out
felix begins leading gordy toward two rows of long open walled sheds
the problems with the diesel generators
the sons of bitches keep breaking down
they pass four very large pits where green leaves steep in a thick foul smelling liquid
were using portables to keep production going but they dont supply enough power to the heat lamps and we have to dry a lot of
theyre now walking between the two rows of sheds where portable gas generators thrum and
gordy can see long wide platforms inside
above the platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps
spread out and drying beneath them is a half acre or two of converted cocaine
workers pack and wrap one kilo bricks of coke for shipment
approach the two giant diesel generators
we can fix anything but these keep dying on us
youll start now
ill have tools brought to you
beat armstrongs a magician with them
lets hope you have his skill
felix walks over to a guerrilla with an ak and speaks to him
whereupon the guerrilla crosses to gordy and takes up a sentry position over him
gordy has the diesels partially dismantled
the guerrilla sentry is still right there
gordy has to think of something fast
he throws a machine part against a wall angrily
i cant work with these pieces of junk
these generators cost a fortune
then treat them that way
beat then armstrong always fixes them
armstrong wants your money
he makes them work but he doesnt fix them
to do this right we gotta order parts from europe
in the meantime i can make something temporary
there must be a machine shop in town
off felix forced to acquiesce
felix is driving
again gordy uses the opportunity to look for the wolf
its a long shot and he knows it
but its all he can do
they pass an empty storefront
a sign on the large front plate glass window says cine and sabado
they pass a bar
felix watches it go by with something like a look of desire
gordy registers the look and the connection to the bar
gordy selects spare parts
a clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper and
gordy realizes his picture is on the paper
he smears grease from his hands over it
gordy finishes loading the parts into the land cruiser
lets get moving
how about you
want to get something to drink
we see the look of desire again
gordys definitely struck a chord
but felix quickly stifles it
we have to get back
ive been working all day out in the sun
i need a drink
nice cold beer
how about it
i saw a bar in town
felix really wants to but still hesitates
with the spare parts ill have the generators running in two hours
we have time for a couple beers
just a beer
theyve had a lot more than two beers
felix has anyway
hes also in love with a waitress on his lap a cute gordita named berta
he pats her
this is mine
this is the reason i come here
playing along si amor
somebody whistles for a drink and berta goes
shes hot isnt she
gordy makes the play hes been contemplating
armstrong said to watch my butt around here
i guess the fucking americans come down and shoot everyone all the time
especially now since the bomb in new york
yeah i heard about it
who did it
felix is just loose enough
the wolf and theyll never catch him
ever see him
beat eyes gordy if you know too much around here it can get you killed
gordys gotten all hell get from felix
he feigns nonchalance smiles
tell me what doesnt get you killed around here
gordy takes a swig of beer
gordy sees the beaten man from the jail in mompos
the man has just walked in with another guerrilla
gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross the room
at the bar the bartender puts out two crates of beer
the guerrillas take the beer and head out
no moneys changed hands
when theyre gone to felix wed better get back huh
checks his watch shit
the two guerrillas are just driving away in a big wheeled high ground clearance suburban as gordy and felix emerge
felix is weaving
gordy keeps his eyes on the suburbans tail lights and opens the land cruisers passenger door for felix
youre too drunk
gordy gets in
felix hands gordy the keys
then slumps against his door and closes his eyes
one day im going to screw berta
gordy starts the car and drives after the suburban
gordy follows the suburban as felix rambles ill take her to a small restaurant
well have lobster and drink lots of wine
ill get her drunk
well drive home
ill carry her inside
ill kiss her
and then ill screw her in my bed
the suburban pulls up next to a house
there are armed guerrilla guards outside
and when i am done screwing her shell never want to look at another man again
gordy drives past the house as the beaten man and the guerrilla with him get out of the suburban and start carrying the beer inside
and a moment later
felix comes around with a start
what the fuck are you doing
he unholsters the mm and points it at gordy
whats the problem
youre going the wrong goddamn way
looks different in the dark
gordy turns the car around
felix keeps the gun on him
you drive where i say
or the supervisor will have us both shot
gordy drives back
they approach the suburban and the house once more
this time its on felix side
felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by and
gordys eyes go to something he couldnt see coming the other way a large propane tank next to the house
the work in the sheds continues
heat lamps dry down the long tables of coke
are more vigilant at night patrolling the grounds with posted teams
illuminate the two big diesel generators as gordy continues his overhaul
he has two sentries now
one wears a combat vest and as gordy works his eyes go to the grenades hanging on the vests front
the suns over the yardarm now blazing hot and gordys still working under the watchful eyes of the guards
nearby a group of guerrillas is playing soccer when
a man is injured and his teammates call for one of gordys guards to substitute
the man in the combat vest responds
the game is shirts and skins and hes joining the skins
puts down his ak strips off his combat vest and shirt and runs in
gordys eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades
with the other guard still watching him closely however theres nothing gordy can do
the soccer game rages back and forth
suddenly an open man gets the ball
breaks toward the goal
gordy sees the player about to go one on one with the goalie
he cheers the action loudly whereupon
gordys guard turns to see whats happening and
gordy grabs a grenade
almost gets it into a tool box when
the player kicks wide the guard looks back and
gordy covers the clattering of the grenades dropping into the tool box by picking up a large wrench
but the grenades still visible as now
felix comes around the corner
hes sleepy and hungover
and pissed by gordys lack of progress
yesterday you said it would only take two more hours
gordy wipes his hands on a rag throws it on the grenade
i have this one ready to go
gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the generator
it sputters but wont catch
felix just looks at him
gordy makes an adjustment and
this time the engine turns over
purrs like new
the heat lamps brighten in a row of sheds
felix winces as the diesel roar makes the hangover hammers in his head pound even harder
what about the other one
i just need another part from town and its five more minutes
gordy grabs the tool box
whyre you bringing the tool box
the old parts in there
i need to match it and its all greasy
felix buys it and heads off
as gordy follows him
they pass the cine in the storefront
the elc supervisors big screen tv is being wheeled in
sees an attractive woman playing with some children
drive past the bar
gordy notices felix doesnt even glance at it
berta working today
we see that whatever this means its an unexpected complication for gordy
gordy chooses the spare part
the clerk wraps the part in newspaper
gordy loads the part into the land cruiser
to felix you as thirsty as i am
felix gets into the land cruiser
gordy climbs in
felix starts driving
gordys down to final straws
we cant stop for one beer
theres beer at the plantation
thinking fast theres no berta at the plantation
i like drinking beer around pretty girls not a bunch of guys with automatic rifles
to hell with berta
last night you were in love with her
theres a beat
felix glances at gordy
decides its safe to confide
i had a dream
i fed her lobster got her drunk and she rejected me for another man
off gordys look dreams tell the future
that wasnt a dream that was the alcohol talking
you saying two men cant go have a beer and look at womens breasts because of pink elephants
nothing makes any sense down here
felix pulls out his
gordy doesnt blink an eye
go ahead and shoot me and you fix the goddamn generator
parts in the back
off felix thinking it all over
a replay of last night
felix is pretty wasted
bertas in his lap again
in spanish you know im your man baby
someone whistles for a drink
berta starts to stand
gordy slips her twenty us dollars to stay
i have to piss
gordy crosses exits into the bano
gordy drops out the bathroom window
gordy gets the grenade from the tool box
he slides it just inside the top of his pants with the spoon hooked over the waistband
he finds some wire
then searches for something else
finds a piece of string and checks its length
from gordys reaction we understand its too short
gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets
he checks the glove box
no long string there either
but he does find two rubber bands
gordy studies them a moment thinking
tests their elasticity
then pulls out the zippo and thumbs it
the lighter still works
as gordy pockets everything and walks off
gordy steals through town hiding when he sees someone coming
hes re tracing the route he took the night before when he followed the beaten mans suburban
he passes the cine in the storefront
a movies beginning to play on the supervisors big screen tv
the place is packed
no one sees gordy who moves on
continues to make his way through caguan when
he rounds a corner and theres a four man elc patrol two in a truck and two out
gordy turns starts heading back when
one of the guerrillas calls to him
the two standing men walk toward him
the other two men get out of the truck to provide backup
one guerrilla approaching gordy stops short and stands off cocked and locked as the other comes up
gordy carefully produces the travel pass
the guerrilla looks it over
in butchered spanish yo trabajo con felix
felix indicates la cantina
the attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the children now walks up holding the hand of a small boy
a guerrilla waves them on
the woman and boy hustle by glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as they pass
they hurry on toward the nearby cine
off gordy as the guerrilla indicates for him to start walking to the truck
the guerrilla patrol has taken gordy to felix still sitting with berta in his lap
are you trying to get us both killed
i went for a walk
i figured you wanted to be alone with berta
to the guerrillas in spanish ill make sure hes on a shorter leash
the patrol leader looks at felix hard
the guerrillas go
felix dumps berta onto her feet stands
felix looks at gordy shakes his head
gordy and felix get in
youre working all night beckmann
that generator gets fixed and youre out of my hair in the morning
felix jams the car in drive
gordy looks down sees the spoon of the grenade exposed
as he readjusts his shirt to cover the spoon
felix is right there supervising for himself as gordy finishes working
he stares hopefully at the machine
then pushes the starter and
the heat lights in the second row of sheds brighten
gordy turns to felix
that make you happy
wheres my money
youll get it in the morning
felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights
the rooms a mess
all kinds of rubbish
theres a washtub sink
theres a cot
this where armstrong stays
this is where you stay
a boat will take you down river at seven
felix closes the door
we hear a lock turning
gordy moves to the door and tries it
its definitely locked
through a small window he can see the lights in the sheds and the ever vigilant nighttime elc sentries patrolling the grounds
the diesels roar in the b
gordy turns back
readjusts the grenade digging into his belly then hooks it back inside his pants
he turns off the light
moves to the adobe wall opposite the door
through another small window he can see its dark in this direction
gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room
we see some rubber tubing
we see some rope
gordy finally finds a piece of sharp metal
he moves to the wall with the window
with the diesels covering the noise gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe
the big wheeled guerrilla suburban drives in
gordy is making slow progress through the wall when he hears the vehicle arrive
he moves to the window by the door and looks out
sees the suburban
four guerrillas are getting out including the beaten man
felix meets them
the beaten man exchanges words with felix
felix indicates gordys room
as the beaten man continues to question felix
gordy realizes hes fucked
he cant get through the wall fast enough
his eyes go to water dripping from a pipe leading to the washtub sink
he moves to it
finds the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap
cranks shut the master valve on the pipe
wraps his hands around the pipe and pulls
jams his feet against the wall for leverage and pulls harder
and this time he yanks the pipe free from the sink
he finds the rubber hose
fits an end over the pipe
quickly lashes it on with some wire
then cranks on the master valve
high pressure water streams from the hose
gordy sneaks a peek out the window
the beaten mans still questioning felix
the sound of the hose water is being covered by the diesels
gordy crosses the room extending the hose to the hole hes made in the wall
he aims the stream at the hole
thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even harder
and watches the jet begin eating away at the old adobe and brick just as it ate through the crumbling plaster in the spanish harlem tenement
the beaten man finishes with felix
felix begins leading the guerrillas toward the storeroom
gordys made progress but hasnt broken through yet
and he wont not in enough time
under his breath come on baby
come on baby
and just then
wham wham wham one of the diesels gordy repaired suffers a spectacularly loud internal breakdown
the heat lights dim in a row of sheds
felix and the guerrillas stop to see whats happening
at which point the generator now bursts into flames
just in time
and we realize that hed planned on the diversion as
the water jet breaks through
the holes still small
gordy begins to widen it
felix the beaten man and the other guerrillas resume their march toward the storeroom
they reach the storeroom
waters pouring out under the door
felix unlocks the door and opens it to find
the beaten man signals two men to go out the hole
to the other man in spanish organize the others
the man goes
outside we hear him shout orders to the guerrillas guarding the plantation
the beaten man turns to felix
felix is terrified
in a pleading tone in spanish he cant be far
youll catch bang
the beaten man shoots felix in the head
off felix dead his blood mixing with the water still streaming across the floor
the guerrillas report to the beaten man
they cant find gordy
to the men guarding the plantation in spanish keep looking
he signals his men to come with him
they get into the suburban
whereupon we find
gordys hanging onto the chassis
with the large tires and high ground clearance theres just enough room to get his legs over the rear axle
hes just finishing rigging up a rope he took from the store room the ropes slung from one side of the chassis to the other to support gordys back
he hears the engine start grabs the transfer case and
roars off with gordy suspended below
the rear drive shaft whirs madly inches from gordys face
and with each bump in the road even with heavy duty off road shocks and springs the undercarriage of the suburban comes within inches of crushing gordys legs
rocks are pinging everywhere
the dirt and the dust are choking
even for a short distance its going to be a long dangerous ride
as the truck blasts down back roads and through the darkened town
continues to suffer underneath
even with the rope supporting him he has to hold on with two hands
a vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade
it starts to slip free
gordy cant stop it without letting go
the grenade falls and
gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it
the spoon just hanging on the end of his fingertips
gordy cant use his other hand to get it
he needs the hand to hold onto the car
the grenade begins to slip
hes going to lose it
and just as it falls
gordy does the only thing left
he slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin
just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road
carefully slowly praying that each bump doesnt jar the grenade off the pin with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
case gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach where he gets a better grip
jams the grenade back
then grabs onto the undercarriage once more in time to relieve the muscle tearing strain on his arm
the suburban passes the cine
the movies over just letting out
the suburban pulls up to the well guarded house gordy saw the night before
the men get out and go inside leaving the suburban running clearly planning to leave again right away
carefully lowers himself to the ground
slides out on the side away from the house
hides behind a large wheel
the brightly lit house is surrounded by coconut trees
gordy watches the guards
when the guards arent looking he runs to the nearest tree
the sounds of the suburbans engine covers his footsteps
gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards arent looking when he reaches one tree and
a coconut hits the ground next to him and
one of the guards comes to investigate
the guard gets closer
gordy inches around the tree
he cant get away without being seen
he nudges the coconut with his toe
nudges it harder causing it slowly to roll away and
the guard picks it up
never sees gordy in the shadow of the tree pressed against the trunk
the guard shows the coconut to a guard near the house then walks back
sneaks to another tree
then reaches the house
he moves to a window
peers into a room
no ones there
but we hear the sound of voices
gordy creeps along the wall
looks into another room and
is a group of elc guerrillas including the beaten man packing suitcases etc
leaving in a hurry
scans the faces
except for the beaten man no face is familiar
a man with his back to us stands and theres nothing familiar about him either
directly in front of us another man emerges from a room
hes also in elc guerrilla camo
off gordy looking intently at the man
the face of the cop outside the consulate
in the room
his face looms larger as he advances towards us
when he bumped into gordy on e
in the room
its the same face
hes found the wolf when
suddenly a guard appears and
eases into the shadows
his dirty face and clothes blend in just enough
the guard moves past
when the coast is clear gordy moves to the large propane tank
he takes out the grenade
puts the rubber bands around it spoon and all
grips the grenade in his hand holding the spoon down and yanks the pin
slowly slowly gordy begins releasing his grip allowing the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring loaded spoon
if theyll do it
if the spoon goes now gordys going up in the blast
gordy continues to relax his grip
the rubber bands stretch
keep stretching until theyre barely holding the spoon
but theyre holding it
gordy quickly carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank
then takes out the zippo pulls it apart and removes the lighter fluid soaked cotton
holds the cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his fingers
lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands
gordy squeezes out as much as he can onto them
then gordy gets the hell out of there
he finds cover
the lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands
gordy suddenly hears a womans gentle singing
he looks in the direction of the sound and
gordy sees the attractive woman and the boy approaching on the road
shes singing a gentle song in spanish
gordys eyes flash with alarm
he glances at the house
the lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and stretch from the pressure of the spoon
gordy looks back at the woman and boy closer now walking toward the house
anne and matt wave to him across madison avenue
gordy sees the woman pull the boy close to her lovingly
the bomb explodes and anne moves to protect matt
he realizes the horror of what will happen
gordy bursts from his hiding place
the woman and boy look over in alarm see gordy running toward them and yelling
the rubber bands are about to break
the woman sees gordy
screams toward the house claudio
see gordy running
they open fire
pile out of the house
gordys too close to the woman and boy now
reaches the woman and boy now
pulls them down
covers them protectively with his body when
a gigantic explosion lights up the night and utterly destroys the house
rains down for what seems like forever
dust fills the air
opens his eyes
gets to his hands and knees
sees the woman and boy are safe when
a vicious kick in the ribs lifts gordy off the ground rolling him away from the woman and child
the wolfs alive and unhurt
angrily punts gordy again
you think you can kill the wolf
a boot in the face this time
you think you can kill the wolf
a piece of paper has fallen from one of gordys pockets and fluttered to the ground nearby
the woman picks it up and we see
its the photo of anne and matt
the woman stares at the photo a moment as
gordy absorbs another blow
he tries to stand
you killed my wife and son whack
the wolf slams the butt of an ak against gordys skull
gordy drops hard
the wolf reverses the ak
points it at gordys head about to pull the trigger when
the woman lays a hand on the wolfs arm
the wolf doesnt take his eyes off gordy
the woman squeezes his arm
implores him claudio
the wolf glances over
meets her eyes a moment
sees the photo in her hand
glances up into her eyes again
they hold the look
a whole conversation exchanged without words
then the wolf turns back to gordy lying in a pile on the ground
to gordy you were just saved by your guardian angel
dark and dank
excavated clay walls and floor
a bare overhead bulb provides some light
gordy lies on a metal bed frame
one of his legs is chained to the bed
hes in pain from being kicked but the physical aches are nothing compared to the anguish he feels for having failed
the doors unlocked and opens
daylight streams in from above as the wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards
he moves to the middle of the room
looks at gordy
one of the men in the jail with you in mompos is dying
he was burned in your explosion
gordy just looks at him
the wolf signals a bodyguard who crosses to gordy and frees his leg from the chain
you want to kill me
come and kill me
the bodyguards are smiling
gordy hesitates then springs for the wolf and
the wolf immediately fells him with a choppy looking karate combination
the wolfs no jet li his styles a throwback even ugly but its well practiced and brutally effective
even still gordy springs back right away
and the wolf drops him again
you americans think you have all the answers
and really youre so naive
gordy comes up swinging
gordys a barroom fighter
if he can touch you youre in trouble
he never gets close
a vicious front kick folds him and a fist drives him to the floor
the wolf stands over him
you see one peasant with a gun and you never ask why he has to have it
you just run to give your billions to the nearest soldiers no matter how merciless or corrupt they are
the last kick really hurt gordy
hes slow rising
thats why im teaching america a lesson
thats why therell be more bombs
and more families like yours will pay the price
the wolf wants to pique him but this is pouring gasoline onto fire
gordy explodes off the ground
the suddenness and fury of the rush catch the wolf off guard
gordy drives him backward
slams him against a wall
then hooks an arm around the back of the wolfs neck and drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen
all his weight behind the punches
trying to break ribs and crush them into the wolfs heart when
a bodyguard slams the butt of an ak into gordys kidneys
gordy takes the blow standing
the guard delivers a second much harder shot and gordy drops to his knees in agony
the wolf recovers from the hammer blows to his midsection
he makes gordy pay for the punches
lands blow after blow on gordys face
beats the living shit out of him
and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor
we hear a gentle clacking sound
the black becomes a blur
the blur becomes a hazy glimpse of selena
shes sitting on the metal bed frame nursing gordys wounds
the clacking sound continues its made by sea shells that dangle from a bracelet on selenas wrist
the shells knock together as she washes gordys wounds
are you alright
gordys still in a deep fog from the beating barely there at all
who are you
my name is selena
the sea shells clack
gordy loses consciousness again and everything goes
the clacking sound continues
this time when gordy opens his eyes theres no blurriness
its a new day
selenas walking to him with a tray
the shell bracelet clacks as she approaches
i brought you food
gordy slowly sits up
why feed me
why not just kill me
are you so anxious to die
gordy doesnt have an answer
he tastes the meal
selena watches him a moment troubled by something
the men in jail with you in mompos
they say you talked to a man from the c
im not one of them
im here for my own reasons
selena watches him another moment
decides hes telling the truth
she reaches into a skirt pocket then extends her hand toward gordy
he looks up
shes holding the photo of anne and matt
gordy takes the photo
looks at his wife and son
selena sits next to him
then off the photo
claudio used to be a teacher
i was a medical aid worker
we met in guatemala in an indian village called guamaunco
we were married there
sophia our daughter was born there
claudio was kind and loving and we were happy
we were there four years when the civil war broke out
the guerrillas were all around us but left us alone
then they made an attack on the army nearby
the next night soldiers came to our village
they were led by american advisors
they accused us of helping the rebels
our women were raped
our men were tortured
our homes were burned
we crawled out into the fields but they threw grenades and sophia
selena hesitates choking back her emotions
my baby girl was hit by shrapnel
she bled to death in claudios arms
she looks into gordys eyes
the look says she understands and shares gordys pain because shes suffered her own painful loss
she looks away again
claudio joined the guerrillas
when that war ended we moved to the next war and the next
each fight has only deepened his hatred
and poisoned his soul
beat hes unable to love anything anymore
why are you still here
because i know he was a good man whos been consumed by rage because of what he lost
just like you
im not like him
he kills innocent people
then hes planning to kill more
selena suddenly stands uncomfortable not wanting to discuss it
she goes to the door and knocks
off gordy as the door opens and selena exits
a laser pointer indicates the photo
this is a satellite shot of the caguan region last night
the laser indicates an area of the photo
heres caguan town
follow the laser to the same night shot with a bright spot in the town area
at we get a large heat and light anomaly consistent with an explosion
follow the laser to a high resolution infrared enlargement
this is the explosive area two minutes later
we got a house blown to shit and burning
we got colombians in cammies a gringo down a woman and kid and some bodies
this guy the laser indicates the wolf
is giving all the orders
i dont fucking believe it
that lucky son of a bitch found the wolf
hes paying for it now
follow the laser to an infrared shot of people and vehicles near the burning house
a little later an e
convoy arrives and everyone loads up
the convoy travels thirty two minutes upriver and stops here
follow the laser to an infrared night shot of parked vehicles buildings people etc
more like a small village
its mobile and its not just guerrillas its women and kids too
here it is by day
follow the laser to a day shot of the jungle village
the laser indicates houses barracks school for the kids cooking sheds h
latrines gun pits
theyre not just hiding the wolf
here it is on the map
pull back to reveal updegraf highlights a map for brandt who thinks aloud its well sited
cant surprise em so you gotta outgun em
beat so thats what were gonna do
were gonna hit it
were not just gonna hit it were gonna wipe if off the globe
cats rats dogs and mice
if its moving its dead
hitting the whole village could make for a p
i dont care what the puerto ricans say
then off updegrafs look which part of the word war dont you understand
our mission down here isnt just about catching the wolf
what about gordy pitt
he was told not to be here
the first choppersll hit it at
its raining buckets
most of the people inhabiting the village have been driven under roofs or indoors
guerrillas drag gordy roughly up out of the bunker into the tropical downpour
they march him out into the open
throw him to the ground
a man draws his pistol as gordy gets to his hands and knees
the guerrilla puts the pistol to gordys forehead
its time gringo
he extends a bar of soap with his other hand
you stink gringo
the guerrillas laugh
gordy throws the soap in the mud
gets to his feet
points his face up into the soothing rain
when he hears arguing and looks over to see
are inside a small house nearby obviously fighting about something
selena emphasizes her argument by slapping her hand
the wolf storms off and we hear a door slam
selena is left alone disconsolate framed in the window
she looks up and sees gordy outside
her eyes meet his
off their look
its pouring here too
assault preparations are underway in spite of the rain
brandt checks his watch
then lights another butt from the one he just smoked
stares off into the distance his thoughts intense and far away
updegraf emerges crosses
the weather systems intensifying
distracted beat what
the storms gonna be real bad for at least twelve hours
heres the data
he hands a paper to brandt
cops a puff off brandts cigarette while brandt reads
air ops says its too heavy for the blackhawks
also sat intel is saying the cloudsre too thick and were blind
beat pissed got any good news
the creeks are rivers around caguan
unless the wolfs a fish hes not moving
and theres fresh coffee
only good thing down here
put everyone on red till tomorrow night
and then i dont care if theres a typhoon i want those fucking rotors turning
brandt crumples the fax and pitches it
then sees he got fax ink on his hands
off brandt holding his mitts out in the rain trying to wash off the stains
selena brings gordy food
shes extremely subdued
leaves the tray and starts back to the door
turns back to gordy
i tried to stop him
she holds gordys eyes a moment
her look is grim haunted
hes gone back
beat realizes the united states
she doesnt answer
where in washington
he had pictures of a building
i dont know
we cant let it happen
its too late
no one can stop him now
wed never make it
i got down here from new york
she just looks at him weighing her chances
how many more kids have to die
and for what
im his wife
if you dont stop it youre as much to blame as he is
she moves to the door and knocks
the door opens
off gordy sagging
passengers are lined up to board a flight to mexico city
find a man in line wearing a crisp business suit and tie
the clothes a haircut and horn rims have made the wolf nearly unrecognizable
the fronts moved through
the night is clear
water drips from jungle leaves and the eaves of buildings
we see the bustling life of the place the families the women and children who live with and support the well organized and high tech guerrilla military
the village is simple but decidedly not primitive
these people have generators a satellite dish and a school with a computer
at night the school is a tv room
right now on the tube daffys getting his beak blown off
pets his child and kisses his wife as he goes off to guard duty
talks on satellite phone inside camp headquarters
sits next to selena on the porch of a house
he plays with the shells of her bracelet as she stares off into the night
the blackhawks black and menacing sit on an illuminated tarmac as heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests load up
door gunners check mini guns
ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods
a co pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward mini gun wherever he looks the gun points
pilots finish checklists and
chopper engines start whining
rotors begin to turn
the noise mounts to an incredible roar
the small helicopters rotors are also turning
brandt stands at the chopper door with updegraf
slams the magazine on a glock
making sure its in solid then slides the pistol into his shoulder holster
he checks his watch
loud to updegraf its time to make the wolf howl
he takes a last drag on his cigarette passes the butt to updegraf to finish and gets in the rear of the l
as updegraf scoots clear
throttles up and screams away
one by one in quick succession lift off the deck and follow the l
into the night sky
gordys on the bed
the guard lets selena in
she crosses toward the food tray near gordy
but shes not there for the tray
moves past it to gordys leg and to gordys surprise begins unlocking the shackle
were going with you
when gordys free how do we get out
she hands gordy a length of pipe secreted in her dress
the guard is the only one close
when were past him we can slip into the jungle
mauros waiting for us there
the blackhawks and l
fly map of the earth a few feet over triple canopy rain forest
brandts in the rear seat wearing a headset
pilot wearing night vision goggles checks his gps speaks to brandt via headset lead chops are twenty seconds out
selena whispers to gordy at the door
hes on the right
no needless killing
gordy moves to the right side of the door
the door swings inward to the left
selena exits with the tray
the guard reaches to close the door and gordy brings the pipe down hard on his head knocking him out
gordy retrieves the guards ak
gordy and selena ascend the bunker steps
they stop at the top and peer into the village
an armed guerrilla approaches unaware of their presence
gordy fumbles with the ak looking for the safety switch on the strange weapon
selena reaches over and expertly flicks it off
they hear the sound of the choppers
the guerrilla approaching them stops and looks up
the first wave of blackhawks flashes over the village
selena and gordy barely have time to duck as rockets explode into ground targets and front and door mini guns spit bullet streams that rip through people and structures
and then the first waves past
in the momentary lull after the first wave guerrillas run to pre arranged fighting positions
women and children are screaming
pulls gordy from the steps
they start to run
but not far
just seconds after the first wave of blackhawks has left the second wave hits
the village and all its details are visible as different shades of green
we see rockets streak toward parked guerrilla vehicles
we see rockets trail fire toward the tv in the school which is then obliterated in a fiery explosion
wherever the co pilot looks the forward mini gun aims its hellish rain of bullets
we track with a running guerrilla and see him chopped down then swivel to a gun pit and watch the men there eat lead
he sees the burning school
watches the continuing slaughter caused by the rockets and mini guns
circling over the action
brandt listens to radio chatter from the blackhawks
the village is being decimated
brandts dream come true
he launches a shoulder fired surface to air missile sam at the l
just before a mini gun gets him
the pilot sees the sam launch
he hits a button and
two thermite parachute flares shoot from rocket tubes and ignite
immediately after the l
the sam zips past the hot bright flares
the second waves gone
gordy and selena start to run again
the screamings endless
gordy almost trips over the burned body of a child
blasts in over the treetops
these are the blackhawks carrying the assault troops
they use a skid n git maneuver to insert the men coming in hot mini guns blazing barely touching down as the soldiers spill out then tipping forward to gain
speed and quick peeling out in a hard right turn
gordy and selena hit the dirt again as the choppers come in and land the troops and the ground battle erupts
the assault teams ground commander an american army captain radios his men via comm link were going for body count
theres a break in the fighting nearest them
they jump up and start running for the trees edging the compound
gordy and selena sprout from the ground and run
the bullets twitch the smoke around them
a slug plucks the ak from gordys hand
theyre almost to the trees
gordy and selena are in his sights
theyll never make the trees
the soldiers head whips around to face a guerrilla firing at him
he kills the guerrilla
then looks back at gordy and selena and
into his comm link two in the jungle
sounds of gunfire
explosions in the compound flicker light through the dense foliage
selena leads gordy to a bush and pulls back leaves revealing mauro cowering fearfully clutching an old leather doll to his chest
selena takes mauros hand grabs a small pack lying next to him then leads gordy off through the jungle
he searches the jungle
up ahead selena mauro and gordy are visible for a split second when they run through a gap between in the foliage
the soldier moves after them
selena mauro and gordy reach the fast flowing water
we have to swim
gordy spies two empty fuel cans nearby
he gets the cans throws them in
then picks up mauro
selena jumps in
gordy and mauro follow
they swim for the fuel cans
gordy with mauro clinging to his neck and still clutching the doll gets an arm over one can
selena just manages to grab the other
he reaches the river
sees gordy mauro and selena bobbing downstream hanging onto the cans
bullets whip the water around gordy mauro and selena
they hide behind the cans
bullets ping off the metal
theyre swept through some rocks blocking them from the soldier who fires anyway
bullets chip the stone
theres one more clear shot after the rocks
theyre almost around a bend
the soldier aims
gordy looks over calls
selena endures the pain
hides it behind iron eyes
your hired soldiers cant shoot
the village is a silent smoking ruin
everyone who lived there is dead
troops check the faces of the bodies of the men against the freeze frame of the wolf outside the colombian consulate in new york
brandts met by the ground commander
no sign of the wolf
two people possibly a third got away
theyre in the river
brandt moves back to the l
a moment later the choppers up and away
gordy mauro and selena are still floating hanging onto the cans when they hear the sound of a helicopter
gordy looks sees the l
flying downstream ten feet off the river
under the water
to mauro uno dos tres
he takes a big breath and holds it
mauro understands and does the same
they go under
so does selena
the pilot scans the river with his night vision goggles
brandt studies the night vision monitor in front of him
theres nothing but river
they zoom by the two fuel cans but see nothing
gordy mauro and selena surface gasping for air
the chopper rounds a bend in the river
and there are the two armed guerrilla customs boats
the boats open up and the l
pilot banks away
sweeps back in on the customs boats
rockets launch from the pods
one customs boat goes up in a massive explosion
the other boat scoots
the pilot sees the second boat go
he sweeps in again
triggers more missiles
we watch the second customs boat go the way of the first
brandt only cares about the primary target
they couldnt have made it this far
go back upstream
as the chopper banks
gordy hears the l
the three of them duck again and
the chopper zips by just overhead
and continues on
a moment later gordy mauro and selena re surface
off them as the copper recedes upriver
gordy and selena float side by side still holding onto the cans
mauros asleep on gordys back his arms around gordys neck
weakened by her wound selena keeps bobbing below the surface
gordy pulls her up
we just have to keep floating a little bit more
suddenly in the growing light gordy sees selenas blood in the water and realizes shes wounded
you were shot
we gotta get you outta the river
kicks them all to shore
he climbs out of the river carrying mauro
as gordy ascends the bank mauro wakes up terrified
gordy tries to soothe him
but mauro squirms free and immediately mauro runs back to his mother
selena uses sign language to tell him everythings okay
off gordys surprised look he cant hear or speak
gordy just looks at them a moment
then moves to selena
re mauro as gordy examines her arm hes a war orphan
i adopted him
gordy finishes checking the bullet wound
he uses part of his shirt to make a pressure bandage
as he ties it around selenas arm she looks around
i know where we are
theres a secret trail nearby that leads toward mompos
can you walk
its just my arm
gordy admires this womans bravery
mauros clutching her skirt
gordy looks at him
how do you say hello
selena looks at gordy a moment
she signs hello for him her seashells clacking as she does it
gordy taps mauro to get his attention
tries out the sign for hello
the boy just looks at him
then reaches out and takes gordys hand shows him the correct way to do it
gordy tries again
mauro nods yes and smiles
gordy smiles back
selena mauro and gordy follow the secret trail which ends below a large waterfall
gordy wonders what they do now when selena keeps walking suddenly disappears behind the roaring cascade
the trail continues curtained by the falls
gordy joins selena and mauro
mauros excited by the experience of being inside the waterfall
gordy holds him lets him touch the sheet of water flowing past
they walk to the other side of the waterfall
gordy follows selena and mauro through
gordy emerges from the waterfall and
hes surrounded by colombian soldiers with guns
more soldiers point guns at selena and mauro
gordy raises his arms
yo soy americano
claudio the wolf rides into the capital from dulles
a blackhawk lands in the clearing
the colombian soldiers escort gordy selena and mauro to the chopper
the chopper door opens
everyones aboard and buckled in
the chopper lifts off
selenas glaring at brandt who pushes a headset at her shouts over the engine whine f
s on the radio
tell em everything you know
gordys her protector intervenes
grabs brandts arm
they both get asylum
and she needs a medic
on the plane
what about the asylum
beat theyll get it
but shes in my custody till were done with her
gordy hates going along with brandt but has no choice nods to selena
she takes the headset
as she puts it on brandt sees her pack
takes it and opens it
he inspects it then hands it back
gordy glares at him
brandt meets his eyes
a long beat
then he wasnt even there
brandt doesnt reply
just holds the look a moment longer
then looks out the window and ignores gordy
the daily tide of humanity flows through the railway terminal
we see people in business suits tourists families a group of kids on a field trip
and standing in the middle of it all we find
now in casual clothes
hes looking over the beautiful and busy station
contemplating the devastation and death that a bomb planted here would wreak
a lear stops by a convoy of black government suburbans parked on the tarmac
fbi agents joe phipps and reggie dray are among those waiting by the cars
the lears door pops and gordy carrying a sleeping mauro emerges with selena
brandt and a medic follow
mauro still sleeping is buckled up in the far back seat between gordy and selena
phipps dray and brandt crowd the second row
phipps extends photos to selena
these buildings best match what you described to us
selena leafs through the photos of various washington monuments government buildings etc
she reaches the last photo
i dont recognize anything
i saw only parts of the building
phipps wants to keep her positive and willing
well keep trying
i think its a public place
he said he wanted the people of america to feel the terror
terror is all they understand
he said it over and over
to dray double up on public venues museums theaters transport
put in all the extra undercover we can
selena looks over at her son sleeping in gordys arms
she lovingly brushes the hair off his forehead rattling her seashells
the leather doll is about to fall from mauros fingers
selena takes the doll and puts it into her bag
then looks out at the passing scenery
off selena in the land of her husbands enemy the convoy slows outside the latin american institute
an attached garage opens
as the suburban turns into the garage
wherere we going
inter agency headquarters for our efforts in latin america
its secure and we can coordinate all departments here
off which as theyre swallowed up by the dark garage brandt phipps dray selena and gordy along with the rest of the entourage walk through the interagency nerve center
gordy carries mauro still asleep
they stop at the door to a large conference room
selenas ushered in
gordy starts to follow
phipps stops him
my people will debrief you in another room
well take the boy to a safe house across the street
hell be well cared for
gordy exchanges a look with selena
she nods her reluctant approval
gordy hands the boy to an agent
claudio opens the door of a cheap rental garage in an old commercial strip
he steps inside
theres a rental van and a big ducati motorbike against a wall
claudio straps a black bag onto the bike then rolls it out and shuts the garage
pulls on helmet and starts the bike
as claudio speeds into traffic selena is seated at a table covered with photographs washington d
coffee table books guide books etc
brandt phipps et al stand around her
phipps flips through the pages of a large coffee table book for selena to see
that books done
he grabs another
opens it to the first photo
a small conference room devoted to everything having to do with the interagency interest in the wolf
photos of evidence time lines charts etc
cover the walls
gordys tired being debriefed by two fbi agents
did claudio leave with anyone else
i was underground
i couldnt see anything
did you hear anything about his contacts in the united states
security tightens all over the city
among the images we see a forklift places huge planters really decorative barricades to re route traffic near vital buildings
with earpieces patrol public structures
some lead dogs that sniff for explosives
claudio weaves the ducati through heavy traffic
phipps flips to the last photo in the book
he reaches for another book
as he does he topples a stack
selenas eyes fix on one book cover
he had that book
let me see it
phipps hands it to her
its a guidebook to washington
selena flips through it
stops at a photo
its of the redesigned lobby of union station
selena glances up
to dray put it under total surveillance
get a bomb team in there with dogs
make em seeing eye dogs if you have to
and pull whatever security video they have for the last two days
why not just shut it down
if we spook him we dont know what his secondary targetll be
dray gets on the horn
to brandt and phipps please dont kill him
a man sits on a bench
hes wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap
he puts a shoulder bag on the bench takes something out then gets up and walks away when
suddenly two tourists and a hot dog vendor are right on him
one of em jams a concealed gun jammed into his ribs while the other two hustle him forcefully to a van
hes shoved inside
his bags tossed in
the van drives away
agents press the man hard to the floorboards
his bags tossed
the guys clean
its not claudio
off the agents holding an innocent man
selena watches as phipps plays a surveillance video of union station
phipps suddenly freezes the image
zooms in on a man in the middle of the crowd
thats him isnt it
hesitates then yes
he was there yesterday
just stood there and left
so far the dogs havent found anything so maybe were ahead of him
whats he waiting for
he takes his time
like he told you he enjoys it
selenas overwhelmed by the experience of seeing her husband on the tape by her betrayal of him
she grows queasy
leans on the table for support
are you okay
i think im going to be sick
brandt opens a door to a bathroom
selena grabs her pack and rushes in
when the doors closed phipps turns to dray indicates monitor
get copies of this freeze frame to all the undercover people and the sniper teams
you got it
and nobody caps him until we get that bomb tagged
after that i dont give a shit what happens to him
theres a long beat
brandt looks at the freeze frame
he always hid his face
whys he giving us a clear picture now
the bathroom toilet flushes
i think id feel better if i could rest a little and see my son
phipps nods to brandt who turns to two of his agents one a female
gordys on his feet looking at the wolf evidence etc
on the walls
he cant keep his eyes off it
its reminiscent of what he constructed on his wall at home
the second agents not in the room
lets go through it again mr
ive told you all i know
we gotta be sure
gordys eyes go to numbered evidence photo
its a picture of a seashell
he points to it
whats the number on it
the agent refers to an index sheet as the second agent returns
hes holding a document
to gordy mr
pitt you said selena told you she had a daughter
she was killed in guatemala
according to tests on the blood we drew on the plane selenas rhesus f six
shes genetically barren
she couldnt possibly have had kids
gordy doesnt understand
why would she have lied
the first agent finds what hes looking for in the index
number eleven small seashell with a hole in it
that was found in the getaway car used in the bombing in new york
off gordys face
theres a gap where one of the shells is missing
gordy blasts through the building
as he runs
selena expertly flicks the safety off on the ak
phipps addresses gordy
we think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone
did you see a cell phone when you ran into him
selena and claudio argue inside the house
selena slaps the back of one hand into the palm of the other
the wolf does the same hand slap
selena emerges with the two cia agents
claudio sits on his parked motorcycle
he sees selena emerge
drops his helmet visor and starts the bike
gordy bursts in sees selenas not there
she went to see her son
shes the wolf
gordy runs out
phipps and others follow
brandt bursts in
finds mauros leather doll behind the toilet
the heads detached
brandt looks inside and
we see a block of reddish semtex plastic explosive and a chemical fuse
clear this floor
gordy jumps downstairs four steps at a time
institute personnel evacuate offices
selena and the agents cross the street toward the safe house
claudio guns the bike toward them
selena hears the bike
sees claudio coming
uses the front edge of her hand to strike the female agent hard in the throat
the agent falls to her knees trying to suck air through a crushed windpipe
selena whip kicks the other agent to the ground
claudio brakes hard next to selena who takes the female agents pistol and spare magazines as
bursts outside followed by phipps et al
claudio opens fire with a machine pistol hitting two agents and scattering gordy phipps and the rest
selena shoots the two escort people dead then blasts away at the other people pouring out of the institute as she straddles the ducati behind claudio and the powerful bike
screams off down the street
gordy jumps to his feet and runs after them
a massive explosion spits flame out of the windows of the buildings top floor
dive for cover
debris showers the street
runs one way in the direction the ducatis headed
far down the block the bike turns right onto another one way street
spots an alley on his right and turns into it
gordys now moving parallel to claudio and selena sprinting hard toward another one way street which crosses the alley ahead
he doesnt know if hell intercept the bike but its his only shot
claudio guns the bike down the second street parallel to gordys alley
he and selena reach an intersection with the one way street
a right turn will complete the u and take them back toward gordy
straight ahead the street theyre on is one way in the opposite direction
claudio hangs right and cranks on the speed
gordys almost to the next street
he can hear the whine of the ducati growing closer
a truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley
gordy veers into a walkway between buildings
a parked car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding ducati
claudio cant swerve around it
slams on the brakes
the cars driver frightened and flustered by the near collision is slow moving out of the way
gordy bursts through a gate
sees back steps leading to the open door of a second story over a garage and charges the steps
the driver of the car finally backs up
claudio aims the ducati through a narrow gap and zooms on
gordy blows into the second story of the garage a converted old time carriage barn
hes in the old hayloft
on the opposite side of the loft a double door built for loading in hay is open above the street
gordy sprints for the opening and
the ducati tears around traffic when
gordy leaps out of the hayloft launches himself off a parked car as the ducati screams past and
he just manages to grab selena and yank her off the bike
selenas arms are wrapped around claudio when gordy rips her out of the saddle claudio goes too
the three of them tumble to the ground as the speeding ducati spins flips and disintegrates
in leathers and a helmet
he takes the fall better than selena
gets to his feet
looks for the guns they dropped
before claudio can get to a gun gordys on him
gordy pounds claudio hard
side kicks gordy
she front kicks a heel into his spine and between his shoulder blades
gordy lets go of claudio and drops
selenas relentless kicks gordy repeatedly as
gets the pistol
aims the gun two handed at gordys head and bang
shoots claudio dead from the mouth of the alleyway down the block
the first shot cracks the back of claudios helmet
the second shot punches through and exits his visor in a bright red mist of blood
goes after her
empties a clip at selena but he doesnt have a clear shot and misses
sees a walkway between houses and turns in
gordy turns in behind her
selena has ten yards on gordy but hes closing
she knows she cant outrun him in a straight line
jukes through a gate into
a shovel lies in the grass
selena scoops it up and in one motion spins back toward the gate launches it blade first with all her strength timing it perfectly as gordy runs through the gate
just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his face
it doesnt hurt him but it stops him and selena breaks toward an open door of the house
selena blasts into the bottom floor runs through a playroom
gordys right behind her
mounts a stairwell
a girls descending
selena grabs a pigtail and flings her down the stairs and
gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from falling all the way to the bottom
he sits the uninjured girl down and continues on
runs toward the living room which is undergoing a renovation
without stopping she tears through the plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the rest of the house
she topples what she can into gordys way
throws nails down behind her
grabs a circular saw and hurls it back at gordy just missing him and shattering a large wall mirror
selenas a soldier taught to pick up and use whatever weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield this battlefield gives her a crowbar which she keeps as she
runs out through plastic covering the other doorway
leads into the dining room
selena runs in
gordys right on her heels
selena pulls down dining room chairs in front of gordy
he vaults one but trips over the second and falls
blows through a swinging door into the kitchen slamming into a hispanic maid whos coming to investigate all the noise
both women tumble
selena gets right back on her feet
she breaks out a window with the crowbar and exits onto a fire escape as gordy blasts in from the dining room
thru thru the window selena slipped through easily is small for gordy
he gets hung up on the glass losing precious seconds
selenas already halfway up when gordy hits the fire escape steps
the fire escape ends at a top floor window
selena breaks out the glass with the crowbar and goes in
selenas in a teenagers bedroom
the teenagers got headphones on oblivious to everything
selena darts through a bathroom into a second bedroom
enters the first bedroom behind her
in gardening clothes and holding a digging tool stands on a stairwell landing alarmed and confused by the chaos she hears in her house
she had started down the stairs but now has turned back at the sound of the window breaking on the top floor
whats going on
runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs above the woman
who are you
what are you doing in here
sees an open rooftop door at the top of a flight of stairs and charges upward without answering
in the hallway a second later
meets the woman in gardening clothes whos now come up the stairs
swipes at him with the digging tool making three deep scratches in his face
gordy doesnt stop
this is where the woman was gardening tending a rooftop flower bed
selena emerges crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof
gordy hits the roof behind her
as selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses we see her warrior determination and discipline
shes thinking ahead and she never hesitates
her big problem is shes being pursued by an equally well trained and determined firefighter
and hes not far back
one tumble and hell catch her
selena strains harder
vaults a gap
moments later gordy vaults it
finally runs out of roof
she looks down
a fire escape ladder leads down to an interior ground level courtyard of a small foreign embassy
still holding the crowbar selena takes the ladder down
gordy reaches the ladder
selenas ahead of him by a floor hurrying down two rungs at a time
gordy doesnt fuck with the rungs
just swings over the edge of the roof grabs the side rails lightly with his hands squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over
the fire escape leads down to a second story balcony running around the inside wall of the courtyard
twin staircases lead from the balcony to ground level where across the slate paved car court a wrought iron gate opens onto the street
gordy hits the balcony a half second after selena
he grabs her
selena swings the crowbar to break his arm
gordy has to let go
selena heads for the stairs leading to the ground
got one chance to intercept selena
the balconys too high for him to jump but the courtyards ringed with trees theyre not close but theyre not far either
not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife and son a man who also slides down fire poles for a living
gordy runs down the balcony
launches off the balcony railing
and hurtles himself at the trunk of a medium sized tree
he hits the trunk
and slides to the ground
hes between selena and the only way out
and theres no way shes getting past him
but thats not what selenas thinking
she attacks with the crowbar and gordy can only retreat in the face of the vicious onslaught
he finds a nearby garbage can
its full heavy but he manages to lift it spilling garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the crowbar
the crowbar thwocks into the can over and over the sound echoing loudly in the small courtyard
selena swings again and gordy moves to block the hit
its a feint
she swings under the can and hits a leg
it hurts like hell he stumbles but he stays on his feet still holding the can
selena goes for his head
gordy raises the can
the cans all dents
theres garbage everywhere
she feints high and then swings low again a wicked blow to the knee
gordy stumbles badly this time
selena breaks for the gate
gordy sees her and with all his might slings the can across the slate pavers and
the can takes selenas legs out from under her
she falls hard
gets back to her feet quickly and starts to run when
gordy hits her like a linebacker
slams selena against a brick wall
gets behind her and slips a mighty arm around her thin neck
selena squirms hard kicks backward going for the balls kneecaps insteps doing whatever she can to hurt gordy and get free
but shes not in a position to do a lot of damage and shed have to kill him before hed let go
gordys got his arm locked in a police chokehold around selenas neck
uses his weight to force the smaller woman down onto her knees
presses her harder till shes sitting back on her legs
selena cant drop out of the hold and her legs are immobilized
all she can do is scratch
but gordys oblivious
theyre alone in the courtyard
body to body
head to head
hes pumped with fury and hatred
he tightens the chokehold
hisses in her ear you killed them
beat with contempt one woman one boy they mean nothing next to the thousands whove been slain
gordy hears it
it only drives him to a deeper fury
they were my family
gordys blind with rage
chokes her neck hard
summoning all the power in him first to shut off her air and blood and then to continue squeezing relishing her every dying moment until hes snuffed out the life
of the person who took anne and matt from him
its all hes wanted since he saw anne and matt die but now he cant do it
hes a firefighter
he saves lives
if he kills selena gordy crosses into her world into brandts world into the brutal nightmare destroying colombia and all the places like it and becomes part of that sadness
gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe
selena gasps for air
the impulse to murder has left gordy
theres a new resolve
the killing ends here
it will never end
under which an embassy security guard emerges from the building
he sees gordy and selena a large man holding a smaller woman in a chokehold
draws his gun
let her go
gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun
please help me
let her go
you dont understand
hes trying to kill me
let her go or youre dead
hes going to shoot
gordy has no choice
as he lets selena go and stands hold us both till the police get here
its too late
selena stomps a heel into the guards knee crushing it then twists the gun from his hands
she points it at him and pulls the trigger and
in his agitation the guard never took the safety off
selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety
in the same moment gordy grabs the crowbar from the ground
flicks off the safety and points the gun again
hurls the crowbar with all his might and
the gun fires just as the crowbar hits selena spoiling her aim
the bullet creases the guards arm
and the next bullet
its from phipps gun
it takes selena in the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way through her body
shes dead on her feet
her body crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large pool that quickly spreads over the slate
move in to help the guard as phipps holsters his pistol
he walks to gordy
the two men share a long silent look
gordy looks again at selenas body in its pool of blood
then turns and goes
entering the courtyard as gordy walks out
brandts seen selena
we got the bitch
gordy hits him
one of the jackhammer blows he slammed into claudio in the bunker
a hard fist deep in the gut that drives all the wind from brandt and drops him to his knees
gordys voice is cold and hard youre no better than she is
and gordy goes
gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker
hes wearing civvies
he stops cranking spoons out a huge dollop into a bowl
gordy hands the bowl to mauro whos playing in the front seat of the pumper
mauro tastes it
mike and the other men on gordys old shift are watching
to gordy itll be good to get you back
gordy turns to them
looks into the faces of these men the people closest to him in the world
then its good to be home
gordys still in pain still missing the wife and son hell never see again
but gordys gonna be alright
mauros gonna be with him
therell be fires to put out and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude of miseries and joys the firefighters in spanish harlem see each and every day
as we pull back out and away from the old brick edifice from which the big red truck will come bringing help
