pitch black shooting draft revised by david twohy screenplay by david twohy based on material by ken and jim wheat revised first draft though mentioned often in the script the
creatures in pitch black are seldom seen at length rather they are glimpsed they are heard they are felt
they are really the embodiment of your nocturnal fears a howling coyote that jars you awake the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long
the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits
chimera of the night
the point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do but on what the creatures do to
reveal the inner nature of the characters
for pitch black is at its heart a story of humanity and courage and lack of the same
david twohy a cryo locker blows open spitting out
she hits the deck of the main cabin four crew lockers in a forward section countless more in back
but the deck is canted at a sick angle and alarms scream everywhere the world is dying around her
legs wobbly shivering like a flu victim fry stumbles to the next forward locker
its riddled with holes
one dead crewie is seen through fractured plexi body pocked and bloodied
but in the next cryo locked
the captain is struggling awake
frys face floods with relief
slapping an intercom hear me
some kinda compromise to the hull
holding for now but
goddamn im glad youre alive
gotta pull your e release
no red handle red handle
ill get the warm ups out while particles bore through the cabin blasting open the captains chest shattering plexi detonating instruments on the opposite wall and leaving contrails hissing in
fry lands on her ass horrified
another locker blows open
a body falls right on top of fry but this ones still alive
disoriented frantic why did i fall on you
christ i was looking right at him when i mean i mean chrono shows were weeks out so gravity wasnt supposed to kick in for another
i mean i mean i mean why did i fall at all you hear me
not owens not
wai wai wait
im owens right
they swap nightmare looks momentarily unsure of their own identities
swear to god it sloughs brain cells
they stumble into nav bay
fry grabs warm up suits out of storage pitches one to owens checks her screens
millibars dropping mb per minute shit were hemorrhaging air
somethin took a swipe at us
just tell me were still in the shipping lane
just show me all those stars all those bright beautiful deep space
owens activates an exterior view a planet rushes up at us thats why they have gravity
the ship plows through the upper atmosphere antennae pylons already disintegrating
heart battering her ribs fry runs forward using hand holds to steady herself
over a headset they trained you for this right
she doesnt answer
fry harnesses in starts running switches but fumbles a few times making mental errors
finally she gets crash shutters open to reveal
cloud strata sweeping up past the windscreen like floor lights on a dropping elevator
were shedding big altitude
crisis program selected number two of this system because it shows at least some oxygen and more than would you hammers a button more than millibars of pressure at surface
okay so maybe the ship did something right for a change
as fry runs more switches
as jettison doors close around the ship
as fry flips up a security latch and thumbs the switch below
multiple shots explosive bolts rapid fire around the ships skin blowing away non essentials that hinder aerodynamics including big deep space drives
but this last separation puts the ship into a dangerous roll
out the windscreen cloud strata roll vertiginously
fry throws actuators
and airbrakes deploy
she manages to kill the roll
but the ships still coming in nose high
showing no major water bodies
maximum terrain meters over mean surface
largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits
jettison doors close behind owens segregating him from the passenger compartment
it scares him for a new reason
whatre you doing
fry flips up a new security latch
cant get my nose down
too much load back there
you mean that load of passengers
so what we should both go down too
out of sheer fucking nobility
frys thumb moves to the switch that will jettison the passenger cabin
selected shots of faces inside cryo lockers among them johns
hes prime of life badge on display some kind of cop
shaken awake he clears condensation to check the locker directly across from his finding
small black goggles hide his eyes
a metal bit wedged in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace
a read out admonishes look fry
company says were responsible for every one of those companys not here is it
when captain went down you stepped up whether you like it or not
now they train you for this so and there wasnt a simulated cockroach alive within clicks of the simulated crash site
thats how they train you
on a fucking simulator
owens unbuckles from his chair
dont touch that switch
overcome by guilt fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction
but a huge jolt puts the thumb right back
im not dying for them
she pushes it but this time
no bolts fire
nothing separates from the ship that screams down through the clouds
now we see why owens reopened the jettison doors locally and blocked them open
you still got seconds to level this beast out
seething anger and guilt fry pops more airbrakes shedding more speed more heat
the ship does level but its still being pounded hellishly
she tries to get a stable view out
were breaking through cloud bottoms
theres just a glimpse of landscape before
an airbrake fails it shears off and pinwheels into
it cracks into a thousand spiderwebs but impossibly it holds
what the shit was that
sunlight flares from every fractured edge its like looking into burning diamonds and fry can only get an impression of the outside world
now she has to rely on
a ground mapping display
realizing hes in some kind of shit storm he claws at safety restraints
ground mapper meters
collision alarms kick in
out the fractured windscreen we see a huge dark mass rise up into view
the windscreens implode
air hurricanes in
chairs rip from their moorings
strapped into one owens slams into the ceiling
johns blows out of his locker and wishes to god he wouldve stayed inside because just beside him
the hull is cracking open nightmare shot a huge section of the cabin tears free
skitters and crashes along the planetfloor behind us
and disintegrates out of sight
cryo lockers vanished with it
hammered by wind fry opens her eyes experimentally
frys pov a vortex of motion of speed of blurring debris
but the ship is burrowing in
burrowing under fry pivots her chair degrees a nanosecond before
dirt avalanches into the cockpit it buries camera
choking yellow dust
ghostly silhouettes are coughing moaning calling out to other survivors in english and surreally in arabic
soon we find
ears running blood
stumbling his way to
riddicks cryo locker
johns reaches for his holster
gone torn right off his belt
no prisoner and no weapon spooky combination
nearby he sees
the light of a cutting torch
someones using it to open a jammed cryo locker
the plexi is torched away to reveal
audrey years old
somethin went wrong huh
johns searches for his pistol
behind him two chained feet lower into frame and then attack swinging over johns head
getting the chain on his neck
twisting hard using the chain as a choke collar
johns flicks open a baton swings it up at
still in body chains and mouth bit
clinging to a ceiling support
riding out the baton blows
seconds from blacking out johns strains forward
and finally breaks riddicks grip on the support
he keeps hold of the chained feet so that
riddick slams headfirst into the deck
johns lays the baton on his neck
one chance and you blew it riddick
never cease to disappoint me
a light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit
its packed with dirt no signs of life
about to search elsewhere johns turns back at
his light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt
johns crawls closer checks the other side of the headrest and finds her
buried to the gills
id shake hands but
he manages a smile and starts digging her out
almost dreading to ask are there any others johns
johns helps fry through the carnage
shes stunned by it all but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be
realizing shes in nav bay fry starts digging like a search dog to uncover
still strapped to his chair
metal rod piercing his chest close to the heart
fry reaches out to touch him
out out out get it outta me
she recoils hard
hes still alive the other survivors bungle over
ten seconds of pure chaos pull it out of him
no its too close to the heart
you gotta do it just do it fast
fry grabs the rod
dont touch it
dont touch that switch
youll kill him im tellin you shit just leave it alone
doncha you got some drugs for this poor man
dont touch that switch
awright awright someone
theres anestaphine in the med lock that end of the cabin
but there is no more that end
in exquisite pain owens screams on
reaction shots of johns audrey
seldom are human beings witness to such raw suffering
the others leave except for audrey staying behind to watch in morbid fascination
johns doubles back and collars her
leaving they pass
riddick cuffed to a bulkhead
his eyes still hidden by goggles track johns and audrey toward daylight
the survivors straggle outside
camera surveys new faces zeke and shazza
male female team of bushwhackers partners in life
shazza has a tough sexiness
zekes face shows aboriginal blood
a puff pastry of a man
s or s
four male chrislams the pillar steady imam ish and three pilgrims young and excitable late teens
note the chrislams represent a union between christianity and islam
they have the iconography of christians yet the physical look of arab muslims
wide shot all around them is stark and unforgiving terrain
the valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side spiked with earthen spires
scorching down on everything are two suns one red one yellow
our own little slice of heaven
the chrislams fall to their knees
confusion as they try to orient themselves
which way to new mecca
we must know the direction in order to pray
johns snaps open a compass finds the needle swaying rudderlessly
the screaming inside the ship finally ends
as fry holds owens now dead
the four chrislams have devised a way to pray backs together each faces a different compass point
fry climbs onto the back of the ship
johns paris zeke shazza audrey are already here
big talk about a scouting party
fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship
one glance confirms that there are no other survivors
then we saw this
anyone else having breathing problems
aside from me
like i just ran or something
feel one lung short
all of us
well i tend toward the asthmatic
and with all this dust
faces turn to fry theyre looking to her for answers
its the atmosphere
too much pressure not enough oxygen
might take a few days to so what the bloody hell happened anyways
somethin knocked us off lane
maybe a rogue comet
maybe well never know
well i for one am thoroughly fucking grateful
this beast wasnt made to land like this
but cripes you rode it down
to others cmon you lousy ingrates only reason were alive is acuzza her
others chime agreement laying thankful hands on frys shoulders
hold on fry her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their savior
breaking out pressure suits liquid oxygen canisters inside
start ripping them out
quick hits only try to make it last
well is someone coming for us
or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse
off their looks hey you dont have to worry about scaring me
were worried youll scare us
ushering her away names audrey right love
and youre goin to taurus three like we were
do we even have enough food to get there
or will we have to resort to cannibalism
to fry ill see bout makin this air go a bit further capn
with your permission a course
they actually think im the captain
zeke and the others get to work
fry finds herself staring at another problem
we just keep him locked up forever
be my choice
already escaped once from the max slam facility on i dont need his life story
is he really that dangerous
only around humans
riddick has his mouth on the hull virtually licking the metal
fry moves closer and now sees it sheeting down the hull
theyre losing water suddenly fry is running snatching up an emergency light climbing wall rungs
and crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water cistern
she opens a crank hatch and finds light invading the interior
her face dies
is it just the pump
ask if anyone has anything in cargo
anything to drink
oversize doors rumble open
fry johns and paris climb into this dark corridor lined with cargo containers
each container has an access door
as paris unlocks johns steadies himself suddenly light headed
little swamp flu from the conga system
never shook it with all this cryo sleep
paris opens his container to reveal
tiffany chairs stacked high
bronze eagle lecterns
neo egyptian castings
king tuts tomb
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system
this wooten here easy easy
they open the wooten desk
cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles of sherry
this is it
thats what you have to drink
educating her year old single malt scotch is to booze as foie gras is to duck guts
cracking a bottle a toast to whatever he just said
ill need a receipt for that
to fry for all these
top of my list
she joins johns for a drink
entering the chrislams watch with both envy and aversion
i dont suppose
one of the christian habits we didnt adopt perhaps unfortunately
well have to wait
there is no water
you understand that dont you
all deserts have water somewhere
god shall lead us there
start on the cutting torch abandoned in wreckage
staring at it is
with his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead he cant get near it
or can he
near the ceiling the bulkhead is fractured a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through
with a gruesome popping he dislocates both shoulders
carries his arms overhead
passes the chains through the broken spot
and brings his arms down in front of him
a body flex pops his shoulders back into joint
free he reaches for the cutting torch
pistol in hand johns runs into a big closeup eyes sweeping
nothing on the horizon
but something lies on the ground nearby
its riddicks mouth bit
like we needed another way to die
fast closeups hands pillaging storage lockers pulling out anything that might qualify as a weapon
it all gets hauled back and dumped into
gathered the survivors take inventory johns has a pistol shotgun baton
zeke and shazza offer up a pick ax digging tools hunting boomerang
imam shows a ceremonial blade
paris straggles in with antique curios
what the hell are these
maratha crow bill war picks from northern india
blow dart hunting stick from papua new guinea
very very rare since the tribes extinct
cuz they couldnt hunt shit with these things be my guess
well whats the need anyway
if hes gone hes gone
why should he bother us
first because he can only live out there for so long hes gonna come back and take what we got
second for the sheer thrill of the kill
they all grab for weapons
johns stands atop the crash ship scanning with a scope
he fixates on
a blue glow on the horizon
what the hell is it
zeke and shazza modify breather units adding straps and tubing and ball floats
the prototype is tested on audrey
she sucks on the mouthpiece and finds that it works supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow
chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head gear readying for travel
fry finishes wrapping owens body
she looks to the yellow sun low on the horizon
the red sun seems inclined to follow
we should leave soon
before nightfall but while its cooler
what youre goin off too
johns is leaving you a gun
just do me a favor huh
get my crewies buried
they were good guys who died bad
acourse we will
note imam is pronounced el ee mam
fry and the others round the ship to see
a blue star flaring into view its rising as the other suns are setting
my bloody oath
to fry so much for your nightfall
so much for my cocktail hour
we take this to be a good sign a path a direction from god
johns swings down from the top of the ship
a very good sign
re blue sun thats riddicks direction
you do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy
thought you found his restraints over there
nodding which means he went toward sunrise
trekking the chrislams waft incense pots and chant from the koran as they head toward the blue star
johns provides shotgun escort fry carries paris second war pick on a shoulder
silhouetted against the alien sky the scouting party is an odd odd sight
already sun battered johns crafts an eye visor out of plexi
fry tries to wrap her head like the chrislams
you get used to the sounds of the ship then
you know who muhammad was
some prophet guy
some prophet guy
and a city man
but he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of god
you were on a pilgrimage
to new mecca
nodding chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj a great pilgrimage
to know god better yes but to know yourself as well
finishes wrapping her were all on the same hajj now
fry notices johns scope locked on something
hands her scope tell me its not a mirage
scope pov beyond a distant rise strange branches
paris has taken over as look out atop the ship
he deals with the heat by erecting a misting umbrella he fills a reservoir with liquor dials up a regulator
umbrella spars shoot bursts of cooling alcohol vapor
paris luxuriates in it
comfy up there
zeke appears below
he loads a scrap metal sled with tarp cable pick ax
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life so long as you have the luxuries
well just keep your bloody fuckin eyes open
dont want that ratbag sneakin up on me bloody fuckin arse
he drags the sled toward the spired hills
keeping one eye on zeke paris eases into a chair lays the war pick across his lap pours himself a spot of sherry
as he sips a blade touches his throat hed probably get you right here right under the jaw
and youd never hear him coming
thats how good riddick is
paris eases the hunting boomerang away
now did you run away from your parents
or did they run away from you
the scouting party approaches a rise
the trees loom just beyond
the young pilgrims break into a excited run anticipating an oasis
but fry hangs back taking a harder look at the trees
they dont move in the wind
the pilgrims scramble up the rise and go motionless
fry johns and imam catch up to behold
the trees are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton tinted green by lichen
beyond is a sea of bleached animal bones impossibly the bones seem to moan in pain
all told its like hell overflowed right here
is this whole planet dead
a pilgrim questions imam in arabic
he asks what could have killed so many great things
moving into the boneyard some
communal graveyard perhaps
like the elephants of earth
fry touches one of the towering bones
it shows cut marks almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword
or killing field
long time ago
pilgrim reaches a huge skull laced with baleen like combing
wind hitting the comb makes a low harmonic moaning
by moving a hand over the comb the pilgrim can play dirgelike music
wanting to show off the trick ah
he looks for pilgrim but cant spot him
and when he turns back to the skull a face is staring through the combing but its only
pilgrim inside the skull
johns enters and chases him out
about to leave johns notices
bone chippings piled on the ground
it could be nothing but still
johns double checks shadows probing with the muzzle of his shotgun
satisfied johns exits
now boom up to reveal
riddick hidden in a sinus cavity
trailing the others fry pauses to change out the o on her breather
riddick drops to the ground
his arms and hands are now pierced with shards of boneyard ivory fashionable little body talons
spotting a shadow on the combing he draws closer
and sees fry
johns doubles back to fry
he takes a hit of scotch offers her some
probably makes it worse
dehydrates you even more
they drink anyway
moving out of the sun fry leans up against the combing
it brings her within arms length of
he pulls a bone shiv freshly chiseled
you know i woulda played road dog for these guys
you couldve stayed back
probly shouldve because you know if we dont find water
we may not make it back
no no i wanted to get away
so i noticed
never seen a captain quite so ready to leave her ship
just as riddick eases his blade toward frys neck
she steps away
better keep moving
whatd owens mean
bout not touching the switch
fry searches his eyes wondering if she can trust him and again she leans back on the combing
we can actually see riddick now
they could too if they would just turn the fuck around
you can tell me carolyn
swear to me you wont you see anybody else here
just between you and me
during the landing
when things were at their worst
owens was at his best
hes the one who wouldnt let the pilot dump the passenger cabin
johns blinks stunned
are you shittin me
trying again riddick reaches out with his shiv and deftly slices off some of frys hair
thats all he wanted
so now you know
guess im more glad to be here than i thought
riddick watches them move off then looks at the scotch bottle left behind
its still got one good swallow
leaving the boneyard the scouting party reaches a cleft in the hills
ahead is a canyon
he jumps onto a rock puts the scope to an eye
thought he might be coolin it in the boneyard could either double back to the ship or slip in behind us
so i left the bottle out as bait
scope pov panning the boneyard
finding the bottle
its still got that one swallow
closer on the bottle
only we see that the scotch has been emptied and replaced with sand
working under the shade of a tarp zeke digs a communal grave
three wrapped corpses wait nearby
he keeps a sight line on
the crash ship
zeke waves back
the scouting party transits a narrowing canyon
lined with rib bones it makes us feel like were in the belly of some beast
fry squints at the ridgetops
more of those spires are visible on the canyon rims looming like silent sentinels
what are they
just mineral deposits
the chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant
leathery petals are spread wide revealing a round stringy core
is it edible
wait wait wait
fry takes the plant pushes the petals back down over the core
they all stare
its a baseball we are not alone here yes
they look ahead wondering what awaits them
but johns is looking back
never thought we were
high angle an old weather cock creaks in the wind
fry johns and the chrislams enter frame far below
the greeting echoes through the settlement built from stacked shipping containers
tattered sun shades flap in the wind
a rusty bike lies on the ground
whoever they were
they move around a building and pull up short
before them looms a moisture recovery unit a hulking machine in disrepair
old jugs litter the ground
water there was here
translating god is great yes
im born again
fry manages a weary smile but soon her eyes revisit the abandoned buildings
who were these people
why did they leave so much behind
through a window we see the johns and the chrislams crawling over the moisture recovery unit assessing repairs
pull back to include fry inside the settlement inspecting
place settings out
years of dust
photos on the wall settlers working modest gardens
posing with children
fry enters a dark room
no response to her command
she pats around for old style wall switches
perceiving black out blinds on a window she throws them open to reveal
a man standing right outside through window hey
dont go too far huh
johns smiles leaves
just as her heart settles something creaks behind her
its an orrery a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns
solar powered the orrery starts turning creaking
one planet seems always to have sunlight
no lights because no darkness
fry reaches a porch
it looks out over the rear of the settlement and more unforgiving terrain
she starts back inside but something glints at the edge of her vision
fry turns back
parts clothes on a laundry line
and sees the source of the glint
excited hits on her breather
fry vaults off the porch and starts walking as if on magnetic bearing
soon shes running
johns and the chrislams trade looks
fry stops on a groomed runway out of breath
the others catch up
they too marvel at
the skiff a light duty vehicle of hybrid technology part bush plane part space craft
its fabric wings are wind torn but the hull looks intact
close on caviar being added to toast points
a scrabbling sound stops paris in mid bite
he eases out of his rocker moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on
a shadow ducking under him
small rocks still trickle down a dirt rampart just climbed by
this now qualifies as the worst fun ive ever had
stop it no response
war pick in hand paris eases to ground level
he checks the perimeter looks inside the ship
is he being fucked with
what paris spins
the voice came from the cargo hold and not where he expected
blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull
paris enters to find shazza and audrey cutting open containers searching for usable goods
tell me that was you
okay it was me
whatd i do now
assailing my fragile sense of security thats what
whatre you goin on about
shes been right here for the last
they all see it sun blades are momentarily blocked by something passing outside
some one a quiet probe zeke
audrey springs to the other side of hold puts an eye to a crack there
hull crack pov far away zeke finishes digging the grave
he starts toward the ship
audrey whirls back mouths a silent alarm riddick
paris goes bloodless
shazza grabs the war pick out of his frozen hands moves catlike to the main doors and poises there ready to strike
audrey follows with the hunting boomerang
all eyes watch as
the sun blades winking off and on chart riddicks approach we feel like were inside a magicians sword box watching the blades shave closer and closer to us
suddenly he appears and shazza swings hard
facing them is a total stranger burned half naked one hand still clutching the emergency release lever of his cryo locker
shazza stopped one inch short of killing him
my god i thought i was the only one who
he lurches toward shazza trying to embrace her and sees blood and brain bits blam blamming against her
his own the stranger sinks bonelessly to the ground
fast rack to reveal zeke in the background pistol leveled
he reads shazzas horrified face and understands what hes done
it was just somebody else
from the crash
he was just
cripes galore i thought it was him
the murderin ratbag
i thought he was
he rushes over to check the dead stranger
as he bends down fast rack again to reveal riddick in the background he stands paces off still unseen by the others
his goggle eyes covet
fry exits the skiff
no juice looks like its been laid up for years
but we might be able to adapt shut up
outside johns has an ear cocked to the wind
thought i heard something
like my pistola
start on the drag sled carrying corpse the stranger
zeke reaches the grave
the sun tarp has fallen on one side blocking the sight line between ship and grave
zeke starts to unload the body but sees something he didnt notice before theres some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave
now what the bloody hell
zeke hops down into the grave
camera moves to reveal riddick hidden among the spires
hes been waiting for a chance just like this
zeke drops to all fours
looks into the tunnel
there seems to be some kind of burrow beyond
burrow pov staring back at zeke
zeke takes a handlight off his belt shines it into the burrow
its the last thing he ever does
as more gunshots jar paris audrey shazza
furious closeups zeke fighting for his life
something slashing at him
blood dancing on air
shazza sprints across hard pack heading for
she slaps aside the tarp to find
bone shiv in hand he just stands on the other side of the grave
shazza looks down
camera pursues riddick as he lopes through the spires running from the scene of the crime
he turns a blind corner and something nearly blows his head off at close range
he hits ground
a boot steps on his neck keeping him there
same crap different planet huh
sucking on their breathers fry and the chrislams make it back to the ship
they find johns beating riddick like a chained dog
i dont play that
i dont play that so just try again
cmon riddick tell me a better lie
ease up ease up
just tell me what
she hauls him off only to have shazza start punching riddick
whatd you do with im
you bloody sick animal you whatdja do with me zeke
fry and johns stand over the grave
its a gory mess but no sign of zeke
johns has riddicks confiscated shiv
he used that
sir shiv a lot
he likes to cut
so why isnt it all bloody
i assume he licked it clean
riddick is back in chains face pulpy from the beating listening to sotto voce voices outside
fry enters looks at him hard
so where is he
riddick turns away revealing a broken goggle lens
the eye beneath is closed for some reason he wont look at her
tell me about the sounds
you told them you heard something right before
no response if you dont talk to me johnsll take another crack at it at your skull
mean the whispers
the ones tellin me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine fourth lumbar down
the abdominal aorta
what a gusher
had a cup on his belt so i used it to catch a little run off
metallic taste to it human blood
but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps that goes away
course thats more for winter
summertime i take mine straight
riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as boogeyman if fear is the only kind of respect he can get riddick is going to grab some with both hands
why dont we try the truth now
a head shaking beat then all you people are so scared of me an most days id take that as a compliment but it aint me you gotta worry about
show me your eyes
again he turns away
she strips the goggles off
he sits with lids shut tight anticipating the pain
show me riddick
imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time
thats how riddick opens his eyes startling us no irises just huge black pool pupils
and from deep within a jewel like eyeshine
his eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar
you did this
well we called him doctor
heard about it
just never seen it
fairly fuckin ironic wouldnt you say
slamlights so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here
three ass kick suns
replacing goggles maybe i did do a few people
but not this one
no maam not this time
then where is he
hes not in the hole
he clicks his tongue at her
chain looped over one shoulder fry heads back to the grave site
johns imam shazza and audrey keep pace as
know what happened he went off on the guy buried him on the hill somewhere and now hes trying to lets just be sure
look murders aside riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame
he loves the jaw jackin loves making you afraid cuz thats all he has
and youre playing right into were gonna find the body johns
christ youre a cop
why am i tellin you this
we gotta go down and find it
well dont ask me to
thought you didnt believe his story
but that ground looked none too stable and i dont want anyone if youre afraid ill go
he shoots audrey a scowl
nobody else is going down but me okay
pulling her aside hey
bein ballsy with your life now doesnt change what came before its just stupid
what you think im doin this to prove something
you said it not me
lets just not let one bad call lead to another
thanks for the tip johns
now get outta my way
chain hooked to her web belt fry drops into the grave
she peers into the burrow
looks back up at the halo of faces above her
then slithers out of sight
letting her eyes adjust fry pats around lightly
quickly she finds zekes handlight tries it
close on the chain slithering through hands playing out as fry moves deeper underground
fry makes an uphill turn
sees a spray of light ahead
worms forward to reach
another chamber wide and just large enough to stand in
shafts of daylight bore down into the room
more old bones litter the floor
fry moves into one shaft and looks up at
an earthen funnel
the inside of a spire
fry slow turns toward the sound
theres something here something just beyond the cusp of light
an icy hand grips her heart
soundlessly fry backtracks her chain but
something shadows across the exit it stops her cold
her hand finds something new
she angles it to the light
its one of zekes boots with a bit of zeke still in it the whole chamber is coming alive around her shadows unfurling skulking the perimeter circling
something impales the boot out of her hand reclaiming it
it was faster than a lightning strike
a paralyzed beat before
fry makes her move rolling back into the shaft of daylight and springing straight up into
bracing against the walls fry tries to walk her way up but her chain goes taut
did it catch on something
or did something catch it fry starts pounding the earthen walls
im in here here here
did you hear
they drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave listening
im over here in the something tugs on her chain
close on her feet
kicking hard at the walls trying to gouge out footholds
a stronger tug
fry loses altitude slipping closer to
the madly clicking lair below
she tries to jettison her belt but cant brace herself up and undo the belt
something explodes near her head daylight appears followed by faces human faces
theyre breaking through the spire with the pick ax
hands reach inside
and birth her into daylight
overlapping we got you
its okay its okay
we got you now
the child heard you before any of us could even
did you find him
you find zeke
half insane wasnt riddick
goddamn that was stupid
but wasnt riddick
somethin else down there that got zeke and nearly got her she flies back into the spire
somethings still got the chain the others grab at flailing limbs
its a tug of war now human hands on one end unseen hands on the other and the humans are losing
imam unsheathes his blade
and slices through frys belt
as the chain falls down the spire
fast shots survivors packing up o liquor umbrellas the koran whatever qualifies as essential on this planet
amid the activity audrey pauses to look at
the spired hills
fry and imam pull a power cell from the ships battery bay thumping it down on the deck
one is all
at his personal locker johns digs out a box of shotgun shells
he bypasses the blue metal shells for a red metal one
theres something special about it though what we cant be sure
a shadow falls over riddick
he doesnt look up
found somethin worse than me huh
and im just wondering if i shouldnt lighten the load right now
now their eyes meet
johns ratchets his shotgun and points it at riddicks head
the shotgun explodes
camera pans off of johns to show riddick still alive
the shotgun discharged next to his head and blew off his wrist chains
want you to remember this moment riddick
the way it coulda gone and didnt
deaf say that again
heres the deal
you work without the chains without the bit without the shivs
you help us get off this rock
the honor of goin back to some asshole of a cell
truth is riddick im tired of this head up shit
i wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me
the future rearranges in riddicks head
youd cut me loose boss
only if we both get outta this alive
and there may be a way
he offers a hand to help riddick up to seal the deal
staring at hand my recommendation do me
dont take the chance that ill get shiv happy on your wannabe ass
ghost me riddick
would if i were you
if you were me id kill us both
cmon you wanna sit at the grown up table or not
riddick reaches out for the hand and grabs the shotgun with his off hand a blur of movement
suddenly johns is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun
want you to remember this moment
he pumps shotgun spitting blue shells over johns
he drops the emptied gun and walks away
extremely wide blue sun setting yellow and red sun rising
the survivors trek for the settlement
fry and imam lug the power cell between them but the real load is shouldered by
promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden he tows a drag sled heavy with cargo
to johns so just like that
wave your little wand and hes one of us now
didnt say that
but least this way i dont have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin up
well i feel we owe mr
lets all line up and beg his forgiveness
right you are
at least give the man some oxygen
hes happy just bein vertical
leave him be
so i can talk to him now
in unison no paris drops a wine bottle
trailing riddick collects it
antiquities dealer entrepreneur
shaking hands richard b
escaped convict murderer
instead of returning the bottle riddick opens it and drinks
paris hurries to catch up to the others
you know if i owned hell and this planet
i believe id rent this out and live in hell
frys pov of spires high above us
the group falls silent as they transit the canyon all eyes on the spires
fry stops short hearing
neck hairs rise but soon the sound vanishes
the group starts moving again faster
are they being stalked
nervously fry traces the sound back to
beads dangling from the belt of pilgrim
whenever he moves the strings clack together
i mean usually i can appreciate antiques but uh
the survivors have reached the settlement
fry is trying to get the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior
little ratty ass
nothing we cant repair so long as the electrical adapts
not a star jumper
doesnt need to be
use this to get back up to the sol track shipping lanes stick out a thumb
youll get picked up
to fry right
fry looks from riddick to johns
how did he know that
little help here
they muscle the power cell aboard
riddick starts to follow but johns blocks
he doesnt want riddick inside
check those containers for me
see what we can patch wings with
with religious fervor the chrislams are repairing the moisture recovery unit the machine allah led them to
start on the battery bay
hands are adapting the power cell to the skiffs older electrical system
lights wink on throughout the ship
okay that should buy us a sys check
but well need more cells
other ship carries gig cells so
five total to launch
kilos each huh
old sand cat outside
see if i cant get it up and chuggin
and if you need an extra hand tap our problem child out
looking out wheres riddick
hes walking the ghost town finding dead gardens
upended chairs and furniture
behind his back
audrey and pilgrim the youngest chrislam scurry through frame stalking this curious monster in their midst
close on the other chrislams faces charged with anticipation while awaiting
the first drop of water
it appears at the bottom of a pipette
tongues fight for it
another drop forms in its place
now another and another
it brings cheers
close on paris hands
getting ready to celebrate he unwraps crystal goblets
dusts off the refectory table
and rehangs an old christmas garland
hands digging in dirt
covertly audrey and pilgrim watch riddick digging near the entrance of a tall windowless structure
he excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses
a shattered light
and a childs tin robot timeless
riddick thumbs a solar panel clean
the robots language program warbles to life
to all intruders
i am the guardian of this land
i will protect my masters at all cost
death to all intruders
riddick stands and tries the doors
he peers through a small filthy window
is there something moving inside
riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign
missin the party
its johns keeping him on a short leash
leaving riddick kicks a trash bin
missin the party
hold on the trash bin a beat
talkin to me
pilgrims pov of audrey exiting the trash bin and running after riddick and johns
pilgrim is at the window of the coring room
hes found a way inside
by the windows feeble light he starts exploring
just visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill
and for this our gift of drink we give thanks in the name of our prophet muhammad peace be upon him and to our lord jesus christ of nazareth and
to his father allah the compassionate and the merciful
to himself the strangest religion
pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets
riddick gets the last of it the part with sediment
selected closeups as they drink
nothing ever tasted finer
perhaps we should toast our hosts
who were these people anyway
looks like geologists
advance team moves around from rock to rock
musta crapped out here huh
but why did they leave their ship
its a question no one has chosen to deal with yet
imam notices one water glass unspoken for
close on the coring room sign
an attached solar panel begins moving orienting toward sunlight
when it catches the full brunt of the suns rays
storm shutters unlatch on the roof
pilgrim hears shooting latches overhead
that sound brings another sound a strange skittering
the pilgrim looks up
is there something in the rafters
answering audrey well just a skiff
like an emergency life raft right
coulda had a real drop ship take them off planet
a toast to their ghosts then
didnt leave these people
whatever got zeke got them
theyre all dead
its like he just pissed in the punchbowl
what you dont really think they left with their clothes on the lines
photos on the walls
maybe they had weight limits you dont know
i know you dont uncrate your emergency ship unless theres a fucking emergency
rag it riddick
nobody wants your theories on to riddick so what happened
where are they then
fry is the only one willing to look at reality or at least glance its way
at the window imam scans outside
has anyone seen the young one
to fry and imam has anyone checked the coring room
now the storm shutters start yawning open spreading daylight over pilgrim and
the ceiling rafters
theyre encrusted with thick nests of
the skittering grows louder more agitated
sensing trouble pilgrim hurries for a sliver of daylight in a wall the breach he entered through
he never gets there sunlight hits the first nest
it explodes with life
as imam hears the scream
ali chaotic shots more nests explode into individual creatures winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire talons hacking and slashing
his exit blocked pilgrim veers into
a dark supply room
he slams the door mumbles a blessing and waits for the storm to pass
hes been cut but at least hes still alive
as the survivors run for the coring room
as riddick stays behind to drink their water
hinges are blasted away
the door caves in
imam shoulders past johns to enter and find
the empty coring room
a noise from the supply room
is it ali
just too scared to come out
imam opens the door
and hatchlings pour out moving with a gang intelligence they circle the room in a wave soar high into the rafters then plunge into the coring shaft squeals vanishing to
shocked silence then
pilgrim tumbles to the ground
hes been shredded into bloody kite tails
there was a nest inside the supply room
imam falls on him in grief
johns and fry inch forward to peer down
the coring shaft
its littered with human bones
the skeletons of the settlers
scattered about and picked clean
against a blue sunrise the chrislams hold a prayer service
paris and audrey attend
riddick watches from afar
why was the door chained up
why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that
not sure but tell you what chrislams better not be diggin another grave out there
other buildings werent secure
so they ran here
thought theyd be safe inside but
looks down shaft someone forget to lock the back door
shazza joins him at the shaft
gazing on the human remains so thats what come of me zeke
an you saw it
you was right there
you were tryin to kill him too
shrugging not necessarily just wanted his o
a beat though i notice he tried to ghost my ass
when he shot up that stranger instead
shazza cant deny it
she looks at him differently now the man she once beat while in chains
she takes off her breather
suspicious what its broken
startin to acclimate anyhow
riddick accepts it awkwardly sucks down some pure o
johns watches the exchange closely not much liking the idea of riddick being promoted to oxygen breathing human
to fry lets board this up and get the hell gone
they seem to stick to the dark so if we stick to daylight should be all years ago
coring samples line the room laid out on counters
frys been scrutinizing them
core samples are dated
last one is years ago
whats special about that
maybe nothing but
but now fry remembers
the year counter clicks over to as
fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear accelerating the orbits
close on the counter
they all see it a giant ringed world eclipses the suns and plunges their planet into darkness
are you fuckin kidding me
not afraid of the dark are you
crossing the yard in wide strides need those cells from the crash ship
shit still gotta check out the hull patch the wings lets wait on the power cells
wait for what
until its so dark we cant even find our way back to were not sure when it happens so lets not get the fucking cells over here johns
whats the discussion
ever tell you how riddick escaped
alone inside the skiff johns and fry continue with more privacy
jarred he can pilot
hijacked a prison transport made a helluva good run fore i tracked him down
with faint hope okay maybe thats a good thing
maybe i can use him to help with he also figured out how to kill the pilot fry
a mental shiver
you said we were going to trust him now
you said there was a deal
thats what i said
he challenges her to read his mind
oh this is a dangerous game youre playing johns
mayve noticed chains dont work on this guy
only way were truly safe is if he believes hes goin free
but if he stops believin you mean if he learns that youre gonna royally fuck him over
we need a fail safe
bring the cells over at the last possible minute when the wings are ready when we know were ready to launch
fry looks at him with new eyes
you know he hasnt harmed any of us
far as i can tell he hasnt even lied to us
just stick to the deal johns
let him go if thats what it hes a murderer
the law says hes gotta do his bid
shaking her head she looks off
dancin on razor blades here
i wont give him a chance to grab another ship or to slash another pilots throat
johns descends the gangway and finds riddick erecting a field table in the shade of the skiff
he seems out of earshot
as they trade looks another flu like shiver runs through johns
shakin like that in this heat
johns moves on
the chrislams appear shouldering a roll of vectran wing fabric material
they drop it on the table
ready to cut bindings imam pats his hip for the knife that was just there
looking after johns ill cut
he has the knife
as shazza and audrey repair the sand cat
close on the knife slicing through the vectran
riddick hands the trim to pilgrim
camera follows as he scampers onto the skiff
balance beams over wing struts
and delivers the piece to imam who stitches the fabric like an old berber rug weaver
pilgrim pauses to check on
the setting blue sun
the hatch closes seals
close on a monitor
a hull integrity test is underway
fry scans rising pressure gauges
looks like were a few shy
riddick is aboard staring at the depleted battery bay
and he has imams blade
strange not doin a run up on the main drive yet
half beat strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape
i got the quick and ugly version
an now youre worried about a repeat of history
entered our minds
i asked what you thought
you scare me riddick
thats what you wanna hear isnt it
there i admit it can i get back to work now
she finds the courage to turn her back on him
riddick moves closer and takes a beat to scan the controls
the cabin pressure builds
think johns is an do right man
you think i can trust him to cut me loose
does riddick already know
is he testing her
why whatd you hear
well guess if it was trickeration hed just do me huh
i am worth twice as much alive
reading her face didnt know
johns aint a cop
oh hes got that shiny badge an all but nah hes just a merc and im just a payday
thats why he wont kill me
the creed is greed
it knocks her off stride but
save it riddick
we arent gonna turn on each other no matter how hard you try
riddick moves right up behind her
i dont truly know whats gonna happen when the lights go out carolyn but i do know that once the dyin starts this little psycho family of ours is gonna
rip itself apart
so you better find out the truth
come nightfall you better know exactly whos standing behind you
a monitor chirps the news hull integrity
exhaling gasses the hatch opens automatically
oh ask him bout those shakes
and ask why your crew pal had to scream like that fore he died
closeups hands select a red metal shotgun shell from a box
pull the shell open
remove a glass ampule hidden inside
drop the ampule into a injection syringe
the syringe touches an eager arm vein
who are you
shirt off johns looks up
shes in the doorway
youre not a real cop are you
just some mercenary who goes around talkin about the law like i never said i was
never said you were a hype either
she moves closer
rummages through his stuff brazenly
finds a shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules
you have a little caffeine in the morning i have a little morphine
and here you got two mornings every day
wow were you born lucky
not a problem unless youre gonna make lashing you made it a problem when you let owens die like that
when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule team
owens was already dead
his brain just hadnt caught on to that fact
anything else we should know about you johns
christ here i am lettin you play games with our lives when he catches her hands and moves them around his body forcing her into an embrace
we understand why when we see a closeup of her hands they find a jagged purple scar beside his spine
my first run in with riddick
went for the sweet spot and missed
they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there
i can feel it sometimes pressing against the cord
giving her hands back so maybe the care and feeding of my nerve endings is my business
you coulda helped
and you didnt
we hear the chrislams jabbering arabic and calling for captain captain
yeah well look to thine own ass first
it cuts deep
fry and johns move outside
the others have gathered all eyes gang locked on
an arch in the sky luminous ominous it grows from the horizon
what do my eyes see
they watch hypnotically as the arch rises inching toward the two suns
shazza shakes out of the trance first
to fry if we need anything from the crash ship i suggest we kick on
that sand cats solar
multiple shots shazza cranking the sand cat
hands snatching up lights water ropes
chrislams piling aboard the sand cat
sand cat moving
riddick jumping onto the rear bed
paris and audrey running catching up
we stay together
johns doubles back grabs his shotgun shells swings out the door
and catches up to the sand cat
riddick reels him aboard
dont wanna miss this
they turn back to see the rim of a giant planet
its cresting over the horizon
the luminous arch is the planets rings
the sand cat storms through the canyon
as it passes through the massive ribcage
the roll cage smashes out some low bridge bones
the sand cat reaches the crash ship
bodies leap off
paris steals a look at
the rising planet
it threatens to blot out suns sky universe
johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the deck
riddick yanks a second cell and carrying it on his shoulder passes johns with a suck my ass grin
johns shoulders his cell and stumbles after
shazza wheels the sand cat around getting clearance between it and the ship
the chrislams lash a scrap metal sled to the sand cat
riddick drops the first cell onto the sled johns the second
theyre racing the eclipse and each other
as the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun
its like god just closed a blind daylight dims
the change in light brings a growing high pitched sound
dont stop dont stop
but paris cant help himself
he squints to see
the sound seems to come from there
as the rings eclipse the red sun
a second darkness sweeps over the survivors
now they all stop beholding
something pouring from the spire tops
backlit by coronal light it first seems to be smoke or ash but soon we realize these are living things hatchlings squealing in delight over their first nightfall
jesus how many can there
they keep coming filling the sky with thick waves
mercifully the hatchlings seem to be moving away
but now one wave cleaves from another and does a quick about face
just a suggestion but perhaps we should flee
cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold
lesgo lesgo lesgo
reach the cargo hold
turn back to see
riddick and shazza still coming
hearing the squealing wave descending on them
riddick and shazza hit to the dirt
hatchlings torrent just inches overhead
close on shazza
hard to breathe
like being underwater
close on riddick
he watches in awe no more frightened that a kid lying on his back looking up at the stars
experimenting he eases a bone shiv into the hatchlings
instantly its whittled down to nothing
its like a river of razor blades the hatchling keep coming
shazza whips a panicky look at the cargo hold
can she make it
should she even try
tell her to stay there
shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold
suddenly the hatchings vanish
is it safe
shazza gets to her feet
no no no no no
and the wave is back enveloping shazza standing in the mouth of the cargo container the others get a last glimpse of shazza as she flies by the doors caught
up in the funnel cloud of hatchlings
then shes simply gone
still on the ground riddick checks left and right like someone about to cross a busy street
now he gets up smacks his hands clean strolls for the hold
a rising gang clicking
close on fry
she knows the sound better than anyone
the spires are crumbling torn down from within
reaching the cargo hold riddick turns around for one last look
push in as he sheds goggles and looks at the world with his jaguar eyes
riddicks pov in degraded image we see the predators adult hatchlings emerge from the spires
theyre large mammalian hammer headed
they click with echo location sounding out the world they havent inhabited in years
what is it
riddicks pov the predators launch from the hills gliding sounding searching
like i said
aint me you gotta worry about
the rim of the planet overtakes both suns
the world goes dark
vault like doors boom closed
the survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship
somehow theyve been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their cave listening to the howls of the sabertooths
what if shes still out there
well i dont want to jump to conclusions here
but member that boneyard
these just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet okay
chances of shazza knockin on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared
agreeing i saw the cut marks on the bones
wasnt a natural die off
imam is listening at the cargo door
the others pile up alongside ears tuned like radar
clicking sweeps past outside
whispering why do they do that
make that sound
perhaps the way they see
with sound reflecting back
realizing echo location
thats what it is
now more clicking behind them
lights whip around to find
only the door of an open container about halfway down the tunnel like hold
a volley of looks
how the fuck could one get in here
breach in the hull
johns realizes they expect him to check it out
id rather piss glass
well you got the big gauge
wanna rag your fat mouth
maybe its just their beads again
imam are you still no no no i do not believe cmon man youre drivin everybody bugfuck with those things
why dont you just lose the goddamn
more clicking along with the sound of toppling cargo
butching up johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward
the open container
leading with his shotgun he fires blindly around the door
something squeals then silence
johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot
hatchlings on the ground blasted into dog food
to others okay
just some small ones that musta something whooshes for his head swinging like a scythe
it catches his shotgun discharging it giving us
a flash image of an adult predator
in one thin second johns is back with the others
very big beads
not staying in here another
he goes for the main door lever ready to flee into the night
fry lunges for him
christ you dont know whats out there
i know whats in here
everybody come this way and we should be safe
imam shepherds them into a container
the door slams closed
at first only the sound of mouths sucking breathers
then a johns fumbles with a cutting torch
gets it burning
adjusts the gasses to illuminate
scythe like blades are probing joints
suddenly heavy blows drive everyone back
to johns can you do sumpin else with that
sides holding it in my fucking face
taking the hint johns starts cutting the common wall between containers
its a race between the sparks of his cutter and the blades of the predators
an burn outline appears in the common wall
johns kicks out the escape hatch
audrey speed crawls through first as
predators shred into the container right behind them clicking sweeping hunting
series of shots again and again they burn a new escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being vacated always entering darkness
inside their fifth container now johns torches away
fry and paris use cargo to block the entrance hole then block the cargo with their bodies
riddick adds his weight until he notices pepper shot in the cargo
suspecting the worst he leaves the others behind
and moves to the front of the container where darkness prevails
something squishes underfoot
he slips off goggles
riddicks pov of dead hatchlings on the floor
this is the open container the one where johns found predators
sensing energy riddick lifts his face
riddicks pov of an adolescent predator
it squats atop cargo eating a hatchling
a heavy bone blade crowns its skull
sensing riddick it sweeps the area with inquisitive clicks
predator pov of riddick
note the predator pov is a crude image that gives impression without detail
were seeing what the predator hears with echo location
think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in d space
oblivious the others kick out the new escape hatch
audrey fry and johns worm through
imam and pilgrim hang back
hes in a stare down with a predator searching pilgrim rounds a corner and finds his head caught in a vice like grip
riddicks pov as a second predator appears above them
this one reaches down with its scythe blade
and gently probes the two men
it wants know what theyre made of
close on the pilgrims shoes
over running with piss
more blades descend moving over them like surgical instruments
one test slices riddicks shirt
in the next container fry waits anxiously
hissing through the escape hatch imam
where are they
close on a predators scythe blade
it test slices the pilgrims skin
blood wells up
all clicking ceases
tight on the pilgrim more scared now that the clicking has stopped
losing his nerve he bolts
the predators are on him just blurs in the dark
third predator appears above him
making his move riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as
frys light catches him square in the face
blinded riddick howls and stumbles forward
frys light leaps deeper to hit
the predator right behind him with a similar reaction the beast howls and flails back
hold on fry for a time stopped moment
what stopped it
was it really her
suddenly a shotgun explodes beside her head
jacked up johns is blasting shadows
stop it stop it stop it
i killed it
they give him a look
sure you did
suddenly a carcass slams to the floor sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash pattern
christ he did kill one
fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass
wherever the light strikes it the flesh chars and steams
like the light is scalding it
it hurts them
light actually hurts them
vulture sounds from the two o
adolescents fighting over the scraps of the pilgrim
well burn a candle for him later
cargo has been shoved against the door and walls
the survivors gather around frys handlight
audrey tough little audrey has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush
one cutting torch
one handlight here two more in the cabin
i think two more
anything over proof burns well
how many bottles
those umbrellas the ones that mist
would they burn
reading his face if you got a receipt
so maybe well have enough light
enough for what
now she challenges him to be the mind reader
if youre in your right mind i pray you go insane
to others we can stick to the plan
if we get four cells back to the skiff were off this rock
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact but that sand cat wont run at night
well have to carry the cells
whatever it takes
is it just our imagination
or is the light on the floor growing dimmer
with all those things still out there
sounds like a hoot
back it up
how long can this last
no one knows for sure
i had the impression
from the model
that the two planets were moving as one
that there would be
a lasting darkness
those suns gotta come back sometime and if these animals really are phobic about light we just sit tight till then
im sure thats what someone else said
locked inside that coring room
a persuasive thought
eyes swing back to audrey
look we gotta think about everyone now the kid especially
how scared is she gonna be out there
oh dont use her like that for a smoke screen
smoke screen for what
for your own fear
eyes narrowing hey
why dont you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesnt involve mass suicide
two seconds pass
how much you weigh johns
what the hells it matter
because youre kilos of gutless white meat and thats why you cant come up with a better plan
he makes a move for her
johns shotgun bumps the underside of riddicks chin
think about that reward johns
im willing to take a cut in pay
how bout a cut in your gut
johns looks down
camera drops to reveal the shiv riddick holds poised for evisceration
oh trash baby youre gonna regret this
this solves nothing
johns backs off first
the light grows dimmer
to audrey theyre afraid of our light
that means we dont have to be so afraid of them
and youre certain you can find the way back
even in the dark
no im not
but he can
shes pointing of course to riddick
the eclipsing planet dominates half the sky
in whatever coronal light remains we see clouds forming
cargo doors crack open
mixed for maximum flame the cutter is pushed outside and swept around
fry appears behind it
moving like hostages the survivors cross open ground trying not to heed the primal sounds beyond their light
soon they reach
the main cabin
he lifts his goggles
riddicks pov checking the cabin
finding a lot of wreckage but no life
johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first
just as he stands up inside
a predator buzzsaws over his head fleeing the cabin taking off into the night
fuck me you said clear
said looks clear
well whats it look like now
rechecking looks clear
just get the goddamn lights on
they scramble aboard
riddick tongue clicks behind johns
he isnt amused
prep montage we see the survivors powering up cabin lights
yanking three more cells from the battery bay
threading nylon cord through paris misting umbrellas filling the reservoirs with high octane liquor
swapping out o canisters
reloading his shotgun johns finds himself shaking again
he unpockets a shell a red morphine shell and gives it a lovers look
he palms the shell
hell lead you over the first cliff
you know that dont you
were just burnin light here
you give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you
he will leave you all out there to die
i dont get it johns
what is so goddamn valuable in your life that youre worried about losing
is there anything at all
besides your next hype
no response got no right to be so scared
neither one of us
as hands yank the last power cell
cabin lights die
still brooding johns finishes loading his shotgun in the dark
close on a burning wick
alcohol mist shoots across the flame to create
two umbrella torches fabric already burned away belch fireballs into the night
by this light and more we see
imam chained into the first harness of the drag sled
beside him johns fumbles with a second harness
hands help him into the chains
the hands belong to
both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping his captor into chains
to all keep the light going
thats all we have to do to live through this
just keep your light burning
riddick loops a handlight over his neck places it to shine light down his back
to fry be runnin about paces ahead
i want light on my back but not in my eyes
and check your cuts
these things know our blood now
close on audrey
overhearing she goes stone faced
was thinkin we should make some kind of deal
just in case you know this actually shaking head had it with deals
but i just wanted to say nobodys gonna turn a murderer loose
i fuckin knew better
it worries fry
if he doesnt expect to go free
been a long time since anyones trusted me
thats somethin right there
we can cant we
completely genuine thats what i been askin myself
he walks away
hold on fry wondering if she hasnt made a terrible terrible mistake
the drag sled begins moving
series of tracking shots riddick running point goggles off eyes flashing
johns and imam pulling the drag sled like malamutes handlights sweeping
pilgrims at the first side guard position fry and audrey at the second each position carrying an umbrella torch fireballs blazing
paris stumbling along at rear point sweeping the cutter back and forth every shadow a threat
they are a train of light
close on the sled
holding four power cells and eight bottles of booze
close on fry
noting sand cat tracks underfoot
below us run the survivors
crane up and away so that their lights become insignificant
so that we include in foreground the silhouettes of gliding predators
theyre following from above awaiting their chance
frys pov of the ground
the sand cat tracks have vanished
so you noticed too
riddick the procession grinds to a halt
everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light
where are the sand cat tracks
why arent we still following them
saw something i didnt like
hard to tell sometimes
even for me
but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin each others gonads off
thought wed swing wide
okay by you
paris looks over his shoulder
we went around what nearby clicking breaks up the confrontation
to audrey just a detour
hell get us there
can we switch
what switch what
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that
and im not sure i can
off their stares okay thats a lie
i just dont want to be alone back there anymore
if you could just give me a few minutes up front here shes the pilot she should stay close to the cells
oh so im disposable
ill switch ill switch
christ just get this train moving
they trundle on fry the new tail gunner
at side guard paris relaxes a bit even though the clicking never seems far from earshot
a weak fireball spews from his torch
he checks the reservoir
light please need light here
still moving johns and imam train lights on paris while he refuels
for a brief moment audrey strays from the light
predators pov dive bombing the girl
a high velocity clicking its like an incoming missile
imam lunges at the last nanosecond
and flattens audrey to the ground
scythe blades swing
chinking the harness chains on imams back johns whirls blasts
light beams leap around
but the predator is long gone
have we been cut
can someone tell me if
he finds his dropped light thumbs the switch again and again
in the confusion paris has been left in the dark
something slashes him from behind its like the night has claws
oh sweet jesus
the bottle drops
the blood flows
the clicking stops
oh sweet jesus will you get me some faces whip around
but before their lights can rescue him
paris is gone snatched away by a swooping blur
light beams jump fitfully vainly
riddicks pov of predators feasting on paris
carrying a youngling on its back a female predator arrives late and cant find a place at the trough
with shocking apathy it whips the youngling off its back and begins devouring it
other predators start in fighting killing themselves for food
pov pans to a pair of predators closer sounding out new prey
pov pans again to include the object of their desire
audrey close on riddick
trying to figure it out
close on audrey
listening to the horrific feeding sounds
oblivious to all the attention shes getting
what do you see
i see years of hunger
as clouds mass
into a rising wind the survivors range on
audrey now carries paris torch refueled and coughing fireballs at regular intervals
fry seems to be handling rear point fairly well until
the cutter sputters and dies
she ditches it and takes the torch from audrey
four fulls one half
that mean were halfway there
theyve just been blindly following
the light on riddicks back
can we pick up the pace
working like a mule johns growls to himself
if you think you can do better
abruptly he slaps an arm across imams chest spotting
a sled track
in front of them
fry hears a shotgun ratchet
she spins to see
johns out of his chains
jamming the shotgun into the back of riddicks neck
we arent completely stupid
stay in the light
stay in the fucking we crossed our own tracks
hes running us round in circles
look for yourself
what the hell are you listen imagine a hundred geiger counters next to a truckload of plutonium
thats the sound that rides the wind now
i circled once to buy some time to think
think about what
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff
goddamnit were just doin the heavy lifting for this prick
answering fry about the girl
what about her
what its gonna be like when we hit that canyon
with her bleeding
whatre you jaw jackin about
girls not cut
it hits fry like a two by four
she looks at audrey
confessing i didnt want you to leave me there
back at the ship
thats why i didnt say anything
no wed never
oh god honey you shoulda told me sooner
finally getting it aw this cant be happening to me
they been nose open for her ever since we left
they go off blood
we must keep her close then
here shell be safe if we put her between scanning there is no safe
an epic beat
the wind gusts
the flames chatter
their ears fill with canyon sounds
its not gonna work
we gotta go back
hey youre the one who got me out here turned me into a goddamn sled dog
an now you spect me to go back like a whipped dog
i was wrong
i admit it
my bad okay
now lets just go back to the ship
nice breeze wide open spaces you know im startin to enjoy myself out here
are you fucking high again
just listen to no no youre right fry
whats to be afraid of
my life is a steamin pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow
so i say mush on
canyons only couple hundred meters after that were in skiff city
so why dont you just butch up stuff a cork in that kid and get shes the captain we should listen to listen to her
her when she was willing to sacrifice us all
eyes turn to fry
she wants to protest but cant
whats he talkin about
during the crash she a warning growl this does not help us johns
she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us just shut up okay
tried to kill us in our sleep
paris had it right we are disposable
were just walking ghosts to her
would you rag your stupid hole
she rushes him ready to rip his eyes out
he shunts her aside
were not alive because of her were alive in spite of her
he swung below the belt and connected
frys chin quakes her knees fail
the undertow of events finally pulls her down
we cannot go through there
lording how much you weigh right now fry
pushing him back fine fine youve made your point
we can all be so scared as you
johns snatches a light away from imam
to all verdicts in
the light moves forward
they trudge on slower now building reserves for the canyon run
at rear point fry follows like a broken rudder
pilgrim now draws the sled with imam
and up ahead
johns falls in step with riddick
aint all of us gonna make it
just realized that huh
johns blasts the night driving the sound away and reminding everyone of who carries the big gauge
six of us left
if we could get through that canyon and lose just one thatd be quite a fucking feat huh
a good thing right
not if im the one
what if youre one of five
whatre they doin up there
talking about the canyon i suppose
how to get us through
overhearing fry looks
its odd to see johns and riddick walking side by side like equals
look its hellified stuff but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies
its called triage okay
kept calling it murder when i did it
either way figure its something you can grab onto
doping it out sacrifice play
hack up one body leave it at start of the canyon
like a bucket of chum
trawl with it
theres a cable on the sled
we can drag the body behind us
dont wanna feed these land sharks just keep em off our scent
looking back so which one caught your eye
don look don look don look
fry spots riddicks look and johns non look
dont stop just slow down
little more space tween us and them
i would rather we all stay do what i say
whats her name anyway
what do you care
then lets not name the thanksgiving turkey okay
i assume you still got a shiv
what you spect me to do it
whats one more to you
like this is the one that sends you to hell
oh youre a piece of art johns
they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere
or forget the museum maybe they should just hang you
as fry and the others keep slowing
you do the girl ill keep the others off your back
aw dont tell me youre growin scruples
shakes head just wonderin if we dont need a bigger piece of chum
like who mr
extremely tight on both men in their eyes we see the new partnership splintering apart like mr
riddick makes a play for the shotgun it blasts skyward
as the fight erupts bring the light
whatre they doing
whatre we leave the sled lets go go go
fight scene johns light hits the ground creating an arena of illumination
fast clicking nearby
still struggling riddick and johns somehow manage to gang aim the shotgun and blast the the shotgun goes free
johns lunges for it but riddick kicks it into the night
and then pulls his shiv
gotta stay in the light johns
thats the only rule
johns circles inside the light
fucking with him riddick starts poking and jabbing backing him up against the wail of dark
johns stumbles over something
riddick finds his own bone club and now they go at it like two cavemen
riddick beats on johns club hand breaking fingers forcing him to drop the bone
just trying to get away now johns makes a desperate lunge for the light but
riddick shivs open his back
remember that moment
gushing blood johns starts crawling pathetically with the light
riddick dogs him
shoulda never took the chains off johns
you were one brave fuck before
now look at you
oh yeah you were billy bad ass with your gauge
with your chains
johns finds the shotgun and im still billy bad ass
he sweeps it around with the light ready to kill
whered riddick go
clicking behind johns
he whirls to see
something big coming for him johns blasts it back into the night dropping the light as he does
eyes in the back of his head he whirls again and takes aim on
another bull rushing predator
johns triggers a bad round
crazed he ratchets and levels the shotgun for another try
hes too late
big closeup as the ejected shell rolls to a stop
johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark
riddicks pov with johns skewered by the armpits the predator lifts him off the ground and stares with a deceptively gentle predators pov of johns final expression
riddicks pov the predator rears back its head then slams forward hitting johns with the full force of its skull blade splitting him in two
fry imam audrey pilgrim
theyre running stumbling trying to backtrack the sled marks
checking for pursuit fry looks over her shoulder
and crashes into riddick he was just standing in the dark waiting for them
back to the ship huh
get out of our way
so everybody huddles together till the lights burn out
until you cant see whats eating you
that the big plan
conflicted they all look back
audrey starts to puddle up
gonna lose everybody out here
he died fast
and if we got any choice thats the way we should all go out
to audrey softly dont you cry for johns
dont you dare
we hear the canyon in full cry now clicking
battling bone blades
the rending of flesh and snapping of tendon
far below twin flames appear as the survivors reach the gauntlet
predators perch in foreground just hulking silhouettes watching from a canyon rim
they are but five fry riddick audrey imam and pilgrim
close on each face as they listen to the canyon
there must be countless predators ahead
how many you see
one or two
three full bottles
but almost time to refill
doesnt seem like enough to turn back on does it
only see one way
turn the sled over and drag it like that girl down low
light up everything we got and run through like dogs on fire
understanding the sled as a shield
and what about the cells
ill take those
she looks at him hard
were just here to carry your light arent we
just the torch bearers
lets drop back an boot up
start on the power cells
theyre been lashed together into one queue
working amid the giant bones riddick crafts a new harness from the old straps
close behind him imam is muttering in arabic
whatre you doin
blessing you like the others
off his look its painless
a beat i see
well even if you dont believe in god it doesnt mean he wont be you dont see
riddick shrugs into the harness snugs it down
cuz you dont spend half your life in lock down with a horse bit in your mouth and not believe
and you surely dont start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe
oh absolutely i believe in god
and i absolutely hate the fucker
he will be with us
give my blessing to the girl
she needs a spare
burning non stop
fry and imam
sled chains on
lapping up o
each holding a torch
clutching a handlight
rolling under her sled shield becoming the turtle in a metal carapace
he has no desire to see what horrors will surround them
theres just one path anyway straight through
as fast as you can
you sure you can keep as fast as you can
slew of shots fry and imam on the move dragging the shield fast
audrey speed crawling beneath
pilgrim tripping along behind the shield
and riddick behind them all face already tortured pulling pounds of stubborn mule cargo yet somehow keeping pace
the torch flames stretched by the wind flank them in fire
as predators launch from the rim
first come the hatchlings streaming right into their faces then veering away at the last second repulsed by light
next come feral sounds overhead
thin blue liquid spatters them
do not look up
fry looks up and stumbles when she beholds
a ceiling of predators at the cusp of light they dive and weave and dart slashing each other in a rabid desire to sound out the humans below
its like looking into a bucket of angry eels
keep going keep going keep going keep going
his voice whips them like the devils coxswain
chastened fry keeps her eyes down and speed up
more blue blood showers down followed by entrails dropping out of the sky
could this be hell itself
a muttered mantra so dark the clouds around my way i cannot see but through the darkness i believe god leadeth me
i gladly place my hand in his when all is dim and closing my weary eyes lean hard on him
now whole corpses are crashing down around them victims of in fighting
fry and imam start slaloming through the ghastly mess
pilgrim passes too close to a corpse a blade slices his leg drawing blood
he keeps his mouth shut
the passage narrows into a choke point
fry sees it first
ahead a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon what
what is it
its a fucking staircase
go over it
steeling themselves they start climbing
but audrey on all fours has to discover the corpses with her hands then taking exception at being walked on
one corpse snaps at her audrey recoils sideways
and tumbles down the mound of corpses
predators pov rapid fire images of audrey
flashes from different predators
audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as
a predator kamikazes onto the shield its bone blades piercing the metal
and nearly skewering audrey beneath
caught in torchlight steaming the predator howls as it tries to rip free of the shield
beneath audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing
the predator tears clear spins pounces blindly at
riddick standing at lights edge
stunningly he catches the beast under its scythe blades blunting the attack
the predator clicks madly at him
predators pov of riddicks face
the predator rears back its head ready to bisect riddick with its skull blade
switchblade fast riddick drops a hand
yanks his shiv
and sweeps it over the belly of the beast
howling the predator falls disemboweled
reaction shots of fry and imam
didnt know who he was fuckin with
imams head swivels back and forth theyre one person short suleiman
get the girl back under
suddenly pilgrim reappears thrust back into the light by unseen forces
hes still alive but shouldnt be
he makes a feeble attempt to grab onto imam to anyone but hes gone again before they can even react jerked out of the light
out of existence
they flail on
and now finally
the canyon widens opening up like some door to heaven
the worst sounds fall behind
we can see it in their sweat sheened faces the faintest hope that maybe theyve survived the seventh circle of hell
the torches spit and sputter
audrey hears pattering on the metal shield
blood falls anew
one torch dies yet somehow comes back to life
imam upturns a hand checking the liquid for color
but this blood has no hue
no no no
rain montage water rilling running flowing over rocks and ground
caught in a downpour the survivors slog to a stop
one torch goes out and wont relight
so where the hells god now huh
no answer from imam ill tell you where
hes up there riddick
riddick sheds goggles to look ahead
we dont know what he sees nor what hes thinking
tell me the settlement is right there
we cant make it
hold on frys anguished face rendered in dying torchlight
somewhere behind the awful sounds return
hes found a crevice in the canyon wall
they crawl into the fissure
the second torch dies behind them
theres just one light left now the one riddick wears on his back
by its glow we watch him lift the shield muscle it over to the crevice
and slide it over the opening
a black beat
a beat whys he still out there
frys not sure
is he protecting them
or entombing them
working like sisyphus riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise
he stops at the top peers through the rain
riddicks pov of the settlement
riddick disappears over the rise
the four cells follow slithering through the mud like a serpents tail
hes not coming back is he
fry checks imams face
did riddick say anything to you
imam wags his head
a bleak beat before fry realizes she can see his face
theres light in here
its a soft glow from above
imam climbs higher to discover small blue white lights clinging to rocks
he plucks a few
what are they
close on the lights in imams palm
they writhe with life
mind racing how many bottles we got
riddick boards the dark craft
connects the power cells to the battery bay
watches the ship come to life
close on a liquor bottle
its half full of glow worms
more more we need more
they climb higher
little by little the bottle brightens their world
drenched in light riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff looking out into dark rain
is he struggling with a decision
or just savoring the safe harbor
then very deliberately
riddick smashes his handlight on the hull
he steps inside and closes the hatch behind him
something claws its way up the rise
standing we see that its fry a bottle of glow worms strung around her neck
ahead she spies
silhouetted by engine light
as the skiffs engines warm up
as riddick dabbles with flight controls
as fry running splashes past buildings
audrey and imam huddle around a bottle of glow worms this is all they could harvest
presently scrabbling sounds on the shield
imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield
he cant see much until
a blade rushes through the hole imam recoils hard snatches up the glow worm light to see
more predator blades exploring the edges of the shield
the light drives them away
riddick dims interior lights activates exterior lights
hes actually startled by the sight of
standing in the skiffs headbeams
daring him to run her over
riddick opens the hatch
they meet at opposite ends of the gangway fry in the rain riddick in the light
strong survival instinct
admire that in a woman
youre not leaving
not until we go back for the others
he laughs at that
i promised them wed go back with more light
and thats exactly what were gonna do
think youve mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck
what youre afraid
confusin me with johns now fear was his monkey
i only deal in life and death
all that stuff in between
some shade of grey my eyes dont see
i trusted you riddick
goddamn i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race
i wouldnt know how
fry realizes its impossible to shame a shameless man
with desperation edging her voice then wait for me
ill go back myself
just give me more light for them
he tosses her a light
the broken one
just come with me
got a better idea
come with me frys mouth moves but nothing comes out
theyre already dead
get on board
youre fuckin with me
i know you are
course i am but doesnt mean i wont leave you here
if you believe anything about me better be that
no you see i promised them
i have to
i have to go and
shes bleeding resolve
riddick can see it can smell it and he keeps slashing away
step aboard carolyn
tortured i cant
approaching extending a hand here
make it easy on you
dont do this to me
just give me your hand
they could still be
no ones gonna blame you
take my hand and save yourself carolyn
she takes his hand and jerks him down the gangway they sprawl through mud
she gets a knee on his neck
i will not give up on them
i will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things even if it means in a blur riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck
is history repeating itself
riddicks face though is strangely calm
youd die for them
i would try for them
you barely know them
but im human
i know you view that as a weakness but im sorry i do feel fear theirs too
goddamnit riddick yes
i would die for them
more scrabbling at the shield
imam cocks his blade back ready to do battle with
she heaves the shield aside
behind her riddick
big eyed you came for us
yeah yeah were all fuckin amazed
anyone not ready for this
protected by the meager light of two glow worm bottles the four remaining survivors head out
they pile up awkwardly
fry listens hard
i dont hear he covers her mouth
riddicks pov water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise
a predator drinks there
on his breath doesnt see us
wait for it to leave
riddicks pov another predator lands to drink
their backs are to us but the pool is turning into a major gathering place
soon they all can hear clicking above the rain
their nightmare is far from over
get behind me
riddicks pov of a half dozen predators shifting places at the pool
a slim gap appears
when i go we go
close on their hands gripping each other
riddicks pov the gap between predators widens into a passage
a gauntlet within a gauntlet
riddick runs linked like paper dolls the others follow blindly
riddicks pov of a predator turning to stare over its shoulder
predators pov of riddick bearing down fast
the survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs crashing through scattering water and predators alike managing to reach
the muddy rise
audrey loses her grip on the others
and starts back sliding she cries out turning the head of
he catches audrey as her legs hit the pool
he muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top sending her slip sliding down the other side
you know the way
not waiting for him fry and imam disappear over the rise
riddicks pov of the predators
crawling up the rise at us
fry imam and audrey run hard glow worm lights bouncing wildly
riddicks pov chasing them
predators pov chasing riddick fry imam and audrey reach the settlement
they spill around a corner and see
the light of the skiff
riddicks pov ahead of us we see fry imam and audrey vanishing around the corner
breathing like a racehorse we follow in their steps storming around the same corner
suddenly a predator is right there right in our face
predators pov of riddick skidding to a stop
he snaps a look up
riddicks pov of another predator perched gargoyle like on the building
it speed clicks at us
predators pov of riddick slowly pulling two shivs
ready to blade it out
imam and audrey stagger aboard
safe in the light of the headbeams fry turns back panting waiting
he wants her to board the skiff
fry gives it another beat eyes sweeping the dark rain
and just when we think its over for riddick terrible screams are heard from both man and predator theres a helluva fight going on out there
close out there
fry snatches the glow worms off imams neck
and plunges into the darkness homing in on the sounds until
a blade flashes in her face she ducks and spots
bloody muddy hes down on his knees still trying to fight off the shadow beasts that swirl and slash all around him
around them both its me its me its me
she gets the light around his neck
now we see his face clearly and see a very human expression there fear
fry grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up
cmon riddick said id die for them not you
he gets his feet under him
gripping each other they start moving turning like dancers in a macabre waltz hoping the predators cant fix on riddicks blood
keep turning keep turning
othersre already board waitin for us right now
cmon almost there riddick
were almost something jolts them
all clicking stops
extreme closeups searching each others eyes
someone just got slashed from behind slashed bad
not for me
in an eyeblink shes gone ripped from his arms
there was no scream
no final words
out of the blackness a spot of fire races toward us
it resolves into the skiff fabric wings burning off as it hits escape velocity
close on a bloody hand
it toggles through nav charts plots a rendezvous with sol track b shipping lane
in the cockpit riddick finds audrey beside him
she stares hypnotically at the stars ahead
probably okay to talk to me now
not sure where to go
i was just runnin away when this whole thing started
a beat where you goin
i was just runnin away when this whole thing
stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes a course correction
one very bright star comes into view
might interest you
imam moves forward
seeing his face lifts
think a soul could get lost there
with all those pilgrim types
its more a place where souls are found mr
as riddick ponders the possibilities we cut to
the first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet
its light feels cleansing
