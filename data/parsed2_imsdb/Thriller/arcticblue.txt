by ross lamanna flying
not at the intangible height of a jet but at spitting distance from the treetops
were in central alaska the big lonely just north of the arctic circle
a thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills like a deep pile carpet
up at treeline the forest thins to tundra a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the coming of autumn
on the horizon the hills rise to meet the endicott mountains a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and jagged that snow cannot stick to its face
this is how all north america once looked raw indomitable
then abruptly coming into the scene is a colossal etching across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin
bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon or a scar depending on your point of view is the mile long trans alaskan pipeline
even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant by the vastness of the land
it goes on and on and on
a lone man walks along the haul road a one lane gravel trail running parallel to the pipeline
the weather turns sour rough wind and stinging snow cut across the mans path
the man is eric desmond twenty four clean shaven determined
hes clearly out of place here dressed in a business suit and a light camel hair topcoat
eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow a predators tracks those of a wolf or coyote
but the footprints ahead have faded covered by the snow and wind
the weather becomes more oppressive
heavy snow gale winds and sub zero temperatures make his progress tortuous
eric strives stubbornly forward
eric has gathered some branches
he tries to make a fire
moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar of his insufficient coat and his skin is split raw from the cold
his hands are too numb to hold the matches
after several attempts at striking one he slumps down next to the pile of wood exhausted and frustrated
the snow has covered the pile of branches
eric still sits next to it partially covered in snow himself
his face is a death mask eyes half open and dull lips a purplish blue bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over
the wind howls around him
the snow sticks to his eyelashes and hair without melting
eric bolts up in bed
next to him anne marie gauvin sits up and hugs him
all that can be seen of her in the dark is a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair
after a moment eric kisses her
he shakes off the dream and lies back down
a metal sign peppered with shotgun holes is posted near a pipeline support piling eric walks quietly past the sign intent on something ahead of him
although still somewhat boyish in appearance hes confident and resolute in attitude
his clothes have a distinctly western feel lucchese boots levis s mahan cotton shirt
his down parka is unzipped in the sunny windless forty degree afternoon
he pauses then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a four power scope mounted atop it
he peers through the scope
he puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big ivory white timber wolf fifty yards away
anne marie stands beside eric a nikon with a telephoto lens in her hand holding her breath in anticipation
shes twenty three pretty with soft features and piercing blue eyes
she wears eddie bauer womans gear like she was born in it
eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger
but instead of a loud retort there is only the dull pop of a co powered dart gun
the tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolfs fleshy shoulder
the wolf takes off running but almost immediately slows sits then lies down
eric and anne marie hurry over to the wolf who is breathing deeply
eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur
what a beauty
to anne marie hand me the transmitter
anne marie passes to eric a tiny weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band
eric puts the collar loosely around the wolfs neck and crimps it in place all the while talking soothingly to the semi conscious animal
anne marie smiles at erics tenderness and snaps some photos
with the collar in place and transmitter activated eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis
continuing hes coming around fine
be right back
i left my camcorder in the car
as she hurries back to their international scout
on the door of the scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick under which are the words anne marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera
eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and trots unsteadily away
near the treeline the wolf turns glances back at eric and then disappears into the forest
anne marie is taping the wolfs retreat
looking through the viewfinder she crosses a gully between a pipeline piling and a rock formation
eric turns toward her and a glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye
she glances down
something metal is half buried in the dead leaves and gravel
continuing dont move
eric runs over
he pokes at the object with a stick
with a snap a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half
anne marie jumps back
eric brushes the dead leaves on the ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the gully
continuing goddamn trappers
he angrily rips the trap out of the ground unearthing several others attached to one another by a long chain
continuing takes nerve laying traplines on restricted land
eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring point
using the scope as a telescope he scans up and down the haul road
what are you doing
he still might be around
i saw fresh tire tracks coming in
the road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon north and south
in the distance a jeep is parked on the haul road
near it a man climbs down into another shallow ravine
eric hurries down the footpegs
man and a jeep about a mile and a half down
he jumps into the scout
anne marie stuffs her cameras into the hatchback
as soon as she climbs in eric tears out
it races along the dusty gravel road at mph
startled at the approach of the scout the trapper uproots his traps and runs out of the ravine
he whistles and another trapper appears nearby
they pile into their dilapidated all terrain jeep
its oddly well equipped however
bolted to the dashboard is an expensive tape player and a beat up radio beacon receiver with a round locating screen
they zoom off
eric stomps on the gas
the dust from the jeep obscures his view but hes gaining on them anyway
anne marie hangs on and squints her eyes against the choking dust
the driver is lemalle a tall ugly rawboned canadian
his entire outfit is made of animal hide
he has long red hair and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic sneer
while driving he scans along the pipeline
where the fuck did you drop corbett off
in the passenger seat mitchell chews tobacco and looks grim
hes a squat flat faced okie with curly matted hair and tired grey eyes
hes dressed in a brown long coat and has a colt
peacemaker in a quick draw holster strapped to his leg
despite his intimidating air confrontation is not his style
he spots a figure up ahead where the road crosses a muddy creek
hes over there
turning sharply the trappers jeep splashes through the creek bed without slowing
bouncing it comes down hard against the axle deep bank at the creeks high water mark
lemalle tries to back out but cant find traction in the mud
eric stops the scout thirty yards behind them
eric opens his door
to anne marie stay here
be careful therere two of them
eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to anne marie
if i unzip my parka stick this out the window
eric confidently approaches the jeep
then a third trapper climbs from the creek
hes got a line of traps slung around his neck and a world of experience on his face
hes ben corbett a life long huntsman somewhere past forty weathered beyond his years
he has a feral nose thick beard and dark smart hunters eyes
he wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt cotton coveralls and vapor barrier mountain boots
on his belt is a holster rig cradling a
eric slows down
he didnt expect to face anyone as formidable as corbett
emboldened by corbetts presence lemalle reaches into the back seat and grabs his
by swedish military carbine
to lemalle no shooting
lets see whos so interested in us
corbett has an incongruously affable voice
he throws his traps into the jeep then strides closer toward eric
to corbett aint worth it ben
as corbett comes closer eric realizes this might notve been a great idea
corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the air as if by this he can gauge his opponents mettle
you got two counts against you trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land
cant be much of a crime if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid
i got your plate number asshole
maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail
corbett just smiles
but lemalle rankled sticks the carbine out the jeep window
seeing the rifle pointed at him eric freezes then slowly unzips his parka
sure you dont want me to drop the fucker
corbett doesnt answer
then his eyes narrow and he looks past eric at the scout
the passenger in the scout sticks what looks like another rifle out the window
eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure anne maries backing him up
you leave and dont come back thats the end of it
after a long moment corbett smiles again then turns away from eric
he motions lemalle to the front of the jeep
frustrated lemalle slams back the safety on the carbine and throws it in the back seat
mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine
lemalle and corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut
while pushing corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp piece of granite
he cusses and pushes harder
eric walks back to the scout
he feels the trappers eyes on his back but forces himself not to hurry
the trappers free their vehicle
corbett gets in the drivers seat and they take off
anne maries hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic tranquilizer rifle back in the window
unnerved great idea pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high powered hunting rifle
bastards took off though didnt they
the trappers have left the flatlands of the haul road area
now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills
corbett broods while driving
mitchell looks out the window
the silence makes lemalle uncomfortable
all this fuckin land and were locked out
makes me puke
jawing about it wont change it
three hundred seventy five million acres in this state
im real tired of runnin into people
then dont look to your left
a brand new land rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a bend in a small river
scattered about is an assortment of expensive camping gear beer cans spent shells and other garbage
three toy macho vacationing sportsmen are guzzling beer and blasting fish in the shallow river with gauge shotguns
they look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and stops
lemalle grabs his carbine
leave it here
lets keep going
were only an hour from devils cauldron
pats mitchells shoulder relax
i just want to ask them how the hunting is
corbett gets out of the jeep
he regards the sportsmen their shotguns and their mess with ill concealed contempt
the sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch corbett
he walks around the camp spotting a rubber lined rucksack stuffed with dead ermine
after a long tense moment corbett smiles
looks like youve had some luck
wheres your guide
were on our own if its any of your damn business
re ermine you did real good
he crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur
to corbett no swinging shit
theyre over their goddamned limit
to sportsmen my friend is right
supposed to have a licensed guide when youre on this land too
hey we paid our fuckin permit fees
lemalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire
no one notices that in the b
quiet sportsman unzips his parka exposing a
peacemaker in a belt holster
i were you id drive right on outta here again
calmly this was my roaming land til the government took it over
only innuit can hunt here now and tourists like you
corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of the land rover
pissed sportsmen and step closer to him
continuing according to tribal law hunters passing through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive
they can eat the meat but have to surrender the hides
lemalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the ermine
want the meat
fuck you dirtball
corbett chuckles and mitchell spits
lemalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the land rover many still in their packages
he helps himself to some sandwiches and a pack of beer
i say shoot em bury em with their shiny new car
to lemalle if youre gonna take something take it and lets go
corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack
suddenly sportsman reaches inside his parka and pulls the pistol
he swings it toward lemalle
lemalle looks up when he hears the hammer cock
there is a deafeningly loud shot
sportsman falls down dead at lemalles feet
off to one side corbett holds a huge smoking
magnum six shooter in his hand
shotgun in hand sportsman gauges his chances of blasting corbett
when corbett turns to him he lies the weapon down
sportsman rushes to his friend
looking bleak mitchell spits again
corbett crosses to lemalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to steal
chastised lemalle smolders
after a moment to sportsmen put him in your truck
smell of blood will attract the bears
to trappers lets go
as corbett walks to the jeep hes too angry to notice that hes stepped in a patch of mud under the land rover
near the jeep lemalle stops and pulls them into a huddle
i dont believe in leavin witnesses behind ben
it was self defense
leave it at that
you think those fucks will tell it that way
ending the argument well get a head start before they go crying to the law
corbett turns and fires two rounds from his
into the engine of the land rover
the sportsmen stare and sputter
continuing to sportsmen you can pack out of here two three days hike along this river at most
weather should hold this early in the season
corbett and mitchell get in their jeep
isnt yet satisfied
he walks back over to the sportsmen kneeling beside their fallen friend and crouches right beside them
intimidated sportsman looks away but lemalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him
think im pretty
you better forget how we look cause next time they wont keep me from killing you
this land aint quite civilized you know
he unsheathes his buck knife
below frame he slices across the forehead of the dead sportsman peels back his scalp and cuts it loose indian style
the sportsmen are stunned and sickened
corbett looks at mitchell and wearily shakes his head
at least he scalped the dead one
devils cauldron hot springs is a cluster of twenty tiny dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk
the town squats ugly and temporary looking in a dirt clearing fifty miles north of the arctic circle
thirty miles east of the pipeline its almost dead center of interior alaska
at the edge of town is a gravel airstrip
mixed with the prospector era sod roof cabins are a few prefabricated houses
the boon brought by men building the pipeline is long gone
now only a few itinerant loggers natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom each other and the depression of the oncoming winter
enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually blanket the valley with fog
the spa is log walled and horseshoe shaped with partitioned baths inside
facing it are a mud walled fire bath a wooden steam bath called a maqi six one room cabins for let and an unused dance hall
leo meyerling opens the tailgate of a dodge truck with the northland petroleum logo and district supervisor on the door
meyerling is short and bald with a completely disreputable face
he staples a poster on a wall
it has a picture of him on it and for state legislature corbett and the other trappers drive past meyerling and park their jeep as the sun disappears behind the
a handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church meetings reads live each day so you can look every damn man in the eye and tell him to go
there is a post office in the corner with some combination boxes and a wicketless window
the trappers come in
corbett sits in a chair and pulls his boots off
one of his wool socks is wet
he nods to the man sitting in the other chair sam wilder
wilder is short and tough with a full head of crewcut grey hair and weather ravaged face that makes him look older than his sixty years
yeah real slow and id like to keep it that way
conciliatory just passing through
a chubby inupiat interior eskimo wearing thick glasses several heavy sweaters and battery heated socks fusses behind the counter
hes earl kenai owner of the hot springs spa and the general store
lemalle chews on a handful of bear jerky
kenai stares at lemalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky
corbett pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to kenai
continuing re boot needs patching
twenty five dollar
smiles sure have learned to worship the white mans god
kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out
corbett pays him
meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the corkboard
i hope i can count on you gentlemen to vote for the peoples friend this november
share some of that oil company money in your pocket and you can
meyerling smiles like a toad then slaps another poster on the wall
lemalle throws his knife and it sticks in the poster between meyerlings spread fingers
meyerling jumps back and the trappers laugh
meyerling looks to wilder for support
to meyerling one flier comes loose and i shoot you for littering
exiting grudgeless have your fun
just remember the peoples friend come election day
shakes his head oil company candidate running on that slogan makes about as much sense as a rat fucking a grapefruit
hard to work up an interest in politics way we live
youre the first people weve seen in two weeks
to kenai how about a quart of jack daniels
how about it is right
back in the primary this town was voted dry
to corbett aw shit
leave a note for viking bob tell him to meet us in cache
one more day without drink wont kill you
im living proof of that sad fact
can we buy the marshal some dinner
no i better stay at my post
even without the hootch riling em up you know how mean spirited folks get when they smell winter coming
an early storm has blown in from the north bringing whipping winds and freezing rain
corbett peers out the tiny window frowning
lemalle cleans his carbine while eating beans and bacon
mitchell hunches over a table
hes making a scrimshaw delicately engraving using homemade tools on a palm sized piece of whale bone
he rubs his eyes and looks up at corbett
so much for the walking weather you predicted
had no choice
pointedly at lemalle given the situation
least you didnt shoot all of them
fuck you mitchell
woulda been my ass if ben didnt waste that prick
after a beat mitchell look it dont take three of us to wait for viking bob
mitchell glances at lemalle then at corbett
continuing go ahead
take the jeep
ill come to cache with bob when he gets here
okay by me
youre the one likes these hot springs so much
leave my traps
well tag up couple days
the winds have died down
the rain has turned to a light snow
a mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the haul road
its a double unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass and aluminum pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires
the front module is by the rear by
an extended cab pickup pulls up and sam wilder gets out
the gravel and dirt haul road paralleling the pipeline for miles is closed to the public
an arriving vehicle therefore is news
the front door of the dwelling opens
eric and anne marie come outside delighted to see wilder
i was making my rounds saw your hangar wide open plane getting rained on so i closed it up
to wilder i bet you havent had lunch
smiles bet youre right
but i didnt come by to wangle a meal we appreciate the company
anne maries getting cabin fever already
anne marie shoots a look at eric but doesnt disagree this is obviously an issue with them
wilder looks with amusement at the mobile dwelling
whatd you say they call these spaceships
mobile arctic dwelling mad
i call it the turtle as in carrying your home on your back
best thing is meyerling has to chase around to find us
laughs the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do
watch it with meyerling
mans as mean and corrupt as they get
cut his mothers throat if itd get him a couple votes
looking past wilder eric points out some smoke on the horizon
hey sam look over there
black and white smoke
likely thats an sos
have to pass on that lunch
well go with you
everything seems peaceful enough
the sos fire made from burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black smoke has burnt down to embers
eric anne marie and wilder pull up in wilders pickup
the two sportsmen sit in the front seat of the land rover but they dont react to the arrival of the rescuers
in the back seat a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass
something is amiss
eric shoots a look of trepidation at anne marie as they get out of the pickup
wilder pulls the door of the land rover open
a sportsman slumps out onto the ground
his eyes are open and his tongue pokes out between his lips
his skin is blue white
he looks in fact much like erics nightmare
startled eric steps back
anne marie gasps with horror
wilder unzips the sportsmans light windbreaker and listens for a heartbeat
stupid goddamn greenhorns
froze to death
its not even winter
they got wet in the rain
core body temperature dropped got drowsy probably didnt even know what was happening
eric stares at the dead sportsmen
continuing question is why they sat here when the storm moved in
check their stuff while i sniff around
wilder tries the ignition
the starter turns over but the engine makes a horrendous grinding
he walks to the front of the vehicle
noticing the bullet holes in the grille he bends down for a closer look
eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful supplies
still in their packages are some matchbox sized elt locating beacons
they had emergency locater transmitters but didnt use them
opens one up shakes his head maybe because they didnt bring batteries
anne marie opens the back door of the land rover
she pulls back the camping blanket
and uncovers the third sportsman
the torn red flesh on his head and his bugged out eyes are a hideous sight
anne marie screams and stumbles away
eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath
wilder looks at the third sportsman and angrily kicks the side of the land rover
im too old for this shit
any idea who couldve done it
sourly wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the vehicle
a certain sonofabitch bastard more wilder contd wearing a damaged mountain boot
left a footprint clear as an autograph
wilder examines the sportsman finding the bullet hole in his chest
continuing even for ben corbett this is nasty
mans got balls
he was sitting in devils cauldron when i left calm as can be
you can arrest him
corbetts awful hardbitten these days
wilder leans against the land rover feeling tired
continuing his old roaming areas all private reserve now
normally long as he stays civil in my jurisdiction i let him be
beat wont be able to take him by my lonesome though
nobody in townll lift a finger on this
eric looks hard at the dead sportsmen
quietly ill go into town with you
eric leave it alone
its not your business
shakes his head no way can he get away with this
ill be back by tonight
the town is quiet
corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy inupiat hooker dixie
he looks up as eric comes into the spa
eric holds corbetts boots which have been repaired
eric pauses when he sees corbett
there is a flash of recognition between them
afraid you have me at a disadvantage
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these
didnt expect wed already met
no big deal
we just got off on the wrong foot
whats your name
eric glances down at corbetts duffel bag which sits on the floor next to corbetts tub
corbetts magnum rests on top of it well within reach
corbett notices erics interest in it
he leans back and smiles
new to the country kid
ecological study for northland oil
folks use that term for everything but what it means whos eating who
putting his hand on dixies shoulder corbett stands and gets out of the tub
his sinewy body resembling a scarecrow made of steel cable is covered with scars
he wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to eric
continuing now why dont you get around to saying what you want
corbett grabs his boots from eric and finds himself facing a revolver which eric has been hiding inside one of the boots
continuing smiling you wouldnt shoot anyone
but i would
wilder has come in the back way and stands behind corbett with a gauge shotgun
he kicks corbetts magnum out of reach
all this for laying traps on private land
you left a footprint at the sportsmens camp
only pretty sight there ben cause the two men you didnt shoot and mutilate died of exposure
corbett shakes his head but remains implacable
christ if i shouldnt know better than to step in soft earth
ive seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old
to eric i got it from here
to wilder sam give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit will you
eric comes outside
earl kenai overdressed for the weather in gloves mukluks and a full length sealskin coat stands shivering by a woodshed near the hot springs hacksawing a piece of meat from
a frozen moose carcass
before white men came my people lived in sod houses underground and laid our dead on the tundra
now we live above ground and bury our dead and we havent been warm since
wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and corbetts duffel bag cradled in his arm
handcuffed corbett walks in front of him
kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with corbett as he goes by
corbett stops next to eric and smiles
nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window
see you again maybe
as he leads corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of town
they approach a prefab house perched on skids under a tall antenna tower
mounted above the shack a dc wind charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze
from within the cabin comes an anomalous sound mtv
wilder knocks on the door
arthur neff a pasty white year old ex texan pulls the door open
his customary grin fades when he sees corbett
wilder pushes corbett inside past neff
i need to call fairbanks
neff just stares at corbett
dial it up
with a what can i do but oblige
look to corbett neff sits in front of the rca alascom radio telephone and dials
on phone fairbanks alascom
patch me through to the state police
after a moment he hands the receiver to wilder
wilder takes it keeping one eye and the shotgun on corbett
on phone this is sam wilder marshal in devils cauldron
had some killings here
i got a suspect be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands
thru phone on a good day i couldnt spare a crosswalk guard
but now no way
folksre batshit with the weather turning sour
bring him in yourself
on phone next planes not coming til next monday
thru phone sit your suspect out in the cold
on phone this mans friends aint gonna look favorably on his incarceration
thru phone mr
glib so shoot him
wont have to feed him that way angry wilder slams the receiver down
in one room there is a wood burning cookstove and an ashley heat stove a table a bunk and a small window
behind a cloth partition is an eight by six holding cell
the frame of an iron bar door is securely cemented to the log walls
wilder comes in with corbett and locks him in the cell
mind if i get some stuff from my kit
wilder does mind
he locks the duffel bag and corbetts
in his desk drawer
continuing sam listen i shot to defend my man
other guy drew first
if that was all fine
but carving him up stranding the others thats too fucking much
is everything that walks crawls flies or swims fair game to you
softly ill get loose before that plane comes
dont try me
ill kill you if it comes to it
as eric walks into kenais general store neff hurries over
grins sticks his hand out arthur neff
area rep for the federal assistance plan
tell the boys in dc to keep those goodies coming
snowplow generator tv dish
hell we get the goddamn playboy channel
here this is for you
he hands eric a piece of styrofoam shaped like a commode seat
continuing warm to forty below
remember anything you want you ask arthur neff
the storm has passed
a faint chugging emanates from the small orange generator trailer behind the turtle
eric pulls up and parks the scout
nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds erics research equipment and anne maries photographic supplies
in one corner of the turtle are several of her black and white prints
all are of man made objects whose presence is juxtaposed with the natural surroundings
relieved hes home in one piece anne marie meets eric at the door and kisses him
carrying a brown paper wrapped package eric follows her into the kitchen where shes preparing dinner
did you catch corbett
he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road
was there any trouble
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker
going after killers isnt the same as chasing poachers eric
grins cant help myself
corbetts type always pisses me off
hands her the package oh i found this at the post office
had your name on it
perplexed she looks at the return address bloomingdales
delighted she tears it open
inside is a pretty elegant dress
anne marie kisses him
you were looking at it in the catalog
dont know where you can wear it
ill wear it for you
and i can wear it when we go home
we wont be here forever
frowning you make it sound like a prison sentence
thats not what i meant
its exactly what you meant
look why get into this again
as long as its working lets leave it alone
its been nice so far
were together permanently
sighs do i want to be with you permanently
yes i think i do
but be with what you do and the way you live
that i dont know
cmon eric until i met you coming back to alaska was totally out of the question for me
but im here
im getting great pictures and im having fun
slips her arms around him i love you
kisses him so shut up and lets eat
an old primer grey station wagon rattles into town and parks
with an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth viking bob corbett gets out and stretches
hes six foot six with sandy hair beard ruddy skin and his brothers dark eyes
he looks around for some sign of life
he spots neff tending one of the windmills and walks over to him
im looking for some trappers
ben corbett mitchell lemalle
said they were going to cache
they were thirsty but we were voted dry
as viking bob walks back to his station wagon he notices kenai poking around in front of wilders cabin
illuminated by a bare bulb is wilders typical bush country front yard
piled are five cords of wood boxes tarps stove parts saw horses gallon drums dismantled snow machines wash tubs tires etc
bunching his collar around his neck kenai shivers and sorts through corbetts traps
viking bob ambles over to kenai
gonna make an offer
man who owns them wont need them where hes going
wilder peers out the window and sees viking bob then turns to corbett
back against the bars
wilder handcuffs corbetts hands to the cell door bars then quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across corbetts face covering his mouth
magnum in his belt wilder coatless slips outside
as soon as hes out the door corbett cranes his neck and painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner of the door hinge
the look on wilders face tells kenai to shut up
viking bob realizes somethings up
your brother and the boys left me some traps to sell for them
theyre gone to cache
so i heard
ben never said nothing to me about selling his gear
corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth
he pries one of his boots off and kicks it through a window
they got me on a murder charge
wilder pulls his
ill have to keep you here til i ship him south
viking bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at wilder then punching him in the gut
wilder sprawls among the junk dropping his revolver
kenai freezes not about to take sides
before viking bob can come at him again wilder grabs for his
viking bob jumps back and bolts for his car
he dives into his station wagon and starts it up
as he drives past wilder pops off a few rounds but viking bob keeps going
kenai helps wilder up
pissed wilder shoves him against the cabin
continuing you stupid greedy loudmouth sonofabitch
hell have the others here in a few hours
you fucked me up now youre gonna help me move him
shakes head forget it sam
i never work for free
anne marie sits on the floor editing one of her videotapes
on the monitor it shows footage of the traps under the pipeline piling
eric comes out of the back module holding two elt pendants
he glances over at the monitor and nods approvingly
i still cant believe im being financed by an oil company
especially when they get a look at these pictures
technology in the wilderness not too pretty
re elts whats that
i thought i should check our emergency transmitters
eric activates the elts
they emit an sos pattern of radio waves three short three long and three short
this is visible as rhythmic interference on anne maries video continuing avalanche season is coming
two straight months of night we may never get out of bed
kisses him which would suit me fine
prolonged darkness makes people crazy
she turns on a small s vhs video camera and snaps off the room lights
continuing allow me to give you a practical demonstration of low light infrared photography
she does so by seductively undressing for the camera
shes seen on the monitor illuminated by the light from the hot stove
eric appreciates the show
he crawls toward her
continuing high tech in the wilderness
gets me excited too
laughing he wrestles her to the rug
there is a full moon and a clear night sky
viking bobs station wagon is parked out of sight
he sits inside waiting
he hears an engine starting in the distance
sitting up he grabs some binoculars
wilders extended cab truck pulls out heading west
in the bright moonlight two people are seen in wilders truck as it speeds along a dirt road
viking bob follows at a discreet distance headlights off
viking bob turns and takes the literal high road a narrow trail above the roadway that wilders truck is on
he zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry then drops back down onto the road and waits in ambush
as wilders truck approaches viking bob turns on his bright lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun
wilders truck screeches to a stop
kenai gets out with his hands up
viking bob slowly approaches wilders truck
viking bob looks in the cab
kenais passenger is dixie the inupiat hooker
viking bob grabs kenai and pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek
continuing wheres ben corbett
i have no argument with you bob
wilder said i could keep his truck if i drove it ten miles away from town
where did they go
he didnt say but i would guess the opposite way from here
viking bob shoves kenai against the truck then punches him for good measure
cussing he runs back to his station wagon and drives off
eric and anne marie are asleep
eric starts awake at the os sound of a high pitched vehicle horn and an approaching eric pulls the door open
wilder is untying corbett from the snowmobile
i got an emergency on my hands
corbett smiles at eric as he walks inside
eric wilder and corbett sit in the front module
anne marie nervous wearing a down robe serves coffee
she stares at corbett trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor with what she saw that afternoon
corbett smiles at eric
to eric you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station well be in fairbanks in a few hours
thats what we shouldve done in the first place
i couldve sat tight for the transport til bob came poking around
to wilder re anne marie a lot to ask dragging him away from such a good looking girl irritated to take you to jail
itll be my pleasure
to eric you better get some sleep
flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises
go too low one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it
hard ill get you there all right
eric takes anne marie to the rear module leaving wilder with his prisoner
a bottle of erics scotch sits almost empty on the table beside wilder
wilder dozes in a chair facing corbett
corbett is awake
he contorts his body to bring his handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of him
he eyes wilders
its in a lefty sam browne holster
no way to take it without waking wilder
corbett stands and inches toward the door
as he pulls it open the insulation makes enough noise to stir wilder
wilder gets up and pushes corbett back into his chair
goddammit i dont need this aggravation
ill shoot you ben
bank on it
i dont want to hurt you sam
im not too old to knock the snot out of you
wilders mind clears enough to realize that corbetts hands are in front of him
he reaches for his
corbett butts into wilders midsection with his head
amazingly wilder stays on his feet
corbett hurries back to the door
wilder lunges bull determined to hold onto him
corbett smashes wilder across the face with his clenched hands
wilder goes down hard hitting his head on the table and stays there
corbett instinctively kneels to see if wilder is still breathing
but then hearing movement in the rear module corbett flees
eric is pulling on his pants
eric rushes in
the outside door is open and wilder lies on the floor
his holster is empty
anne marie comes in and crosses to wilder
eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the company issue equipment coming up with a huge remington bolt action bear rifle
unfamiliar with weapons eric tears open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle
corbett is trying to start erics scout
eric fires a loud warning shot from the turtle doorway
you want to try that handgun against this rifle go ahead
corbett sits in the scout for a long moment weighing his odds
he takes his hands off the steering wheel
eric shoots again this time smashing the side view mirror and window next to corbetts head
still handcuffed corbett gets out of the scout
gingerly by the butt he puts it on the hood of the scout
some day you might have to face me without a gun
eric leads corbett in
anne marie is cradling wilders head
eric looks at wilder
there is blood coming from his ear and hes fading fast
thickly fetch him back
eric nods dont let him walk
eric nods again
wilder holds his gaze on eric then simply stops breathing
eric is stunned
quietly corbett sits down
clutching the rifle eric sits on the floor and glares at corbett
softly does he have people
after a beat a daughter in oregon
send him down to her
theres money in my duffel bag back at his cabin
corbetts benign attitude is chilling
i better call in
he turns the shortwave radio on
it sparks and burns out
the remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it
continuing thought of everything huh
surviving is what i know killing is what you know
to anne marie pack some food while i prep for the flight
off her look im sure not gonna let him go
covering corbett with the rifle eric handcuffs him to the sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit
viking bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt road
the huge night sky all but smothers the weak light from the town up ahead
cache seems a mistake a jumble of unpainted buildings in the middle of a big nothing twenty miles north of the arctic circle
still its more animated than devils cauldron
there are a hundred permanent residents several taverns and a three store fly in shopping center
even though its the middle of the night people roam the streets drinking and socializing
with only a couple feet of snow on the ground this is still summertime
under storefront awnings drunken indians sleep on the concrete
viking bob cruises the main drag looking for the other trappers
he spots their jeep in front of a dangerous looking saloon called the bear sign inn
as he parks and gets out of his station wagon
he hears a familiar voice around the side of the building
cmon girl talk to me negotiate with me
drunk lemalle stands in an alley with a bored acne scarred oriental prostitute
he weaves and leers his hand stuck inside her blouse
we got a problem
mitchells inside boring bastard
grumbling viking bob separates lemalle from the prostitute and drags him by the collar out of the alley
meyerlings campaign posters cover the walls
many have been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd
in a booth covered with grafitti mitchell squints and works on his scrimshaw
lemalle somewhat sober eats a plate of muktuk whale blubber
viking bob pours him more coffee
to viking bob ben never sent a signal
musta never got a chance to more viking bob contd activate
wilders aiming to take him to fairbanks we can count on that much
meaning hell need a plane
closest planes for hire are here in cache
to lemalle remember that cessna we saw at the pumping station on the haul road
belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline
there you go
wilders always chummy with the fuckin bambi lovers
its a long shot
you got a better idea
wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky
eric comes out of the turtle leaving the front door ajar
he throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the scout
corbetts right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit
terrified about being alone with corbett anne marie cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him
how long have you been up north
after a beat six months
too keen a sense of this place in your pictures
six months this time
i was born in the aleutians
your people alaskan
anne marie doesnt want to talk to a killer but corbett is so soft spoken and charming that she answers despite herself
my dad was a navy doctor
knew you had no native blood even with your dark hair
blue eyes give you away
my wife had blue eyes
had some good years
met her in
she showed up one day in coldfoot
no one knew her
one sunday morning she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder
didnt work out in three months shed return the money and leave no hard feelings
off anne maries amazed look my bid was eight thousand dollars
how did she
i was gone in september laying traplines
she went to our cache for some meat
got mauled by a bear
tore open her skull
more corbett contd mightve lived if she got help but the exposed part of her brain froze
anne marie shudders
smiling good naturedly corbett looks around spotting the package anne maries new dress came in
continuing what about you why come back
classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things
thats why i left moved to washington
when i met eric i was doing day shoots products and fashion mostly
eric was teaching college and then he got the job with northland oil
we wanted to stay together so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography
and here i am
as shes talking the turtle rocks slightly
she looks out the tiny window
eric is putting wilders body inside an enclosed storage compartment built flush into the side of the turtle
horrified anne marie turns away
you should know something
i dont want to talk any more
wasnt my intention to hurt wilder
im telling you the truth
i liked the man
i only meant to get loose
your cheechako boyfriend better understand that
beat listen ive got some money put away dont ever think you can buy eric off mr
eric comes in none too thrilled about anne marie chatting with corbett
he carefully stuffs wilders magnum in his belt and ignores anne maries disparaging look as he does
to corbett lets go
wait a second
anne marie leads eric out of earshot from corbett
eric keeps a cautious eye on him
maybe you should drive him into devils cauldron let them decide what to do with him
reassuringly fairbanks is a three hour flight
ill be back by dinnertime
realizing hes determined she sighs and kisses him
continuing be careful okay
thats my line
eric and corbett drive toward the deserted pumping station
they cross over a prefabricated steel portal bridge spanning a fast running creek
the wind whips through the shot out wing window
corbetts handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon rope
the pumping station consists of three corrugated steel buildings
the largest is an airplane hangar
just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip running parallel to the haul road
eric pulls up to the hangar
suddenly lemalle steps out from behind the building
lemalle recognizes the international scout
he swings his rifle up to stop it
eric slams it in reverse and screeches back around the hangar
aim for the tires
lemalle fires as the scout rounds the corner
he hits a fender doing no damage
angry he runs after the vehicle
eric slams on the brakes and turns the scout around
let me out and keep going
they catch us theyll kill you
eric doesnt need any convincing of that
he tears out
mitchell runs out in front of them and blasts the front of the scout with his
steam hisses out of the radiator
eric floors it and races past mitchell almost hitting him
mitchell and lemalle shoot at the retreating vehicle
one of the scouts back tires gets blown out
eric slows shifts into four wheel drive and continues driving on the rim
chewing an unlit cheroot viking bob pulls up next to mitchell and lemalle in the trappers jeep
they pile in
eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle
as the scout heads for the feldspar creek bridge it disappears from sight over a hill
viking bob zooms over feldspar creek
they come over the rise but the scout still cant be seen ahead of them
the scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed below the haul road
above the trappers speed past without noticing
after giving the trappers time to get around the next bend eric drives the scout up the embankment and crosses back over the bridge
eric stops the vehicle
he grabs a five gallon gas can and a piece of cloth from the back
the prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the army corps of engineers left over from the building of the pipeline
eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and the honeycombed underside of the bridge
he puts the rag inside the spout of the can lights it with a match and runs like hell back to the scout
the trappers realize their quarry is missing
viking bob slams on the brakes and looks around
eric speeds away
theyll still catch us
all youre doing is pissing them off
the gasoline can explodes tearing the bridge couplings away from the concrete abutment
the trappers see the explosion behind them
they turn around and head toward it
eric parks the scout sideways to block the way to the airstrip
with the magnum at the ready eric cuts corbetts handcuffs loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar
the leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on rollers
eric unlocks it and rolls it back
inside is a cessna dusted with snow and ice blown through the cracks by crosswinds
eric brushes the windshield with his sleeve
the trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge burning and disconnected from the creek bank
eric helps corbett into the cockpit then secures his handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope
viking bob assesses the damage to the bridge
loose from the abutments it wobbles like a diving board
below the water is too deep and fast moving to be traversable
eric tries to turn the engine over
the starter is sluggish from cold and lack of use
viking bob looks at the others bursting with frustration
he climbs into the drivers seat
we can jump it
they hop in
he screeches backwards to get a running start revs the engine pops the clutch and tears toward the bridge
as they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle under them
with a sickening wrenching the crossbar supports crumple
the jeep flies through the still burning gasoline becomes airborne and scrapes to a rude stop on the edge of the pavement on the other side the back wheels dangling
lemalle and mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end of the jeep onto solid earth
eric finally starts the plane and taxis out onto the landing strip
the trappers drive up to where the scout blocks their path
they pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing strip
it picks up speed and takes off
below the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads
lemalle points his carbine at it but viking bob pushes the rifle down
corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him
viking bob watches wide eyed with fury
lemalle punches the wall
then he turns and repeatedly blasts the scout parked nearby with his carbine
erics knapsack an emergency kit and several five gallon cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats
how the hell were they smart enough to find us
thats why im sitting in this plane and theyre down there blowing me kisses
eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the southwest
corbett notices that eric seems a little unsure of the controls
continuing been driving long
i needed a pilots license to take the job here so i got one in six weeks
that makes the flight more interesting
eric ignores the jibe
he stays at feet making the landscape all the more immediate
corbett stares out the window and broods
he spots an open snow covered area where some dark blotches mar the whiteness
continuing see the blood
pack of wolves took down a moose
greedy gut ripping sons of bitches
id kill the last wolf on earth right in front of the president of the u
stinking cowardly predator the wolf
sounds like professional jealousy
hunting and trapping was a damn fine life
beat me and mitchell bob and lemalle we were teams
id always go with mitchell
good man mitchell
id let bob worry about goddamn lemalle
wed hire a plane in october
on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere wed drop supplies
wed land tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas
while talking in an even tone corbett intently studies the instrument panel and scans the landscape below
the idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did
along the route wed set our traps
made our years living in three months
corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains above the tree line
continuing lot of times we didnt even have a landing strip
wed set down on a plateau like that one there
yeah that ones easy you could glide right in
suddenly he turns in the seat and pins eric against the door with his left foot
the plane flies erratically
with his right foot corbett kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel jamming it on
the lever used to empty the fuel tanks in case of emergency does so with great expediency
all the gas is instantly discharged
corbett releases eric and calmly sits back up in his seat
eric rubs his neck incredulous
corbetts move was too fast and too outrageous
in a moment the engine sputters to a stop
eric struggles to hold the stick steady and glide the plane down to the plateau corbett pointed out
hope you got your moneys worth on those lessons
theres an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the plateau
eric pushes the cessnas nose down
the plateau comes up fast
the plane drops lower and lower pitching and yawing in the wind
it crash lands its metal underbelly screeching as it hits the jagged granite under the snow
it stops suddenly flipping tail over nose
it rests upside down in the snow
the men are dazed
behind eric one of the extra fuel cans now hanging upside down leaks gas
in front of him the engine is on fire
eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself but his leg gets caught in the tangled belt
he pulls out a swiss army knife and cuts the rope binding corbetts handcuffs to the seat
corbett pushes the passenger door open
panicking eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt painfully wrenching his ankle
corbett rolls out into the snow
with no time to grab his supplies eric clambers from the wreckage
he and corbett crawl roll down the incline of the plateau away from the plane
a moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine and the cessna explodes
eric tries to stand
he cries out and falls into the powdery snow clutching at his ankle
corbett realizes eric is at a disadvantage
but before he can bolt eric grabs for the
magnum under his coat
he lies on the snow gasping pointing the gun at corbetts midsection
you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger
eric cocks the guns hammer with his thumb
be no different than shooting a rabid dog
the men face off for a tense moment
corbett smiles and zips up his jacket dispelling the tension
letting the hammer down eric looks back at the burning plane
continuing next time you want to kill yourself dont include me
i took the odds on getting down in one piece and i made it
now were in my territory
with light clothing and no supplies this is nobodys territory
you sound like the tourists
know it alls who read about survival in a magazine
you wont make it off this mountain
corbett drops his facade of conviviality
eric is too angry to be intimidated
he takes the scarf from around his neck and wraps his ankle with it
re erics ankle im not gonna carry you out of here
look take these cuffs off
we need to work together
eric holds his wristwatch up points the hour hand at the sun counts forward to noon and accordingly makes an approximation of their direction
continuing last time i checked the flight plan we were forty miles northeast of devils cauldron
southwest is that way
no sense waiting for a goddamn taxi
grimacing with pain he gets up
clutching the magnum he shoves corbett in front of him and starts walking
corbett frowns its tough to trudge through the snow with his arms cuffed tightly behind his back
eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register on his face
they wouldnt be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet
smelling fear on eric corbett enjoys the view
the endicott range is full of jagged peaks icy streams and gnarled tundra valleys
squinting in the glare of the snow eric and corbett trek through the grandiose gates of the arctic area
the smoldering plane wreckage is a hard won snow covered mile behind them
intricate patterns of fragmented rock strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely foreboding mosaics upon the landscape
the air is still
the silence is itself a disconcerting presence
ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower the forest begins
but here on the rock face of the mountains eric and corbett might as well be in a desert
itll be interesting trying to build a fire without any wood
welcome to the environment mr
out here one mistake is all you get
determined and dour eric pushes on
continuing why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in
i dont plan on dying
its all academic
the sheer magnitude of the surroundings makes them feel theyre the only people in the world
the sun drops behind the mountains
a wind whips up chilling the men through their clothing
eric tries not to shiver
he spies a small rock formation with a granite elbow protruding from it making an enclosed triangle of solid rock
well stop here dig out a snow shelter
ill have a little sit down
corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while eric digs near the rocks
although he knows corbett is testing his every move eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him
continuing even in the drifts this snows too powdery to make a shelter
when youre done jerking around reach down the back of my coat
eric approaches him suspiciously
he puts his hand down through corbetts collar
something is stowed inside a homemade flap in the lining of his coat
eric pulls out a folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner eyeholes
he shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open
eric and corbett have stretched the tarp out tent style next to the granite rock formation making a minimal but functional refuge from the cold night
the men huddle inside the tarp
eric keeps a wary eye on corbett at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake
eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it
its swollen to the size of a softball
still quite a hike to devils cauldron
a long stretch to go without sleep my friend
you can hide behind that pistol for now but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze turn around
while poking the
in corbetts ribs eric one handedly unlocks corbetts right manacle pulls his arm through the granite elbow then locks it back up again
eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit following the predators paw prints in the snow
he peers ahead and his prey becomes visible
but it isnt a wolf its corbett
his hands and face are covered in blood
the sun peeks over the mountain tops drenching them with light and color
the light hits erics eyes
he bolts awake from a fitful sleep
corbett sits already awake looking like hed uproot the rock to which hes chained if he could
he waits for an opportunity any opportunity with the patience of a vulture
eric and corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream bisecting their path
its simple to continue they have to cross it
corbett takes in the scenery in no particular hurry
frustrated but making dead sure hes always got the drop on corbett eric puts a tentative foot on the ice
ice is too thin you can see the water moving underneath
were not sitting here til november
theres a cargo plane coming to devils cauldron in four days and im putting you on it
we get wet we freeze to death in a couple hours
ive been on ice like this when i was a kid skating
spread your weight keep moving
corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by someone with a masters degree
gestures you first be my guest
im right behind you
frowning corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches across the fifteen feet to the other bank
he turns and indeed eric is right behind him
wait til im across
eric doesnt want to be too far from his prisoner
he keeps coming
the ice groans and hisses under their weight
corbett is three feet from solid ground
he drops to his knees then stomach and rolls like a log the rest of the way
eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across
the ice makes an ominous cracking and water begins to seep through air holes
standing corbett weighs his chances of bolting from eric
eric crawls doubletime
he makes it onto solid ground just as the ice under him breaks off in a big thin clear plate
eric sits on some rocks
corbett glares it him
most dangerous thing in the world a regular joe in over his head
you trying to prove how tough you are for me or for yourself
it wasnt my idea to crash the plane
theres grayling under this ice
ill snare some for dinner
standing weve got another two hours of daylight
pushing it is flat wrong
all you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail
eric is not convinced
grumbling corbett gets up and takes the lead as they continue southward
trying to keep busy anne marie develops some prints in the darkroom shes made from the front bathroom
she glances at her watch and sighs her mind on erics overdue return
anne marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up to dry
outside os a car horn blares a couple of times
grinning she runs to the door
meyerlings dodge truck pulls up
anne marie comes outside
her smile wilts when she sees its not eric
as meyerling climbs the embankment to the turtle he glances at wilders snowmobile parked alongside the turtle
ive been trying to raise you on the shortwave for two days
he pushes past anne marie and goes into the turtle
have you talked to eric
i have not but i very much want to
what do you know about the trouble in devils cauldron
i was hoping you had some news get this straight im the district supervisor
whatever you do reflects on me
it wasnt my idea to bring you people up here but im stuck with you
you are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes
whichever side you take you alienate the other
corbett is quite well known in this region
people admire him corbetts a killer
i dont care if ben corbett makes meatloaf out of nuns and babies hes not your concern
anne marie just glares at him
meyerling examines the damaged shortwave
continuing what happened here
the radios on the fritz
whered you say eric is
somewhere along the pipeline
what about that hotheaded marshal sam wilder
i heard he was in the middle of this mess
we havent seen him
i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside
beat by the way your truck also on the fritz
its out by the pumping station shot full of holes
noting anne maries distressed reaction to this news he crosses to the door
continuing still nothing to tell me
no reply suit yourself
eric limps further down from the mountains
corbett keeps pace in front of him and his magnum
as their altitude decreases there is ever thicker vegetation
their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the distance
the magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings cannot be overstated
picture the most rustic overwhelming wilderness imaginable and then make it ten times larger
the mens way is once again interrupted this time by a sheer granite drop
the steep decline would be tough to negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear
corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head
have to backtrack find another way down
it would take days
assessing the drop going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on
eric realizes hes right
after some deliberation eric cautiously approaches him
cocked and ready he undoes one of the cuffs leaving them hanging from corbetts wrist
he then unthreads the nylon twine from corbetts tarp
eric and corbett are tied belt to belt with the nylon rope
corbett inches down first feet spread for maximum footing gloveless hands grasping at anything
eric mimics corbetts moves and follows the same path
unable to grasp the rocks effectively he stops and takes his gloves off
continuing he winces the rock is cold and sharp
his hands are soon numb and bloody
even in the dry below freezing air eric is sweating
he looks down and hangs on more tightly
sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger
corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks
eric is right above him
suddenly corbetts foot slips
his right hand instinctively goes for a hold
the dangling handcuffs snare on a protuberance knocking him off balance
the fulcrum of corbetts body leans out into the empty air
eric moves down a little braces himself and extends his leg giving corbett something to grab
corbett takes hold of erics shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock wall
adrenaline screams through erics system
corbett looks up at eric
a careless move will send them both tumbling
eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits for the worst
after a long moment corbett regains his balance and lets go of erics foot
he continues his descent
eric lets out his breath and tries to swallow
his mouth is as dry as the granite
handcuffed again corbett hikes in front of eric along the top of some foothills
now and again he glances behind gauging erics weariness waiting for a moments carelessness
around them there is heavy vegetation now snow covered sedge tussocks knee deep muskeg and twisted thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through
above them ominous clouds and sharp cold winds are coming down from the north
but below a mile ahead the edge of the forest is like the hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward
the combination of altitude and latitude creates an amazingly sharp topographical dividing line
within a few thousand yards the landscape abruptly changes from scrub brush to thick coniferous forest
better get into those trees before that squall blows down
then corbett pauses as a walloping sound echoes across the foothills
just ahead two enormous bull moose are fighting
they ram each other with six foot wide antlers
corbett stares transfixed admiring
you talk about ecology there it is
eric turns surprised at corbetts unabashed awe
catching the mens smell the moose bound away and the spell is broken
viking bob mitchell and lemalle head somberly back to cache
they drive along a hydraulic gold mining sluice on a nearby river and come into town
as the trappers park their jeep some miners greet them shouting over the roar of the water
wheres ben at
youll want to hear about it with a drink in your mitt
outside a storm rages
lemalle is drunk but still able to stuff himself with a thick steak
mitchell drums his fingers and listens to everyone talk
with them at the bar are the miners loggers cat skinners bulldozer drivers and some leathery women
figures corbett getting hauled off by a federal marshal
god almighty how i hate the u
we should pass a hat
send corbett a few bucks
we owe him
someones hat comes off
it quickly gets filled with bills
government and business
they ruined this state
re meyerling poster like that little weasel for instance
peoples friend my lily white more woman cat driver contd butt
i heard northland got a conservation program up along the pipeline
meyerling told me that stuffs nothing but p
for the tv and papers down in juneau
hes full of shit
we got run out of there by some fuckhead driving a northland truck
viking bob hurries in and whispers something in mitchells ear
mitchell shoots lemalle a look and gets up
the threesome hastily exit leaving behind the hat full of money
viking bob mitchell and lemalle stand in a quiet corner near the front door
i called the cops in fairbanks see when ben is standing trial
they dont know shit about ben or wilder
get the fuck out of here
its a three hour flight
they shoulda got there yesterday
maybe they went back to devils cauldron
naah wilder knows we got friends in town
that plane mightve been to throw us off the track
remember the bait and switch wilder pulled with the eskimo and his truck
wilder still woulda made fairbanks by now
fuck a duck
ben musta got loose
okay lets backtrack try to pick up his trail
you know the kid out on the pipeline that wilders buddies with
smiles we were just talking about him
the storm brings gusting winds and below zero temperatures
eric and corbett move through the storm in slow motion
both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common enemy
the snow and wind cut through their clothing like razors
they poke around for dead wood with which to make a fire
the trees are small and healthy little is found
shouts over wind just gather birch
itll smoke like hell but itll burn green
awestruck by the intensity of the storm eric tears branches from birch trees and piles them in corbetts handcuffed arms
they hurry back to the nylon tarp strung between two tree trunks flapping violently in the storm
hunching against the wind eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his pocket for some precious matches
his fingers are so cold he cant hold them and he drops several in the wet snow
angry he shoots a look at corbett
corbett is holding his hands inside his coat
he pulls them out and quickly takes the remaining matches from eric
crouching down back to the wind corbett grasps a match between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it
he holds the flame next to the kindling
it doesnt catch fire immediately
corbett lets the match burn out against his fingers
he tries another match
this time a flame takes hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment
on his knees and elbows corbett nurses along the tiny fire
eric cant control his shivering
he gets on his knees next to corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the wind
corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame not caring that its burning his skin
finally the fire begins to grow
relieved eric and corbett look at each other with a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect
the fire now unattended is smoky as corbett predicted but burns along nicely
corbett and eric sit under the nylon shelter
the storm rages outside
eric empties his pockets of eskimo potato reindeer lichens bistsort sorrel and other plants for his dinner
corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree branch and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next to a small animal burrow outside the shelter
a squirrel sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate
corbett sits catlike ready to pounce
eric grimaces as corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrels squeals os abruptly cease
corbett pulls his dead dinner inside
i need your pocket knife
eric hesitates i have to eat too
after a beat eric pulls open the small blade on his swiss army knife and pushes it with his foot to corbett
smiling corbett admires the fancy knife
then below frame he skins and guts his catch
continuing damn lucky this storm didnt blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains
it continues we better stay put
it could blow over tomorrow too
im still figuring youre either real brave or real dumb
i just want this over with
laughs where in hell meyerling dig you up
you know meyerling
the peoples friend
kiss your ass with precision if theres a vote in it
corbett eats the squirrel eskimo style
he uses the knife like a native too holding the meat in his teeth then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice
eric stares disgusted
off his look continuing always eat your meat raw when the weathers cold
does you more good long as the entrails look clean
corbett uses snow and the squirrels fur to wipe the blood from his face then wipes the knife off and lays it open next to his leg
ill hold onto that
with a wry smile corbett pushes it back over to eric
while eric eats his dinner corbett listens to the storm and watches him eat
sure love to know where you fit in up here
im here to do my job
you want to fool yourself about that bullshit job fine
damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along
you think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man more corbett contd making your salary
look ill give you five grand
take the money and go home where you both belong
dont fucking insult me
corbett smiles maybe hes beginning to understand eric
folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons money
those cover most everyone
but frontiers also draw another type of man
one with a demon in his gut
he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon and lay it to rest
sometimes they do but usually they end up crazy or dead
eric ponders corbetts words as he eats
anne marie is frantic with worry
she has the am fm radio on for company
this is tundra topics on kfar
remember as the nights get longer be sure to stay on a regular sleep schedule
the depression from the coming of winter that doctors call seasonal affective disorder or arctic blue to us lay folk is preventable
anne marie tunes the radio to pipeline of the north on continuing john byers was hospitalized in fairbanks today for an infection in an abscessed tooth
byers had a toothache and attempted to remove the tooth himself with a pair of pliers
suddenly a bump rocks the turtle
someone is outside
startled anne marie turns the lights off and looks out the window
no sign of a vehicle or a person
as she pulls on her parka she glances at the big rifle leaning against the wall but doesnt touch it
her visitor whoever it is is behind the turtle
anne marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead
a foraging grizzly sniffs around attracted by the smell of fresh carrion wilder
eight feet tall and eleven hundred pounds its used to having its way
right now its hungry
with a casual swipe of its paw its massive claws puncture the turtles aluminum skin popping open the door of the utility compartment
the bear pokes its head inside and wilders body slumps out into the snow
the bear pushes at the corpse with its snout
salivating it prepares to dig in
anne marie looks around wondering what the hell to do next
wilders snowmobile is a few yards behind her parked against the side of the turtle
she inches toward it
testily the bear looks up sniffing loudly
keeping her eyes on the bear anne marie feels for the snowmobile ignition keys
theyre not there
she feels around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road flares
anne marie ignites the flares
they illuminate the area with an eerie reddish glow
she yells at the bear wields the flares like excalibur and moves forward
the bear reluctant to leave so hearty a pre hibernation meal growls and cocks its head back and forth to assess the threat
as anne marie inches ahead the bear stands on hind legs to its full height to meet the challenge
anne marie tosses a flare toward the bear
it grunts when the flare hits it and shuffles backwards
anne marie throws another flare
with a roar from hell the bear charges
anne marie falls back
still holding the last flare shes forced into a crawl space under the turtle
anne marie tries to squeeze out the other side but shes pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground
the bear swipes at her its huge paw inches away
anne marie jabs at the paw with the flare but that only makes the bear more quarrelsome
she twists around looking for a defense
above her is the cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the turtles electrical system
she tugs at it but it wont budge
the bear sniffs at anne marie with its big wet snout
anne marie notices warning a sign on a control valve grimacing she tries to turn the valve
after much effort it snaps and opens releasing a stream of fetid sewage
the bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff
howling unhappily it backs away grunting and sneezing
greatly offended its appetite gone it lopes into the forest
anne marie squirms out from under the turtle and gagging from the horrible smell pulls off her wet parka
wearing one of erics coats anne marie stands in the center of three similarly sized trees
a flare supplies the light
the big remington rifle leans against the tree closest to her
she tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a sturdy tree branch twenty five feet from the ground
then she throws the other end over an opposing branch and stretches the rope like a clothesline
she attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the first and throws it over a third tree branch midway between the other two
she kneels and ties something below frame to the cross length rope
pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope she hoists something heavy to the level of the branches
the flare burns out plunging the area into darkness
anne marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and nervously tries to light another flare
as she does the forest seems closer sinister filled with lurking ogres
seized with an instinctual fear she grabs the rifle and runs back to the turtle
the storm has passed leaving a fresh covering of powdery snow in drifts like sand dunes
eric and corbett trek toward devils cauldron through the ever thickening forest
corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses
eric using a tree branch as a walking stick still limps on his sore ankle
for the first time he keeps the magnum stuck in his waistband
theres a cabin maybe twenty miles south of here
kneels to adjust his ankle wrap too bad were heading west
theres a snowmobile
inside a day we could be on the yukon
i got money there
remember that five thousand
make it ten
take it and walk away
bristling you dont get it do you
corbett takes advantage of erics poor peripheral vision from the visor by kneeing eric in the face
eric falls backwards into the snow
corbett takes off like a jackrabbit
eric spits out some blood shakes the stars out of his eyes and yanks the
from under his coat
corbett bounds through the snow dodging trees and snow covered rocks
eric squeezes off a shot and is startled by the recoil and the blast
he scrambles to his feet and shoots again
corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank
corbett runs over a frozen stream invisible under a cover of snow
suddenly the ice shatters under him
corbett is immersed in frigid waist deep water
he gasps from the sudden temperature drop
hobbles after him cussing bitterly to himself
crawls to solid ground
disoriented from the shock to his system he rolls over to catch his breath
eric appears over a snowbank
corbett tries to run but his frozen waterlogged legs feel like pig iron
stumbling and panting he looks for a safe place to cross the stream
eric easily catches up to him
corbett sits in the snow shivering
he looks up as eric trots over
eric glares at corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek
just wanted to see what youd do
noticing corbetts sopping legs eric becomes furious
continuing have to get these wet things off
youre not going to slow us down
inside of three hours youd be dragging my dead carcass
fuming eric helps corbett up
the sun sinks below the horizon creating across the mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows
the wind eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter
corbetts pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it
he huddles under the tarp covered by his coat drowsy and listless
you want to go hypothermic
if that means freeze my balls off no thanks
yawns ill be okay
eric examines him
corbetts skin is white and rigid his lips are pale blue
he scowls at eric
continuing told you im fine
holds up three fingers how many do you see
you dont feel cold
its a spring day
he starts to doze off
the shivering hes been repressing now racks his body
eric sits him up closer to the fire and puts his own parka over corbetts shoulders
with his foot eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to corbetts legs
eric rubs his arms and hands but it isnt enough
eric loathes the specter of death even corbetts
he shakes him trying to keep him awake
wake up goddammit
youve got classic hypothermia crankiness fatigue cant feel your coldness
worst thing you can do is fade out
corbett is headed someplace far away
sighing eric turns him so his back faces the fire
he unbuttons corbetts shirt then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across corbett
eric gasps corbett feels like a slab of ice
corbetts teeth chatter
hes completely unconscious
continuing one more thing this doesnt mean were going steady
later corbett rests fitfully
it could go either way
eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it lively
some color has returned to corbetts skin
eric turns as corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of his shirt
his eyes open
he tries to sit up but hes too weak
wheres my elt
all your gear is back at wilders
you got one
it was blown up with the plane
wed be out of here in a few hours
nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season
beat besides im surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics
im surprised a flat ender like you knows cold weather remedies
read a lot of adventure stories when i was a kid
go kill me some dinner
maybe you wont die after all
hate to disappoint you
the aurora makes a dazzling display in the cold clear sky
below the only light on the endless expanse of dark earth comes from the turtle
flashlight in hand wearing one of erics coats anne marie refuels the generator
something catches her eye in the distance headlight beams jostle along the haul road
anne marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away
grinning its about time
she hurries back into the turtle
anne marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable
the vehicle gets closer
its the trappers jeep
it slows and parks on the haul road next to the turtle
anne marie peers out the window
she gasps as she recognizes the jeep
ducking from sight below the window she grabs erics coat and hurries into the rear module
mitchell stays in the jeep
viking bob and lemalle get out and walk cautiously toward the turtle
lemalle stands midway between the jeep and the turtle cradling his carbine
viking bob goes up the steps
anne marie remembers something she shouldve taken with her the rifle
she hears viking bobs footsteps os come up the wooden stairs outside
viking bob knocks on the front door
he peers through the sheer curtain on the window into the front module
he shrugs to the others then tries the door
mitchell gets out of the jeep spits and follows the others in his hand close to the colt peacemaker strapped to his leg
anne marie climbs out a window in the back
she closes it behind her just as viking bob pokes his head in the rear module
the trappers snoop around noticing that the coffee pot is still warm etc
the emptiness is ominous
lemalle picks up the big remington bear rifle
he opens the breech to determine if its loaded and sniffs the barrel to see if its recently been fired
viking bob notices the damaged radio
somebody left in a big hurry
to lemalle check outside
lemalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around
in the back anne marie drags an evergreen tree branch behind her to cover her tracks in the snow then climbs into the utility compartment where wilders body was stored
a moment later lemalle comes around the corner
he notices bear tracks and scat from the prior nights visit
calls out to others grizzly sign
viking bob and mitchell converge with lemalle
they point their flashlights around spotting footprints and marks going off into the woods
tense and silent the trappers follow the marks
a breeze rustles the needles of the evergreens around them
they stop at the point the footprints end
a rhythmic creaking above them makes lemalle shine his light upward
the light reveals wilders feet swinging back and forth above their heads
his body is suspended in the manner of a trail cache
viking bob lets out a startled grunt
he and mitchell shine their lights on wilders face
its sam wilder
musta wanted to keep him from the bears
if ben killed him he sure as hell wouldnt hang him up like this
wheres the kid
who gives a husky fuck
the trappers look glumly at one another
anne marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo equipment
she stops as she hears the trappers boots os crunch in the snow past her and go inside the turtle
the trappers peel off their overcoats
they look around at the comfortable surroundings
i should get me a job with an oil company
he sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving tools out on the coffee table
lemalle helps himself in the well stocked larder
i say we eat torch this fuckin thing and move on
lemalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh bottle of scotch
i aint about to get blasted
flashlight in hand gloriously drunk lemalle stumbles outside
he crosses to the jeep to grab a box of twinkies and as long as hes at it take a leak in a snowbank
bleary eyed he notices the damage to the utility compartment inflicted by the bear
he walks to it stepping over the bear scat
he marvels at the size and depth of the clawmarks
big mother musta wanted something real bad in here
lemalle tries the door but its jammed shut
he tucks his flashlight under his arm and gives another tug
this time the door cracks open
he peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in
a pair of eyes stare back at him
lemalle jumps back startled and pulls out his knife
he tries the door again
it wrenches open
hes looking at his own face in one of anne maries mirrored photo reflector boards
letting his breath out lemalle pokes around the equipment in the compartment
ever larcenous he pulls a few items out examines them and disinterested leaves them in the snow
doing so he comes close to uncovering anne marie who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the compartment
nothing in the compartment catches lemalles fancy
leaving the door hanging open he wanders away
after hes gone anne marie reaches over and closes the door
she can hear the trappers os conversation inside i know in my gut he was here
first light we try to get scent of his trail
sighing anne marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and tries to get comfortable
its going to be a long night
eric and corbett wearily trudge through the woods
corbett has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth
as he walks he sniffs at one of erics eskimo potato roots and takes a tentative nibble
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome
i figure youd be a whaler coming from there
told thats what our old man was
planned on going to sea me and bob til i read jack london
started trapping when i was ten
mailed the furs to sears
eight bucks for a skunk three for a muskrat
off erics look that was fine money
killing wildlife not good enough anymore so you go on to bigger and better things
you got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them
they walk in silence
corbett tightens the tarp against the cold air and looks at eric
continuing dont judge me
youre a joke coming here from a fucked up culture telling us what to do
yeah it is fucked up but its not too late to keep that from happening here
temper flaring all you do is keep folks from working the land living like theyre meant to
you dont understand shit
trappers hunters were part of the environment
whos protecting us
sourly ive seen plenty like you
so more corbett contd full of yourselves theres no room for other peoples way of life
what do you know about people
you live like an animal
a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here as far away from the rest of us as possible
im real sad you dont approve of me
he shoves eric with his handcuffed hands
continuing tell me what i should do professor
you got all the answers
i shouldnt hunt
fine ill just phone up and have a salad delivered
livid eric backs away and knocks corbetts hands away from him
dont push me
im in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you
eric smashes his fist into corbetts face
corbett reels back more surprised than hurt
eric moves in furiously throwing punches
corbett plows his clenched fists into erics midsection doubling him over
gasping eric rams his head into corbett and they fall into the snow
despite the handcuffs corbett gets a few blows in
they wrestle fiercely and eric ends up on top of corbett
hes about to throw another punch when corbett looks up at him
continuing first you save my ass now you want to kill me
make up your goddamn mind
eric lowers his fist and climbs off of corbett
corbett gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence
chimney smoke rises straight up in the still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging above the devils cauldron valley
a scratchy recording of a hymn we will gather at the river plays through a pa system echoing forlornly off the hills
the people of devils cauldron walk through the new snow to the center of the settlement
some older women mostly head for the dance hall where the hymn originates
the women sing along with the hymn
they face a shelf holding the pa a rusty tv and record player
and in front of the shelf an unmanned pulpit
the men including neff split off from their mates and go into the maqi
neff joins some other men sweating on benches in the primitive steam bath
kenai sits closest to the fire
his thick glasses are steamed up but he finally looks warm
wilders missing church services you believe it
i just as soon he stay gone
fool couldve got us all killed arresting ben corbett here in town
exhausted corbett and eric climb across the last set of foothills before the devils cauldron valley
the town comes into view below them faintly the music carries from below
corbett looks at eric and breaks the silence what makes you so sure my boys wont be waiting for us
they think youre in fairbanks
if not they still wont find you before the plane comes tomorrow
dont bet on it
i already have
you dont know how true that is
eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down
well wait here until nightfall
no fire no tarp
corbett sits next to him
after a long moment didnt mean it you being a coward
youre a lot of things but chickenshit isnt one of them
ill tell you what scares me stumbling through life like an ordinary jerk
thats why i want to work on the front lines where what i do means something
beat soon as i got here i realized my job was bullshit
oil company propaganda
i was ready to leave then i thought screw it ill outsmart them do the work anyway
beat i dont know anymore
maybe i am fooling myself
thats what im afraid of most of all
hell i still get a knot in my gut every season wondering how much longer i can go on
no home for retired trappers that more corbett contd i ever saw
were like eskimos get too old to be useful were left on the ice to die
the men listen to the faint music echoing through the silent foothills
continuing softly my wife used to go to chapel on sundays
see her friends cause i was away so much
beat shouldve been home that day
shed be getting dressed right about now
eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses corbetts face
the trappers file out the front door
my guess is hes loose and heading for chukfoktulik
hell need supplies thats the closest settlement without a lawman
lemalle carries his booty with him
viking bob looks at him disapprovingly as he puts the big remington rifle in the jeep
i aint gonna leave a seven hundred dollar remington behind
exasperated what you gonna do with it
large bores for shit on small game
not in the right hands it aint
to demonstrate he rapid fires several shots from the hip taking the radio antenna off the roof of the turtle shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession and blasting
the door latch off the utility compartment
pleased lemalle slams back the bolt ejecting a spent shell
he glances curiously at the door of the utility compartment and starts toward it
continuing thought that door was open last night
quit fucking around
lemalle climbs into the back of the jeep
with viking bob driving they pull away
grinning maliciously lemalle hangs the remington out the window as they retreat
taking careful aim he shoots
lemalles bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator
the kerosene fumes explode splattering burning kerosene on the rear module of the turtle
the trappers dont slow down to enjoy the show
viking bob hurries on to more important business
as soon as the sound of the jeep fades away anne marie clambers out of the utility compartment
haggard and numb with cold she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously devours the rear module
shielding her face from the flames anne marie reaches under the accordion cover between the modules
with great effort she unbolts the coupling bracket
anne marie starts the engine slams it into gear and lurches the front module away from the burning rear module
she shuts the motor off and trying to hold back the tears watches the rear module burning
bone weary eric and corbett walk toward town staying on the outskirts to avoid being seen
they look at one another this moment seemed impossible not very long ago
no one seems to notice as they limp into wilders cabin
eric locks corbett up in the holding cell not noticing that corbett seems almost pleased to be there
he blocks the windows pumps up the pressure on the white gas lantern and heads back outside again
neff pries himself from his mtv to answer a knock at the door
eric hobbles in
neff notes erics weatherbeaten condition
you dont mind me saying mr
desmond you look like hell
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me anne marie
not a damn thing
whats going on
meyerling was here all steamed up looking for you
look neff ive got ben corbett with me here
back at my place
he uh broke his leg
if corbetts men find out im putting him on the plane to fairbanks eleven tomorrow
beat what do you want from me
corbett ruined my two way
go to my place on the haul road tell anne marie im okay and to sit tight
ill go at dawn
dont tell anyone you saw me
after eric goes neff closes his door and bolts it
the temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from the north
another storm approaches
the temperate days of last week seem ages ago
kenai neff and other townsmen batten devils cauldron down for the storm
kenai is bundled up in the cold
the men tighten guy wires on the radio tower windmills and caches bring firewood indoors close off unused rooms in the general store and spa
then neff and kenai split off from the others
via a catwalk neff and kenai climb up into the ceiling struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a roof leak with pitch
neff is sullen from his conversation with eric
kenai however is smiling at neff
why the smirk
bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in
maybe more for lettin him loose
off neffs flustered look i was up in my cache
saw the northland man come talk to you
youre out of your greedy goddamn mind
corbett coming here stinks of trouble
we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass
stay out of it
eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove
corbett watches from the cot in the cell
talk to that good looking girl of yours
you broke the radio remember
smiles im sure shes fine
seemed like a clever kid
corbett sits up as eric hands him a plate of beans
continuing you were real resourceful out there
got me thinking of this perimeter man froze all his fingers one winter
so he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones
gets along better than ever
yeah maybe i underestimated you
i liked you better frozen
you didnt talk so much
youre damn lucky glimpsing this country before its ruined gone for good
you saw wonders youd only dreamed of
that alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from because you have dreamt them
corbett sees hes hit a nerve with eric
continuing remember that demon in the gut
sometimes its nothing more than wondering if the so called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you
thats what you want out of this isnt it
all i want want is you in jail a knock at the door interrupts
eric lowers the flame on the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the cardboard in the front window
frowning he cracks the door open and slips outside
its neff and kenai
neff looks guiltily at eric
explaining he saw you and corbett come in
dixies waiting at the infirmary
shell put a splint on that injured leg
eric is skeptical of kenais concern
dont let him fool you
real reason hes here is to buy corbetts traps
eric looks at kenai then at neff
neff nods that its okay
as extra precaution eric handcuffs corbetts right wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell
to kenai okay
you can talk to him
but ill keep the keys with me
outside the wind howls
eric enters and walks into the hallway connecting the bath partitions
a hand grabs his arm
startled he turns around
its dixie wearing a threadbare flannel robe
earl says you get discount
twenty five dollar
eric shakes his head typical kenai
he gives her three tens
she smiles and leads eric toward the infirmary
its actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining table and a first aid kit
neff paces nervously
corbett smiles at him and kenai
apologetically look ben we dont want any trouble
the kids got the key and besides he looks edgy enough to use that magnum hes carrying
ill get loose in time
any traps you dont want ill pay cash money
guess someone should use them
open the bottom drawer in wilders desk
my kits in there
might as well unload everything
kenai tugs on the drawer
undaunted he jimmies it open with a knife
kenai goes to throw corbett the duffel bag but neff grabs it
he checks for weapons pulling out a hunting knife
satisfied he hands corbett the bag through the bars
with his free hand corbett digs through his belongings clothing freeze dried provisions jerky paperback books
he looks up and shrugs
erics ankle is in a resin cast
his foot rests on a stool
while waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub a hot towel draped over his face
above him on a wall bracket a closed circuit tv plays a war surplus porno film
the door creaks open and dixie comes in
she impassively checks his cast which is interesting as shes now wearing panties clog shoes and nothing else
eric takes the towel off his face and sits up astonished
i wash your back for you
you will like it
before eric can protest the door opens again
he snaps his fingers at dixie to shoo her and she scurries away
i hate to interrupt playtime but why the hell are you caught up in a local matter when i gave you express instructions to the contrary
cut the shit leo
i might need your help
consisting of a handful of sod roof cabins mostly bars chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest sixty miles southeast of devils cauldron
with the seats pushed back lemalle peels the towns lone whore out of her parka
hes got the motor running for warmth
her gold tooth glints in the light from the building next to them
the locating screen on the beat up radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash glows phosphorescent green
they got nice beds upstairs honey
im standin guard duty
besides rather spend the room money on sloppy seconds
over the sound of lemalles exertions there begins an insistent succession of beeps
the whore looks over lemalles shoulder at the locating device
hey tiger lemalle turns and immediately loses interest in the whore
pushing her off of him he blows the jeeps horn three times
eric and meyerling are in the middle of an argument
i wont let a killer walk
what does this matter to you
sneering you cant see past your lousy little assignment sniffing around the pipeline
the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett and im not about to alienate them
i should release corbett because you want some votes
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union
policys made here the same way as in the civilized world at the ballot box
thats the beauty of it these icebox cowboys are living a century too late
get them on your side its like buying manhattan for beads
with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world
some day these peoplell wake up and youll be the first one theyll run out of here
erics attention turns to a rhythmic interference on the tv screen
there are three short bursts followed by three long bursts
something about it is very familiar
scowling he sits up
to meyerling distracted do what you have to
so will i
eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on
kenai sorts through the tangle of corbetts traps
the door bursts open and eric hobbles in
gun drawn eric unlocks the cell door
he rips corbetts shirt open
looking around he sees corbetts duffel bag sitting by the cot
digging through it he finds at the bottom of the bag an elt with a small red led flashing on it
furious he flings it against the wall smashing it
the green dot on the screen and rhythmic bleep go suddenly dead just as viking bob and mitchell run up to the jeep
lemalle dumps the half naked whore out onto the snow
viking bob starts the jeep and they roar off
eric shoves kenai and neff out the door
just stay out of my face until im gone
he slams the door
corbett smiles his cheshire smile
continuing picks up elt emergency transmitter
what happened to signal mirrors or two tone smoke fires
lets us watch each others backs over a wide area
only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths
elt was in my duffel bag not around my neck where it shouldve been
no way theyll find you on a five minute signal
and no way more eric contd theyll get here in eight hours in this weather unless theyre right around the corner
they havent disappointed me yet
fat dry snowflakes pour through the still air
gloomy clouds hang immediately overhead
visibility is ten feet the temperature is below zero
sitting at wilders desk eric pries the tops from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam cup
he rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches then seals it with masking tape
watching him from the cell corbett smiles
eric doesnt answer
he pulls on a heavy overcoat of wilders
putting the unused bullets back in wilders desk eric finds corbetts
he puts it and some speedloaders full of
hollowpoints in his pockets
eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of the early hour and heavy snowfall
he paces out several circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at the edge of town pausing now and again along the way
he hears a door squeak open and someone cough nearby so he stands motionless in the snow
bundled in wool blankets kenai trundles down to his outhouse
after kenai passes by eric sneaks inside the spa
he climbs up into the catwalk
as kenai goes back to his cabin he notices that the antique bear traps on display in front of the general store are missing
suddenly eric grabs him and pulls him into the spa doorway
erics unexpected appearance startles kenai
i need to rent a cabin
whats the problem with sam wilders place
will you rent me a cabin or not
pretty clever if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time sams is the first place theyll look
they may figure youre waiting for an airplane so you cant stay in the shack by the airstrip
last place theyd expect you is on the far side of town
shakes his head i cant afford any trouble takes out all his cash heres a hundred dollars
and if you or anyone else will back me up on this grabs money forget it
and try not to bleed on my throw rugs
walks away then turns back why do this
if you have to ask you wouldnt understand
outside there is the high pitched whine of a snowmobile os driving into town
eric cautiously follows the sound
he listens as the vehicle cuts across town toward neffs house
the snowfall is too thick to see who it is
eric moves in as close as he dares
the engine stops os and footsteps crunch up neffs driveway
a person in a hooded parka stands on neffs stoop about to knock
magnum drawn eric suddenly appears from the curtain of falling snow
he shoves the person against the side of the house
its anne marie
seeing eric shes more angry than relieved
eric puts the gun back in his waistband
why arent you in fairbanks
he pulls her away from neffs doorstep
her anger dissolving she wraps her arms around him
continuing oh christ sweetheart
i thought you were dead or worse
you cant stay here
go back to the turtle
ill meet you back there in a few hours
stung by his coolness whats going on
ill tell you everything later
a transport plane is due at eleven
once i put him on it its all over
so whats the problem
there isnt one unless corbetts men get here before the plane does
anne marie grasps the situation with a sickening clarity
let the people here handle it
its their marshal corbett killed
has been eavesdropping on the conversation through his window
the news about wilder stuns him
please anne marie you being here only complicates things
eric knows she wont relent
take the snowmobile park it behind wilders cabin
sighing she starts the snow machine
most of her photo gear is lashed to the saddlebags
as she pulls away eric limps back to neffs house and knocks on the door
shaken neff opens the door and lets eric in
i was just on my way to your ladyfriends but i guess she found you
sorry i barked at you last night
im the one should be sorry
goddamn kenai always out for a score
i never shouldve let him go over there
id sure like that favor you offered a while back
neff gets a seasick look on his face
desmond i didnt count on it turning this ugly
what are you talking about
bastards killed sam you think they wont kill the rest of us
therell be three four men at the most
i have some backup nothing will happen
im real sorry
in a while youre gone from this country
but we live here
no one wants to mix it up with those hombres
neff opens the door for eric
angry you dont care enough about sam to sam wilder was my cousin
hes why i came to alaska
all his letters saying what a paradise it is
but me ending up dead wont do sam a lick of good
anne marie waits in front as eric hobbles up
she looks at his bad ankle
cmon we have to hurry
he leads her inside
corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell
couldve told you no one would help
seeing anne marie he smiles
continuing to anne marie maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend
to anne marie either way you better clear out
i dont want anyone innocent getting harmed
this comment has the intended effect on anne marie
angry eric throws corbett a coat
corbett puts it on
reaching through the bars eric cuffs corbetts hands together
as they exit corbetts sardonic look makes anne marie shiver
the ten by ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots a beat up color tv set a cookstove and a half drum heat stove
built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a now dry stream
eric checks his watch
he bolts the door and blocks the windows opening one enough to let sound in from outside
he extinguishes the benman lantern and douses the fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the chimney
anne marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb waiter
youll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft
sit on the cot
hands her the
keep this pointed at him if i get preoccupied
anne marie reluctantly takes the huge gun
trying to allay her fears eric sits and brushes the hair from her face
corbett intently watches them
before he can say anything eric shoots him a cold look
corbett stays quiet
a pall hangs over the town
people know to stay inside
time crawls by
in his house neff for once has his tv turned off
he tries to read and listens for sounds outside
in the spa water drips somewhere
all the stalls are empty
in his sod house kenai looks out his one tiny window at the curtain of snow
dixie comes up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders
he looks up at her glum
in wilders empty cabin his belongings are scattered about as if expecting his imminent return
in the rental cabin eric checks his watch
the sound of a motor grows in volume then abruptly ceases
the trappers jeep appears in the snowfall on the road into town
it coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a woodpile across from wilders cabin
the trappers get out of the jeep
lemalle has erics remington mitchell has his peacemaker and viking bob carries lemalles old carbine
its so cold outside that the spittle freezes and cracks before it hits the ground
they fan out and approach wilders cabin
the cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move closer
there is no sign of life
viking bob gestures for the others now positioned on either side of the cabin to crouch down for cover
calls out ben
carbine held at his hip viking bob walks up to the door and with a mighty kick breaks it in
viking bob points the carbine at an empty room
he notices however corbetts duffel bag on the floor of the cell
the trappers march through town like an advancing army looking for some sign of corbett
lemalle stops to dig through his pockets for some food
all he comes up with is the stump of a candy bar
viking bob looks at him impatiently
look we pull bens ass out of the fire ill get you a whole damn crate of snickers bars
insulted im right fuckin here with you
to prove his point lemalle trots from dwelling to dwelling looking through windows and letting himself in through any unlocked door
this proves fruitless so he lets out a frustrated yell
pointing the remington skyward he lets off a couple thunderous shots that echo back off the foothills
hearing the shots eric pushes anne marie against the floor
cautioning her to stay put he crawls to the window and tries to see through the snowfall
after a moment of silence from outside not too far away ben
speak out before i torch every dump in town
eric points the magnum at corbett
answer and ill shoot
you kill me you sign your death warrant
re anne marie and hers
viking bob and mitchell come running over to lemalle
lemalle fires another couple shots for emphasis
calls out you hear me
to lemalle ease off
we do this my way
he and the others strain their ears for a clue
continuing calls out whoevers holding ben corbett listen to me we just want to know hes okay
he is nobody gets hurt
his mind racing eric stares at corbett
despite the freezing temperature of the room hes sweating
they know im here
i dont say something theyll plow this town under
you willing to accept that responsibility
setting his resolve eric drags corbett to the window
he pushes the barrel of the magnum against corbetts cheek
say youre okay
tell them ill kill you if they rush us
anne marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave front
despite the gun in his face corbett remains calm
shouts through window bob
hearing corbetts voice the trappers spin around trying to ascertain its direction
i got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose
the trappers follow his voice toward the rental cabins
you in one piece
look forward to seeing you
count on it
eric pulls corbett away from the window
he shoots a look at anne marie
theyre in a bind and she knows it
lemalle grabs viking bobs arm
to viking bob sweet talk wont get shit
calls out choose it asswipe cut corbett loose or soon as you come outside i put a fuckin bullet through your eye
eric glances at corbett whose grim look certifies lemalles boast
snows to their advantage kid
you cant see them but soon as that plane comes theyll sure as hell know where were going
take me to the yukon
ill give you that money and guarantee youll walk away
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside
the time has passed for men like them and me
i know it
but theyre still fighting for survival like cornered animals
thats why theyll kill you
more corbett contd smiles be rude to let that happen after you kept me from freezing back there
anne marie tries to hide how tempted she is by corbetts offer
to eric hes right about the snow
eric sighs is she against him too
from outside ben
the trappers are obviously much closer
eric signals to corbett not to answer
eric and corbett face the window
they dont notice as anne marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin
eric turns gasping as he realizes shes gone
corbett smiles sardonically
at least your girl had the sense to jump ship
too bad shes the only one small enough to fit through that dumb waiter
using the cover of the snowfall anne marie circles around the outside edge of town toward wilders cabin
she takes some of her photo gear from the snowmobile
unaware of anne maries maneuver the trappers wait for a response from corbett
viking bob places a calming hand on lemalles shoulder
just wait we dont know what this guys up to
benll let us know what to do
with a camera bag slung over her shoulder anne marie climbs up the metal antenna tower behind neffs house on the edge of town
she grits her teeth and fights back a wave of vertigo
the ground disappears from sight hidden by the snow and fog
fifty feet up she attaches her infrared video camera to the tower crossbars and using a length of coaxial cable hooks its rf output to the feedline of the community
eric looks at his watch
a cracking twig behind the cabins gets the trappers attention
clutching his rifle lemalle goes to investigate
as he probes through the snow listening
he reaches the edge of the woods and finding nothing returns to the others
anne marie crouches behind a tree twenty feet behind lemalle
after a moment she tiptoes back toward the rental cabin
eric and corbett turn as anne maries camera bag suddenly drops from the dumb waiter shaft
anne marie wriggles back inside
before eric can say anything she puts her fingers over his mouth
she turns on the tv set and tunes it to channel
a fuzzy image comes into view
its devils cauldron from the vantage of anne maries infrared video camera
the falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the scene
buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes
heat producing objects warm walls chimney smoke etc
are pink and red
and there are three clearly definable human figures standing near the maqi
corbett is amazed
eric smiles at anne marie
your infrared camera
nods technology in the wilderness
only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip
ive got an idea
well have to work fast
he digs through anne maries bag of equipment and supplies then stops and looks up
outside there is an os sound that is felt before it is heard
the cargo plane approaches in the distance
the trappers look at each other as the sound of the plane grows louder
theres what theyre waiting on
smiles tightly theyll have to come right past us
eric quietly pulls the door open
holding the pistol to corbetts head he pushes corbett out in front of him
anne marie and eric exchange a long look
fighting back tears she reaches up and touches his face
when you ran off i thought youd keep going til you were back home in washington
my home is here
then he and corbett are gone lost from sight in the snowfall
after a beat anne marie takes a deep breath and slinks away in the other direction toward the dance hall
the trappers wait twenty five feet from eric and corbett
the drone of the plane grows louder
start toward the airstrip
corbett sees a patch of bare dirt and scuffs his feet in it
the trappers turn to the sound heard under the rumble of the still distant plane
converging they head in that direction
suddenly anne maries voice booms through the town over pa theyre moving toward you
eric shoots a couple times then backtracks and pulls corbett behind one of the rental cabins
ducking the bullets the trappers sprawl onto the ground
anne marie has turned on the rusty tv near the pulpit
while watching the infrared image of the action outside she holds the microphone wired to the old pa
viking bob gestures to mitchell and lemalle to separate
over pa theyre fanning out
angry lemalle blasts his rifle in direction of her voice
to viking bob kenais pa but how the fuck she seein us
we know where theyre going
stalking anxious lemalle follows viking bob
splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow
eric pushes corbett through a narrow pass between two buildings in the center of town
he walks in corbetts footprints
almost through to the other side he suddenly stops
pulling corbett with him eric walks backwards still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprint
corbett cant help but smile
watching the tv screen anne marie sees one of the red blips change direction and head toward her
into mic one is moving back toward the cabins
he crosses to kenais generator
with a well placed rifle shot to its innards he grinds it to a halt
the tv picture disappears as the power dies
anne marie keys the pa microphone its dead too
eric and corbett emerge from between the buildings
eric backtracks toward the hot springs spa now leaving an obvious trail
eric and corbett go inside
eric pulls the door closed behind them but leaves it ajar
the drone of the approaching plane is ever louder
kenai stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters
dixie looks at him
earl its crazy to go out there
i hear someone in the spa
he straps on a holster under his sealskin coat
the big prop plane is about to touch down on the far side of the snow covered airstrip
anne marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside
lemalle follows the footprints to the door eric left ajar
he peers inside
its tomb quiet except for water dripping and pipes creaking
lemalle looks around
the sound of a small ding against metal above him gets his attention
he sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him
he finds a metal ladder slings his rifle over his shoulder and climbs up
hearing another sound on the far side of the catwalk he hurries across holding onto the pipes for balance
lemalle is directly above the huge central pool
he ducks to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling to a dark corner below
suddenly the twine snaps tight pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling
the door swings down and knocks lemalle off the catwalk
with a yelp he splashes into the water below
hidden in the shadows eric drops the end of the twine and rushes toward the front door with corbett in tow
to corbett thatll keep him out of the cold
climbs out of the central pool soaked
he pulls his wet jacket off and furiously throws it down
eric leads corbett around the back of the spa
a gunshot rings out nearby and a bullet hits the wall above erics head
has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow
he purposely shoots over their heads so he doesnt hit corbett
eric and corbett crouch down and double back
they are once again swallowed up by the snowfall
viking bob follows their footprints in between the buildings
he continues to a point where they converge to one set then stop
he smiles at the naivete of erics ploy
looking at the boardwalk railing above he assumes eric and corbett have swung over it onto the iced over boardwalk
pleased with his deduction viking bob continues along the alley
viking bob lets out a horrible howl and falls on his back in the snow
biting into his right calf is a huge conibear leg trap
in extreme pain he struggles to lever it open with the barrel of his rifle
corbett shoots eric a dangerous look as viking bobs cries carry though the town
hearing viking bobs cries mitchell backtracks and rushes to viking bobs aid
between them they manage to yawn open the jaws of the trap and free viking bobs leg
viking bob tries to walk but the leg wont support him the bone is broken
bitterly frustrated he waves mitchell on
in agony viking bob eases down in the snow
he tears a strip of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the bleeding
anne marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip
suddenly the hot springs door bursts open and lemalle lunges at her
stripped of his wet clothes hes wrapped in blankets and furs his feet protected by sacks lashed to them
his wet body and hair steams in the frigid air
anne marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from him
she falls hard on her back knocking her wind out
scrambling for footing in the snow lemalle drops his rifle
he comes at her again
anne marie moves away and pulls the magnum out
lemalle stops and glares at her
gasping dont make me shoot
she gets up keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him
lemalle glowers menacingly
continuing were going to sams cabin
you can stay in the jail until this is over
lemalle slowly crouches down for his rifle
anne marie wields the handgun at him but he doesnt stop
want to chance it with that hog leg
you cant even hold it up
better drop me first shot bitch or ill rip your fuckin lungs out
taunting sneering lemalle stares her down
anne marie is paralyzed
feeling that hes won lemalle wraps his bony fingers around the stock of the remington
anne marie closes her eyes and fires
pulling the rifle close lemalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet
anne marie fires again and again
shot lemalle hobbles away leaving a trail of blood in the snow
numb anne marie lets her arm fall
eric looks around at the sound of the shooting fearing the worst
he pulls corbett off the boardwalk and they cut across open ground toward the airstrip depot
kenai looks around at the messy results of lemalles ransacking for things to wear
kenai turns startled when he hears footsteps
its neff and meyerling
disgusted lookit this damn mess
where in hells wilder
after a beat dead
trappers killed him
told you this was trouble
to meyerling what about you big shot
whos side are you on anyway
hey i thought you people loved corbett and his wild men
this shoot em up shit is bad for business
im sick of it
what about you neff
two of the trappers are down already suddenly on the bandwagon one left three of us
lets finish it
what about eric desmond
ill handle him
through the snow eric can see the faint outline of the plane on the runway
he and corbett hurry toward the back of the airstrip depot
as they wend their way through the junk filled yards eric catches a glimpse of movement around a corner reflected in a pane of glass leaning against a roll of
peacemaker in hand mitchell is behind the depot coming right for them
eric takes out the homemade flashbomb
he lights it tosses it toward mitchell and covers his eyes
it explodes with a muffled pop and a bright flash of white light
mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes
the flash has temporarily clouded his vision
eric moves corbett to another approach to the depot and waits for mitchell to move on
mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his shoulder stops him
its lemalle oblivious to the profuse bleeding from his right shoulder
mitchell blinks still having trouble seeing
lemalle gestures for him to be quiet and points in eric and corbetts direction
whispers over there
he hoists his remington
whispers hold it
you might hit ben
i hit what im aiming at
let em come closer first
but lemalle is too anxious
he swings the rifle up left handed and shoots
the bullet just misses eric
he panics and wildly returns fire with the
mitchell and lemalle scatter under the hail of bullets
as they hear lemalles labored footsteps run past them nearby
eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the depot
there is no further movement
eric waits a moment then leads corbett cautiously toward the depot
reaching the rear wall they practically stumble over something
its mitchell lying on the ground near the wall badly wounded by erics barrage
anguished corbett kneels next to mitchell
mitchell pulls him closer
glad to see youre okay
i told lemalle not to shoot
tries to smile had some fine seasons didnt we
mitchells grasp on corbetts coat relaxes as he dies
horrified eric stares at the man he killed
noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from mitchells pocket corbett picks it up
to eric fifteen years on the trail with this man i never saw him rise to anger
glaring at eric corbett dips his hand in mitchells blood and suddenly smears it across erics mouth
repelled eric pulls back
continuing bitterly your first kill
how does it taste
wiping his face sickened and desolate eric has no reply
then from somewhere close by lemalle fires at them
eric stuffs the
in his belt and uses a brick to knock the padlock off the back door of the depot
he pushes corbett inside
the pony tailed ex hippie pilot shuts his engines off and removes his walkman headphones
hearing lemalles continuing gunshots the pilot pulls his door closed and turns on his two way radio
into radio mic circle this is bmy
i just touched down in devils cauldron
nobodys here to greet me like usual and theres gunfire
im getting scarce
with that he starts his engines up again
who turns startled when he hears the engines coughing to life os
the pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take off
he looks up surprised as the passenger door suddenly opens
anne marie slides onto the seat
you cant leave yet
its my responsibility to get this aircraft out of here safely
anne marie points the
continuing you got to be kidding
leave the engines idling
go back and open the side door
shaking his head and muttering the pilot unfastens his seat belt climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment and obliges the little lady with the big gun
the depot as temporary looking as the rest of devils cauldron is a boxcar shaped loading dock and warehouse with a corrugated steel roof
boxes wood palettes and hand dollies are piled haphazardly about
eric and corbett navigate through the piles of boxes inching toward the front door the door leading to the plane
suddenly a string of overhead lights come on
eric goes for the
then stops when he sees meyerling kenai and neff have come in the front door
kenai stomps his feet and shivers
grandstanding for the others meyerling steps forward
nobody wants any more killings we all agree to that correct
no one argues thats good
now eric youre gonna hand your prisoner over to us
this isnt your concern
its over here and now
to meyerling sure when you put a bullet in my back on the way out
easier for all involved
not a bad idea
face it ben
theres no room in alaska for you any more
meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped over rack of eskimo paraphernalia masks furs big skin drums fish and bear spears
continuing youre as antiquated as this shit
meyerling moves toward corbett but eric stands in his way
youre quite a piece of work meyerling
the tide changes you ride right along with it
eric looks at neff
neff you know better than this
youre an outsider mr
step aside stay out of it
kenai and neff move in with meyerling
eric stands his ground and reaches for the
in his belt
suddenly lemalle stumbles into the depot the blankets and furs dragging at his feet
his right side is bathed in blood
half frozen bled dry he looks ready to drop down dead
in his left hand impossibly he still clutches the massive remington
he hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he bolts a round into the chamber with his injured right arm
bracing himself he levels the rifle at eric
hearing the action of the rifle eric turns
corbett reaches down grabs a rusty eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands and hurls it
there is a deafening roar as lemalles rifle discharges
lemalle flies back from the recoil and from the spear stuck clear through his chest
some packing material above erics head smolders ignited by the muzzle blast
there is a moment of silence
corbett looks at the other weapons near him and then at meyerling
threatened meyerling pulls out a
before eric can do anything meyerling fires
the impact of the bullet throws corbett against some boxes
with a yell eric jumps meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp
enraged he pummels meyerling with it until kenai and neff pull them apart
eric wrenches away from them and scrambles to his feet with meyerlings gun in his hand
continuing anybody moves and ill shoot
on them eric crosses to corbett
bleeding from the abdomen hes trying to stand up
continuing can you walk
wounds a through and through
missed my liver i think
lets get out of here
cautiously backing away from the others eric helps corbett get up and shuffle toward the os sound of the cargo plane
anne marie jumps down from the cockpit
she and eric lift corbett into the plane
as it taxis and lifts off
while eric takes corbetts handcuffs off anne marie looks at his wound
he waves her away
how come you didnt let him shoot me
softly like i said id still be up on that mountain frozen solid it wasnt for you
well get you to a hospital soon as we get to fairbanks
so they can patch me up and put me in a cage
meyerlings right im a dinosaur
greedy bastards like him its their turn with this land
put me in the woods let me live or die on my own
he painfully pulls himself into a sitting position
continuing peers out window look down there tell me what any of this matters
struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness
soon there wont be a trace of our troubles
everything we do leaves its mark
you said it yourself there are hundred year old footprints in the tundra
too tired to argue corbett leans back against the window
he takes mitchells scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at it
the exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a grizzly beside a wilderness creek with trees and mountains in the background
clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes
eric sighs as he looks at the blood mitchells blood on the back of his hand
he stares at corbett for a long moment
then resolved he climbs up front and says something to the pilot
grumbling the pilot adjusts his controls
the snow clouds are dissipating
the cargo plane comes down through them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumping station
as it rolls to a stop eric throws open the cargo door
corbett sits up surprised
he and eric exchange a long look then corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly steps down onto the snow covered runway
eric and anne marie watch from the door of the plane as corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline
as he goes his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind
corbett stops turns and looks back at eric then continues onward disappearing into the forest
eric closes the cargo door as the pilot turns the plane around and taxis back down the runway
eric wearily sits next to anne marie
she kisses him
the pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns
to himself too damn crazy in this state anymore
im moving back to l
the plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny ice blue sky
it banks and turns south
behind it the mountains roll on toward the arctic wasteland forever
