sphere early draft by stephen hauser by stephen hauser based on the novel sphere by michael crichton march fog hangs above the street amongst the streetlamps
apartment buildings line the curb it is very quiet
in one building six floors up a bedroom light is on
we see the silhouette of normans wife looking out the window
what kind of a crash was it
you seen my suitcase
theres nothing on the news about a crash
did he say what airline
he didnt say much at all
honey in the closet
i dont understand norman why would they call you
dont be so supportive honey
well i cant imagine five years of unemployment four
four years four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume
keep watching the news
are you watching the news
how are you getting to the airport
you need money for the bus
a tinted window black sedan travels down the street pulls up in front of the apartment building
navy decal is on the door
theres a u
navy car outside norman
was it a military crash
i dont know
they never used to send a navy car
blinding sunlight as the helicopter whips by speeding above the pacific ocean
norman disheveled unshaven sits in the back
he studies a pamphlet in his hand aircrash survival how to cope
the pilot in the cockpit turns to him
what kinda work you in dr
norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag
im in psychology
still am really just been a while
beat i treat aircrash survivors
oh so youre that dr
youve heard of me
well everybodys been talking about that report you wrote
you mean you dont know
the pilot glances back at him again
must be another johnson then
been flying so many scientists out here cant keep everyone straight
physicists mathematicians geologists you name it
at a plane crash
strange isnt it
in the middle of the ocean no less
what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash
norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the water
the helicopter descends down onto the helipad wind gusting about
a young female officer holding her hat to her head rushes to greet norman as he climbs out of the helicopter
she looks down crudely at his shotty nylon dufflebag
any other bags dr
careful its heavy
she lugs it over her shoulder no problem
no other equipment
no they didnt say this way sir
norman follows the officer away from the helipad
she leads norman down a flight of stairs
captain barnes wants to see you right away sir
hes very eager to meet you
been calling us every half hour to see if youre arrived
as they march down a hallway norman looks down at his wrinkled suit tries to smooth it out
by the way sir ive read your report
i think its brilliant
you mean they havent told you yet
told me what
she staightens up like she might have said too much
this way sir
captain harold barnes s immaculate proud of who he is talks on the phone
hows he look
well we cant all be officers can we
laughs they tell me hes brilliant
norman stands in front of the door
the doorplate reads project commander captain harold barnes
norman straightens his big knotted tie
as the door opens barnes is putting down the phone rises from his desk as norman steps inside
they shake hands
thank you colonel
right forgive me
barnes looks at norman sizing him up
an akward silence
well thanks for the opportuninty here my wife appreciates it
dont thank me dr
you werent my choice
the pentagon made me take you
smiling the pentagon
i didnt know i had friends in washington
norman tries to laugh as barnes ushers him to the door
come with me
the teams already waiting
barnes leads norman down the corridor lined with officers and guards
what have you been told so far
routine stuff really
a guard unlocks a large steel door
norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway wondering how the guard knows his name
you talk to any reporters
no i havent
the steel door shuts loudly behind them
securitys been our biggest worry
now that youre here we can shut this thing down tight
whats with all the security
well we dont have all the facts yet
another guard opens up another large steel door
barnes leads norman through the room crammed with video monitors screens and grids
officers talk into radios
technicians work on computers
were moving fast considering the storm
a cyclones on its way in
i thought they would have told you on the phone
they didnt tell me anything
norman tries to keep pace
weve had divers working around the clock
take a look at this
angle on a large video screen shows a diver walking on the ocean floor holding a bright artificial flashlight
how deep is he
a thousand feet
an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water i dont want to sound pessimistic here but i assume there are no survivors
no i wouldnt think so
then why am i here
what do you need me for
on the video screen the diver shines his light on a large metallic what crashed wasnt an airplane dr
its a bit larger than that
barnes walks toward a technician sitting at a keyboard
to technician bring up the grid would you
angle on the monitor as an image of the craft begins to form
what is it
a military spacecraft
like a shuttle or satellite
something like that
beat that doesnt surprise you
not really no
something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news why youve kept everything a secret
when did it crash
as best we can estimate it crashed four hundred years ago
youre kidding right
angle on the monitor showing a grid depicting an image of the craft and a small layer of rock above it
geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year wait a second dating the crash at least that old
hold on maybe older theres got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft
theres no such thing
our space program isnt even forty years old
extraordinary isnt it
im afraid it is dr
because its sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor
barnes and norman shuffle down the stairs
off the record i dont mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me
it doesnt make any sense
we think it might
thats why we brought you here
weve assembled your team theyre waiting for us now
the one you recommended
in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration
nobodys mentioned that in years
you mean someone actually read it
as they head down a hallway barnes pulls the ulf report out from under his arm hands it to norman
norman looks at it almost embarrassed to be holding it
your reports become our bible down here dr
weve been carrying out each of your recommendations one by one to the smallest detail
but sir i dont understand
this report these recommendations
theyre for an encounter with extra terrestrial life
on a video screen sonar video of the spacecraft
how big is this spacecraft
of what were able to measure roughly twenty six hundred feet
a half a mile long
the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft weve seen
the team members sit around the conference table ted fielding geologist boyish and happy to be here
beth halperin biochemist mother of three whos never worn an apron
arthur levine marine biologist pudgy and quiet
harry adams mathamatician african american wire glasses no bullshit
how much damage
to the craft
not a scratch
so youre saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch
im not saying anything harry im just stating the facts
continuing the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy built into an epoxy resin honeycomb
the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented
on norman watching the team
in basic english what does all this mean
theres no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet
a large x ray apparatus moves to the side revealing normans face
on beth standing next to him
no phone calls
what am i a leper
norman sits up
beth look can i trust you with a little secret
i love secrets
that ulf report everybodys patting me on the back about
ive read it twice norman
the reports a joke
beat thats quite a secret
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re runs of the twilight zone
i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house i had no idea angle on two navy corpsmen standing behind glass in the next room monitoring beth and
do yourself a favor norman
are you listening
dont tell anyone what you just told me
cmon beth that reports like the blind leading the blind
because when we get down there wait down where
to the spacecraft
what do you expect
for them to bring it up here
we cant go down there
were not prepared
that takes years of training beth
were just scientists
we wear ties and lab coats to work not oxygen tanks
well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here
in the ocean
off his look percent of the earths surface is water norman
thats first grade geography
it never occurred to me
well lets pray thats the only mistake you made
have you said anything to barnes about this
the timing has never seemed quite right
just keep your mouth shut alright
this could mean everything to our careers you know that
dont jeopardize this
nervous laughter what are you threatening me
the sky clouds looming on the horizon
angle on arthur levine leaning against the railing looking out at the water
on norman approaching him
arthur never looks at norman he just stares out at the water
i dont know you but ill be honest with you
i dont like this
i dont like any of this
especially the water
a marine biologist
i dont belong here
none of us belong here
look at that
angle on the water an ocean of seemingly endless choppy waves
makes you feel pretty small doesnt it
it scares the shit out of me
close on norman lying on a cot
it is dark
his eyes are open
he stares at the ceiling
a porthole hatch to the descent sub unlatches loudly
a sub officer help norman lower himself through the hatch
norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment
seated in a circle area ted beth harry and arthur
ahead of them captain barnes sits with the pilot in the subs cockpit separated by a wall of plexiglass
norman takes a seat between beth and ted
through the intercom our descent will take minutes
descending at a speed of feet per minute
across from norman harry is whispering something quietly into arthurs ear
pressure adjustments will cause the sub to lurch at times but dont be alarmed
its perfectly normal
arthurs face drips with sweat as harry continues to whisper into his ear
the subs interior atmosphere will experience moisture as we descend and the temperature will drop rapidly
just relax and remain seated during the descent
norman watches arthur dripping with sweat
we have clearing from the base
red interior lights flicker on in the compartment and we hear the sub make a hissing sound
the sub lurches and begins to lower in the water
harry has gotten to arthur
arthur is on the verge of panic
open the hatch door please
harry continues to whisper in his ear
captain open the hatch door please the hatch door captain
open it please
calm down dr
let me out captain
open the door
arthur leaps violently out of his seat scrambles to the plexiglass wall
through the plexiglass sit down dr
youre in a military operation now arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists
your civil rights have been overridden
open it captain
return to your seat
arthur vomits violently heaving splattering the plexiglass wall
open the fucking door
the sub lurches again coming to a stop
the compartment is totally silent as they begin ascending to the surface
on harry smiling a sly evil grin directed right at norman
the sub lurches again and we hear clanking metal
the hatch door opens
and arthur wiping the vomit from his mouth climbs up the ladder and out the hatch door
the hatch door locks loudly
the sub lurches and begins descending
whats that mistake number two norman
he wasnt feeling well
hes a pussy
harry is still staring at norman
how are you feeling norman
you holding up alright
dont be defensive
im not being defensive
you sound defensive
to harry whatd you say to him
nothing that norman doesnt already know
what does norman already know
norman thinks we shouldnt be going down
thinks its a mistake
norman looks over at beth
she told me what you said norman
what is it harry
just one of normans many secrets
on norman saying nothing
we see the sub descending into darker waters
the sub descends into the airlock metal clanks against metal
around it the dh interwoven cylinders lit up with lights
close on the hatch door closing tightly locking
one moment for pressurizing
angle on barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the small claustrophobic pressurizing room
nobody says anything
a long beat
in front of them opens
teeny fletcher s a big boned female officer stands before them
she wears a black plastic pad a talker around her neck
she hands each member their own talker
norman takes his
fletcher leads barnes and the team members down the hallway
each of them wears the talkers around their necks
they pressurize us with helium
whats wrong with oxygen
its a corrosive gas
on earth it makes a half eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly iron rust on an oldsmobile
at a pressure this low oxygen becomes toxic
breathe it down here and itll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile
important safety tip
fletcher listens through her radio earpiece turns to barnes
captain the divers have the airlock mounted at the door
the robot is now in position to enter the spacecraft
close on a monitor showing the robot in front of the curved gray metal of the spacecraft
edmunds bring up the robots camera feed
jane edmunds the unit archivist works the control panel
another monitor clicks on showing the robots pov of the door
captain you know i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television
nobody goes inside until we know whats inside
on the monitor the robot camera scans the spacecraft hull stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door
can you open that panel
working on it now sir
on the monitor a robotic claw extends out to the panel
trying to pry the panel open
id like it noted in the report that i think we should be doing this ourselves
making a manned entry
the claw is clumsy and keeps banging into the metal
id also like it noted duly noted ted
edmunds try using suction
on the monitor another robotic arm extends out with a rubber sucker
it pushes against the panel but doesnt suck
its not sucking sir
thank you i can see that
try something else
we dont have anything else to try sir
well shit find something do something
make something up what about a crowbar
barnes straightens up looks at ted
what about a crowbar
what if we go out there you know wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open
pry the thing open
what are we neanderthals
all that banging and pounding
i dont know
we should think about making a good first impression
for whoevers in that thing
or whatevers in that thing
on the monitor the spacecraft sitting there silently staring back at them
norman what do you think
norman quiet in the corner perks up
well i dont really
i mean you could
you know you could make a real solid case
all eyes on norman
i dont know
a beat as they all stare at him
im secure enough with that
angle on a locker door opening
inside is an elaborate jumpsuit and helmet with the name johnson stenciled above the faceplate
are we all i mean is it necessary for all of us to go
the other team members take their suits out of their lockers
nothing to be nervous about
these suits are wired and electrically heated
each equipped with an alarm that triggers automatically if life support sustems go below optimum
norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him like its something nuclear
its just like swimming norman
you know how to swim dont you
youre not afraid of the water are you norman
they all look over at him
half smiling isnt there a psychological term for that dr
under his breath yeah
dressed in jumpsuits and helmets barnes jumps into a pool of ocean water cut out from the floor leading to the ocean
it looks like a tiny swimming pool
ted jumps in next
beth harry and norman are left
youre next norman
nervous as hell no
such a gentlemen when youre scared shitless
she hops in
norman watches looks up at harry next to him
no why dont harry nudges him forward
wait a second i harry pushes him again
norman catches himself
geez cmon alright
gimme a minute
let me get my bearings harry pushes him again
look would you and harry just pushes him in
norman slips and falls awkwardly
into the ocean depths
only the sound of norman breathing
for a couple beats
normans pov from inside his helmet a light shines from behind him casting his shadow onto the murky ocean floor
normans head turns and hes blinded by a light its harry the light shining from the top of harrys helmet
we hear harrys voice static through normans helmet
the switch is on your waist
on norman his glove fumbling at his waist
his helmet light flickers on
on norman slowly beginning to walk on the ocean floor
his feet squashing gently lightly into the muddy ground
normans pov can barely make out the others in front of him their helmet lights strobing the dark water crossing each other like searchlights on a foggy night
close on normans face eyes cold breathing
and look at that thing
normans eyes look up
we pull back
long high wide shot of the team their little helmet lights tiny and insignificant almost as
in front of them the spacecraft
dwarfing them in size looming large majestic like nothing weve ever seen
the enormous tail fin in the distance extends high out of the coral
in the huge mound of coral covering the spacecraft we see a tunnel cut out like a cave lined with tiny dim lightbulbs
about feet deep
narrower than theyd like
norman descends clumsily awkwardly pushing off the bulky iron handles fastened to the coral walls
close on normans face as he watches the water recede down past his faceplate
ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and bangs at it with a sledgehammer
easy ted were not mining gold
gimme some room here will you
gimme some space
they all back away cramming into the far corner of the airlock as ted keeps swinging
looks alot like an airplane door doesnt it
ted stops and looks at the door
you know i noticed it before but i didnt
you didnt notice shit
you want me to try
youre a year old shrink what are you gonna do
give him the hammer ted
norman takes the hammer
walks up to the wedge
gets his bearings
what is it your back give out
something has caught normans eye
he looks down at the wedge
what is it norman
take a look
barnes comes toward him
the others follow
barnes bends down looks closely down at the wedge in the door
how can it be chipped
i dont know how it can be chipped but its chipped
i thought you said there wasnt any damage done in the crash
then how can it be chipped
on beth she touches the door with her palms feels around
theres heat coming the door
back away then
wait a minute i said back away
would you wait a minute
barnes unstraps a gun nearly the size of an uzzi from his buckle
ted get her away from the door
what are you going to do shoot her
the rumbling louder
get her away
the door begins to slide open
beth backs away
the door sliding is revealing complete blackness inside
the door stops its open its quiet
they all stand there looking at blackness
a long beat
on norman cautiously stepping inside
his helmet light shines on the others ahead of him walking along a foot wide catwalk suspended high in the air
metallic beams and rafters criss cross above them
norman looks over the railing his light strobes through feet of darkness dimly lighting the lower hull a dense network of struts and look at this
what is it
ted spotlights the outer hull
some sort of lead or something
radiation shield you think
a foot and a half thick
thatd withstand a helluva lot of radiation
beths light shines down onto the catwalk
we see footprints outlined on the dusty floor
hold on what is it
any of you get ahead of me walk this far up
i dont think so
because theres footprints here that arent mine
well theyre not mine
on the footprints large like the boots theyre wearing
calm down alright
they gotta be somebodys here
lets stay together please
long shot seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk walking
their tiny streams of light moving about
we see just how ominous this spacecraft really is
why would someone build a ship like this
youd have to ask them
they approach a door at the end of the catwalk
alright beth do that thing you did before
how about i just press the button
she presses a button near the door
the door slides open
press the button
barnes holds out his gun and enters
the others behind him
strange isnt it
you know how it would have a button
earth doesnt have a patent on buttons ted
still make a note i recognized that
on barnes leading them through a small hall
it seems to be opening up into some sort of room when barnes stops
dead in his tracks
serious what do you make of this
on norman as he steps around barnes his light brightening on a sign that reads trash
softly what the hell
very softly harry begins to laugh
norman looks up and sees more of the room as his light shines throughout it tables couches and chairs made of leather very comfortable looking
they begin to slowly wander about
i dont get it
it doesnt make any sense
you dont think it does
i think its rather obvious
is it some sort of joke
like one of those hoaxes
a spacecraft half a mile long with tonnes of coral on top of it
someone went to a lot of trouble
but its impossible
beth touches the table its metal but its soft and rubbery
why would this ship carry instructions in english
think about it
unless this alien spacecraft was you know somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable
im sure christopher columbus wouldve loved these accomodations
good theory ted
well whats your theory
im a woman
i dont theorize
i only deal with facts
all the facts you need are right in front of you
gimme a minute here
i think ive got it
if it is an alien spacecraft save your breath
its not an alien spacecraft
then what is it
beat its an american spacecraft
an american spacecraft
half a mile long
and buried years
yeah good theory harry
its been obvious from the start hasnt it captain
thats why all the secrecy why no one was told about it
we had considered it
that its american
how would you think its american
the chip in the door
on norman glancing up at harry
we take a weeny little wedge bang on it a couple of times and bust off a chunk of the metal
yet any spacecraft even at a low velocity say miles an hour crashes into the water its gonna be like hitting concrete it would crumple like paper
but there isnt a dent to be seen anywhere
not even a scratch
meaning it didnt land in the water
it must have flown here it didnt fly here
it arrived here
from our future
a quiet moment as they take this in
ted and barnes trek through a vast cargo bay like two ants wlth flashlights
i always thought it was one of those myths
like santas reindeer
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back
maybe we didnt want to come back
norman harry and beth
what are you looking for
a light switch
a button opened that door the craft runs on some sort of power
on norman as he sits down in one of the chairs
whats that noise
they listen to a girgling noise
sounds a little like water suddenly the chair normans in wraps around him squeezing him inside padding sliding around his head his shoulders enveloping him sucking him inside
get this thing off me
beth bends down presses a button the chair releases norman
i think the chair thinks you want to fly this thing
on beths faceplate as shes looking down we begin to see reflected in her faceplate yellow digital lettering sputtering across
her eyes look up slowly
as we the black screen in front of the chairs lit up with bright yellow lettering rv lhooq dcoml u
s star voyager assimilating database as a series of numbers race upwards in count
and the desk in front of them lights up a control panel coming to life
nice work norman
whatever i can do to help
on the screen as it changes now filled with columns harry punches some keys on the control panel
a flight recorder
our future is about to be seen in our present
on the screen as it changes
two thousand forty seven
years in our future
unknown entry event
harry pauses looks down and punches more keys
on the screen as it expands in size widens around them curving
we see a galaxy of stars planets coming off the screen into the room becoming three dimensional suspended in air giving the illusion of depth
the image begins streaking outward toward us moving rapidly like were flying through it
the stars and other space matter streaking by
whats that cluster of stars there
in the center
harry stares walking around the desk moving into the d image
a black hole
the cluster of stars grows brighter and brighter as it comes closer and closer brightening
the field twists and turns as the screen and field become blinding as we enter the cluster the black hole
on norman his face bright frightened as he hears ted
we know how this craft got here
where its been
so do we
and it seems to have picked up something on its travels
still on norman frightened
picked up something
what is it
i dont know
but its something alien
angle on our six team members boots in the distance
as we pan up and around we see a curved surface appear a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids
as we come around the team stands looking at the sphere feet in dlameter held by a giant claw gripping it from the top
they walk around it circling it looking up at it
this answers one of our questions
let me get the list out
this spacecraft was designed to pick things up
they see things they want these claws go out and bring it in
they come across this
sphere find it interesting curious
they draw it inside to take back home
but on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past
but what does it do
maybe its a message of some sort you know
see this red here
angle on the sphere some dark red markings on its surface
continuing looks like a design some writing maybe
maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message
that isnt writing
those are grooves
on the red grooves engraved into the surface
they dont represent a message
they arent decorative at all
they have another purpose entirely
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere
a break for what
down a long corridor we see barnes through a half closed door pacing talking on the phone
its definitely something alien another civilization yes sir
well we dont know yet but we think weve found a door
edmunds barnes and the team members minus ted look at the monitor
so how do we get it open
ted seems to have some ideas
on the monitor ted pushing on the sphere door
banging into it with his shoulder
maybe we shouldnt
if it is alien maybe we shouldnt try to open it at all
nodding to norman man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows
the anthropomorphic problem
i mentioned it in my report
didnt you read the report
everything ever written about extra terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human
if it doesnt look human its a reptile or a big insect or something having human values human understanding
whats the problem
theres enough difference between our own species to prove that
take politics our views on abortion the death penalty
cannibalism to be extreme
and now were talking about a new life form
their values and ethics may be incomprehensible
like thou shall not kill
or maybe it cant be killed
you mean whats in that thing is immortal
i dont know
thats the point
everything can be killed
even on earth
thank you beth but i dont think were gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread
and were just talking about three dimensional creatures
what if its five or six or seven dimensional
so dimensional that we couldnt even see it to kill it
i dont know what youre talking about but good point
or it could contain some great benefit to us some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind
but the odds of it being any use to us are against it
you dont know that
lets say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us just like we are to say medieval europe
suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set
there wouldnt be any place to plug it in
just tell me worst case
worst case of what we might find
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas
disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think
produce radioactive waste and disintegrate us into nothing
close on printer typing surface winds at knots estimated time of departure hrs empty sterile
we hear the repeating sound thwap
almost like a dripping faucet
harry on his bunk staring at the wall flicking his middle finger at his cheek thwap
you realize norman that we are all going to die
norman is lying in his own bunk below harry
dont be so optomistic harry
im completely serious
there is something very important missing from that spacecraft
you know what that is
not a clue
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible
i dont follow you
on that flight recorder they called the black hole an unknown entry event
they didnt know what a black hole was
fifty years from now men are going to build that ship in a very tentative experimental way with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible
harry leans his head over his bunk
so we know beat we know it went through a black hole
we saw it
norman when wed get to the surface wed tell someone about the black hole wouldnt we
itd go in some report like some big discovery
so in fifty years when they build that ship theyd make precautions for a black hole
beat but they didnt the called it an unknown entry event
meaning were never gonna get the chance to tell anyone
meaning were never gonna get to the surface alive
to tell anyone
norman gets out of his bed
i cant believe that harry
gimme another explanation
if i had a minute to think maybe but i know youre wrong
look were under a lot of pressure were tired youre not thinking straight
you mean you think im cracking
i didnt say that
then what norman
norman stops pacing a beat
its whats in that sphere isnt it harry
whatever you think is in that thing you think its going to kill you
curious isnt it
before i die id sure like to open it and see
close on monitor video of the sphere
what caused it
i dont know
everything was normal
no changes at all
when did it happen
playback we see the sphere idle
nothing around it
then its door slowly opens revealing blackness inside
and then it closes
let me see that again
edmunds plays it again
we move in on harry staring at the monitor
to himself id sure like to open it and see
on harry those cold intelligent eyes
close on printer typing
knots etd min close on norman and barnes
dont get hysterical norman
im telling you harrys lost it
hes saying theres a deathwish out for each of us
look the ships are clearing out
theyre taking us topside in a matter of minutes
someone can check him out there if its that imprtant
all im saying is someone should keep an eye on him
just worry about yourself
barnes on the phone with the surface
ted talking to him anyway
can i stay sir
im willing to risk it
after what we just witnessed
into phone what
no i know theyre civilians
on norman gathering his things
stuffing his shotty dufflebag
beth at her bunk doing the same
norman stands up
looks at the bunk above him unpacked clothes unpacked belongings a notebook lying there saying property of dr
on norman panicking looking around for harry
into phone i said send the subs down damn it
barnes out the door ted at his heels
did you hear me sir because ted shut up
are you packed
ready to go
i want everyone packed
on norman running at them
what do you mean hes missing
hes here somewhere
the subs on its way
they look at him go
norman runs off
barnes storms down the hall
how can he be missing
sir about leaving were on the bottom of the fucking ocean he cant just walk outside
edmunds working the monitors stops
seeing something on a screen
staring in horror
to herself oh my gosh
barnes phone to his ear
gimme a report i want ladies and gentlemen
who is that
wheres that coming from
please watch your closest monitor
on his monitor harry in jumpsuit and helmet stands in front of the barnes quickly puts on his headset mic
whats he doing there
edmunds norman beth ted staring at the monitor
i thought he was with you norman
through the speakers
get him out of there
i thought i told you people into her mic harry
can you copy
on the monitor harry before the sphere
pay close attention
i think you will find this of interest
the sphere door slowly opens
what the hell is he doing
harry steps up and into the sphere
the door closes slowly behind him
etd min norman with barnes
dont tell me i told you so norman because i dont want to hear it
yelling past him ted i want everything by the door ready to go
on monitor labled sub descent its still
into mic subs are still at surface sir
into phone send them damn it
i know but im not gonna be held responsible norman with him
you cant just leave harry down here sir
i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say
but sir no buts
if he wants to be left well leave him
into phone hello
yes the subs i want a report
yes a report

etd min into phone yes a report
beth inside now
i am not leaving without him
do you hear me
we come down as a team we leave as a team
what are you his mother

into mic edmunds the subs
what the hell is going on here
beth rushes by ted carrying bags to the door
by the bunks
beth running in
cant see him anywhere
edmunds do you have a on norman
well where the fuck is he
in the ship sir
barnes spins to see the monitor
on monitor norman in jumpsuit and helmet running through the ship
barnes slipping on headset mic
norman running across a catwalk
you get your ass back here
you have no authority whatsoever to be in there
you hear me
dont go hero on me now
etd min evacuation imminent sir if the subs havent left by now
theyve left keep watching
sir the door its opening
on the monitor the sphere door slowly opening
revealing where is he
can you see him
a still moment and then harry tumbles out the sphere and falls to the ground
barnes squinting at harry on his monitor
how does he look
can you tell
harry lies motionless
on beth in the hall hearing that
norman running blindly through a hall around corners
norman get out of there now
if the subs arent here yet sir barnes into his headset
theyll be here
norman can you hear me
on norman running
you dont have time
get the hell out of barnes voice goes static and cuts out
on the monitor flickering losing power
sir were losing it
on the monitor flickering fading and all the lights and monitors on harry lying still face down under the sphere
goes to him
checks harrys life support badge
still blinking hes still alive
norman pauses looks up staring at
he can see himself reflected in the swirling mass staring back at himself
the door begins to open closes
begins to open
ted beth and barnes wander throughout
what the hell happened
the lights flicker back on
they switched us over
the ocean floor a cable falling from the surface coiling around and around
angle on their dufflebags piled in the corner by the door
theyve been left behind
looking down a long corridor its quiet
we peek inside the cafeteria
the surface ships will be back
after the storm clears
how long will that be
barnes speaks to the team minus harry and norman
they told me about sixty hours
two and a half days
how long can we last down here
seventy two hours
comfortably whats that mean with oxygen
harry lies on his bunk
he begins to slowly awake
we begin to hear a scratching noise like nails on a chalkboard
it gets louder as harry comes to
he puts his fingers to his temples
norman stands beside him writing in his notebook
what is that
angle on normans pen as he stops writing the noise stops
norman looks down at his pen
harry can you tell me about the sphere
what are you still doing here
you remember opening the door
you were all supposed to leave
you werent supposed to stay down here
tell me about the door
do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere
you dont understand about the sphere
then explain it to me
harry pauses staring almost like a frightened little boy
what is it harry
what happens on page
have you ever read page
page of what harry
i could never read that far
i never wanted to
that far in what harry
harry doesnt say anything
you shouldnt be here norman
its too dangerous for you and the others to be down here
beth comes out from behind a vinyl shower curtain
a towel wrapped around her
beth i wanted to have a word with you
barnes washes his hands at the sink looking at her in the mirror in front of him
back at the door i asked you to back away
i heard you
there are procedures beth that i want followed
and considering whats going on i want you to follow them very closely
a beat forgive me
ive never read the navy manual
i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures
he walks to the door then turns
and beth one other thing
id like from now on for you to address me as captain or sir in front of the men
a long corridor looking into the cafeteria
harry is eating at a table seems more relaxed
the team members around him eating too
harry sprinkles salt on the dish of food in the middle
hey go easy on the salt will ya
were not a bunch of icy streets here
salts good for you ted
helps you from getting impotent
im not impotent
off food these arent half bad fletcher
you might have a second career coming
what are they
harry stops mid chew
there was a whole flock of them out there earlier
its dead down here and then all of a sudden harry drops his fork
he begins coughing
he hacks out the squid from his mouth
a long empty corridor
all is quiet
close on a monitor a series of numbers when did it come across
harrys trying to decode it in his room now
wheres it coming from
we have no surface support
it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater
is it coming from our own computer
harry thinks its some sort of discharge from our own system but ive seen it discharge before and it didnt look anything like this
swarms of pretty pink jellyfish
from under the habitat fletcher swims up to them with a net
harry on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands turns to norman entering the room
getting anywhere with those
theres some sort of pattern here
itll take a minute
have you looked outside
i hate jellyfish
sits on the table harry what happened in the cafeteria
dont do this
dont psychoanalyze me
i hate squid
just like you hate jellyfish
you said something to me before about how we were all going to die
you dont remember that
i dont remember much
its like my memory is on the tip of my tongue but i cant taste any of it
funny my senses are much keener though
hearing seeing smelling
like i can smell your sheets norman
you tried to wash it out earlier but i can still smell the urine
beat dont worry im not going to tell the others
its normal really isnt it
in a crisis
beth ted and barnes watch
on a monitor fletcher outside with the jellyfish
into the mic fletcher
what are you doing out there
theyre like pink snow sir
she says jellyfish are a delicacy
you know i never knew that
get out of there
i dont want anyone going anywhere outside understood
i can feel the heat on my legs
fletcher i want you back here
norman sitting on the table
what happened to you inside that sphere harry
a long beat
harry becomes concerned
does someone else want to go inside
on the monitor fletcher the jellyfish clinging to her facemask her suit
i cant see theyre smearing the faceplate
fletchers suit tears
fletcher get away from there
get out of there
i cant see
on beth bolting out of the room
barnes turning to her
but shes nobody move
theyre eating through
somebody on fletcher underwater jellyfish eating into her plastic faceplate
shes coughing gasping
on the monitor her body twisting contorting
her suit ripping apart
her body falling
close on fletchers face
jellyfish rooted in her skin
close on a microscopic image of a jellyfish
on norman in the corner of the lab inspecting a medical kit
what is this beth
you taking valium
beth looking into the microscope
whatever my mood calls for
norman picks up a book next to the kit leagues under the sea
whered this come from
we have a library
a bad one
it was the only book in there
norman come here look at this
no thank you
i hate jellyfish
walking toward her
when i was six my younger brother and i we went swimming in the pacific
at my mothers beach house
we both felt stinging and when we came out of the water he was wearing jellyfish head to toe
my gosh norman
yeah it was awful
what about you
what happened to you
well i was wrapped in seaweed
it itched for a while but i survived
beat beth do you find it
curious that were seeing all this life down here
nothing and then these enormous flocks of squid
normally id say no
everythings quiet now no ships no divers no electricity
but whats curious is these arent normal jellyfish
what do you mean not normal
they have six tentacles
a new species
and the squid too
they had no stomach
wait a minute
you knew about the squid not being normal
before fletcher went out there
and you didnt tell anyone
beth i mean im not
i wasnt absolutely sure if
they they are or they arent
which is it
why are you beth
why are you looking at me like that
beth she backs away from norman knocking off a speciman jar it shatters on the floor
she starts breaking down
norman watching her falling to the ground picking up the glass hurriedly
i didnt do anything wrong
i didnt mean
shes crying glass in her hands
she looks up at norman frightened nervous
you wouldnt go and tell the others would you
norman hesitates goes to her tries to hold her but she pushes him away
i hate this place norman
i want out
looking down at the room where barnes was on the phone earlier
he stands there now hand on the knob
closes it shut
barnes sits norman in front of him worked up
im not paranoid
i know beth
she can be drastic
you dont want to know
i think i do
a while back beth and i we worked at the same university
she was assisting a chemist there i forget his name doing research experiments
she was also living with him
off barnes look yeah i know
and when she finished her work he kicked her out broke off the relationship and published five papers all her work without any thank you or acknowledgement
she shouldve known better
she put a razor to her wrists a day later
a beat when was this
she tried again five years ago
beat i thought you should know
so you knew this when you wrote your report
at the time i dont know i thought putting her on the list it might help her career catch her a break
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation wait a second and then brought her down here i didnt know it would come to this without
a cautionary word to anyone
beat you know ted said something to me earlier
i think hes right
he said when you got a guy who if he wasnt here hed be standing in the unemployment line you gotta question if you got the right guy
on norman sweating
on the monitor a series of numbers its the same as before but the spacings different now
its definitely nonrandom
harry sitting at the monitor shows ted barnes norman and edmunds a printout of the screan indicating a pattern
its a single sequence repeated over and over
were all very proud of you harry but what the hell is it
maybe its a message
maybe the sphere were not hooked up to the sphere
well if its a discharge its not a discharge
you said before right
so its gotta be a message
from the sphere
whats inside the sphere
if it is a message its probably a substitution code
ill work on it
yeah ill work on it too
to ted flat you do that
ted nervous anxious with five or six printouts in his hand has normans ear in front of the sink
hes manic norman
you know that
this reliance on harry is misplaced
you hear me
hes overlooking things
ted hands him a printout
its not some fucking substitution code its a direct visual representation
you mean a picture
take a look
i rearranged the numbers
put em up to the light
norman does go ahead
squint at it
i dont see anything
hands him another printout try this one
this is like nursery school
dont you see it
its a picture of the creature
inside the sphere
look thats the vertical torso three legs two arms
theres no head so im guessing the creatures head is located within the torso itself you know
on norman teds lost it
well how about we wait and see what harry comes up with
sure why not
give him the trophy
that pretentious son of a bitch
you heard him norman
all that someone went to a lot of trouble try again bullshit
where does he get off saying im impotent
hes a fucking self righteous little prick
close on monitor spirals now
i asked myself why would the sphere be using a code
if youre trying to communicate why use a code
to norman see
whatd i say
codes are for hiding information
so its making a mistake
its making a code without intending to
i figured its probably substituting numbers for letters
then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard
and since were getting spirals i imagined the keyboard as a spiral
so i translated it
ted grimaces at norman
spiralling out of the center you see g is one b is two h is three and so on
when i got the message
whats the message
i have to tell you
how do you mean strange
harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads hello
how are you
i am fine
what is your name
my name is jerry
barnes walks briskly down the hall norman with him
he translated it wrong
my name is jerry
its like see spot run
the message doesnt show a lack of intelligence
its approaching us in a simple way
like you would a dog
holding out your hand letting it sniff get used to you
what am i a dog now
barnes ducks his head into the video feed room
edmunds get in here
i need you for this
in a minute sir
barnes storming through the room the others minus edmunds around the monitor
i want a name
a real name
this things full name rank and serial number
captain i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions i am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we
could meet an alien named jerry
on the keyboard typing first we have to see if hell talk at all
the monitor blinks reply okay jerrys talking
harry types whatd you say
we are friends
cut the friends crap get a name
now lets see if itll switch over to english letters
hello reply hello its not talking its mimicking
give him a chance
hes speaking our language not the other way around
typing good idea ted
confused thank you
hello no reply
whats he doing
the things ignorant
its not ignorant
maybe its pretending to be ignorant
harry types reply harry types reply are you enjoying yourself harry because i dont know what the hell youre doing
he understands me fine
harry types yes reply harry types hello a long beat
reply i am delighted to make your acquaintance
the pleasure is entirely mine i assure you
they stare stunned at the screen
well hes polite
unless its an act
why should it be an act
are you the entity hecho in mexico
whered he get mexico
are you the entity made in the u
he doesnt wait for an answer
who says its a he
not now beth
i want to know who were talking to before we start talking
shes not gonna know sir
to harry ask him
harry types we are
who are you
reply we are hells that mean
we are what
harry types we are the entities from the u
who are you
we have to teach him plurals
harry no you are a many entity
we are many separate entities
is there one control entity
hes saying take me to your leader
he wants to know whos in charge
im in charge
the control entity is captain harald barnes with an o
harold with an o
what you want me to retype it
harry who are you
i am one where are you from
i am here where is the location from where you began
from where you began
thats not even good english
i am from awareness what is that a planet
where is awareness
awareness is did you make a journey
did you make a journey
yes i make a journey
you make a journey
we make a journey together
i am happy
ask him about his weapons
lets talk about guns and violence
you dont think weapons are important
i think we should be careful
consider his emotional response
you want to put him on your couch norman
grill him about his childhood
when he uses a phrase like i am happy i think we should think twice about what we ask him
do not be afraid the all stare at the screen stunned
jerry can you understand what were saying
every word norman walks up to the screen close to it
jerry can you read our minds
yes norman barnes goes to the intercom
edmunds i want you in here
norman focuses on the screen staring
on the screen blank
norman concentrating on the screen
the screen blank
jerry are you there
yes norman we shouldnt talk here
shut it off
i do not wish to intrude we would like to talk alone
i do not agree
that is not possible
i enjoy to talk with you
and we enjoy talking with you
let us talk now wed like to talk with you more
we admire your talents and your great power and understanding
thank you and in your great understanding you know that we are entities who must talk in private with each other
do not be afraid were not afraid we are uncomfortable
am i offended you
not at all we enjoy you very much but we need to talk alone without you listening
i shall oblige thank you
but i am not happy jerry
well be right back after a short break for these messages from our sponsor jerry
are you still there
into intercom edmunds
get in here
i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted
shes not gonna know
she wired this system
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic
dont gimme that psychology bullshit norman
psychology isnt a science its superstition
its a bunch of soft subjective theories without any hard data to back it up
with an intellect like this emotions dont mean shit
its like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer
hed run screaming witchcraft
and you couldnt explain it to him either
modems microchips particle physics
into intercom edmunds
dont make stuff up these emotional theories just so you can feel important here
frankly ted id be much happier if jerry was just a cold emotionless intellect
into intercom edmunds
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional
damn it edmunds
it raises a very serious question what happens if jerry gets mad edmunds
can you copy
an empty chair
edmunds is not here
we hear a repeating thump
on a monitor we see her body wedged in a light stand bracket floating in the water lifeless
her helmet thumping against the wall of the habitat
norman and beth in jumpsuits and helmets walk out from under the habitat
still hearing the thumping
they pause looking around
coast is clear
they go to the south end of the habitat
the thumping louder
norman climbs up the grid like stanchion the support beam holding up the habitat
the body above him flapping in the current
thumping against the wall
he climbs reaching the body
a boot swings catches the loop in his air hose
bubbles shoot out
norman your suit its leaking
the boot comes off in normans hand and the naked foot gray flesh purple toenails kicks his faceplate
look at this
on edmunds suit a long tear in the fabric revealing red mangled flesh
droplets of blood float past normans faceplate
her flesh has been macerated
ive never seen a bite like this before
norman pulls her body out
edmunds faceplate whips around and norman sees her staring eyes mouth open in horror
i cant feel her bones
shes like a sponge
she was crushed
feel her skin its like sandpaper
what could have done this
barnes at the monitors ted with him
what is that
the sensors are picking up something outside
barnes flips a switch
it wont register
its too big to image
white eggs the size of golf balls descend from above
hundreds of them
beth catches one inspects it
what are they
from inside their helmets
you people need to hurry back
the sensors have activated
i dont think youre alone out there
ted walks with norman and beth
what was it
barnes didnt know
couldnt get a reading
has harry spoken with jerry
not that i know of
norman and ted at the console
jerry are you there
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds
with whats out there
im not sure
beth scalpel in hand is making an incision into the shell
looking at the coating here its definitely marine invertebrate
barnes norman harry and ted stand around the table
well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood
what was edmunds doing outside
resetting the sub
in the dome hanger
all our tapes are transferred to the sub
its on a hour timer
if someone doesnt reset the delay button the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes
if something should happen to us the navy will at least have partial records of what happened
at least our obituaries will be accurate
on the egg splitting open
a slimy pinkish brown fluid oozes out
a fetus underneath
they cover their mouths from the smell
what is it
beth picks at it with forceps
im not sure
ive never seen anything like it
youre a fucking biochemist arent you
cant you tell us something
beth glares at barnes
beth holding a piece of paper in her hand pulls norman inside pressing on him
he lied to us
he left us down here
dont make this personal
he told me himself they were taking us back
yeah he told you
what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose
he was on the phone
except that cable is a thousand feet long norman
they wouldve broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute
youre jumping to conclusions beth
dont get worked up fuck you norman
its right here
she shows him the printout in her hand putting a flashlight on the words reads
although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft
signed barnes usn
where did you get this
in edmunds things
you went through edmunds things
hes not just a navy captain he works for the fucking pentagon
calm down beth
dont tell me to calm down
its done alright
and theres not a damn thing we can do about it now okay
he turns to leave
you said something to him didnt you
you told him about me
on norman pausing staring at her
beth you did didnt you
dont do this
beth i didnt
hold it together
she looks at him piercing into his eyes
beth no i should stay calm
like you say
norman looks at her concerned knowing she doesnt believe him
fletcher and edmunds are dead norman
and the only one we can trust to run this place is a fucking liar
on the oxygen regulator bobbing up and down keeping track of the little thats left
barnes norman beth and ted are gathered around the monitors
barnes addresses norman
i dont want you talking to jerry
but sir i think its imperative
i think the messages the animals weve seen what killed edmunds the reading you got earlier i think theyre all related
jerry isnt hostile norman
he said earlier we were his friends of course he did
hes been isloated for years
he wants someone to talk to
look you put a human being in isolation for four days they can become neurotic sometimes psychotic
were talking about years here
an alien that shows emotional responses
i think we need to address him before he reacts further
you think he killed edmunds
yes i do
whatevers out there i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier
whats out there isnt alien
its an animal
but i think we need to ask jerry about it
i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat
he might be listening now
i think he already is
they turn to the monitors nice work captain sir
shut up beth
i dont want to hear it
jerry we dont want to ignore you
dont underestimate my power we dont
yes you do jerry the monitor blinks back we see the sphere
it is closed
we hear the sensor pong
harry alone stares at the fetus on the table
on the sonar impulse monitor lines jumping higher
barnes norman beth and ted watching it
the monitor flashes im not listening blinks back
an outside camera feed infra red a large image streaks by
directions east coming
what was that
barnes flips a switch
it looked like a tentacle
of a squid
the monitors beeping now
the size of a whale
i dont think so
beat target acquired
what if it attacks
fifty yards and closing
what do we use for defense
were a habitat
not a castle
the only defense we have is high voltage
it sends volts throughout the cylinder surface
but weve never used it underwater before
but youve tested it
each time it started fires inside the habitat
what are you saying we cant stop whats out there
the monitors blink i am coming
the monitor blinks to blank
what the hell
bangs on the monitors it shut us down
ted go into the control room
listen for my instructions
ted goes out the door
all the monitors blank
where is it
why cant i
what the hell is going on here
they hear a metallic clanking
what was that
hes right beneath us
the monitors blink i am here
harry looking at the fetus on the table
it suddenly slides down the table
the room is rocked
on shelves jars petry dishes test tubes slide off shattering to the floor
ted is thrown ruthlessly against the wall
his head striking metal splitting open his forehead
the walls cracking and groaning
water breaks through a crack spreading out onto the floor
ted stumbles reaches for the headset
sir were leaking
blood dripping from his forehead
increase positive pressure
thats our reserve air
its either that or we grow gills
they grip onto the console
ted drousy blood gushing from his head keeping balance searches for the pressure gage
ted are you with me
finds the gage
increasing positive pressure
air bubbles burst out of the walls
on the floor the water scurrying back through the leaks in the wall
barnes watching the monitors
thats enough ted
beat shut it off
the pressure gage the needle rising
on the headset in the air dangling from its cord
on ted passed out on the floor
blood covering his face
beth and norman bolt out the door running
theyre thrown against the wall
the pressure gauge rising higher higher
norman and beth losing their balance stumbling to their feet running
on ted sliding out of the control room down the corridor taken by the water
beth grabs him as norman stumbles finds the pressure gage shuts it off
barnes grips his headset as hes thrown to the floor
norman can you hear me
norman grabs the headset slips it on
you see the lever on the green box
upper right hand corner
norman sees it reads it high voltage defense system
on beth in the hall tending to ted looks up at norman
you see the lever next to it
dont do it norman
do you see it
on norman turning from beth to the lever
i see it
dont pull it norman
itll start a fire we cant stop
do it norman its the only choice we have
this thing is gonna crush us
norman dont do it
the walls creaking and screeching
barnes on the floor a monitor crashes alongside him spitting sparks flashing i will kill you do it now
dont do it
creaking groaning of metal
pull it damn it
on norman puts his hand on the lever
he pulls the lever
down the corridors a loud hum from the generators
the lights bang
we hear what seems to be a squeal as the metal rends and an alarm sounds
barnes looks up
the warning board lights up
fire in communications room
fire roars out from the walls
close on fire extinguisher case beth whips it open grabs it
on norman picking up ted lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder
on barnes running down the corridor towards them
barnes falls to the floor taken away by the water
another case on the wall whips open beth grabs gas masks
she looks down the corridor at
barnes on the floor flailing in the water screaming as his legs are caught in a crack in the wall
help i cant
on beth staring at him
just watching him
barnes his body falling through the crack his head bangs into the wall stuck in the crack water choking him
be trying to scream his neck ripping snaps and his body vanishes into the ocean
on beth cold turns away
fire blasts out from the wall
beth and norman still with ted wearing gas masks rush into the room
beth sprays white foam on the fierce flames licking up the side padding smoke boils to the cieling
the room is rocked
it wont stop
norman falls to the floor losing ted
ted slides away and under the computer console
the computer console breaks computers monitors fall crushing on teds legs
he screams out in agony
norman scrambles towards him through the smoke when
the console catches fire erupts in flame
ted underneath it
beth her extinguisher out of foam
norman runs to a wall finds an extinguisher casing its been bent cant get it open
ted reaches out in desperation as his legs catch fire
norman bashes the casing in with his shoulder grabs the extinguisher turns
ted his entire body on fire
norman falls dropping the extinguisher it rolls across the floor
he reaches out cant get it
close on ted his face burning
the lights go out
norman watches in horror as he watches ted lit in flame burning to death
norman reaches for the wall for balance grabs metal and hes electricuted
falls backward head first and everything goes
a long beat
we focus in on norman as he awakens
navy seaman s african american standing above him
does this mean what i think it means
its over sir the storm has cleared
were ready to take you home sir
the navy seaman helps norman to his feet
norman is smiling its over
norman and the navy seaman walk down the hall
how are the others
the others sir
beth and harry
theyre in the sub sir
norman sighs smiling
the relief the jubilation
that whole time i couldnt stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier
what was that sir
about the time paradox
the seaman nodding how we were all going to die that there was no way we would make it out of here alive as norman looks up the navy seaman
still walking and nodding begins to slowly disappear
vanishing before his eyes
norman stops looks around him
norman watches on a monitor the video of him walking down the hall the navy seaman walking next to him
how we were all going to die that there was no way we would make it out of here alive on the monitor the seaman disappers
norman stops tape
looks over at the monitor showing the sphere
it is closed
the screen goes black
flashes up hello norman jerry
yes norman jerry did you create that man
the entity navy seaman was a manifestation
did you have a happy talk
jerry are you manifesting whats destroying our habitat
did you have a happy talk
jerry answer me
stop calling me jerry the monitor shuts off
norman looks over at another monitor labled airlock feed
on the screen beth is putting on her jumpsuit
reflected in the pool of water we see beth slipping on her boots
where are you going in such a hurry
i have to reset the sub
norman stands in the doorway
forget the sub
dont bother me norman
its not worth the risk
its also our only way out of here
it holds three people
and theres only three of us left now
you me and harry
you me and harry
wake him then
get outta we cant
the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here
and we have four days of decompression when we get up top
get the helium out of our bloodstream
we go to the surface now wed pop like a soda bottle
she begins to put on her helmet when she stops
maybe you should go
to the sub
why should i go
you should know how it works
just in case
in case you die too
i dont trust harry to do it
but my suit i fixed your suit
she goes to it
brings it to him
watching her closely you fixed my suit
you dont trust me
but i dont know how you press a button norman
its not brain surgery
here go ahead
you only have minutes to reset it
go on norman
she hands him a briefcase the tapes inside
ill watch the sensors for you
norman drops to the bottom with the briefcase
lands on the ground
checks his life support badge
she mustve fixed it
youre clear norman
he walks along out from under the habitat
carefully looking around
the subs a feet in front of you
you see it
i cant see anything
how does it look
norman hesitantly ventures out
the dark water
anything could be out here
we hear him breathing
his breathing gets shorter
he looks at his life support badge
whats the matter
you fixed this suit
no reply beth
youre just nervous
my air isnt
im coming back
counters at minutes
you dont have time
his breathing is short but managable
he continues on
ahead of him the dome hanger attached to a large gray cylinder forty feet high
underneath the dome hanger norman climbs up to the hatch door
looks below him
nothing around him
he spins the wheel and pushes the hatch open
lifts himself up awkwardly
grabs handholds and pulls himself up into the pocket of air trapped inside the dome
the sub in front of him
he finds the hatch opens it climbs inside the sub
norman sits in the small seat
he bangs at his helmet
he searches the subs control panel
gadgets switches buttons
up top a flashing red lit button timer hold
it stops flashing and a small screen glows timer reset count
it begins counting backwards
he looks at the control panel a video screen with the choices descend ascend secure the sub slightly sways
norman sits still nervous
harder this time
norman looks through the glass windshield
cant see anything in here
it sways faster harder back and forth
he grips the seat
hes thrown around in the sub
he cant see anything tosses around
he reaches for the doorhandle
he looses grip his legs fly up in the air
the sub almost turns over on its side
his helmet bangs into the glass we see his look of terror
water splashing up from below
then everything stops
the sub sways to a still
he sits quietly
reaches for the doorhandle cautiously climbs out
stands on top of the sub
he looks around finds a door inside the dome
tries to open it
looks down at the water
can he risk it
his breathing short
can you hear me
he dips his leg slowly quietly into the water
then cautiously slips down into the water
close on his face terrified
doesnt see anything
lands on the bottom
his life support badge beeping
shortness of breath
he walks trying to run out from under the dome hanger
the dark water
cant see anything
scared to death
the habitat ahead of him
norman goes to a stanchion
grips onto it
doesnt see anything
life support badge bleeping faster
norman where are you
i cant breathe
you see the airlock
norman twists around and as he does
hisses at his faceplate
on his hand holding the snake not the girder lets go
looking up the snake wrapped around the stanchion slithering between the grid like posts
the snakes head comes at norman as he falls to the ocean bottom
backpeddaling on his arms and feet
the snake hissing coming at him
its long tongue flicking at him inches from his faceplate
norman backpeddaling cant breathe the snake coming down on him norman falls on his back the tongue whipping across his faceplate when
norman is whisked up
harry has him by the collar of his suit
taking him up
they burst out of the water
harry throws norman onto the floor
unhooks his helmet norman breathes fast and furious
norman panting walks with harry
my suit beth said she fixed it what happened to her
what do you mean
shes not here
when i woke up nobody was here
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me
her suits gone
i thought she was with you
norman and harry at the mic
what do you mean
im in the ship
what are you doing in the ship
we were out of food
you sound mad
yeah well i get that way when im facing death and someone deserts me
harry said hed take over for me
harry shakes his head no way
when he woke up he said we were out of food
he told me to get some from the ship
i never said that
yes you did
norman i wouldnt leave you out there
you know that
we never even had a conversation norman
we stood right there harry covers the mic
shes cracking norman
you didnt say that about the food
i was just in the cafeteria theres plenty of food in there
take a look for yourself
but why would she
shes lying norman
just like she lied about fixing your suit
harry uncovers the mic
you get it straightened out
i think so beth
norman sitting at a table eating a couple pieces of cold chicken
a salad some fruit and boxes of crackers on the table
beth walks in carrying a bag of food
whats harry doing with your suit in there
but i fixed notices the food whered you get all that
its a pretty common place to look for food when you dont think you have any
that wasnt in there before
we mustve had it delivered then
wait a second deepsea delivery
i hear theyre good
none of this was here before
did you look
it was on the top shelf
no it wasnt
i swear none of this was here
none of it
beat you think he hid it
he mustve hid it
you dont believe me
all i know is i opened that refridgerator damn it norman
i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit
you think its me
you think im saying there was a conversation when there wasnt
i dont know beth
i wasnt there
damn it norman
dont you get it
there is something seriously fucked up going on here and hes causing it
why cant you believe me
to her left she looks harry is standing in a doorway cold holding normans jumpsuit
he turns away
on beth looking back at norman tears rolling down her eyes
harry neatly hangs normans jumpsuit under the hook labled johnson
smoothens it out for him
on beth sitting at a table her face in her hands
on norman looking at her as he closes a box of crackers
wraps cellophane over the chicken
walks with it over to the refridgerator
opens it placing the chicken inside
but he cant
are books neatly lined up on each of the shelves
norman backs away
what the hell
norman now looks at the cupboards
goes to them
books neatly stacked
norman panicking opens each of the cupboards all of them with all of the books are the same
entitled leagues under the sea by jules verne
norman looks over at beth
what is it norman
she comes to him
he stands there bewildered scared mind racing
norman paces frantic almost running his hands through his hair trying to think
turns to beth
i could never read that far
norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf turns pages gets to page
our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long
some skeletons of squids
according to calculations of some naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles feet long
that would make a formidable monster
he looks up from the book realizing something
snaps the book closed
close on harrys dufflebag norman rifles through notebooks
tears off the first jerry transmission
beth standing at the doorway keeping watch down the hall
norman what is it
norman grabs harrys yellow pad of paper
their feet scurrying through the water soaked corridor
norman ushers her into the control room
shuts the door
norman scribbles on the printout glancing at the yellow pad of paper
after the attack a navy guy woke me up i dont know i thought he was an illusion
but i checked the tape and jerry said he manifested him
brought to life
i dont know
but at the end jerry said stop calling me jerry
and norman stops staring at the pad
he translated it wrong
norman picks up the pad of paper reads
how are you
i am fine
what is your name
my name is harry harry is walking towards the living quarters
remember when we first spoke to jerry barnes kept asking for jerrys real name
but harry never would
he didnt because he was afraid the screen would say harry instead of jerry
we werent talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry we were talking to harry
or a part of harry
what do you mean a part of harry
when did the messages start
the animals outside start showing up
after harry came out of the sphere
you think in the sphere he acquired some sort of power
a power to manifest things
i dont know
how can the sphere do that
i dont know beth
im not the fucking alien that built the thing
but it can
when harry came out of the sphere he mumbled something about page
how he would never read that far he was too scared to
then you found the book remember in your lab
then in the cafeteria and page talks about a giant squid
which i told barnes was attacking its his fear
hes manifesting his fears
making them real
but why is he doing it
he must not realize he is
like the navy crewman harry was sleeping then
he mustve manifested his dream
you cant control your dreams
and you cant control your fears can you
shaking his head no
i mean weve always believed we can think anything we want without consequences
you ever read the bible
off her look it talks about our sinful nature you know
i mean we can think and believe and desire whatever we want but theres a part of us a shadow side as jung called it that cant be controlled
its inside us
its what we are
harry lies on his bunk asleep
and thats the part of harry thats being manifested
and if it is its a part of him not even he can control
harry opens his eyes stares at us
on screen a transmission comes across
beth and norman watch
looks like some sort of code
why would harry go back to using a code
you mean jerry dont you
harry leaning against the doorframe enters the room
i said jerry didnt thats a hell of a mistake to make beth
slip of the tongue
yeah i dont know how you could make that confusion
norman watching them
wisconsins your answer
off screen navy transmission
theyre sent from wisconsin
how do we decode it
dont have to
itll do it for you
the screen jumbling its letters until finally
norman and beth smile
the cavalry is on its way
it begins decending in count
just in time too
in time for what
just in time for what
beth nervous tries to cover
our habitat i mean
this place cant handle another attack
a long beat as beth stares at harry
why are you looking at me like that
im not youre staring at me
no im not
im not star yes you are
harry looks at both of them suspiciously
did i miss something
you two seemed to patch things up awfully fast
a tense beat
we just figured you know the three of us we need to
work together through this
the three of us
beat is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag
norman glances at the screen behind harry i will kill you all
close on the medical cabinet whipping open
norman quickly digs through the medicines
something for burns
beth at the computer looking up the names
its for motion sickness
a synthetic opium analogue
does it cause drowsiness
thats all we need
to get him unconscious put him under
nothing about drowsiness
and may also cause bizarre halucinations
norman throws it on the floor
how do you spell it
p a r a s o
its a soporific
its like a sleeping pill
used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride
norman digs finds paracin trichloride
here we go
beth mixing the medicines
reading from the computer ccs of parasolutrine in combination with ccs of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures
no cardiac side effects rem activity is surpressed
how long does it last
three to six hours
ill just boost the doses
wait isnt that dangerous
how fast does it take effect
what if it takes minutes norman
what if it takes an hour
and he can fight it off
we cant afford that
beth goes to the cabinet grabs another medicine
norman comes over as she adds it to the mix
what is that
what are you doing
what do you want to do kill him
its an idea
beth to be on the safe side
i mean you want to kill him
look its either him or us norman
another attack and we go down with this place
she fills the large syringe with the clear liquid mix
you ever given an injection before
thirty years ago
i passed out
only lab rats
she hands him the syringe
give him the whole thing
hurry before he wakes up
norman looks at the syringe like its an assault rifle
where do i stick it
harry sleeps on his bunk
the door to the room is closed
norman spirals down the stairway from the lab
hurrying through the dark cafeteria the syringe at his side
shuffling down the corridor nervously
glancing at the syringe
and sees in front of the living quarters
two african american navy crewmen standing guard of the door
norman stops hides behind the wall
norman comes in
hes got farrakahns army standing guard
whats plan b
the room shakes
cabinet doors swing open
norman falls to the floor
the computer monitor crashes down in front of his face
it reads i norman and beth running
water shoots through the wall
gushing out onto the floor
the walls cracking
on harry running out of his room
what is it
you know what it is harry
they lose their balance still running
its the squid
what are you
another crack water gushing inside
you know damn well what
youre doing it
norman grabs harry pushes him up against the wall
im not doing anything
beth takes the syringe from her palm and stabs harry in the shoulder
norman and beth sit at a table sipping coffee
not believing you
youre not sorry
beat youre a psychologist norman
you pride yourself on knowing when someones lying to you not telling you the truth
and now youre scared because youre not sure you can tell anymore
on norman watching her sizing her up
on harry lying on a stretcher in the corner propped up with pillows and a blanket
an iv in his arm
norman at the console stares at the monitor of the sphere
a long beat
his reflection staring back at him
he slips on the headset
the room is empty
can you copy
on the jumpsuit hangers the jumpsuit under the name dr
beth halperin is missing
norman at the mic
what is it norman
where are you
in the sub
resetting the timer
on the monitor beth sitting in the sub
the sphere looks different
what do you mean different
the grooves around the door theyve shifted
and the pattern the fluids they look darker now
beat hows harry
on harry the iv in his arm
close on a monitor
descending in count
norman pouring himself more coffee alone
beths suit still gone
harry lying on the stretcher still
norman watching him from above sipping his coffee
norman goes to the console sits
checks the monitors
looks around the console not knowing what it is
a flashing light on the sensor board
norman still doesnt know what it means
the monitors go blank
beth the monitors flash up i am coming
norman spins around goes to harry lying still
norman grabs harrys wrist
norman returns to the console slips on the headset
can you hear me
get the hell out of there
the monitors boot up again
norman looks at the sub video monitor the sub is gone from under the dome
bangs on the headset
im getting some sort of reading
theres something he scans the monitors looking for movement
they are all still
norman turns to looks at harry
close on harrys face still
back on norman sweating
and whatever it is its not coming from harry
norman looks at the monitors on an outside camera feed a bright light blinds the screen
its beth in the sub moving along the habitat
the subs claw arms carry large red boxes
the lettering on the boxes isnt in focus
norman squints at the monitor cant make it out
what is that
what are you doing
the subs claw arms drops one of the boxes plumping it softly on the muddy floor
can you hear me
can you copy
get inside theres something out there
on another monitor the sub moves forward
churning up the sediment
it stops again and releases another box
norman bangs on the headset
damn it beth i know you hear me
the monitors blink i am coming for you on norman breathing heavy
what the hell
another monitor the sub in view a closer view
it releases its last box
norman can read the lettering now caution tevac beth
what are you
the monitors flash i will kill you oh shit
norman whips off his headset bursts out of his seat opens a cabinet
searching for tapes
a shelf labled sphere all the tapes are gone
the monitors flash i will kill you on the headset resting on the console
we hear faintly
norman pushes harry and his iv down the corridor
an inch or two of water on the floor
close on a metal case labled captain harold barnes
norman bangs it against the wall trying to bust the lock
breaks the lock
digs inside the case
pulls out a gun
norman pushing harry and the iv stand
wheels him into
turns off the main lights
the room goes dark
the florescent light above the sinks stay on
norman wheels harry inside places him by a wall
checks the iv
norman goes to a stall
keeps the stall door open
can still see harry about feet away
norman looks at the gun
pinches his finger
norman looks over at the sinks
a faucet is on
water hissing faintly from it
norman ignores it
waiting in the dark
on the faucet the water running
on norman looking at it
cant ignore it
norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor
the light above them on
norman turns the faucet off
the water stops
but the hissing sound remains
norman looks at the faucet queerly
turns it back on
the hissing sound still there
it isnt the water
norman looks down at his feet
the floor seems to be moving
something swimming in the water
close on normans pantleg a long tubular sea snake slithers up inside his pantleg hissing
his pants bulging as the snake slowly slides up past his knee
as more snakes comes through the crack in the wall
norman watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the snake slithers up to his groin and across the inside of his shirt
another snake begins wrapping itself around the outside of norman sliding up around his neck
norman standing still watches as more snakes crawl up his sides slithering around his arms his shoulders his neck under his chin over his face
their forked tongues flicking and hissing
what time is it norman
norman looking in the mirror as beth comes up behind him in her jumpsuit
do you know the time
norman glares at her in the mirror
his body stiff
i have to know the time of day norman
do you know
snakes covering his eyes slithering across his mouth
through his teeth your watch
a snake flicking its tongue at normans lips
trying to get inside his mouth
what was that
i couldnt hear you
oh yes my watch
i almost forgot
she looks at her watch
she begins grabbing the snakes off of him carefully dropping them to the ground
snakes writhing in her hands twisted around her wrists
shakes them off
some drop in the sink
she bends out of view and the snake inside normans shirt moves back down the way it came
past his stomach his groin
norman heaves from his chest vomits on the mirror
close on a pot pouring a white milkish drink into a cup
beth walks it over to norman sitting at a table looking ill
isotonic glucose supplement
norman looks at the cup
go ahead drink it
norman places the cup down
whats wrong norman
im feeling better
beth takes a seat
stares at him
a long beat
its getting cold
you think id really drink that
you dont think i put something in it do you
you put explosives around the habitat i cant imagine what youd put in a drink
i did do that didnt i
she picks up the drink and begins sipping it
norman watches her
how do you feel about snakes
what do you mean exactly
you know what i mean
am i afraid of them
not during the day
sea snakes are diurnal
when the suns out they dont bite
fortunately for you i had on my watch
off cup this is quite good
what are they doing down here
in the bathroom
you tell me
do you fear them
are you manifesting them
if i was then i wouldve had to have gone in the sphere wouldnt did you
whats the phrase keeping up with the joneses
why did you go in the sphere beth
same reason i put explosives around the habitat
for the power
to protect myself
hes not a threat
no he isnt
he cant manifest
no he cant
then why beth
why go in
why put out explosives
why manifest the snakes
you think i manifested the snakes
yes someone did
but it wasnt me norman
beat it was you
you manifested the snakes
a long beat between them
beth youre losing it
youre lying am i lying
are you sure
are you absolutely sure im lying
off his look then explain to me about the jellyfish
why did we see jellyfish
harry doesnt fear jellyfish
theyre your fear arent they
but and the snakes
you want to know about the snakes
you saw one outside earlier didnt you
when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified
realizing thats when you went in the sphere
one lonely terrifying sea snake
you manifested that beth
or was that you
beat when you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened didnt you
like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor
you did that norman
or am i making so much sense that youre going insane
i never went in that sphere
you dont remember you did
but im sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry dont you
you remember that
you remember before you picked him up when you looked up at the sphere you remember that when the sphere opened
off his look thats right
but you cant remember going inside can you
no of course not
harry couldnt either could he
like everythings on the tip of my tongue he said
beth the message said harry
my name is harry
my name isnt harry
no it isnt
your name is norman
but your younger brother what was his name
the one who was stung when you were younger
the one that died
the one you couldnt save
what was his name
imitating mommy were going out to the ocean to go swimming
but i dont want to go swimming norman
cmon harry itll be fine itll be fun
resuming you heartless fuck
thats why youre so scared of the water isnt it
shut up beth when you were in that sub and that squid was attacking you are you sure it was the squid that was attacking
do you know
i cant get beth on the radio
im in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean
surrounded by all this water
was it really the squid that was attacking you norman or was it something else one of your fears
you never really saw what it was did you
norman stares up at her frightened
is she right
im not scaring you am i norman
i hope im not frightening you
the last thing i want to do is frighten you
you feel okay dont you
its not me beth
it cant be
its not me beth
its not me
it cant be
im not doing anything
just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle
norman looks at her palm sees the needle in her hand
norman backs up away
but i have to norman
i promise promise what norman
beth you think id belive you
believe anything you might say now
after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past
about my problems
its either this
or i kill you
the gun in her other hand
beth she comes at him needle in hand
its your choice
because its not safe for you to be awake
to be walking around
to be thinking about things
its not safe for you to be either
you think i care
you think i care if i die
almost laughing would i put explosives around the habitat set on vibration sensors that can trigger automatically if i cared about myself
ive tried twice before norman why wouldnt i try a third time
im not thinking about myself no norman im thinking about you
protecting you from your own self
she lunges at him with the needle missing
he runs for the spiral staircase leading to the lab
norman grabs the handrail begins climbing the stairs
beths at his feet grabbing for his ankles
im doing this for you norman
he frantically crawls up the stairs her grasping at his heels
climbing climbing round and round the stairs never seem to end
he looks up the stairs expanding in front of him strangely increasing in number
he climbs racing panting
beth right behind him laughing almost
come here norman
she grabs his ankle
she raises the needle
norman turns kicks her in the face
she wails blood spitting from her nose
the stairs increasing above
he lunges for the top step grabs it
pulls himself up
he stares down at beth the gun pointing at him
norman he slams the hatch door on top of her bashing her head down
he holds the door closed
trying to regain his breath
this is what im talking about norman
dont you see
its in you
get away from the door beth
he slides a heavy file cabinet over on top of the door
oh norman i dont want to come in
the doors metal pivot turns
on beth on the stairs spinning the doors wheel
i want to lock you in
norman staring at the wheel
its locked from the outside
norman falls to his knees
close on a surveillance video camera in the upper corner of the room
youre a psychologist norman
you of all people dont want to admit to your shadow side
on a monitor we see norman sitting in a corner of the lab staring up at us
you have a professional stake in believing in your own mental health dont you
dont you norman
norman huddled on the floor
of course youre going to deny it
you want to blame someone else
you want to blame beth
because you hate beth
dont fuck with me beth
im not fucking with you norman
youve fucked yourself
norman jumps up looks at the ground water on the floor
rising in level
turn off the water beth
the entire floor is covered in water rising higher and rising fast
youre frightened arent you norman
norman wading through the water searching
where is it coming from beth
dont you know
beth stop it
dont blame me
its not me
norman frantically checking for a crack a leak
then wheres it coming from
from you norman
from your mind
youre doing it
its up to his waist
he climbs on top a lab bench
puts his hands to his temples straining
we hear beth laughing
a specimen bottle explodes right next to him
theres no ventalation in the room norman
the pressures going to kill you
another bottle shatters shooting fragments of glass across the room
its you norman
your fear of drowning
you have to face it
microscope lenses crack
bottles test tubes dishes expolde
let me put you under
before you kill yourself
bottles floating in the water pop
the water too high norman swimming in it now keeping afloat
his face strains from the pressure
he looks at the camera in the corner
its over norman
next to the camera he sees the hatch door in the ceiling
dont even think it
you dont have your suit norman
the water will freeze you
he reaches up at the door
cant get it
the water rising
he dives down in the water
he swims to a cabinet near the floor opens it searches things floating out an oxygen cylinder and mask he grabs it
normans face bursts above water level slips on the mask breathes
it wont help norman
your body is boyant
youre gonna shoot right to the surface and explode norman
dont you get it
he breathes a last breath reaches up to the ceiling hatch door spins it
norman what are you doing
youre insa the door opens and water gushes inside
he grabs the frame of the door and his body shoots up through the hole
his body upside down his hand holding onto the frame
he grabs a pipe next to it pulls himself hand over hand along the pipe
his face straining from the freezing chill
moving along the pipe hand over hand
he loses grip
his body thrusts upwards
close on his right hand purple frozen holding onto the pipe
his face his eyes fluttering
he blows air from his mouth bubbles burst from his lips
his body slightly descending
his left hand grips the pipe
he continues on
hand over hand
he sees the airlock in front of him
he scoots along but slower now
he clasps his hand to his chest its burning
he sees the airlock
his eyes fluttering hes losing consciousness
he cant do it
and he lets go of the pipe
floating upwards is he gone
his head bangs into the habitat floor
his body flat underneath it
being sucked upwards against it
he pushes forward
trying to grab the floor with his hands
hes inches from the airlock
plants his feet against the wall and pushes forward
his body sucked up and away
his head bursts above the water level big breath
he flails his arms over to the ladder
grips the ladder but his hands are like ice
cant hold it
flailing in the water
he heaves his chest over the metal rim
twists his legs around out of the water and flops his body onto the deck
tries to get up
his body shaking
his lips purple
his eyes barely open looking at
his jumpsuit hanging on the wall
norman crawls toward the suit his body shaking violently
he reaches out for his boots on the floor
cant grip them
inches his head toward his suit tries to bite at his suit but his teeth chattering
i know what youre doing norman
but you cant save yourself
he grips the wall his hands pulling him up
he rips his suit off the hanger
its over norman
its all over
slipping on his suit he hears a mans voice
your attention please
your attention please
all construction personnel clear the blast area now
tevac explosives are now activated
mark minutes and counting
on norman as he slips on his helmet his teeth chattering
close on the airlock hatch door norman trying to open it
through normans helmet locked
dont try norman
you cant get in
i wont let you in
norman turns dives back in the water
norman swims out from under the habitat
looks around at the cylinders the walls
goes to the outside of a wall
looking for a crack a leak a way in
to his left barnes body floating hooked to the wall
norman goes to him
sees the crack
struggling through the crack careful not to rip his suit
flooded to the top with water
norman emerges through the crack
moves down the hall
floats by his faceplate
norman where are you
i cant see you norman
tell me where you are
norman pulls at the cylinders hatch door
he hears faintly through his helmet
twelve minutes and counting
he opens the door
slips inside the water going with him
a screen flashes d cylinder hatch door open the chair in front of the console spinning empty
beth just left
norman closes the door
down the corridor
norman ducks inside

the cylinder a maze of pipes and equipment
heaters controls and wires everywhere
difficult to see
we see norman walking through the cylinder
holding his helmet at his hip
leave me alone norman
he goes to her voice in the back
past pipes equipment
i cant do that
on beth huddled in the back corner wedged among pipes
her eyes red
holding the gun in her hand
pointing at norman as he sees her through the pipes
abover her head a computer screen reading detonation sequence
descending in count
norman stares up at the screen concentrating
you cant stop it norman
you cant fight me

beth gimme the gun

she sees her reflection on a piece of broken glass on the floor
she puts her fingers to her matted hair tries to comb it
over the intercom
nine minutes and counting
on the gun we see beths wrists
the two scars
its over norman
go on get outta here
norman walks toward her

from behind her harry whacks beth across the head with a wrench sending her to the ground
norman goes to her checking her pulse
did i kill her
i dont think so
i could hit her a little harder
more toward the cranium
norman stares at the numbers on the screen above him
if shes still conscious you cant fight her
you cant stop the numbers
over the intercom
eight minutes and counting
killing hers the only way hey
we didnt kill you alright
and believe me harry i wouldve found great pleasure in bashing your head in
norman rips off a piece of her t shirt ties it to the wound around her head

harry in his suit now helps norman slip on beths boots and jumpsuit

norman carrying beth on his back hurries through the water
i repeat five minutes to detonation
norman tries to climb up the ladder with beth on his back
she falls off deadweight to the ground
picking her up harry
im gonna have to lift her up to you
harry leans down from the subs airlock
norman pushes her up to him but she bends at the waist
i cant reach her
norman flops her up in the air but she bends again at the waist

norman takes beth and pushes her on top the sub
the sub sways back and forth
norman what are you they lose balance beth almost falls norman catches her
alright harry get in there
harry jumps on top of the sub
slides inside it
reaches his arms out catching beths legs
three minutes and counting
take her come on
just beths leg swings up and hits harry in the helmet
im trying to keep balance with gimme a second just pull her down like inside harry work with me here
her legs are in the way
you got her
harry pulls beth down inside as norman steps on top of the sub helps push beths head inside
get her out of the seat i need room to sit
two minutes thirty and counting
norman drops inside
norman in the seat
beths leg hangs over his right shoulder
harry looks at norman who assesses the flight controls
you know how to work this thing
well press something
two minutes and counting
how long did you say shut up
let me think
norman presses a button
the screen blinks descend ascend secure shutdown
norman hits ascend
the sub whirrs rumbles and drops down below
norman works the steering wheel gliding it upwards
the sub comes out from under the dome
rising above the habitat
less than a minute were never gonna make it
nine hundred feet to surface
its not fast enough norman
theres a helluva lot of explosive down there
the sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin
harry looking down below him
thirty seconds to detonation
the shock waves gonna crush us norman
harry just stares at norman
norman grabs beth trying to stablilize her
off normans suit hows that working out by the way
now that i have it on
harry laughs why are you laughing
you dont even know what that means
but i always said to myself when i die i want to die laughing
a thunderous explosion below them
rocking the sub spinning it up and around surging it upwards to the surface
through the windshield racing toward the surface toward the sunlight its blinding and the screen goes white
a pale white room
on norman sleeping
his eyes begin to open
beth is next to him looking at him
there is a long beat
norman looks up at her
you know i think you really need to see a psychologist
she stares back at him and smiles
begins laughing with him
two navy crewmen stand outside the door looking in
has anyone spoken to them yet
shakes his head the admirals going over the tapes they brought up now
does he know yet what really happened down there
looking inside norman harry and beth sit at a table
at the table
theyre going to want answers and theyre going to keep asking until they get them
we can refuse to talk
wont make any difference
the tapes document everything
a long beat
there is one possibility
we all kill ourselves
laughing then bad joke
the power allows us to manifest our fears right
what if we feared the power to go away
you mean forget
it would erase all our knowledge of it
all of our power
would it work
and i think we already know it will
down below harry said we would all have to die
since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible and we all knew then we would all have to die
before we could tell anyone
death was the only logical explanation
but sitting here we still know
so how is that possible
beat unless we make ourselves forget
norman harry and beth walk with the crewmen
the admiral s many stripes on his sleeves sits behind his desk
harry and beth sit in front of him
the tapes on the desk
there are some questions that we need to address here
when you were being transferred to decompression dr
adams you mentioned something about a squid
however there doesnt seem to be any squid recorded on these tapes
i dont remember anything about a squid
to harry did you say something about a squid harry
harry shakes his head
a bright sunny day
on the helipad the helicopters propeller begins whirling
an officer sits in the passengers seat glancing at a clipboard
you all ready to go dr
the pilot from the opening scene
the one that wrote the report
on norman in the back
