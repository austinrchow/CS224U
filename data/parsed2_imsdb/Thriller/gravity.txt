written by may like all images of earth seen from space this image of our planet is mythical and majestic
the globe seems almost tangible slowly spinning floating in the endless void of space
it is a blue planet and bright white clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents green yellow and
it is noon in cape town and early night in india
the sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened sliver on its eastern edge
it is beautiful
and so full of life
but not here
here it is completely silent
a small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding earth
if it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us
it is the size of one football field
it is the international space station iss
it resembles a dragonfly
its solar panels stretch out like wings from the long body made of connected pressurized modules
it floats with a sense of proud achievement
it orbits at an altitude of km above sea level
it moves at an average of kilometers per hour completing
laps around the earth per day
it is cruising over zimbabwe
to the east the island of madagascar
up to the north the expansive dry lands of somalia and ethiopia
soon the iss curves around the spherical planet and it becomes smaller almost indistinguishable no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere
orbiting at an altitude of km the explorer space shuttle becomes visible
this icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of nasas missions since the late s
faintly we hear static voices murmuring over radio frequences
as the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst the on radio faint explorer please verify that the p ata removal on replacement cap part and are complete
on radio faint dma m m m and m are complete
on radio faint copy that explorer
dr stone houston requesting status update
a fizz of static and then the voice continues with sudden starling clarity
installation ninety five percent complete
running level one diagnostics on circuits sensors and power
looks like were on schedule
stone medical is concerned about your ecg readings
im fine houston
well medical doesnt agree doctor
are you feeling nauseous
not any more than usual houston
diagnostics are green
linking to communications card
ready for data reception
if this works when we touch down tomorrow im buying all you guys a round of drinks
thats a date doctor
just remember houston is partial to margaritas
ok here we go
booting comm card now
please confirm link
houston please confirm reception of data
were not seeing any data
stand by houston
im gonna reboot the comm card
an astronaut matt kowalski floats thirty meters away from the shuttle wearing a bulky white space suit and a full bubble like helmet
houston i have a bad feeling about this mission
okay let me tell you a story
id been up here days
every time i passed over texas id look down knowing the second mrs kowalsky was looking up thinking of me
six weeks im blowing kisses to that woman
then we land at edwards and i find out shed run off with a lawyer before i was off the launch pad so i packed my car and i headed
youve told this story kowalsky
as houston recalls she took off in your gto
engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype
matt smiles checks the monitors of the sleek device strapped to his back
five hours off the reservation and i show drain
my compliments to engineering
except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust
engineering says thank you
tell them i still prefer my corvette though
speaking of which did i ever tell you the we know the corvette story matt
were going to miss you matt
matt grins fiddles with a control and propels himself away from the shuttle
stationed around the telescope are two astronauts carrying out a repair mission
they are also wearing space suits but unlike matt they are not wearing manned maneuvering units
safety tethers are the only things stopping them from floating away into space
comm card reboot in progress
thank you doctor
shariff whats your status
replacing battery module a and c
shariff dasari is an indian engineer in his mid thirties
he is attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the hubble
this is his second mission into outer space
could you be more specific
indeterminate estimates make houston anxious
no houston dont be anxious
anxiety is not good for the heart
the system is ready to re activate
hubble telescope engaged
upgrade fully functional
that applause you hear is for you shariff
kick back take the rest of the day off
shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in hindi bursting into a zero g bollywood choreography that is repressed by the stiffness of his space suit
jaise baadal paani ka yaarana hai oh jaise paani ka yaarana hai
matt please advise as to mission specialist shariffs current activity
he appears to be doing the macarena of some sort
though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part
matt is now approaching the explorer skillfully maneuvering his thrusters
the other astronaut stands perched on a robotic arm attached to the shuttle
the arm is a crane like moving platform remotely operated from inside the shuttle
we track in on the astronaut as she works intently alone
medical now have you with a temperature drop to
and heart rate rise to
how are you doing
houston im fine its just
keeping your lunch down in zero g is harder than it looks
medical is asking if you want to return to explorer
ryan hums as she jiggles the card
no weve been here for a week houston lets just finish this
ryan stone is a medical engineer specialized in hospital scanning systems
shes focused on her work as though shes all alone in the world
this is her first mission
ryan eyes the card then
card is up
thats a negative
im afraid were getting nothing on this end doctor
ryan eyes the card then
a beat then
houston could you please turn that music off
not a problem
matt toggles a switch and the music stops
thank you kowalsky
ryan moves the card around
could houston be misinterpreting the data
were not receiving any data
engineering is recommending a vis check for component damage
again as if to herself mmmm
let me see whats going on
she starts to disengage one of the panels
what have you got here
ryan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to examine it
matt begins to approach her
visual examination doesnt reveal any damaged components
the problem must be originating in the comms panel
that seems to be the case
engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen
thats as close to an apology as youre going to get from them
we shouldve listened to you doc
without losing any time ryan puts the card back into the im on it
how long do you think itll take you
matt begins a wide loop around the telescope
we appreciate your patience doctor
installing your system in the hubble is the main purpose of this mission
ryan doesnt respond continuing to work
matt closes in as he circles the telescope
houston trusts mission commander kowalsky realizes that this delay is not of sufficient duration to enable him to surpass anatolys solovyevs spacewalking record as most recent calculations indicate that he
will be left
seventy five minutes shy
never crossed my mind
matt its been a privilege
matt hesitates ever so briefly then
right back atcha houston
enjoy your last walk
am i a go to assist dr
stone in removing the panel
thank you houston
mind if i join the fun
ryan begins unbolting
matt lands right next to ryan and grabs onto the telescope
she is frustrated determined
how are you feeling
like a chihuahua thats being tumble dried
matt takes out his pistol grip and with fast precision puts its head to a bolt and begins unscrewing
matt removes the bolt with confidence
its been a rough week
if it makes you feel any better i puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride
ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip and when a bolt she drops it
the bolt spins floating away
she tries to grab it but misses barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push that makes it change direction
she turns and reaches out to grab it but she is strapped to the robotic arm
the bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when a hand grabs it before it has gone too far
it is matts
ryan looks at him embarrassed
in my basement lab things usually fall to the floor
matt puts the bolt away
he begins to unscrew another bolt
hey youre the genius up here
i just drive this bus
call me a genius if i can get this board initialized in the next hour
explorer this is houston
go ahead houston
norad reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike
the impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at miles per hour
current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory
well keep you posted on any developments
ryan glances at matt
should we be worried
let the boys down there worry for us
explorer engage arm and pivot to cargo bay
standby for arm maneuver
the robotic arm moves very slowly pulling ryan along while matt begins to unharness from the telescope to shift his position
so doc now that you work for nasa how do you like it
kinda like winning the lottery isnt it
she grins at the memory glances at him
confesses i was just happy that they didnt cut the funding to my research
how long was your training
so what is this scanning system
nothing rad its just a new set of eyes to scan the universe
assuming it works its just for hospital use
this one is a prototype
standby for marking
listen they dont bankroll prototypes even for your pretty blue eyes
she gives him a look
my eyes are brown
matt stares at her a faint smile on his face
right now your eyes are blood shut
she grins looks away he got her
shariff raises his arms again
is this great or what
shariff jumps and floats away from the shuttle screaming and flapping his arms
a long safety tether attached to his waist brings shariff to an abrupt stop snapping him back like a bungee cord
for ryans benefit and to think he went to harvard
ryan doesnt react to this too consumed as she is with the panel
matt looks out
a sad smile is on his face
you gotta admit one thing
you cant beat the view
the earth with its ever changing surface of blues and whites greens and browns is massive and serene below him
so what do you like about being up here
she hesitates trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as we gaze down at the silent planet below
i could get used to it
matt laughs softly
we arrive back on him as he turns back to look at earth
something flickers briefly in matts eyes something hmmmm
ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope studying it with a small mirror
houston from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead
am i a go to cut link to auxiliary
youre the expert doctor
its your call
ryan takes out the small mirror and matt stretches his arm offering assistance but she does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her toolbox leaving matt
with his arm outstretched
ryan starts looking for another tool but matt is one move ahead of her offering her a pair of tweezers
ryan hesitates and takes the tool
she starts working on the panel
houston i have a bad feeling about this mission
its the same feeling i had at mardi gras in
he waits letting the moment hang knowingly
then that is affirmative
surprisingly control hasnt heard the mardi gras story
well its day one and im bumping my way down bourbon street looking for the sister of a friend of mine
the streets are swimming with people im thinking theres no way im finding this girl
ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself proceeding to over ride
matt continues his story without missing a beat then all of a sudden i look up and there she is
i am about to yell out when i notice shes holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a margaritaville t shirt
then i realize the guys no guy
my sisters friend is holding hands with a mission control interrupts on the radio
iss this is houston
ryan inserts the plate into the hubble
explorer this is houston
go ahead houston
repeat mission abort
initiate emergency disconnect from hubble
all the astronauts stop what theyre doing and anxiously await further instructions except for ryan who keeps working
begin re entry procedure
start deorbit prep for pls at kennedy
iss initiate emergency evacuation
matt is immediately flung into action and rapidly unharnesses himself from the hubble
copy all houston and in work
matt immediate return to explorer
repeat immediate return to explorer
explorer prep airlock
airlock engaged ready to receive
ryan is working on the panel
debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris
norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude
copy all houston
put a bow on it dr
if i turn it off now well lose the whole system
she keeps on furiously tweaking
im not going to ask you again
not one second
shut it down
she looks up sees matt glaring
looks him in the eye
the robotic arm slowly withdraws carrying ryan back towards the shuttle
matt watches her go then kowalsky initiate emergency disconnect from the hubble
alright shariff lets do this
shariff turns and heads toward the base of the telescope holding onto the hangars handrails
matt propels himself to the base of the hubble using the propelling unit on his back
we have a full on chain reaction
its been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the russians striking one of their own satellites
shariff arrives to the base of the telescope
they shot down their own satellite
right of disposal
most likely a spy sat gone bad
now its space junk
matt grabs onto the base of the telescope explorer ready to disengage hst
locks releasing in three
the locks attaching the hubble to the explorer release
matt and shariff give the hubble a push away from the hangar
pushing the huge telescope is not a difficult task in zero gravity
explorer new data coming through
as it floats away matt gives the telescope a small spin
whats the blowback houston
its not good
most of our systems are going down
debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding
multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling
matt eyes the arm as it slowly retracts carrying ryan back
define multiple sats
most of them
telecomunications systems are gone
expect a communication blackout at any moment
kowalsky visual of debris at nine oclock
matts eyes shift watching a large object a piece of a bse satellite spiral toward them
half of north america just lost their facebook
the sat glides by at tremendous speed
youre a go for th
repeat youre a go for th procedure
copy that houston
explorer this is kowalsky
confirming visual contact with debris
debris is from a bse sat
to repeat heads up
to repeat i have another object part of a weather satellite hurls by them a little bit closer than the previous one
stone requesting faster faster transport
it is followed by a small piece of debris
it zooms by faster than the previous ones and hits the bse satellite
the satellite explodes into hundreds of pieces and a chain reaction takes place
we have to go
the debris from the bse satellite hits the weather satellite and it explodes sending debris in all directions
new data suggests immediate evacuation absolu
a high frequency of interference and the arm transporting ryan is moving very slowly
stone requesting faster transport to the bay area
explorer get me down
explorer permission to retrieve dr
you are a go kowalsky
matt thrusts himself over to ryan
houston this is explorer
but theres no answer
houston this is explorer
still no answer
we lost houston
matt stops next to ryan
you cant tune out the world up here
she reaches for the last clip and begins to undo it
try releasing the safety clip
shariff makes his way back toward the airlock as a piece of the debris hits the hubbles solar panels making a inch hole in its golden surface
a piece of debris passes nearly hitting them
need some help there matt
no dont wait for us
further back another piece of debris collides with a bigger one
the two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of shrapnel one of which hits shariffs helmet breaking through the glass and hitting his head like an expansive bullet
matt propels himself toward shariff who is floating away from the shuttle unconscious
a piece of debris pierces through the right wing of the space shuttle creating a five foot hole
the arm with ryan attached to it rolls with the shuttle
explorer has been hit
explorer do you read
explorer another impact
a piece of debris hits the robotic arm like a cannon ball and detaches it from the shuttle
the broken piece of the arm spins away from the explorer at a great speed with ryan attached to it
she passes next to the hubble as a big piece of debris hits the telescope
the top of the cylinder explodes into more debris which is expelled in all directions barely missing ryan as she spins away attached to the arm
ryans panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness of space
astronaut off structure
stone is off structure
with every spin the shuttle being punished by debris diminishes into a tiny dot in the distance
you must detach
if you dont detach that arm is going to carry you too far
a brief beat then listen to my voice
you need to focus
im losing visual of you
in a few seconds i wont be able to track you
she pulls herself together ok
you need to detach
i cant see you anymore
the robotic arm keeps on spinning and stars orbit wildly in her field of vision
i cant its stuck hold on
ryans hands are trembling and she cant get a grip on the hook
houston ive lost visual of dr
houston ive lost visual of dr
as matts voice is lost to static ryan squeezes the hook and is
gone kicking herself away from the robotic arm and flying free of the rotating arm
she catches a brief glimpse of the arm as it helicopters away then loses sight of it as she rotates end over end in endless free fall
a primal scream of god forsaken fear erupts from her lungs
the radio crackles and matts voice returns
do you copy
do you copy
ryan slowly spins drifting into the empty darkness of space
give me your position
i dont know
i dont know
report your position
tumbling end over end ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist
the effort makes her nauseous
she looks away
i cant its down i cant
give me a visual
matts faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of static
ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate
her eyes rake the dark sameness of her surroundings
i told you
i see nothing
do you have a visual of explorer
do you have a visual of iss
as matts signal grows fainter her breathing becomes more labored
i need you to focus
give me a visual
ryans eyes flutter then roll up into her sockets
its too fast
ryan swallows harshly her throat suddenly dry
i cant breathe
she inhales and exhales with quick short breaths ryans eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing accelerates
her limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable void
and her throat closes
her mouth is open but she cannot exhale
not a breath
the lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out and her lips turn blue
her eyes open wide and she exhales
and begins breathing deeply
as her breathing steadies she begins to focus her eyes searching the distance
ryan can see her face reflected against the visor lit by the control panels
she dims the light and she can see her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts towards the empty void broken only by lonesome stars whose position
change as she rotates giving way to very still and very distant
night is creeping across the sphere as the sun sets a sliver of light on the western hemisphere
a metallic object floating over the earth is hit by a ray of the sinking sun and it gleams like a tiny star
her eyes blink in recognition gleaming with alertness
her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm
houston this is dr
im drifting but i have a visual of explorer
her eyes scan the enveloping darkness trying to get a fix on the gleaming orb that is earth her face alive with concentration as she makes calculations
with north at oclock the shuttle is at the center of the dial
she frowns as she tumbles backward again recalculating
the sun is slipping behind the earth
she studies the rim of fire until it too slides from view
i can see the chinese station
no no no its the international space station
the suns glow illuminates another object in the distance a bright spec hovering over the horizon the international space iss is at no oclock
just then the suns rays recede and the station dims becoming one with the darkness
ryan blinks mildly alarmed
lieutenant kowalsky do you copy
explorer do you copy
slowly the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light bathing ryans face evaporates
as she is swallowed by the darkness she speaks once again houston do you copy
and so is ryan
her eyes dart
it is utterly silent
she spins in the darkness waiting
houston this is mission specialist ryan stone
im off structure and im drifting
there is only the silence complete and absolute
do you copy
she watches the earth slip from view yet again
when next she speaks the words are as delicate as snowflakes tripping off her tongue like a prayer
a soothing light hits ryans face
the moon is rising over the pacific ocean
its almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe brightening the deep blue waters and a light not bigger than a star is flickering
ryans eyes focus on the light
her pupils dilate
something like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light afraid to blink as she watches the
star draw closer smiling as the faintest thread of a radio transmission stitches its way through the silence listening as static sings through her helmet stinging her ears with the
do you copy
almost to herself lieutenant kowalsky
the flickering star begins to thicken
do you copy
as she watches the figure of an astronaut takes shape
flash your light
so i can see you
ryan opens a pouch in her suit fishes out a flashlight
hands trembling she shines it toward the approaching dot
there you are
report your status
give me your readings
psi i think
give me your o
steady at eight percent
youre breathing too fast
youre burning oxygen
we dont want to do that
we want to relax
ryan can see matt quickly growing in size
she continues to you can holster that torch dr
she slips the light back into her side pouch just as matt appears as if from nowhere and grabs her
ryan holds on to matt
instantly they begin to spin together
matt takes out a tether
now im going to tether you to me
ryan is paralyzed holding onto matt tightly and looking at him in fright
he stares back
you never realized how devastatingly good looking i am
but i need you to stop staring and help me with the tether
okay ohh i got it
he runs the other end of the tether to the harness on ryans suit and attaches it
so far so good
im going to give you a little push just so youre clear of the jets sorry
not a push more like a nudge
matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle nudge
drifting again she begins to freak
the tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from matt
matt ignites the thrusters tugging ryan behind him
but this proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him changing his direction
where you go i go
matt ignites a new thrust to re direct his position
as he does so ryans change of momentum makes him swing again
lets get out of here
using his thrusters matt negotiates a new position and igniting a long thrust he jets away
ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up and she screams ahh dammit
i know what you mean
youre burning oxygen were going to go back to the shuttle
hows that for a plan
right copy that
as matt accelerates toward a lower orbit his momentum takes over steadying ryans swing
houston in the blind this is kowalsky
dr stone and i are making our way to base please prepare airlock for arrival
they descend gliding through pieces of debris
among the space junk a solar panel from the hubble is distinguished
matt eyes a small dot in the distance the shuttle
houston this is kowalsky
how do you copy
why arent they answering
it seems like communications are lost
can they hear us on an alternate frequency
we dont know
thats why we keep talking
if someone is listening they might just save your life
set your watch for ninety minutes
matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for minutes
houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour
factoring in our current orbit i reckon weve got minutes before we play duck and cover again
ryan sets her watch studies the counter as it begins to count down
down to six percent
as they travel the shuttle begins to take form
pretty scary shit being untethered up here isnt it
pretty scary shit
after a beat you did all right
to the shuttle houston in the blind
this is kowalsky
our current location is approximately meters out from the explorer
stone and i would like to retrieve the body of mission specialist shariff and return it to shuttle
am i a go to retrieve
matt changes direction and approaches shariff
he has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction fighting against ryans momentum
where is he
where is he
shariffs body is tethered to a panel that was ripped away from the explorer
matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course and he grabs onto it
ryan continuing her momentum crashes against shariffs body
the contact slows her trajectory but it throws shariff away his tether tensing pulling the panel with him
oh my god
oh my god
matt holding on to the metal spins with it
he detaches shariffs tether from the panel and attaches it to himself
he lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster pulling the two tethers behind him which as they tense bring ryan and shariff closer together
youre pulling me away
i got him
i got him
matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the shuttle but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all
clutch him like hes your valentine
i cant gauge my thrust with you two yo yoing around
tentatively ryan extends her right hand to grab onto shariffs body harness
and she sees shariffs broken helmet
a hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess
ryans face is inscrutable
finally she looks away but this time something arrests her gaze a laminated photograph floats next to shariff tethered to his suit via a small chain
in it a young boy laughs with abandon happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his two strong arms
transfixed ryan is unable to look away something complicated confusing her eyes
the photograph floats in the empty space above planet earth
as they approach the damage to the shuttle becomes apparent
explorer has been badly hit
under his breath jesus
the shuttle has suffered devastating damage
the tail is beyond repair one wing is completely destroyed while the other waffles weakly nearly sheared from the fuselage
heres hoping youve got one monster insurance policy houston
damages to explorer are
will commence search for survivors
down to five percent
matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the cockpit
at the mercy of matts momentum ryan hits hard against the nose of the shuttle losing her grip on shariff
as she caroms off she grabs onto what is left of the cockpits window
all right here we go
careful of the edges
matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows lighting the cockpit
ryan pulls herself up and looks the cabin has been destroyed
a disarray of objects smashed and devastated
at the end of the cabin among the floating objects a lifeless body drifts among the wreckage
ryan regards it silently mesmerized
the face of a second astronaut appears right in front of ryan and crashes against her visor
the eyes are frozen unblinking
ryan gasps wheeling backward and away
matt clicks shariffs harness onto the shuttle
houston in the blind
mission specialist dr
stone and myself mission commander matthew kowalsky are the sole survivors of matt turns to ryan who is staring at the dead astronauts inside
i apologize for not complying
i shouldve stopped working as soon as you instructed me to
we were going to be hit no matter what
there was nothing you couldve done to change that
he begins to reach out hesitates briefly then lightly touches her shoulder
she turns no elbows this time
we have to get ourselves to the space station
matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance
its a bit of a hike but its our only
its our best option
she stares at the dot
as she turns agreed
she studies his face and then finally nods
he gently pushes her into space
she slowly drifts away from the explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether
matt ignites his propellers and giving a couple of small thrusts he combats ryans swing
and with a longer thrust he shoots forward pulling ryan behind him
the two astronauts push forward together leaving behind the shell of the shuttle and the remains of the hubble
houston in the blind this is kowalsky
stone and i have determined to proceed to iss and use one of their soyuz for re entry
iss if copy please send rescue mission
repeat please dispatch rescue mission
they are heading toward a small point in the distance the space station which is in a lower orbit
we see the two astronauts crossing the distance a thrust and they coast ahead and then another thrust
matt pulls ryan behind him
two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows on the darkened hemisphere
the sun looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of earths atmosphere
the oceans and the continents brighten as its light spills over the earth beneath them
warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel themselves across the empty expanse
down to two percent
were getting there
beautiful dont you think
thats what im going to miss the most
but ryan is not into the view right now
shes stricken with fear
her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed
matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles
so wheres home dr
ryan keeps her eyes closed doesnt answer
matt trying to ryan
ryan opens her eyes but still she doesnt dare to look out of the helmet
where do you pitch your tent
where the hell is that
central time zone
that makes it roughly
pm right now
what are the good people of lake zurich doing at oclock in the evening
ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out
she frowns terrified by the sight and hides her face once more inside the helmet
i dont know
what would you be doing
she tries again
this time she forces herself and stares out at the earth which is over kilometers below her
youve just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary hour shift
youre driving home
ryans wide open eyes are transfixed on earth like a deer in headlights
i listen to the radio
there we go
let me guess
top for anything
as long as they dont talk
i just drive
her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her taking over her body
it is not fear it is something deeper and more painful
matt studies her curiously
what do you miss down there
ryan looks at the earth
it never felt so far away
a long silence without an answer
is there a mr
she frowns unable to comprehend this initially as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math then shakes her head
someone down there looking up thinking of you
ryan closes her eyes
she remains silent
a silence that cant hide an unspeakable pain
i had a daughter
her eyes flutter then open
she is frozen in this moment as if stunned
her gaze shifts and finds matt studying her in his mirror
what was her name
she was four
stupidest thing a school trip to the swimming pool
she was playing tag she slipped hit her head and that was it
she loved tag
im sure she was laughing
she looks away toward earth
it looks small
when i received the call i was driving and ever since thats what i do
i wake up i go to work and then i just drive
matt finally averts his eyes
he rolls his wrist over consults the timer watching the numbers slowly count down
down to one percent
well well what dyou know
i have good news and bad news
the good news is were five minutes from the iss and i know where the russians stash their vodka
and thats a good thing cus im running out of fumes
bad news is im gonna be ten minutes short of
breaking anatolys record
im red lining
my o tank pressure is low
the tank may be empty but theres still oxygen in your suit so sip ryan
its wine not beer
well get you there
matt gives ryan a gentle push waiting until the tether goes taut and he gives a small thrust to position himself in the right direction
he holds this single thrust for longer than all of the previous ones immediately gaining speed descending towards which is half a mile away and now all of its modules
are clearly visible
it also becomes clear that houston in the blind we have visual of the iss
station must have been evacuated because first soyuz is missing
second soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed
its use as escape pod for re entry to earth is impossible
the surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels have been ripped
the second soyuz becomes visible attached to the stations docking module
a piece of red and white fabric floats around the spherical capsule
ryans losing her breath
shouldnt we be turning
were sip ryan
drifting is good
we want to drift
i wasnt kidding about those fumes
this can has one or two good thrusts left
if were lucky
they approach the space station which is just ahead of them and a hundred meters below
shes sweating and starts to hyperventilate
she looks down eyes the station passing beneath them
it looks as though the station is going to slip away altogether
matt triggers his thruster turning sharply
ryans trajectory carries her in a straight line until the tether tenses breaking matts direction
he fires again to counter her momentum
a very long thrust sends both of them in the right direction straight down toward the station but at great speed
the station is getting very close and theyre going very fast
matt ignites the frontal thruster which begins to slow him down but the thrust stops
ryan following her own momentum begins to pass matt
you have to break
were coming in fast and were going to hit hard
grab onto anything you can and hold tight
just then ryan crashes against the solar panel but is unable to grab hold
as she tumbles past the body of the station looms
matt misses the solar panels and collides against the station
as he begins to drift past he reaches out and snares a railing
ryan passes flying above him
the tether tenses pulling matt
the momentum is to great and he lets go of the railing
ryan floats over the roof of the space station trying to grab hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules but shes floating too high
shes quickly reaching the end of the station there is only one handle left ahead her last chance before floating away into the black void
she extends her arm and grabs the handle tightly for dear life shes holding onto the handle
i got it
i got it
she looks up and sees matt is floating straight toward her and he collides against her
for a moment they are face to face only the glass of their headgear separates their faces
but she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her into the emptiness
her drifting is intercepted by a solar panel
she crashes against it shattering it as matt rolls above it
ryan bounces down towards the earth tensing the tether pulling matt making him descend over the other side of the panel
the sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two
the tether broke
im im detached
grab a hold
ryan is drifting away from the station
she sees the infinite black void ahead of her and it becomes tangled in the strings and fabric slowing her down
ryan is panting her face covered in sweat
she turns back and matt rolling drifting in her direction
she stretches out her arm
matts arm is also outstretched
give me five here ryan
hes trying to make light of it but hes really struggling to reach her
ryan stretches farther
matts hand comes closer to hers
the tips of their fingers are almost touching
ive got you
ive got you the very tips of their fingers touch as matt drifts past
no as the parachute tenses she stops
the tether attached to matts suit passes two feet away from her ryan grabs the tether
it slides through her closed fist until her grip tightens and the tether stops
matts momentum is now pulling ryan dragging her loose from the parachute
you have to let me go
no you have to
those ropes are too loose im pulling you with me
you have to let me go or we both die im not letting you go
her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further out being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her foot
we move from high angle to low angle two shot
as this ryan
youre not going anywhere youre not its not up to you
matt begins to unharness the tether
please dont do this
matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand
please dont do this
please dont do this
youre going to make it ryan
he opens his hand letting go of the tether and begins to float relieved of matts pull the parachute begins to retrieve pulling ryan closer to the station
i had you
i had you
matt drifts away from the station into the empty space
ryan bumps against the station pulled by the parachute and she twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail
ryan do you copy
do you copy
an alarm goes off
my co alarm went off
my co alarm went off
you need to board the station
can you see the airlock
she turns looking for the stations airlock
do you copy
v shot beginning to blur yes
i see it
i see it
thats where you want to go
youre losing focus right
thats because youre breathing co and youre losing consciousness
you need to board the station
her eyes flutter
ryan blinks turns off the alarm and begins climbing over a module of the station
the transmission becomes weaker filled with static
now listen to me
that second soyuz is too damaged for re entry but its perfectly fine for a little sunday drive
look to the west
you see that dot in the distance
that is the chinese station
youre going to take the soyuz and cruise over there
the chinese lifeboat is a shenzou
ive never flown a shenzhou that doesnt matter
its re entry protocol is identical to the soyuzs she nods already looking
youve never flown a soyuz either
only on a simulator
so then you know
i crashed it
i its a simulator
thats what its designed for
i crashed the simulator every time
its not rocket science
just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow youll be back in lake zurich with one hell of a story to tell
im going to take the soyuz and come get you
no youre not
i have too much of a head start
that ship already sailed
im coming to get you
ryan youre going to have to learn to let go
i want to hear you say youre going to make it
ryan is struggling for breath
im going to make it
keep going ryan stares at matts tiny figure in the distance
what kind of name is ryan for a girl
dad wanted a boy
are you close to the airlock
ryan continues to the airlock
so now that we have some distance between us youre attracted to me arent you
well people say i have beautiful blue eyes
you have beautiful
you have beautiful blue eyes
i have brown eyes
she looks at matts figure receding
you wanna know the good news
im going to break anatolys record and i think mines going to stand for a long long time
im coming to get you
you know ryan is a nice name for a girl
wow you should see the sun on the ganges
ryan starts to respond then falters watching matts figure grow ever smaller
the sad crooning of hank williams crackles through the dying radio
in a daze matt
only static hisses
static again as matt falls deeper into the distance becoming lost in a sea of white specks and the transmission ends
ryan is dizzy sweating and having trouble focusing
she sees nothing more than a dot
she stretches her hand toward him as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers
but the dot has already vanished into never ending darkness
ryan is about to lose consciousness when a new alarm goes off
she takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely
if she doesnt move shell die
ryan pulls herself forward reaching for a handle on the soyuz
she grabs it and reaches for another climbing her way toward the stations airlock
but shes losing focus
as her right hand is reaching for a handle everything becomes a blur and she misses
her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen
she struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible
she reaches up again almost blindly
her hand grips the handle and with one huge effort she sprints across the docking module swinging from handle to handle in one continual push until she reaches the she
stops takes one deep breath and she turns the latch and opens the re entry hatch
the hatch blows open as the air inside the cabin escapes into the vacuum almost throwing ryan back into space but she holds tightly onto the latch
she hangs outside trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system
she sees her feet dangling against the emptiness of space and with one last effort she pulls herself into the airlock
as she enters she does a degree flip
as soon as her legs are in she grabs onto the latch and she turns the latch and ryan is suffocating
with very little oxygen and her body intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood her breathing is coarse and painful
she can hardly keep her eyes open and she pushes herself through the cabin an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury lights
she reaches the control panel a small computer with a screen that monitors the atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock
she presses a button on the panel and a low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the station begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock
the control panels monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising
ryan gasps for air but there is none
she stares at the red orange green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels
it reads red
her pupils begin to dilate as in the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills
the sounds are muffled like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb
a beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock anxious and halting
the control systems graph slowly moves from red to orange
the cabin is still not fully pressurized
but that will have to do
with one sharp motion and pushes it from her head
she gasps for air and coughs
she contorts and shakes fighting to breath in the thin atmosphere of the airlock
her helmet bounces around the walls of the cabin floating
the beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable it is an alarm ringing out across the station
orange is turning to green
her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even
her body floats relaxed in the confined space of the airlock
ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove
and then the other
desperately she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist
she squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half
then she throws off the lower half squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit
wearing only underwear and a t shirt she floats in mid air relieved and exhausted
the hum of the space station surrounds her
then slowly she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms floating in a fetal position
for a moment ryan simply hangs in suspension a fly in amber surrendering to the poetry of the planets rotating slowly in the cabins womb
the international space station with its modules its torn solar panels and the soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center is dwarfed against earths orb and the infinite
universe stretching out beyond
the station looks frail and secluded lost somewhere between the grandness of the heavens and the earth below
everything is still
the module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets a small eating area and a small gym
a hum reverberates across the station
at the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading a spherical space with three hatches each leading into different modules
a hatch opens and ryan floats in
she stops at the center and holds onto a handle
she looks in all directions and launches to her right towards there are sleeping bags fastened to the walls
clothes shoes a strip of three condoms all kinds of personal objects float in chaos around the module
its clear that someone left in a hurry
ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet on the wall
she opens drawers looking for something
come on come on
she finds what shes looking for a bag of water with a straw at one end
she unscrews the top and begins to drink from it
she drinks in long gulps squeezing the bottle trying to quench her thirst
drops float out of her mouth as the water overflows
they float around her face like perfect pearls of different sizes
she takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath
the water is cooling her down but she still takes another long thirsty gulp and empties the bag
she checks the count on the stopwatch minutes and counting down
she takes a new bag of water from the drawer and pushing herself off of a wall she dives into the ok
where are you
where are you
there you are
without stopping she goes through one of the open hatches into the walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires
without slowing down her momentum she floats to the main console a large deck which houses all of the communication and navigational systems
on the opposite wall there is a large porthole through which earth is clearly seen
she begins to push buttons
computers come to life and ryan puts on a communications headset
this is ryan
this is ryan
matt i made it
im inside the station
do you copy
she drifts along the module listening intently through the headset
come on matt
talk to me
tell me where you are
give me your position
where are you
give me a visual
tell me what you see
oh come on
youve been yammering nonstop since we left cape canaveral and now you decide to shut up
she waits one second two seconds come on matt talk to me
the signal cuts in and out but remains indecipherable
there is something unnerving about it
she drops her head and continues drifting toward the porthole listening as the static sputters
tell me about mardi gras
tell me about the hairy guy
waiting for him to respond and in a softer voice completely oh matt
im not ready for this
she bumps against the porthole and glances out the earth glimmers brightly
a third of the hemisphere is in complete darkness
her face reflected in the glass is superimposed over the earth
her eyes glisten briefly but she fights it back
then she pulls herself together and begins reporting houston in the blind
the way matt would have done it this is mission specialist ryan stone reporting from the iss
all communication with mission commander matthew kowalsky has been lost
radio transmission is absent
visual is nonexistent
to confirm i ryan stone am the sole survivor of sts
ryan hovers by the porthole looking hopeless
all is silent save for the radio static and the hum of the space station
outside the aurora borealis performs its ghostly dance over the earths northern hemisphere
only the hum and the static when an alarm chirps red lights flickering across the module
ryan twists swimming back to the control panel studying a flashing grid of leds where a blinking light indicates the japanese module is on what now
the destiny lab begins blinking
she pushes herself toward the hatch swimming through the few pieces of paper still hovering as she exits into the the alarms staccato is blasting in synchrony with the emergency
lights blinking across the station
smooth blue flames ribbon eerily across the skin of the destiny lab
they are spreading expanding with a dense cloud of smoke
ryan enters and snatches a fire extinguisher on the wall of the module and she points the nozzle at the fire and sprays
with no gravity to hold her down the force of the spray sends her flying back and she crashes against a wall
the fire extinguisher bangs against her face and cuts her lip
the impact is so strong that it almost knocks her out
her eyes fill with tears but she reacts
theres no time to lose
she fastens her feet to a strap on the floor and sprays the extinguisher at the fire
but the extinguisher is no match for the fire which has gathered in a gigantic smooth blue ball and is expanding coming at her
ryan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite direction into the dashing straight into the she darts across the module behind her the expanding fire ball has
swallowed the unity node and is making its way towards her chasing her into the where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the just in time
above her the flames cross the node as they spread into the rest of the station
they quickly spread downward into the docking module
ryan the flames caressing her feet dives through a hatch into ryan crashes against a space suit floating inside and turns to close the hatch
the fire is spreading outside in the module sucking the oxygen out of the soyuz
an incandescent blue bubble that charges at her
ryan faster than fire closes the hatch
she closes a second hatch and the soyuz is safe
she exhales in relief
a rumble in the station makes the soyuz quake
the extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and ryan has to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the as soon as she makes it through
the hatch she turns the cabin there is just enough space for three astronauts to sit surrounded by the control panel that navigates the vessel
she sits down in the command chair
she fastens the safety belt and looks around trying to recognize the different buttons on the panel which are all labeled in russian
where was it
where was it
she moves her finger across the different buttons searching
where is the power
here you are
her finger stops on a button which is labeled bkn she presses on it and the control panel turns on
all the buttons light up and with a hum the soyuzs systems start to run
just like training
ryan reaches to the right where next to the panel there are several binders each a different color
and she takes out a red binder
its all written in cyrillic
she turns the pages until she sees a graphic representing the undocking procedure
i remember this
she uses the cursors on the panel and selects a function on the she presses another button and on the screen a countdown
another rumble in the station
we dont have four minutes to spare
were going manual
she flips through the binder to another page
she looks at a diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function on the screen okay
arming the system
she releases the safety lock on a button
an explosion in the station makes everything shake
the vibration passes through her body startling her and firing the pyros
she presses the button
the sound of a mechanism releasing reverberates throughout the vessel
a spring mechanism pushes the soyuz away from the station
the spacecraft is made out of three modules the engine the control cabin and the airlock at the front
detached from the space station the rumbling has ceased leaving only the gentle hum of the cabin
the distance between the soyuz and the docking module grows little by little as the vessel drifts away from it
ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and she presses different buttons bringing to life a new set of systems
i engaged manual control r o a k and ryd are activated
she grabs the joysticks with her hand and the lateral thrusters give a small thrust and as the spacecraft moves away from the station it drags its parachute which floats
lifelessly in space
another bigger thrust and as the soyuz pulls away from the station the parachutes ropes tense and her seat belts prevent her from being projected forward as the soyuz is
pulled to a sudden stop
ryan is very confused unaware of the reason for the sudden stop
she looks at the station is drifting out of the scopes sight
she turns to and through the glass she sees that the station is coming straight at her and it looks as though oh no
no no no
she presses the joystick
the soyuz is two meters away from the station about to crash the soft jets ignite launching the vessel upwards
the soyuz skims just over the docking module and passes three inches away from the solar panels barely avoiding a collision with the metal giant
and as the soyuz drifts upwards the station passes under it
now ryan can see through the parachute is tangled with a solar panel and the ropes are tensing up and the soyuz stabilizes over the station the parachute entwined with
the solar panel
she looks out at the rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with the station
the station hovers below the soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat
the hatch of the soyuz opens
ryan comes out of the craft into space
shes wearing the space suit she packed and she carries a large bag
she holds onto handles as she floats safely tethered to the inside of the cabin
she looks around the international space station is a looming presence floating ten meters below
it is pulling the soyuz by its parachute
an alarm on her stopwatch rings
its been minutes
she turns the alarm off and looks around
clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris
she hums a song the tune is reminiscent of the hank williams melody that matt had played earlier
she begins to climb around the vessel
with plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit this is not a difficult task
she pulls herself from handle to handle making her way around the soyuz and reaching an impact has blown open the cover
three ropes float out of the container into space
three meters away from the vessel each rope branches into dozens of parachute strings
next to it a second cover is also badly damaged
harnessing herself to a handle she inspects the ropes
the three ropes are bolted to the containers frame
we detach this and we go home
piece of cake
she harnesses the bag and resumes her humming louder this time
she unzips the bag and takes out the pistol grip tool without noticing that behind her dozens of pieces of debris pass zooming less than thirty meters away from the
a tiny piece of high speed debris crashes against one of the stations solar panels shattering it and causing the station to tremble
she places the tool against the first bolt stretching her arm into the parachute container
it is an awkward position
she pulls the trigger and the drill rotates turning the bolt but it slides out of the notch
she places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the trigger
the drill rotates slower this time
she hums under her breath and sweat begins to drop down her forehead
she is very focused unaware that behind her debris hits the stations solar panel piercing holes through it
as it floats off into space ryan drops the pistol grip and uses both hands to detach the rope from the frame
the rope floats away from the soyuz undulating like a long snake but ryan notices that the pistol grip is also floating away
she stretches her arm trying to catch it but it is out of her reach
she pushes herself towards the pistol grip and barely manages to grab onto it when she sees oh shit
the tide of debris is floating straight at her
she pulls herself back to the container
it crashes in silence against one of its modules creating a hole the size of a car wheel
the vacuum sucks blue flames from the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume
ryan brings the pistol grip to the second bolt and pulls the trigger
the bolt spins
ryan is humming louder and louder
ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the debris zooms by behind her
she quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it float away
shaken by the impacts the space station drags the soyuz with it
she braces herself as debris wreaks havoc some pieces hit the station others crash against one another
each collision creates more debris that ricochet and fly away in all directions
the soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope as the station spins out of control
ryan starts humming even louder the bravado is full tilt now
her face is now covered in sweat which pours into her eyes making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt
behind her a cluster of debris pierces the parachute
ryan continues drilling as it crashes against the japanese lab which silently explodes into millions of pieces
the pieces expand away from the station
ryan manages to unhook the rope freeing the soyuz from the collapsing space station
she braces herself against the vessel as she sees shit
the soyuz is heading straight towards the stations solar panels
the soyuz solar panel collides with the stations shattering into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit ryan
the soyuz spins away as ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the slowly revolving station segments
as the segments crumble colliding with additional debris the fragments glimmer magnificently then join
the thinning tide of debris orbiting toward the dark side of the earth
all of a sudden
she pauses blinking into the suddenly empty distance
her gaze remains fixed on the vast nothingness for no good reason but nevertheless fixed on something
i hate space
a symphony of alarms shrieks loudly
the hatch flies open and a helmet floats in followed quickly by ryan
she presses different buttons and with each a voice of the alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent
she takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt
she puts on the communication headset and resets the stopwatch minutes and counting down
she checks the temperature gauge she exhales the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in the frigid cabin air before evaporating
okay lets stabilise you
she takes the joystick
ryan looks focused at where the western horizon comes into frame and nears the center crosshair
a small dot glimmers in the distance the chinese station
lets visit the chinese station
houston in the blind tiangong is approximately km
to the west and i am off its course by about degrees
i will correct trajectory
she moves the joystick and the crosshair readjusts
she releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button
ill engage main thrust in five
three she releases the safety lock
she pushes on the button
the soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on the horizon the chinese station but nothing not even a small flame comes out of its back thrusters
ryan waits expectantly and gives the button a new push but one
the thruster wont ignite
the vessel remains motionless orbiting over the pacific which is already under nights dark veil
she pushes again and again and again come on
the soyuz stays in place
ryan looks at the fuel gauge percent
she taps on it and the frozen needle drops to empty
you gotta be kidding me
she taps on the frozen dial once more as if trying to get the needle to go back up and once again wheres your backup
she taps even harder this time
wheres your goddamn backup
she bangs down on the control panel in frustration inside the capsule through the portal ryan hits and hits bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all
her anger until she herself is out of fuel
she grabs the radio and this is dr ryan stone can you hear me
houston this is ryan stone can you hear me
houston this is ryan stone can you hear me
a magical cosmic act
as the sun nears the edge of the earth the atmosphere brightens shining with a luminous orange light that is reflected off the surface of the pacific ocean
at the soyuzs orbiting speed this does not last long
the sun quickly dips behind the edge of the earth and the whole face of the planet is in shadow
the vessel is almost lost in the deep black of night
fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole like a lonely firefly lost in the deep of night
and the night has brought with it its cold grip
ryan shivers and her voice is now weak but she continues searching for help houston this is ryan stone can you hear me
houston this is ryan stone can you hear me
she turns her neck stiffly looks at the temperature dial degrees and dropping
through the porthole the sun drops
finally a sound surfaces through the static the crackling sound is coming from the communication headset
ryan puts it on and brings the mouthpiece to her lips
this is mission specialist ryan stone
do you copy
this glimmer of hope gives her a new burst of energy
she turns on the cabin light and attempts to tune into the frequency turning one of the control panels dials
into the mouthpiece houston youre coming in over the am frequency
please confirm identity
fragmented words emerge through the static
she turns the dial slowly clinging desperately to the wavering thread of communication
this is mission specialist ryan stone from sts
do you copy
words burst forth ringing clear as a bell for a moment
hannik ya itc
the transmission is not in english
is this the chinese station
is this tiangong
as she tunes in a faint voice is distinguished
it doesnt appear to be in chinese either
do you speak english
hannic ya itcitem pini
do you understand
can you copy
the voice on the transmission appears to be a man in a very jovial mood
he keeps laughing
the hoarse laughing of an man rises through the static
then realizing is that your name
aningang is your name
she starts to speak again but the glimmer of hope fades from her face with the realization that this man does not understand her plea
no maydays not my name
im stone dr
ryan stone i need help
ieukpalliktuq uumaruq taigaa naabuqtuq
a noise in the background makes ryan smile
are those dogs
those are dogs
are you calling from earth
the barking of several dogs can be heard behind the mans voice
she listens to the mans laughing voice shakes her head helplessly and sighs
where are you aningang
is the sun out
are there birds
are there trees
can you smell the ocean
is it beautiful where you are
here its colder than hell and lonelier than shit but its beautiful aningang
utterly terrifyingly beautiful
through the porthole even under the darkness of night it is possible to see the glaciers spreading over the green forests
it all looks so fresh and full of life
make your dogs bark again aningang
suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq
she makes barking noises
the man begins to laugh and barks back at her
ryan and aningang bark in unison
ryan begins to howl giving in to the mad joy of it all
moments later through the radio she is joined by a chorus of canines aningangs dogs tuning into her voice in a mad crazy harmonic cacophony
ryan smiles blissfully happy howling with abandon
each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic unlocking emotions that have been festering over time and tears roll from her eyes clear as crystals spilling from her lashes and
floating into the air glimmering like sapphires in the cool moonlight
they float away like tiny satellites orbiting her face
aningang can be heard intermittently yelling as if trying to silence the dogs
then the dogs one by one cease their wailing and ryan is left with nothing but her own voice
she stops gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue light
im going to die aningang
the signal ebbs losing its battle with the static
i mean were all going to die
everyone knows that
but im going to die today
the static waffles in and out
the static breaks and aningangs husky voice begins singing
and you know what aningang
i dont care
i dont care if i die
i dont have anything
ryan is floating now over her seat
but the thing is
im still scared
im really scared
she rolls in space and stares upwards
no one will mourn me
no one will pray for my soul
will you mourn me aningang
is it too late to say a prayer
id say one for myself but i have never prayed in my life
no one ever taught me how
the tune is lyrical and soothing tinged with a touch of melancholy
no one ever taught me how
ryan listens to aningangs melody and smiles softly closing her eyes
ryans face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness buoyed along on aningangs sad soulful song
a sputtering cry cuts through the static
ryans eyes pop open
theres a baby with you
aningang stops singing speaking in a soft voice ieukpalliktuq upatimi
you are singing to your baby
is that a lullaby
thats so sweet
ryan is transfixed listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby as aningang coos to it then begins to sing again
i used to sing to my baby too
painful memories flash before her haunting her
ryans lump in her throat is washed away by a gentle sob
i hope i see her soon
she reaches for a valve and opens it
a hizzing sound is heard inside the vessel and the oxygen in the cabins atmosphere begins to drop
ryan closes her eyes simply listening to the lullaby as it grows fainter
growing ever drowsier thats nice
keep singing aningang just like that
sing me to sleep
ill sleep and sleep and sleep
sing to me aningang
the transmission grows fainter
and then is
for a long beat ryan merely sits there
she is gently humming a tune
it is a lullaby
a quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and that finally explodes into tears float around her like tiny satellites
the cold and the gentle humming of the soyuz cradles ryan
she closes her eyes and as her breathing relaxes she begins to fall asleep until ryan opens her eyes startled
ryan turns in confusion and looks at through the glass the helmet of an astronaut is looking in
he knocks once more this time louder
ryan is still drowsy and does not understand what is going on when she sees that the latch on the porthole begins to move
but the latch continues to open
ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair
the latch keeps turning
ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when the latch releases and the vacuum of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air inside the cabin and
with it every sound
the straps hold ryan back as objects gush out through the hatch
her hands press tightly covering her face
on the control panel alarms begin to flash
a shadowy figure makes its way in and with one sharp motion turns and closes the hatch
presses a green button and the cabin begins to pressurize
and sound re emerges with the beeping of the alarms as the red orange green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green
ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure who straps into the seat next to her
he unlocks the ring around his collar and country western music escapes into the cabin
alright check your watch
call anatoly tell him hes been bumped
the figure glances around
bit gloomy in here
how bout a little light
he taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms matt
ryan stares mouth agape
how did you
trust me its a hell of a story
but how did you
he reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches
instantly the alarms go silent
ryan looks at him wide eyed wanting to know how i found a little extra battery power
im just happy youre still alive
to be honest i thought your chances were slim to none
by the way did you find the vodka
you never told me where
matt fishes a small flask from under his seat spins off the cap
and takes a big gulp
he offers the flask to ryan who appears to be dozing off
she blinks shakes her head
he studies her
right lets get out of here
he looks at the monitors where the chinese station is seen
were bout a hundred miles to the chinese station
a little sunday drive
course we can
theres no fuel
i tried everything
well theres always something we can do
i tried everything
did you try the soft landing jets
theyre for landing so
well landing is launching its the same thing didnt you learn about that in training
i never got to land the simulator i told you
but you know about it
and i crashed it every time
ryan is falling asleep
matt studies her as she dozes off
listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here
i get it its nice up here you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights and just close your eyes and tune out everybody
matt starts flipping through buttons on the console turning the cabin lights off
theres nobody up here who can hurt you its safe
then whats the point in going on whats the point of living
when the cabin is in darkness he turns and looks at ryan
your kid died doesnt get any rougher than that but still its a matter of what you do now
if you decide to go that youve gotta just get on with it sit back enjoy the ride
you have to start living life ryan
ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open
how did you get here
ryan you have to learn to let go
ryan is almost sound asleep
ryan is asleep
its time to go home
her eyes snap open
her gaze shifts
the flask is floating in front of her
but no matt
the cabin is empty
she turns back
ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking making a percussive sound
a soft cool light shines in through the condensation that has frozen on the glass
it is the moonlight caressing ryans face
landing is launching
with a new surge of determination she turns on the cabin light
she pulls the helmet floating above her and puts it on
she connects the umbilical to her suit opens the oxygen valve and begins to breath
as the oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face
she opens the valves of the other two umbilicals allowing oxygen to flow pressurizing the cabin
she grabs the manual
okay landing landing landing is green
she opens the green binder and browses through its index
okay okay landing alright
she stops turns some pages and stares closely at the manual
ryan notices the energy bar floating by her
she grabs it and as she opens the wrapper she stares intently at one page of the manual where there is an illustration of the soyuz capsule two meters before
landing and hitting the ground
a thrust is shooting out from under its bottom cushioning its fall the soft landing engines
soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing
youre a clever son of a bitch matt
so to land i need to get rid of the bo and engine module okay
she puts on the communication headset
listen to me matt
youre going to see a girl with brown hair
shes sarah her hair is probably a mess
thats okay she doesnt like to brush it
she looks out of the porthole down at earth
tell her mommy found her red shoe
she was so upset about that shoe matt but tell her it was right under the bed
she turns back to the console and places her finger over one of the buttons
you give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her
tell her shes my little angel and that she makes me so proud so so so proud and that i promise ill try and make her proud too
you tell her that im not quitting that im going to keep fighting
you tell her i love her matt
i love her so much
ryan smiles remembering
and then tri module separation go
she presses the button
the locks connecting the three modules of the soyuz release
control cabin airlock and the engines separate
a mechanism pushes the control cabin away from the airlock and the engines and it slowly gains distance from them
ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the manual
okay houston here comes the tricky part the soyuz has to think were only three meters above the earth
a pause and then lets reset you then
using the manual as a reference ryan uses the cursors to select the altitude display on the computer screen
the current altitude is m
she uses the cursors and presses a button
a warning on the computer screen comes on
she presses another button and on the screen the altitude goes blank
ryan punches a new set of commands
the altitude now reads meters
i only have one shot at this
she extends her finger
whats the point if we dont try
a three second thrust ignites at the back of the cabin pushing it at great speeds toward the chinese station
the strength of the thrust pushes ryan back in her seat
she looks at the soyuz is approaching the tiangong
the center of the crosshair is aiming three degrees above the chinese station
the soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the chinese station
ryan is looking out of the window at earth wow
you were right matt
she then turns to the chinese station quickly grows in size as the soyuz gets closer and closer
altitude dial km and dropping
youre losing altitude tiangong
you keep dropping and youre going to kiss the atmosphere
but not before i get to you
you have my last ride home
a new sense of urgency comes up on ryans face
she unhooks the umbilical from her suit
she unstraps herself
she floats over and looks out of the chinese station is approaching getting closer
she disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the latch
she pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm
with the other arm she reaches for the latch
the station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it
okay im done with just driving
lets get go home
she turns the latch and pyrotechnics shoot the porthole into space
the brutal force of the infinite vacuum of space sucks the air out of the cabin and ryan is launched out of the cabin at a tremendous speed
she hits her shoulder as she goes through the hatch into a cannonball woman is launched up from the soyuzs hatch
she passes the chinese station as she twirls up toward the heavens
the soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward earth
ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain
earth and heavens
an alarm in her stopwatch rings
its been eighty five minutes
and she spins and sees the tiangong one mile below her
and below it a bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the earth
it the soyuz burning upon contact with the atmosphere
ryan drifts away
she holds tightly to the fire extinguisher with one hand and with the other she checks her right shoulder
but theres no time the tiangong is getting farther away
she points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and it acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the station
it helped but she is still off target
she is in pain
the glass visor is steaming up
she begins humming as she looks at the station drifting ahead less than five hundred meters away
from this distance the damage caused to the tiangong by the debris is clear
the solar panels are shredded to pieces and several modules appear to have been badly hit
propelling herself even closer to the station
she stops humming
her breath is fogging up the glass giving her a blurred view of the station which is less than a hundred meters away
she can the lifeboat the shenzhou a vessel very similar to the soyuz is docked on a module
its now clear that shes not flying straight toward the station
ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving but only a very small thrust comes out of the extinguisher not enough to push her on the right track
she pulls the trigger again but only a few dust particles come out
the extinguisher is empty
she lets go of it and it floats away
she drifts toward the station slowly
she is less than twenty meters away and getting closer
and she misses it by a hair
she drifts very slowly two meters above the station
her arm outstretched tries to grab hold of anything it can
ryan winces in pain and looks at her outstretched arm reaching toward she slowly drifts across the modules the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the tiangong
a handle passes under her almost within reach but she does not manage to hold onto it
shes struggling but she knows shes not going to make it
she looks ahead at a solar panel following the rotation of the station comes into view
she stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it
but the solar panel continues its rotation and she is approaching very slowly
the panel is rotating away
she stretches and she grabs onto a rod on the solar panel stopping her momentum
ryan hangs from the station
she holds her right arm tightly to her chest
she catches her breath and is clearly in pain
it hovers above the station and glows as the sunlight hits its surface
it passes very quickly
and theres another one cruising farther above
she pulls her right arm up
the pain is excruciating but she grabs onto the panels rod she pulls herself up and clinging with her leg she secures herself to the panel
shes panting and through the fogged up glass she can see far away over the horizon pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere
a swarm of incandescent locusts that is coming directly at her
ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible she climbs up to she goes over the module and makes her way across pulling herself from handle
when she reaches the end of it with one last big pull she makes it to the hatch that leads into the airlock
with her bad arm she holds onto a handle
with the other she pulls on the latch and a gust of air bursts out pushing the hatch wide open
ryan holds on tightly to the handle
clusters of debris pass by flying at different distances and at great speeds
pieces collide with each other exploding into more debris
a big piece of debris is flying downward missing the station by ten meters as it continues its descent
and meters below it burns like a shooting star
the station is rapidly approaching earths atmosphere
and over the eastern horizon a cloud of dust is quickly approaching
ryan secures the hatch
the airlock is smaller than the one in the international space station but like the iss there is a small control panel on one side
the glass is almost fogged up
she makes her way to the the red yellow and green graph is bright red
under it two buttons with chinese ideograms on them
her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess
a faint hissing sound is heard
as oxygen fills the space unrecognizable at first is a rhythmic pattern under a syncopated murmur
but as air allows sound to conduct its waves it becomes clear
over it a recording plays in a loop
it is in mandarin
the voice in the recording is urgent
clearly it is not good news
shes in pain and more tired than ever now and shes punchy
she waits floating
the glass is completely fogged up
through the condensation she can only discern a red light filtering through
and when the red glow turns to orange ryan unlocks her helmet and using only her left hand struggles to take it off
as the helmet floats bouncing off of the cabin walls ryan massages her injured shoulder
she does this gently as even the smallest pressure inflicts pain
the orange light is turning green when she feels the station quake fiercely reverberating through the handle shes holding onto
the tiangong is plummeting
the tip of a solar panel is already grazing over the outer layers of the atmosphere leaving a trail behind it as it parts the gases
debris passing under the station burn up
ryan rushes out of the airlock
a new intensity sparkles in her eyes
her fearlessness and determination are bordering with madness
she inspects her surroundings
through a hatch she sees a long corridor like cabin that leads to another node
it is the lab the loop keeps on playing
she enters the hatch into the the only light is coming from flickering emergency lights
objects float in chaos
ryan makes her way dodging the disarray of lab objects scientific instruments a plant drifting by with its roots exposed clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres two eggs hovering
one of which is broken
the shaking intensifies as she reaches the end of the module and goes into the she floats to the center of the node
there are three open hatches right left and a docking module very similar to the one in the iss
at the far end of it an open hatch leads into the shenzhou escape pod
a solar panel defeated by the friction with the atmosphere breaks off from the station and is thrown farther down where it quickly burns dissolving into sparks
the tidal wave of debris is catching up with the station a cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight
bright streaks can be seen as debris burns scratching through the atmosphere
ryan springs into the floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other end she tosses the helmet inside the shenzhou
a loud metallic roar
the station is collapsing
she dives through the hatch into the it is almost identical to the soyuzs airlock
she does a quick flip and closes the outer hatch
then she pulls on another latch and closes the inner hatch
the shenzhou is sealed off from the rest of the station
she throws the helmet into the control cabin and follows through into the she struggles to turn around in the confined space and then she pulls the hatch closed
the shenzhou is smaller than the soyuz and has only one seat
in this confined space the shaking of the station is felt even stronger
she sits buckles herself in and looks at the it has more monitors than the soyuzs panel and the main board is arranged differently
all of the buttons are labeled with seriously
a thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window
the yellow halo envelops the whole station as it glides over the outer atmosphere
the remaining solar panel resists breaking off from the structure but still goes up in flames leaving a trail of in the soyuz the power button is erm
she passes her finger over the board trying to make sense of the buttons
ah ok ah undocking undocking
an alarm rings and under the ongoing loop a recording clearly warning
that doesnt sound good
she glances around frantically turns it off
its shaking very intensely but shes wide eyed now clearly close to being beside herself
she tries a big button that says a new alarm followed by a new recording also a warning and with a horrible accent no hablo chino
she keeps searching for the right button
and she presses a new one
the lights on the control panel go on
the cabin makes a humming sound as systems begin to activate
on the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of the switchboard in the soyuz
she begins going through the progressions she used on the soyuz only quicker this time jabbing button after button
and this should be
she presses one more button and systems turn to green
houston in the blind
she raises her voice to be heard over the growing rumble
this is mission specialist ryan stone reporting from the shenzhou
im about to undock from the tiangong and i have a bad feeling about this mission
she presses a new button and the system goes to green
and on the monitor a countdown appears
reminds me of a story houston she reacts to a bad shake of the cabin
okay you know what houston
never mind the story
she looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder
its getting hotter in here
she watches the countdown on the monitor
the way i figure it theres only two ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown
raises her voice to compete with the rising chaos
i either make it down in one piece and ill have one hell of a story to tell
and now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak
or i burn up in the next ten minutes
ryan smiles flips the safety lid of a button open
whichever way it goes no harm no foul
as the cabin rattles violently
because either way she closes her eyes puts her finger over the button
itll be one hell of a ride
ryan presses the button
the station is bouncing over the atmosphere
one end of it is glowing more brightly and catches fire
the tide of debris is getting closer
not far off some pieces are already burning
a large piece of debris has caught on fire and is flying at great speed and tearing it into two parts which are sent twisting in opposite directions
the escape pod attached to the dock is spinning towards earth
ryan is shaken and rattled in her seat
gravity is still minimal but the force of the inertia is rough and it jerks her around
she sees a red lever above her but she can only reach it with her bad hand
the cabin separates from the rest of the vessel and from the station
it spins away plummeting toward the atmosphere
the two fragments of the tiangong follow spinning in a rage of sparks and fire
the spinning is punishing
ryan is shaken violently
she is also mumbling words to herself that we cant hear
it looks like she rambling
some lights go off
the capsules aerodynamics slow down the spinning positioning the vessel nose up
it cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds
its metal is burning hot
smoldering debris and the fragments of the station chase the shenzhou in its descent
a blinding light pours in from outside the window
the spinning is over but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble
as the g force restrains ryan against her seat she clenches her face and sweats
on the ceiling condensation begins to form
the shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies
its followed very closely by debris and the two fragments of the station
the two fragments collide and explode into a ball of fire that breaks into many pieces
an avalanche of fire cascades towards the shenzhou rapidly closing the distance
in the porthole outside burning debris is passing by
the gravitational pull keeps ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face
she the ceiling where condensation is dripping
the avalanche is about to swallow the cabin when the burning debris disintegrates before reaching the cooling stratosphere
the capsule escapes the inferno as the debris crumbles in a final explosion expelling a very small piece of debris that shoots towards the shenzhou and skims its surface tearing
one of the outer shields
the impact is felt inside and a panel falls off
a small smoke trail is formed around its wires
ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force of the fall and the shenzhou has left the burning debris behind
as it touches the lower atmosphere it immediately cools down dimming its brightness surrounded by a purple sky
meters per second and the long fabric comes out and expands as the air fills the red and white canopy
when its fully open it slows down the cabins descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the earth
a breath of relief as through the porthole she sees the ropes of the parachute extend out to the large canvas cushioning the fall
a second parachute expands
it slows the fall even further shifting the cabin into a more vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems tangible
ryan starts coughing
the cabin is quickly filling with smoke and the white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is getting thicker
the shenzhou drops hanging from the parachutes at a speed of thirty kilometers per hour
it is surrounded by a blue sky
it passes through a layer of clouds
she coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable
the shenzhou is rapidly approaching the ground
it is falling straight toward a lake
two meters before hitting the landing engines ignite giving the downward thrust meant to cushion the landing on a hard surface
the thrust parts the water creating a curtain of steam and the shenzhou gently falls down making a wave that spreads out in a circle
ryan feels the cabin hit the water
she has landed safely
but she cannot celebrate because she cant stop coughing
she is asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke
she unstraps herself and reaches a lever at the side of the hatch
she pulls the lever
with a small controlled explosion the hatch cover is launched away from the cabin
smoke pours out through the open hatch
she begins to unstrap herself when water pours in through the open hatch
she tries to make her way out fighting against the strong current that is gushing in but the flow is too strong and she struggles to force her way through
the cascade rapidly filling the cabin but it is too strong
the water has reached ryans chin when she manages to take one last deep breath of air before the metallic capsule which weighs almost three tons sinks quickly into the
as the ropes of the parachute tense the long fabric follows the cabin down
air trapped inside ryans suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up
ryan fights her way to the hatch and pulling with her good arm she swims out
she pushes herself away from the cabin swimming away from the a dark cloud of mud swells up around it
ryan struggles to swim up to the surface but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is dragging her down
she strokes rapidly but she isnt moving up
instead shes going down and she looks up and sees the rays of sunlight breaking through the lakes surface are eclipsed by the parachute which floats down toward her like
a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray
the frog crosses in front of her effortlessly swimming on its way to the surface
small bubbles of air come out of ryans nose as she struggles to open her suit
she takes off the bottom part of the suit
the parachute is getting closer a net about to trap her
she struggles out of the top part of her suit
and squirming out from under it she frees herself from the heavy garments and swims up as the sinking parachute traps her foot and begins dragging her down
but with a kick she sets herself free and she swims up stroking with her good arm
she is completely out of breath only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose
she is about to lose consciousness when she sees the frog swimming ahead of her sliding smoothly through the water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface
ryans eyes are closed as she floats up her body limp
the surface is coming closer and closer
she reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she come out to the and she takes an enormous breath
almost primal like the first breath of a newborn child it burns her lungs but reclaims life
she only has enough strength to keep her face above water
she floats catching her breath and taking long gulps of air
she looks up at where the clouds move caressed by air and light
and beyond outer space but she turns around and she swims breaking through the water and harnessing every last bit of energy in her
and soon she arrives to the she drags herself from the water like the first amphibious life form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land
the water laps gently over her washing in and out around her legs
she lies with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes closed recovering her strength
and as her breath steadies she pushes her face against the ground enjoying the sense of weight and then she looks at her surroundings taking in the almost unbearable beauty
of the planet earth
shes breathing deeply and begins to cough
its not a cough its a chuckle
ecstasy overcomes ryan and joyful laughter fills her body
she plants her palms against the ground and with an effort she pushes herself up
she feels her weight and manages to rise to her hands and knees like a four legged mammal
and she stands up
one foot falls heavily on the ground
it sinks into the mud and ryans feet are solidly planted on the mud
one foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground unstable coping with the weight
and then the other foot follows as she begins to walk on planet earth laughing
