written by oliver butcher stephen cornwell adapted from the novel out of my head by didier van cauwelaert
sleepy thick fatigue the end of a red eye flight
most passengers still asleep a few read or stare blankly
in business class a husband and wife mid s
hes awake reading a document
she sleeps nestled against his shoulder
hes trim sharp good looking in an academic way
even in sleep shes beautiful
wide mouthed and honey haired
the planes aspect shifts the pilots voice comes on in german
the man lifts his window shade peers out at the first rays of sun touching the skyline of berlin
halo of lights
giant talons the airplanes landing gear appears through cloud
tires hit slick asphalt
martin harris and elizabeth harris
wider a german immigration officer glances up at martin and liz
stamps both passports swipes the bar codes over a scanner hands them back
martin slips his into a leather briefcase
a melee of travelers and vehicles
liz beside him martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush
an attendant ushers them toward a waiting cab and driver
a crash of thunder the rain suddenly triples in strength
the taxi driver hustles martin and liz towards his car
he shields his head with a newspaper piling their bags into the trunk cursing
martin sets down his case moves to help the driver
the driver merges onto the autobahn
liz yawns with jet lag studies martin who stares out at the passing city
youre gonna do great
you always do
modern deco revival hotel conference center
a banner welcomes delegates to the world biotechnology forum
the harris taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red eye travelers arriving for early morning check in
martin takes out his billfold
ill do this

liz pecks his cheek gets out
martin leans forward
how much do we owe you
liz presses up to the crowded desk
a busy receptionist takes lizs booking slip
the eisenhower suite
a bellhop holds a large umbrella up to the rain loads the harris bags onto his cart
shuts the trunk the taxi pulls away
heading for the entrance
welcome to the hotel imperial
have you stayed with us before
no this is our first visit to berlin
were he stops short staring at their bags stacked on the luggage cart
he turns tracks the their taxi already pulling out of the drive
a stab of concern on lizs face
what do you mean the suite may not be available
i have to check with the manager
security inspections of the rooms are still being completed
but we confirmed two months ago
receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a ringing phone
liz sighs glances back toward the entrance
suddenly curious as she sees
martin standing in the open door of the next taxi in line
he speaks to the bellhop who nods quickly pushing the cart in through the doors headed for liz
martin getting in agitated
the driver pulls out into traffic
the rain still heavy
martin stares out at the wet city
eyes track as the shadowy columns of the brandenburg gate pass by
he lets himself relax a little enjoying this moment of forced calm
he catches sight of the driver in the rear view
young female shortish hair
smart eyes older than her years
layers of clothing
she glances into the mirror catches martin watching her
everyone says how much its changed
eyes connect brief
wipers flip flap
i wouldnt know
yes me too
i mean i wouldnt know either
he looks back at her inquisitive
for the airport its always americans in the morning
asians at night
martin nods pulls out his phone
service dies as gina downshifts doc martins working the pedals accelerates away from the large flughafen airport sign down a cobbled road next to main route
i think you missed
he stops smiles as he realizes shes navigated around a large construction back up saving them time
you do what you do i do what i do right
what do you do when youre not
he smiles nods
okay dumb thing to say
sorry i didnt mean anything its okay
i know what you meant
her eyes meet his in the mirror
she swings the taxi onto wilhelmstrasse
stops at a red light
ahead the marshall bridge over the river spree
gina moves the taxi mid stream in the traffic heading onto the bridge
martin checks his phone hes got service
he starts to dial
suddenly the cars in front of her start veering wildly in different directions just missing the boxed refrigerator tumbling off the truck in front of them
the box bursts open
gina swerves to avoid it clips the corner
front tire blows out
taxi skids crazily hits the curb
shower of sparks
taxi slams over the curb through the rail
plunges off the bridge
intense vivid images
the playing card ace taxis logo on the dash
ginas eyes in the mirror
silent free fall dive
martins head smacks against the side window
gina cushioned by the airbags which she wrestles back
water sprays in
gina cant open her door
steel steering lock on the floor
grabs it smashes the side window
hauls herself out
on the bridge above people frantically flag down traffic
gina turns sees the taxi midstream sinking
martin still in back unconscious
gina gulps air dives
she reaches into the front of the cab grabs the steering lock hammers it against the passenger window glances up the surface starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath
gina hammers at the glass again it breaks
grabs martins limp body drags him up to the surface
a crowd on the bank
people wading out to help
taking martin from her carrying him up onto dry land
the police arriving pushing back the crowd
paramedics quickly laying martin out on the concrete
everyones focus on the unconscious man
gina eases back
melts away into the growing horde of on lookers as the paramedics rip open martins shirt
feeding a tube down his throat
pushing on his stomach
whine as defibrillators charge
a paramedic lifts martins eyelid shines a flashlight
in a dark fog
distant voices university lecture hall
youthful martin speaking on the spotlit podium
a college age liz in the audience
laughter of rapt students
a jovial older colleague eagerly shaking martins hand
paddles on martins chest
paramedic calls out achtung
the charge surges into martins body
martin as a child
fascinated delighted as his father shows him the opening bud of a blossom
butterflies wings shimmer in sunlight
martins chest heaves up
slumps back down
liz and martin making love
martins chest rising up
half dressed hair ruffled and wet
turning toward us
her lips moving
martins body slumping back
sudden quiet now the world removed
just his face
they say your whole life flashes before you
but its the little things
its like looking at a painting
stand close all you can see are the brush strokes
its only when you step back that you get the whole picture
of light seen from behind closed eyelids
except for a distant sound
like falling rain
the sound growing
filling our ears as
a tiny pin hole of light too bright
glimpses of a nurse as she tears the wrapping off a fresh drip sac
a mans voice
small faded image of a german doctor speaking with the nurse
again a pin hole of consciousness
the nurse taking a private moment speaking in german on her cell phone
the nurse looks over straight at us realization in her face she hurries from the room
arms by his sides
a few days beard
a sutured cut on his temple
his eyes fluttering barely open
clipboard beside the bed
an admission form
where martins name should be unbekannte maennliche person and the subtitle becomes our main title
squeak of a door
just the distant pulse of his heartbeat
vision blurred blinking to focus
scrubbed floor white walls banks of drips and monitors his possessions on a table near him
konnen sie mich horen
daylight through a window
sitting by the bed is a dark haired man with a van dyke beard
wenn sie mich horen konnen blinken sie zweimal
he watches as martins eyes tilt
look directly at him
a dry croak
slowly forms itself into speech i
beat accented are you english
farge signals the nurse to come in
speaks to him slowly and clearly in english my name is doctor farge
you are in the waldfriede hospital
im the head neurologist here

farge exchanges a look with the nurse

we didnt find any identification with you doctor harris
the driver who saved your life disappeared soon after the accident and no one else has come forward

it sinks in
martin shakes his head wretchedly
liz doesnt know
shell be worried sick

where can we reach your wife
does she have a cell phone
yes she does
i cant remember
his voice trails off
a long beat
farge asks gently can you tell me what you do remember martin
do you remember what day it is
giving it thought
you told me that
but i dont know how i got here
he shakes his head
its called retrograde amnesia
with severe trauma of this kind memories get lost or fractured
although its unlikely youll ever fully recall the events around your accident
in the meantime let us see if anyone has filed a report looking for a martin harris okay
the light outside greying into dusk
on the tv a german chef showing how americans prepare thanksgiving dinner
the nurse comes in starts to makes a note in martins chart
the nurse shakes her head apologetic
martin watches a family a wife and children pass his door visiting another patient
he turns his head stares at his belongings
his clothes neatly laundered and folded shoes beneath them
a rolex with a stainless steel band a ballpoint pen a wad of cash in a billfold
three hundred or so euros a small blue book
crinkled water stained
painful effort he rises reaches out and picks up the watch
he turns the watch over
an engraving on the backplate e
snow falling outside a warmly lit living room
a fire crackles
martin unwraps a present the watch
he turns it over reads the engraving smiles up at liz across from him beautiful also smiling
she gave it to me our anniversary
the nurse smiles shakes her head not understanding
martin sets the watch down picks up the little blue book beside the watch horticus the classic botanical reference
he flicks through it reads the handwritten inscription for martin that he may discover the worlds inside
a distant smile
martin as a child sits with his father in his fathers study
his father shows him the illustrations in the new book
martins eyes are wide
martin starts to close the book tracks some numbers handwritten on the endpaper
he shuts the book glances at the tv silently playing the local english language tv news prince fahad arrives in berlin

familiar biotechnology forum banner
martin gets out strong deja vu
trying to orient
eyes peeled for a possible glimpse of liz martin heads for elevators
hotel security is everywhere
an entrance to a ballroom is flanked by guards checking ids and invitations
martin steps out into carpeted silence makes his way down the hall to the eisenhower suite
about to knock when he sees the door is ajar
martin pushes it open
hallway leads into the spacious sitting room
no one there
draped over a chair martin recognizes lizs jacket
martin smiles blinks against tears hes home
sound of movement from the bedroom door
im here i
a hotel maid appears from the bedroom door
startled as she sees martin
im looking for mrs
she suddenly gets him
nodding pointing down
guests flow in through the ornate doors
martin moves among them
significantly under dressed in his tattered jacket the sutured head injury
almost at the doors
when a hotel security guard intercepts him

i mean yes
distracted still looking at passing faces
i dont have it with me
my names harris dr
im on the list
my wife is elizabeth harris
im trying to find her
ive been in the hospital
as the guard checks a screen a crop haired man in a cheap suit nearby tracks them herr strauss head of hotel security
he approaches also checks the screen as the guard speaks to him quietly in german
do you have any other identification
ive already told this gentleman ive been in the hospital
i was in an accident
martin sees someone through the crowd
a striking intense looking man with dark wiry hair a designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder
smiling arms around his two ten year old daughters twin girls prettily dressed
immediately the center of attention
people moving forward to meet him
martin raises his hand calling out professor bressler
words lost in the noise
martin pushes toward him
but im sorry sir
thats professor bressler right there
he knows me he can confirm who i am
if you would be patient sir
no im done being patient
martin stops short
staring past them thats her thats my wife
by the buffet table
looking superb in a black evening dress
in conversation with a group of men and women
the look on his face
an overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief
thats liz my wife
strauss stares at him blankly
martin starts to lose it
look i have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me
so you need to take me to her right now
heads are turning
herr strauss mutters to the guard then beckons martin to accompany him inside
thread through the crush
martin ignoring the glances hes getting
his eyes fixed on liz
her back to him
a glass of wine in her hand
her golden hair
the ivory skin of her shoulders
strauss taps her on the arm
she half turns
excuse me madam
your husband is here
he needs to liz
liz turns fully
a flash of surprise as she sees martin
the suture on his head
oh jesus liz i moving in to embrace her
abruptly she steps away from him a flustered look of confusion on her face
i was in an accident
i was in the hospital in a coma im so sorry they didnt know who i was excuse me

liz stares at him nonplussed
her group also staring
and just who might you be
martin bewildered growing angry
liz half smiles glances around

she calls to a man nearby engaged in conversation
mid s like martin
elegant groomed athletic
conspicuously more handsome in a chiselled way

moments strained silence
strauss unsure what to do signaling a guard
martin b steps in

martin rounds on martin b
jabs a finger

he tries to put his hand on her arm
liz shies away

guard grabs martins shoulder
martin shakes him off
guard grabs him again
martin elbows him
martins hauled back

martin pulling free steps away
loud sardonic great
thats the first good idea anyones had

to liz serious its not funny
i was hurt
liz just stares at him afraid anchored to martin bs arm
seen through glass
a wall of monitors show images from around the hotel
inside martin sits surrounded
martin rocks in a chair restless hands knotted
a female detective watches him
an older detective is on the phone
strauss sits near him studying him while a technician fast forwards pane video of the hotel reception area the drive in front of the hotel
on the video slowing to real time
liz arriving at reception speaking with the receptionist gesturing outside
thats liz and i
i must have been outside i

the video plays on
liz thanks the receptionist leaves
as you can see

martin stares at him helpless
the older detective hangs up the phone
immigration confirms the arrival of a doctor and mrs
harris on november rd at
an hour later they checked into their suite at the hotel
martin breathes in
chooses his words carefully
hes not martin harris
i am martin harris
the man downstairs is pretending to be me
and this impostor
may i ask
did he also steal your wife
martin searching for a response
the hint of a smile on the female detectives face
hes forcing her
he must have but why
theres no answer to that
martin looks down
this is insane
he stares at their faces
he calms himself trying to get a grip
a memory resurfacing
my lab number
call my assistant she can verify who i am

he picks up a pad scribbles down the number
the female detective picks up the phone dials
she switches to speaker
a recorded message

if youre calling
the older detective presses off
no ones going to be there till monday
racking his brain rod
hes a colleague

female detective dutifully dials the number
click of a machine
then a jovial male voice this is doctor cole
im having an out of office experience right now so

you want us to disturb a nobel prize winning scientist simply to attest to your story
when no crime has been committed

on one of the monitors a view of the rose room liz and martin b visible in the corner dining
off the monitor and sharing a hotel suite with his wife
excuse me your wife

even if she is your wife sharing a room with her is not illegal

german subtitled look at her
soon well have twenty more men claiming to be her husband
the room tries not to laugh cant help smiling
the monitor image flips now just a corridor
im sorry i didnt realize this was funny to you
the older detective frowns offended
the female detective speaks into her radio
martin tracks panicking
you have no proof you are even american
we can arrest you only for that
i told you i was in an accident

the female detective listens to the radio response nods to the older man who checks in with strauss
youre going to arrest me

the older detective confers with the female detective
on the monitors the image from the rose room reappears liz and martin b visible laughing drinking
martins gaze darts panicked the image
coming to a decision
low pained im sorry
youre probably right
faces look over interested
i havent been remembering things very well
perhaps this is just

martin remembers something fumbles in his jacket and produces farges card

i should go back there
im really embarrassed
strauss leans in half convinced
now you are saying that you are not dr
point of no return

martin in a humiliated daze as two hotel guards escort him out of a service entrance
dirty pavement a few bellhops smoke in the cold by a propped open door
the guards move martin along out towards the hotel taxi stand
martin climbs into the back seat
one of the guards hands dr
farges business card to the driver speaks to him in german
door slams cab starts to move
even as they pull away several high end mercedes are sweeping up
saudi security get out of the first and last cars check around before opening the doors of the center car
the man we saw on tv gets out
prince farad flanked by bodyguards and gorgeous female companions
the hotel manager and conference head greet him smiles and handshakes they usher his entourage inside
martin tracks the prince then focuses beyond a view into the hotel bar
liz and martin b entering
his gaze fixed on them as the cab starts to move again
ive changed my mind
martin thrusts a few bills forward steps out
a large brown range rover locks up tires as martin steps out in front of it
a brief moment martin staring up into the tinted front glass
cant make out the driver
he holds up his hand apologizing makes his way to the street
weaving back through pedestrians eyes fixed on the bar
freezes as he sees them
he leans into her speaks quietly
she nods intimate smiles and shakes her head
what an evening
liz and martin b get up leave
she takes his arm intimate heading out to the lobby
picks them up again in
an exterior elevator rising up the side of the building
the two of them inside
martin walks fast blind lost
miasma of lights and sounds
frozen mannequins in windows
the din of clubs and bars
sex shop neon sizzling
nowhere to go but to keep going
martin gazes at the dark water
silent free fall
the taxi hits the water
the rattle of a u bahn train on a bridge snaps him back
its pulsing lights strobing like a silent movie
faint voice in martins ear as rodney cole recites his message
hands numb with cold martin pumps in change
rodney its me martin
rod im in berlin for the conference but its liz
im in trouble rod
phone issues a demand for more money
martin fumbles for change drops a crumpled ball of euros into the gutter
hotel is a charitable description
martin counts out sodden bills hands them to a woman behind the desk
she in turn gives martin a form to fill
martin looks at her helpless
the woman sighs
pushes back his money
nicht reisepal nicht hotelzimmer
martin exits pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold
he scans the street unnerved frowns as he spots a brown range rover up the street parked idling
he squints paranoid checks the other way
his eyes lock on a lit s bahn station across the platz
martin pushes through the turnstiles his footsteps echo in the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the advertisements
happy sexy germans smile back at him
the sound of footsteps behind him matching his
he slowly becomes aware glances back
the empty corridor curving away
martin stops listens
he starts to move again aware that the delicate click of the following steps also begins again
up ahead the corridor straightens out at the train platform several late night travelers waiting
martin begins to hurry
the footsteps also increase in speed
another sound a train approaching
martin gives up cool starts to run as the train barrels into the station its noise eclipsing all sound
doors open and martin leaps in turns to face the open door
moments pass the cars bell signals
then a man appears rushing from the corridor one hand raised
german subtitled please
hold the door
hes mild faced glasses carrying a shopping bag in one hand
he frowns as martin does nothing to stop the door
the two men stare through the glass as the train begins to move
the man shakes his head foreigners
martin shivers with cold and exhaustion eyes play over the few passengers in the car
a nondescript man a few benches down who stares at him then back to his paper
martin eyes him paranoid
slowly gives up lets his gaze plays over the adverts
has to write something down
fumbles in his jacket for his the copy of horticus looking for a blank page to write on
a piece of card falls from between its pages
something printed on one side
martin flips it over scribbles on the other th
other times dates numbers
everything he can remember
sudden overwhelming fatigue
the roar of the train
lights racing by the windows
martins eyelids droop
lecture hall younger liz in the audience
smiling older colleague shaking his hand
bees wings swarming in their hive
young martin watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass
their movement morphing into naked bodies
martin and liz making love
liz towelling her hair
only now its dark and cut short
turns smiles at him
are you ready
martins eyes creak open
the train is still moving but everything has changed
morning passengers crowd the car giving him space
an american couple their bags tucked tight
the wife staring down at him
martin runs water combs his hair with his fingers
tries to press creases out of his stained suit
he stares into the graffiti stained metal mirror of the bathroom
are you going to give up
solve the problem
martin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor eyes glued to the screen as he types in an url
the dartmouth mail website appears
martin types in his login password
please try again
he switches tactics
types martin harris into google
results come back at him
on an impulse he clicks images
page after page of men young and old
getting married posing partying historical illustrations
behind martin door jingles a young man comes into the cafe seats himself across and to the side of martin
martin focuses tries martin harris phd
a new window opens
the role of gorytini and thynnidae in drakea pollination
research faculty information dr
he stares in disbelief
suddenly becomes aware of the man across young nondescript his head bobbing gently to whatever his ipod earbuds are playing staring into his computer
the young man looks over meets martins eyes holds for a long moment small smile looks back
martin studies him for a moment forces his gaze back to the page the negation of his life on a small screen
glances over again
martin catching him
can i help you
the guy points to his headphones shrugs
martin stares at his screen ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds
martin rises suddenly looks to the bored attendant who nods towards the back
martin moves past college kids on facebook to a dim back corridor a door marked manner and whats hes looking for a back door cracked
martin slips into the alley trots towards the street glancing back
no one is following
he moves onto the street waits at a light
eyes lock onto the familiar ace taxi logo of a taxi passing
silent freefall dive
the ace taxis logo
the face in the mirror
looking back at him
hunched against the drizzle martin pauses outside it
the playing card ace taxis logo
martin ducks under the open steel shutters
the depot manager a bully with a face like boiled meat rants at martin in german
biko a gentle looking somalian translates
his english is impeccable
he says he doesnt care if she saved your life
the bitch cost him euros
the insurance wont cover the cab because she had no license
the driver who was letting her moonlight in his taxi skipped town
the depot managers rage reaches a hitlerian climax
he says illegal immigrants are destroying german society
im guessing he doesnt know where she is
no one knows where she is
martin studies biko nods
please thank him for his time
biko exits the depot starts to tuck in ipod earphone when martin catches up with him meets his pace

she moves to the register where a beefy owner counts off a weeks pay and stuffs it in an envelope for her
she thanks him in german tucks it away and ducks behind the counter to steam milk for a coffee

a long moment she looks back down to her work

she finishes the turkish coffee starts another

she looks up at him

she turns pushes back into the restaurant
he watches her explaining to her boss
then turns away towards a back door
martin sits in a small plastic chair filling out paperwork
the place is closing early for the long weekend
a man opens a door looks at martin
marc spiegler is german fluent english
patient but wishing he was on his way home as well
he looks over martins paperwork as martin places his watch and the horticus book on the table
where the form asks for a complaint martin has written identity theft

he needs work and hes good at finding things
he may be able to help you
cavernous lobby echoing voices and footsteps
ancient brickwork and tile contrast with new age furniture and technology
an atomic clock reads
martin heads to the desk
i need to find professor bresslers lab
i have an appointment at
the female receptionist behind the desk consults her screen
your name please
the professor knows who i am
we scheduled this meeting weeks ago
the professor knows you
well we havent met but weve been corresponding
he invited me here to discuss my thesis
she frowns rises from the desk
wait here please
is there some sort of problem
no answer she disappears into a back office
martin shakes his head exasperated
he scans the building plan on the wall
p molekulare botanik
suddenly about turns heads for the stairs
the woman out of the office
eingang ist verboten
she quickly grabs the phone on the desk speed dialing
rows of head height corn in a large humid chamber under bright lights
above ancient rusting girders and brick
research students clip seed spikelets bagging and logging the samples
martin slips quickly in through a door unseen
heat and moisture hitting him
above the drone of bugs
he recognizes one of them
drakea named after anthea drake the english botanist who wondered how it manages to reproduce when it doesnt appear to attract any insects
a wave of anger
thats martins work hes discussing
its puzzling one wonders how bressler stops talking
stares past martin b at martin heading toward them down a corn row eyes burning
martin b turns sees him
his eyes harden
but its bressler who speaks first
alarmed indignant this laboratory is a restricted area
who are you
its all right professor
what the hell are you doing here
you know this man
how did you get in here
are you absolutely out of your mind
he is not martin harris
i am martin harris
thats a conversation stopper
bressler looks to martin b
who shakes his head embarrassed
martin pointing oh jesus
a phone rings somewhere in the room
its picked up
so what is this
some sort of hybridized propagation
there are two martin harrises
let me explain
this man showed up at the hotel last night
security had to remove him
the police were called
i called the police you sonofabitch
seems he checked himself out of the hospital
he was in an accident of some sort
one of the research students calls to bressler in german
martin catches the word polizei
a surge of panic
he looks around
sees a straw he can grasp at
miss drake was wrong
the plant sample on the table behind bressler
a single insect was attracted but she couldnt see it
its too small and it moves too fast
its a kind of wasp but it looks like an ant
only the males have wings
the orchid re produces the pheromones of the female wasp to lure it in
its a trick
its pretending to be something it isnt
bressler looks to martin
martin sees his opening
hope in his voice
you and i
on the phone
we discussed your interest in alternative forms of propagation
i told you about my father a school teacher
his passion for science
how he passed that on to me
i dont believe it
youve been listening to my calls
just who the hell are you
i said id like to do the same for my kids
you talked about your children
their his voice falters
tails off into silence
searching his memory
expression shifting to one of panic
you told me their names
i know them
martin b picks up for him
icy clarity laurel and lily
martin frozen as martin b goes on
ten years old
the same age i was when i told my father i wanted to be a botanist
we discussed that on the phone professor
how id never seen him so happy
martin sways on his feet sweat beading
that wasnt you
dont you remember
we spoke of how brave our wives were to marry to marry scientists
i told you about our honeymoon our honeymoon in paris
my wife and i
liz wanted to go to the museums
all i wanted to do was visit the
but she insisted and
but she insisted and thats how i first saw thats how i first saw leonardos vitruvian man
leonardos vitruvian man
a beat a breath
bressler looking between them
look stop it
martin b suddenly seems to snap
this is my wife were talking about
my father whom i loved
you may think its funny but its my life
whatever sick pleasure this gives you im tired of it
you need to
martin just stares at the martin b whos shaking upset
like looking in a mirror that has taken your emotions
this isnt happening
the police suddenly there
bressler signals for them to stay back
martin lifts his eyes
martin b shakes his head
i cant believe i need to do this
he reaches in his jacket
produces a passport
martin bs face
then he opens his wallet
credit cards new hampshire drivers license
a photograph in the wallets plastic sleeve
martin sees the photograph
his eyes widen
dog eared with age
a younger martin b with liz
in the tuileries in paris his arm around her
the image closer blurring out of focus
the floor rushing up
flickering like a candle in darkness
voices behind the light
a distorted form slowly takes shape
a familiar bearded face
farge fans a penlight across martins eyes
propped up on a gurney
flinches at the glare
the police brought you here
the mistake was mine
i should never have let you leave
martin blinks bleary
farge talks briefly to the nurse in german
she nods starts prepping a hypodermic at a table
farge looks back to martin
explains gently confusion
the complete or partial loss of identity
these are common stages in recovery
some temporary others longer term
were going to do an mri
try to find out whats happening
martin stares out the window not fighting hardly listening
a bird alights on a branch
the mind is like a jigsaw puzzle
the pieces fit together to create the person we are
with major trauma the puzzle is shattered
but the brains ability to recover is remarkable
the mind needs a narrative an identity
without memory without a past we are nothing
in the coma state memories are rebuilt
in some cases the pieces move
in others they go missing
completely new pieces are found
the bird flies off
martins eyes track
comas sometimes perform a kind of alchemy
a patient awakes convinced of a reality that was previously only fantasy
new men in effect with new lives
do you know what it feels like to become insane
there is quite a lot of literature on the subject
but finally i would say its a i can tell you
martin looks over farge almost recoils at the intensity in martins eyes
its like a war between what you know
he taps his forehead
and what you believe
his hand moves down his body to his chest taps his heart
he leans towards farge
who do you think wins
tight hurting fatalistic
farge almost afraid nods to the nurse who slips the needle in
far off voices
gurney moving beneath him
rhythmic sound of the wheels becoming
claustrophobic nightmare a support holds martins head rigid earphones piping soothing classical music but the noise of the machine is all engulfing
dunn dunn dunn
the sound deafening
scanner moving over him
martins eyes empty
far far away
undulating bodies moving over each other martin and liz making love
martin b and liz drinking in the hotel bar
she leaning over whispering to him intimate
an abrupt jolt
platform moves sliding martin out of the tube
his eyes open take in the room
tending to him
one raises a needle injects a cloudy substance into martins iv bag
the mri control booth empty
martin squints a little confused
he raises his eyes looks into the face of the man from the internet cafe
call him jones
his mind struggles to compute
the sudden overwhelming realization that hes not insane
this man is here
his eyes dart as the other orderly glances over the man from the train tunnel
call him smith
he smiles at martin polite nondescript
ghostly in his disinterest
this wont take very long
martin tries to raise up but cant move his arms and legs are like lead
he opens his mouth to call out his voice barely a murmur
his eyes lock on the iv bag the steady drip
down the line into his body
the two men quickly lift martin hefting him face down onto a gurney
one arm dangles
the mens shoes thick soled black
wheels of the gurney
jones stuffing his clothes and effects into a plastic bag tossing them under the gurney
german subtitles excuse me where are you taking this patient
martins vision racks traces the nurses white sneakers standing in the now open doorway to the room
martin strains to yell to speak nothing
he can just move his head enough to eyeball the iv
german subtitles we have instruction to move this patient to the american hospital at wiesbaden
here are the papers
the rustle of paper
martin concentrates eyes on the iv tube hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm
great effort he leans pinching the tube closed
close on the iv the drips
german subtitles im surprised i wasnt informed
let me check with a sound like paper torn quick
and the nurse falls to the floor staring up at martin martin gazes down at her in horror as she bleeds out staring upwards at him the light in her
around him smith and jones start to move locking the door opening cabinets working fast martins eyes lock on a pair of scissors tucked in her apron
eyes watering adrenaline surging martin wills his hand to reach down palm the scissors just as the nurses body is dragged away leaving a trail of red
the mri room door opens the two orderlies wheel the barely conscious martin out into the corridor
behind them the room is spotless
they round a corner almost at the exit
doors ahead blow open
doctors paramedics rushing forward with various wounded on gurneys
something big has happened
smith and jones eye the madness coming their way command decision they duck into where a feeble old man mumbles at them from his bed
they ignore the man go about checking martin
jones lifts his head pries open one eyelid after the other while smith ties down his arms covers him with a sheet
suddenly the door opens
a doctor breathless
german subtitles you two
we need help
off their hesitation no choice
they exit after the doctor jones glancing back at martin as the door swings shut behind them
the covered shape on the gurney starts to move
martins hand saws back and forth using the scissors to cut the straps that bind him
across the old man tracks the motion
a strap gives way
martin paws the blanket weakly away
feels along his arm and pulls out the iv
he rises up trying to orient
the old man staring at him
dazzling daylight framed by a window
strange reverberating echoes
pulls himself upright
tries to stand but his body is like jello
reaches out grabs the leg of a steel equipment trolley which teeters
crashes to the floor showering martin with a cascade of instruments and dressings
emergency team clusters around a lifeless patient working fast
smith and jones resentfully holding drip bags
they heard that
turn eyes meeting
set down their drip bags
edge back toward the door
smith and jones hurrying down the hall
quick check into the patients room reveals martin gone the old man gesturing panicked
they moves on fast around a corner into
doctors and nurses
smith and jones push into the room scanning
see shuffling towards the doors
given away by the plastic bag and the hospital gown showing under the jacket
entrance doors slam open
paramedics charge in wheeling in more accident patients on a gurneys past martin as he exits
smith and jones break into a run trying to press through two more crews coming through with more crash chaos here
ambulances arriving departing
crews slamming their rigs closed taking off sirens wailing
other arriving with wounded
smith and jones rush out of the hospital doors pull up
the many ambulances the crowds
no sign of martin
cop cars and fire trucks surround an accident scene where a truck has side swiped a trolley car
ambulance pulls up behind them
paramedics jump out one of them pulling open the back doors
startles as he finds martin now dressed back in his clothes a reassuring hand held up climbing out unsteadily its okay
paramedic would do something but his colleagues yelling at him to hurry
just has to watch martin go
weaving down the busy sidewalk buffeting against annoyed shoppers
looks behind to see if hes being followed
keeps pressing on finally arriving at tended by a middle eastern man who stares at martin
martin eyes warm gyros and souvlakis rummages for money
comes out with just a slip of paper with writing on it the slip the man from the embassy wrote on
he focuses his mind clearing a name jurgen
a coroners hand slides a zipper closed past the lifeless eyes of the nurse
the two detectives from the hotel imperial sit with farge who pours himself a drink with remorseful hands
the entire scene in german subtitled the mans condition was unusual yes
but there was nothing to indicate violence
is he still dangerous
farge watches the coroner wheel away the nursess body
to someone who threatens that fantasy
i believe he is
metro train car almost empty save for a few noticeably down at heel passengers
martin looks up at the map
bleak uniform blocks of communist era housing
graffiti covered walls hammers and sickles swastikas
martin stops outside one checks the address on the card
water pooling on concrete
gebrochen sign blocking off the elevator
martin climbs the steps
approaching footfalls shouts from above
a group of young skinheads thunders past him on downward
martin presses a bell
hears it ringing
a door behind him opens
a grey haired lady peers out
martin tries the bell again
coughing from inside the sound of a lock
the door half opens
revealing ernst jurgen
piercing eyes in a face far older than its sixty some years
frayed suit jacket stained shirt grey hair yellowed by nicotine
alles in ordnung frau brunner
frau brunner retreats back behind her door
jurgen turns to martin
eyes reading him
jurgen leads martin down a hallway piled with books
siegler used to work for me
did he tell you that
his laughter becomes a cough that racks his body
lets it pass before ushering martin into a tiny living room
points martin toward a battered chair
opens a bottle of cheap brandy pours two glasses
turns to find martin looking at framed photos on the sideboard
a younger jurgen in east german army uniform
in a large office
smiling beside a russian made sedan
the ministry for state security
thats where spiegler worked for you
the secret police
a true believer like the rest of us
now look at him
i should have had him shot
another laugh more coughing
hands martin a brandy
germans are experts at forgetting
we forgot we were nazis
now weve forgotten forty years of communism
but its not just history thats forgotten
its people too
he sinks into a chair
but enough of me
jurgen jots notes in a pad
hand unsteady he perches his cigarette on the ashtray picks up the horticus
i always have it with me
it was a gift from my father
jurgen flips it open
notices the inscription the numbers written inside the front endpaper
these mean anything to you
its my wifes handwriting
so they mean something to her
he looks to martin
her involvement in this
there must have been something
in the past
martin shakes his head at a loss
jurgen leafs on
the piece of card drops from between the pages
jurgen picks it up
martins notations from the night before in the train times
for this week
its everything i remember
jurgen turns over the card
a cheery cartoon uncle sam uncle sams bowling billiards
my friend rodney cole told us to go said it was a blast
tapping his pencil on the pad
passport credit cards family photos
things like these take time to prepare
you say this man has detailed knowledge of your research of your relationship with
he knows everything
including the fact that you were going to have a random accident that would allow him seamlessly to take your place
these people may be good but theyre not god
the question is why would they want to take your place
what could they gain from being you
they tried to kill me
yes did you a favor id say
now you have
now you know you are right
do you believe me
jurgen pours them both another brandy
in the stasi we had a basic principle ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story
but a man who tells the truth cannot change his however unlikely his story sounds
i believe you are telling the truth doctor harris
a long beat
jurgen closes the notebook
ill start by calling these numbers again
as you say its thanksgiving
and theres the time difference so it may take time to make contact
and then there is the question
martin takes off his rolex
sets it on the table
its all i have
ill pay you in cash as soon as i can
jurgen nods picks up the watch
turns it looks at the engraving on the back
as martin turns to leave
a wince of pain as jurgen gets up
lifts a tea tin off the shelf
takes out a hundred euros
a loan against your guarantee
ill need twenty four hours
call me tomorrow afternoon
do you have a place to stay
a long beat
off martins face
gina is cleaning up for the night counting her tips jotting numbers in a small notebook
the television plays the evening news quietly
in a corner her boss is tallying the days receipts at a table
gina ducks under the counter calls out to a man whos parked in a corner seat out of sight
turkish subtitled hey friend
the man looks up its martin
hes exhausted wet
his eyes full of need and fear
i thought i told you to im sorry
i had nowhere else to go
she starts to respond holds it back
i know the feeling
i just need to know
the man you picked up the man whos life you saved
that was me right
it was me
she looks down at him moved
eyes track his wedding ring
what about your wife
can you imagine what its like to wake up one day and your life
has been erased
he starts to rise collect himself
it was you
he starts to go
she puts a hand on his arm
he stares at it
dont be an idiot
he hesitates then lets her lead him out of the cafe
in the corner the owner watches them go
the tv news changes flashes a special
the owner looks up on television martins face caught by a camera at the hospital
juxtaposed next to it a smiling picture of the nurse
german text scrolls wanted for murder
the owners hand moves picks up the phone
the brown range rover idles on the street
inside two figures statue in silence
smith and jones
the engine idles the vents blow heat
suddenly an electronic scrambler on the dashboard squawks in german
martin and gina walk side by side unused to the company
so how long are you married
where did you meet her
i was a teaching assistant
liz heard me lecture
and theres no way she just didnt
he shakes his head
they reach the cement steps of an overpass climb
you dont have to believe me
its crazy i know
gina pauses stares through chain link at the cars below
everyone has a story
where they came from where they are going what happened to them
why theyre not happy or alone
l ooking over who cares what i believe
all that matters is
pokes his chest who you are what you do right now
she reaches in her jacket
opens the notebook she was writing in
columns of figures
this is me
euros and counting
the numbers the only thing that changes
i reach i can buy papers
or maybe ill come home one day and find a stranger who claims to be me
id like that
leave it all behind
you could do that
martin shakes his head
id still have my memories
you like your memories
very american of you
she shrugs turns away
key in the lock door opens
gina shows martin in
run down but clean
rainwater seeps in through the window
martin sits watches gina as she goes to a sideboard and uncorks a bottle
pours martin a glass of clear liquor
he takes a sip
gina watching him
muffled tv and arguing voices in turkish from the floor below
the walls are made of cardboard
but its home
another smile tired
a long beat
abruptly gina gets up and leaves the room
sound of drawers opening
you can sleep on the floor in there
i have an extra mattress
tosses something to martin
a sweater a pair of mans jeans
before he can speak
night owl students and back packers at rows of terminals fingers tapping
the unlikely figure of jurgen waits in the line at the counter
signs in gets his swipe key
moments thought jurgen types martin harris ph
d into the search window
close on the list the same martin got
jurgen writes something in his notebook

fahad at a press conference
sudden shift of focus someone approaching the podium
security move to intercept
explosive flash of a grenade
blood on the lens hand held pandemonium
the cafe owner is still watching the local news looking for another glimpse of martin
he glances over to see two men one holding up a police badge
german subtitled you guys are quick
the badge lowers
looks utterly nonthreatening plain
but the owners voice falters
martin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed looks around himself as he takes off his jacket
intimate to be in here
photographs on a cluttered vanity old country bosnia
men in suits and women in long dresses
children a boy and two girls
gina goes to the fridge removes a pot of plain stew and sets it on the stove
she uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of fatty meat
drops it on a chipped plate and opens the window
leaning out into the rain gina reaches up slides the plate onto a sloping roof above
excited yowls as stray cats come running from every direction
gina ducks back inside pulls the window shut glances towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the bathroom turns on the hot water
the lights bust so you have to leave the door open if you want to see anything
dont worry i wont peek
the range rover pulls up outside the building
martin takes off his shirt lays it down
notices several charcoal drawings tucked behind a radiator
he pulls a few out
a lonely man in the park
a woman with her child
gina clears her throat
martin looks over sees gina standing in the doorway realizes
im sorry i just
did you do these
i give you a place to stay it doesnt give you the right to
no youre right
putting them back im sorry
you should i should what
have been an artist
perhaps in bosnia
beat quoting him can you imagine what its like to wake up one day
and your whole life
has been erased
he stares at her moved
that connection again
he looks away
looks back again
what is it
its the one thing i remember about the accident
your eyes in the mirror
he tails off
face to face
pounding on the door
gina motions martin out of sight as she opens the door
its biko the soft spoken somali taxi driver
tries teasingly to peek past her into the apartment
you got company
she puts her foot against the door inscrutable
biko drops a set of keys into her hand
bring it back to my place
leave the keys on the tv
and dont forget to reset the meter
youre the best
she pecks him on the cheek
biko pushes in the door just a little but enough to catch martin in his undershirt carrying the rest of his clothes halfway to the shower
im just going
biko looks at gina raises an eyebrow
yes thats right
i sleep with every married american you send my way thank you for that by the way
hey no need to explain to me
get on your way
she pushes him out closes the door
the stew has started to smoke
gina moves it off the burner
biko trots down stairs laughing to himself
passes two men working on the phone box tucked below the stairs
german subtitled hey while youre at it check the line to number eight
shes always getting bad service
one of the men lifts his face
biko takes them in their clothes
jurgen making a call rain dripping off his coat
banks of cctv screens monitoring tegels passenger areas
night shift staff sip coffee
an incoming call
desk officer answers
calls to an older uniformed man who picks up punches a button
german subtitles hans
its colonel jurgen
from the old days
i need a favor
gina punches play on an old boom box and a cool bosnian hip hop groove plays
she spoons some of the stew into a bowl sets it on the table
martin lets the hot water run over his head drip across his face allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation
knocking on the door again
gina puts the bowl in the sink heads for the door
just a moment biko
and youre going to be late she throws open the door
smith and jones press in
jones clamping a hand over her mouth
watching them work is awe inspiring chilling
theres no wasted motion whatsoever
their faces calm observant
jones holds gina gun covers the dark entrance to the bathroom where the shower still runs as smith turns the music up loud then opens the oven blows out the
pilot light turns on the gas
close on the gas a hazy layer rippling over the floor
smith grabs a candle off ginas table lights its wick sets it on top of the stove
pressed against the wall trapped fully aware of whats going on martin
hes pulled on clothes
by looking in the small mirror over the sink he can see the men going about their work
he can see their weapons
his eyes search for anything useful anything at all
he reaches towards the small window to the exterior
it swings open revealing the fire escape beyond
the gas hisses as it spills into the room
smith grabs the bottle of alcohol douses gina as with one hand jones produces a hypodermic
a low thump from the bathroom
smith reacts instantly kicks in the bathroom door gun lined
the empty shower runs
the window to the exterior swings gently
terror stricken realizing martin has abandoned her
jones nods to smith who goes out the door covers the hall
jones flips gina onto her stomach presses her face to the floor pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to inject her with the hypodermic
she struggles screams in rage chokes on the gas
her eyes widen as jones slides the needle in starts to press
martin blasts in from the fire escape through the window nearest them catching jones in the face cutting his face
he tumbles over his gun sliding away
tumble together smash into the sideboard which collapses splintering into the kitchen
martin tries to hit jones who easily deflects the blow leaps cat like to his feet moving towards his gun as smith re enters weapon drawn and freezes his eyes
tracking the candle teetering on the stove
now falling over
jones smith martin
all track the candle its progress towards the edge of the stove
jones and smith run towards the door
martin grabs gina hauls her towards the bedroom as the candle falls
doors splinter outward
blast hurls gina and martin onto the bedroom floor
martin covering gina
pressure wave sweeps over them burning debris raining
fires spreading the main room beyond the bedroom an inferno
martin pulls gina up
they move to the window and the fire escape
gina begins to slide it open
she tracks his gaze down below jones exits the building looks up amidst other onlookers
wipes blood from his face
martin looks around wild for anything his gaze settling on the far wall
flames flare in growing
with a roar martin rushes the wall impacts it with his shoulder goes right through
lands hard in a small empty bedroom turkish decorated
drywall and plaster everywhere
gina follows him through as they thread through the abandoned flat out into
martin and gina slip out a door into a crowd of immigrant families other residents fleeing down the stairwell
smoke is thick flames roar
laying in wait near the entrance to ginas place
hand tucked in his coat
gaze racks looking for another way
we have to go up
he starts to pull her but shes frozen staring in horror
martin tracks her gaze bikos body tucked under the stairs
lifeless eyes stare back
immigrant families emerge from the flaming building
jones stands next to the range rover eyes tracking the crowd the upper floors now engulfed in flame
martin and gina emerge at the top run to the edge
reaching across to the next building
below him five flights down
a mortal fall
martins hands grip a ledge pull him over
he reaches back pulls her across
they keep moving
crowds parting as fire trucks scream around the corner
smith comes out the last to exit the building
he meets eyes with jones satisfied
martin and gina emerge from the neighboring building
see smith climbing into the range rover
martin takes ginas arm steers her away
notices an old mercedes diesel taxi at the curb covered in debris
where are the keys
gina stares at him lost
martin reaches into her pockets
finds bikos keys
he hauls broken panes debris off the car manages to get it open
he bundles her inside
martin fumbles the key into the ignition
he turns it
warning light delay as the diesels glow plugs warm up
in the rearview the range rover making a u turn heading their way
jones drives smith shotgun
they cruise slowly keeping an eye peeled
pass the debris covered taxi empty
they keep moving gaze still tracking
smith pops his cell phone
crouched down martin watches in the mirror as the range rover turns a corner
he restarts the engine puts the car in gear and pulls them away from the curb
gina still in stunned silence
wipes tears and grime off her face
she looks across at martin
he glances up at the mirror
sudden change in his expression
gina turns sees
four cars back
smith riding shotgun
faces expressionless as they swerve out into traffic deftly cut back in one vehicle closer to martin and gina
gina turns back to martin
this cant be happening
adrenaline clearing her mind
martin spins the wheel
taxi swerves across oncoming traffic into a side street
gina waving frantically
just in time martin pulls a right
cab drifts slams a wall side on
bounces back into the center of the road
a look from martin what
gina glances behind
no sign of them
turns to her right
sees the range rover racing down the parallel side street
theyre going to cut us off
martin screeches into a turn
heads for the parallel alley
range rover flashes through the intersection just ahead
taxi cuts across feet behind them
jones spots the taxi in the mirror
brakes high speed
races back up the alley
martin floors the gas
screams out into oncoming traffic across a red light
zig zags past cars
edge of control
zooms through open gates into
tree lined avenue
closed gates at the far end
range rover moving fast down the street alongside the cemetery
suddenly cutting left across traffic
bounces over the curb full speed into the grounds
wd slaloming past gravestones rapidly closing on the taxi
closed gates ahead
martin puts his foot down
smashes through the gates
flying hinge slams the windshield glass instantly spidering opaque
martin driving blind
careens against the embankment whiplashes up spin on its axis
over the edge of the embankment tumbling over and over
slams down right way up axles crumpling
steaming hiss of the engine
martins hands still locked on the wheel
gina next to him
martin shoves open the door
a maze of tracks and power lines below street level
s bahn u bahn high speed ice trains freight
tracks disappearing in each direction into tunnels
martin turns looks up
the range rover jones at the wheel
engine guns range rover plunges headlong down the embankment
as a high speed train hurtles out of the one of the tunnels
martin grabs ginas hand
running side by side
train horn blasts as they cross right in front of it as the range rover cut off spins degrees races down the tracks alongside it
martin and gina scramble across tracks towards a tunnel
the range rover passes the back of the train
hard right over the tracks
the car catches air
bellies down hard onto the next set of tracks
front tire explodes
range rover spins
rear wheels slam into the track
another tire bursts
scraping stop car straddling the rails
jones shifts into reverse
rims spin against metal
martin and gina sprinting towards the tunnel
smith jumps out of the range rover lines his weapon
martin and gina hit the ground bullets chipping ceramic off the walls
up ahead illuminated some utility stairs
gina gasps air spent
martin looks behind them
martin grabs gina pulls her after him
jams shift into drive
pedal to metal
four wheel drive rims scream on the rails inches forward
almost off the tracks
jones looks around
shunted by a rear engine no way the driver can see him
scrambles for the door
freight train plows into the range rover
coupling smashes through the window
impales the car crushing jones pushing the mangled wreck along the tracks
range rover scraping along the wall in a tail of sparks
smith dives out of the way
car wreck and freight cars thundering past him
toward martin and gina pelting full speed
almost on them
last second they dive into the alcove
through the steel door into the utility access stairs
gina doubled gasping for breath
but theyve got to keep going
both staggering up the zig zag iron steps
sprints after them
through the steel door
smith sprinting up to a landing
rush of air
smith dashes around a corner
station jammed with soccer fans
the bars have let out
singing drinking a swarming party
a train just emptying the mass crowding out
martin and gina squeezed together between laughing faces drunken youth singing chanting
both of them in this chaotic oasis
gina struggling to catch her breath
martin looking at her
he knows what shes feeling
she meets his eyes a moment glances back
sees smith caught in the crowd but pushing his way towards them
they push their way forward through the crush
the crowd dissipates into the night
gina takes martins hands pulls him along a street of neon club signs lines of youth waiting to get in
smith emerges from the station tracks them
gina hurries them past bars and clubs
they come to a door crowded with youths middle eastern and balkan
gina pulls martin to the front
unfriendly eyes stare down martin the huge bouncer nods recognition to gina
smith stops takes in the many clubs the various bouncers guarding their doors
looks down at his boring suit nods defeat
turns and walks away
the club is barely lit punctuated by beams of moving light constant music
the bar a glowing oasis
gina leads martin through
they pass down through old wwii bomb shelter construction through curtains into
even darker only small glowing lights candles neon tubing casts shadows
quiet almost only the dull thud of the bass reaches them
he puts a hand on her shoulder
she pushes it off
and she loses it
flies at him slapping clumsily
like an enraged child
martin grabbing her
holding her tight
bodies pressed together
as her anger and fear and grief dissolve into sobbing
his family is in africa
the money will just stop coming
theyll never know why
martin calming her stroking her head
her hand finding his gripping it tight wanting the contact
martin looking down at the face buried in his chest
feeling versus memory
a long beat
her control returning
and her strength
she separates from him
you saved my life
you never know what you will do until the time comes right
martin looks down unsure
she stays on his face
her eyes shift a young serbian manager speaks with a female bartender
both cool young tough
gina makes eye contact heads nod in recognition
martin watches her go speak with them through low light and smoke
his gaze wander
into the strobing lights
its snow drifting down
settling on a small idyllic home
lights glow inside
liz sits on the edge of a bed glass of red wine in her hands
martin enters the frame his clothing and hands covered in drywall dust
are you ready
liz rubs dust off his face leans in to kiss him
martins eyes flick open and the sound and light of the club come flooding back in
low moving lights pass across her body wifebeater undershirt and jeans
she unzips the jeans pulls them down long legs pulls off the wifebeater no bra
looks back sees that martin is watching her
lights catch glimpses of her body her breasts the arch of her back
she turns slightly away from him pushes a pile of borrowed clothing towards him
a heavy coat some jeans
put these on
she pulls a mod shirt on glances back as he now undresses
were you happy
he looks up shirt in his hands
she doesnt waiver
was it happy
i think so
i dont remember
how it felt exactly
she approaches him leans in so she can see his eyes
so why would she do this to you
for the same reason i would
if i thought it was the only way to protect her
gina nods distant
martin presses on difficult
i keep having a dream
liz is in the bedroom of our home although its different somehow
her hairs different
shes smiling about to say something
then it ends
i can remember places details
i just cant remember
how i felt
just the low pulsing beat from the other room the lights revolving over them
gina watching him
looking back at her
that connection again
he looks away
she shakes it off produces a borrowed joint offers it to him
he shakes his head no
she shrugs sparks it
inhales deeply eyes close
she leans back
youll need to get out of town
theres a man whos helping me
he can seems to ignore him in bosnia
it was not like you probably imagine
it was nice
there were cherry blossoms
one day i was sixteen
my sister and my brother came to me and said hey lets play hide and seek down by the creek
he had ten marka for whoever won
it was amazing the way he just said it
she raises the joint hits it again
her eyes open but shes deep in the memory and its intense
so i went down to this place i knew under the small bridge over the creek
and i hid and waited
not really that long
then i went back home to find my brother and collect my money
he and my father and my uncle were dead
and so was my mother
my sister was alive
for a little while
she turns her head eyes blaze straight at martin
it was not enough to kill us
they wanted us to remember every day for the rest of our lives
no one touched me
im not going anywhere
im not running anymore
she nestles in under his arm
closes her eyes
he lets his hand gently stroke her hair
i wont let anything happen to you
say it again
ill protect you
she opens her eyes again looks up at him smiles on her way to sleep
gina sleeps at peace
martin leans over the one object he has left his copy of horticus
he studies the number markings on the flap working
vast windowless cylindrical building on the citys edge
cheering crowd a sound like thunder
a massive indoor stadium cyclists racing on a reverberating wood track below a suspended lighting rig the size of a spaceship
martin at the counter of a busy bar
jeans t shirt bomber jacket
different look to say the least
across the bar gina nurses a coffee
they exchange looks briefly
a familiar grey skinned figure settles next to him jurgen
thank you for coming
martin glances around edgy
jurgen watches him glances at gina long enough to let martin know hes spotted her
you know the most dangerous man in the world is the man who feels that he is drowning
he will drag under anyone who tries to help him
jurgen sets his newspaper on the bar
a picture and article about the murdered nurse
martins picture fuzzy
nods bitter i
i didnt do it
jurgen studies him hard
looks back at gina
you said you had something
martin feels in his pockets takes out the copy of horticus turns to the numbers on the end papers
these numbers are a code
the first number refers to the page of a given book
the second to a specific line on that page
the third number to words on that line
if i didnt have the exact edition of the book the code would be unbreakable
nodding impressed and what do the numbers refer to
thats where it breaks down the words are the latin names of two plant species
and umbellularia californica
and california bay
both common flowering plants
not part of your work
or professor bresslers
martin shakes his head
the one you sent bressler
what was the title
the role of gorytini and thynnidae in drakea pollination
and it was after reading it that he invited you here
look did you ever know someone called laurence darnell
martin looks at him quizzically
shakes his head
he was a graduate student at the university of wisconsin
he died in an auto accident earlier this year
he was doing research very similar to yours
jurgen studying him closely
martin shakes his head
what is professor bresslers relationship with prince fahad
fahads sponsoring the forum bresslers the keynote speaker
so theyre not close
in a way
bressler wants to end world hunger
universal access to all his data on crop cultivation
but fahads just a businessman
theyre both progressives
fahad knows well need food long after oil
new agricultural patents are worth billions
but his progressiveness has cost him
his own people hate him
the attempts on his life
hes got balls thats for sure
jurgen slides the uncle sam bookmark card from the pages of the horticus
turns it over martins remembered schedule scribbled on the back
theres a cocktail party before bresslers speech tonight
its in our suite
champagne and hors doeuvres for bressler and a few of his guests
is fahad going to be there
bressler invited him
martin trails off
starting to get there
with just a few guests in a confined space with prince fahad
for some that might be a very good reason to want to be you
you cant jurgen flips his notebook shut
i need a few more hours
you need to go somewhere you will not be seen
then meet me outside the cafe adler on the kochstrasse
martin and gina thread their way through streets teeming with african and middle eastern immigrants music blasting from storefronts
an electronics store
in the window a muted tv flickers with the news a report on the hospital murder
gina glances around
a cop up the street
we have to go
we have to do what jurgen said stay out of she starts to pull him away but hes not moving
hes staring at the pre paid cell phones on display
jurgen may have nothing
beat to her i need your help
liz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt putting on makeup
the rooms shower is on
close as she applies mascara
the camera searches her face her small gestures looking for clues
in deep focus behind her martin b comes out of the bathroom nude
he picks a robe up off the bed pulls it on as he approaches her places his hands on her shoulders
they stare at each other in the vanity mirror
martin b picks up the phone
yes hello dr
this is else adlam from dr
bressler was wondering if you might be able to meet with him today
gina dressed in the modish cap and shades on a new pre paid no i dont know but he stressed it was important
eleven oclock if thats all right
weinhaus huth on tiergarten
she closes the phone
across from her martin a cap pulled low over his features
he opens another phone dials
yes hello this is dr
i have a message for dr
jurgen hands over a library card
a librarian finds his request slip slides two documents across the counter
one a printed monograph the other a photocopy in brads
he finishes reading the printed monograph
looking down at the cover
the role of gorytini and thynnidae in drakea pollination by martin harris phd
he slides the bound photocopy next to it
the process of drakea pollination by laurence darnell university of wisconsin
a long beat
the two titles side by side
jurgen takes something out of his pocket the card that was inside martins horticus
the scribbled schedule notations on one side
turns it over the bowling alleys uncle sam logo
jurgen holds closer studying it
his mind clicking
printed german text
and right at the bottom a small time clock stamp
martin and gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals near the entrance to berlins equivalent of central park and its zoo
across the weinhaus restaurant is a fin de siecle style brasserie bordering the avenue
she loves polar bears
i never knew exactly why
gina nods looks over to the restaurant
looks back at martin who hasnt moved
she checks her watch
youre going to be late for your date
martin nods heads into the park
long curving paths bordered by green
gina watches sunglasses on as a taxi pulls up and a wiry haired man steps out pays the driver
lap top bag over his shoulder
another taxi arrives liz and martin b get out
this shouldnt take long
i just need to see what bressler wants
lizs gaze settles on the painted sign for the zoo
take your time i want to see the zoo anyway
memory or nostalgia touch her cool face
i love the polar bears
martin b nods watches her go
he checks his watch and heads inside
gina doing her best to casually window shop at a designer storefront
stolen glance across the street
the waiter offers to take bresslers lap top bag
bressler politely declines him
the waiter nods leaves
bressler opens the computer bag checks on the lap top inside
zips it back up
positions the bag by his elbow
smiles to martin b
i thought we might have a table for three in case you still had your alter ego with you
no thank god
i assume hes safely back in the hospital
well its a lesson
you never know what people will do
all my work used to be on line my e mails on an open server
a year ago someone broke into my office and stole my computer
i believe they were after my research
luckily i split my data up and double encrypt it until i put it all together and make it public
thats why this stays with me until tonights over
martin b nods starts to look at his menu
now what was so important that it could not wait until this evening
on martin b realizing hes been played
a single blink
when he looks up hes cool
i hope you can forgive me
it was something you said
its been tormenting me
under the table
martin b has his phone out and is texting blind
smith sits on a bench near a pond tossing bread crumbs to ducks
his phone chirps he checks it and is moving
gina ducks into a store doorway
takes out her cell phone
the other cell phone in martins hand
he answers it
they just sat down
martins gaze doesnt waiver
up ahead of him glimpsed through the crowds
he follows watching transfixed
clatter of falling pins
uncle sam logo
juke box elvis serenading desultory daytime bowlers
jurgen hands the ticket from martins book to a bored attendant
she goes away
returns a moment later with a purple bowling tote bag
plonks it on the counter
rips off a ticket counterfoil
checks the time stamp
thatll be twenty five euros
jurgen pays her picks up the bag
parents buying tickets
excited kids push through the turnstiles under the gilded elephants of the entrance
liz buys a ticket
passes beneath the elephant gate
martin starts to move forward
then doubles back as smith arrives hurrying again checking his phone
he pushes to the front of the line pays his way in eyes searching
martin moves out behind him hat pulled low
watchful staff soothing music
gina at a rack of dresses anxiously looks out of the window staring at martin b and bressler in the restaurant a silent heated exchange
bressler in high form reacting no
youre focusing on the science but this
patting his laptop this is history
you open the research before its finished the conglomerates gobble it up
in the entire history of human development name me one time when business has ever acted except in its own self interest
martin b catches a waiters eye signals for the check
bressler catches this looks to martin b questioning
im sorry its my fault
another appointment i forgot
it doesnt matter
jumping back in but see you you say i am too cautious
its an idiot thing to say
im a realist
liz wanders past some flamingos checks a sign heads in another direction
behind her martin keeps his distance keeps his eyes on smith whos shadowing liz one path over
martin b standing
bressler collecting his bag and scarf
im sorry if i offended you dr
i just dont be stupid
you cant offend me
we are colleagues this is good discussion
but please dr
harris power is an animal all to itself
it adapts mutates to whatever form will best preserve it
its always closer than we know
on martin b extending a hand
perhaps youre right
gina crossing the street searching the restaurant windows the table empty busboy gathering up plates
bressler outside the restaurant getting into a taxi
no sign of martin b
pulls out her phone
liz following the winding path lower as it descends
the sound of a cell phone ring
liz glances back
martin pressed out of sight against a wall
he silences his phone tucks it away
martin b striding through the park toward the zoo
gina way behind trying to catch up
dials again martins phone going straight to voicemail
her slim shoulders her hair tucked into a scarf against the rain silhouetted in front of an underwater view
the giant polar bear swims inches in front of her
her eyes soft
which fades as she senses a presence
standing across from her in this protected space
a strange numbness
doesnt know where to start
just that syllable
she stares back features tense
what are you doing here
youre crazy you have to leave me alone
i have to know why liz
are they making you do this
are they threatening you
how did you find me
the polar bears
i know you liz
you know me
lizs eyes fixed on his
she searches his face
a long beat
her facade seems suddenly to crumble
you cant what
cant get out
theyll kill me
smiths path has veered him away from lizs
frustrated hes a little lost
his eyes play over the entrance to the lower area other women also with umbrellas
martin b waiting in the ticket line at the gates
gina approaches breathless
sees martin b
hangs back from the ticket line
spots a large party of school kids
gina steps past the line confidently joins the group
just another parent
swept through the turnstiles
behind her martin b steps up to the ticket window
what are they making you do
is it about fahad
i cant answer that
come with me right now
we can no
theyll kill us both
who are they
she shakes her head tormented
not until were safe
then ill explain everything i promise
all i want is for us to get out alive
you have to believe me
urgent look around
her eyes lock on his
she closes on him
a wave of emotion as shes almost in his arms her hands on his face searching his eyes
it got left behind
at the airport
thats why you were going back there
you need to find it
in an hour theres a chance for me to get away
meet me at the airport at three oclock
we can run together
eyes suddenly catching gina walking right by
moments urgent eye contact
martin bs here
hes on his way
what can he do
he knows he cant stay
suddenly liz moves her face to his
kisses him on the lips
i love you
martin steps back slowly
their eyes hold
then he turns walks quickly away
behind the glass of the penguin exhibit
she saw the kiss
cuts up a small path rising up from the polar bear area
at the top he turns hiding himself looking back
smith and martin b converge from opposite directions on liz speak at her close heated
smith pops open his phone
martin b glares at liz almost pushing her back against the glass
she glares back up at him
nothing he can do now
he turns away moves to the top of the path where gina waits for him
they walk in silence
martin doesnt acknowledge
each face a mix of emotions
a light rain
jurgen crosses the street to his building carrying the bowling bag
the phone on his desk starts ringing
no one to pick up
martin and gina hurry across the street
cellphone to martins ear
listening to it ring
jurgen lumbers asthmatically up the stairs
gets to the fourth floor
sound of the phone ringing above
trudges up the last flight
phone stops ringing just as jurgen reaches the top
he stops wheezing
an envelope propped against the door
he picks it up
thumbs it open
takes out from the security camera at airport immigration
a couple at a desk
liz and martin
hears the phone start ringing again inside his apartment
fumbles in his pocket for the key
jurgen grabs the phone
is that ernst jurgen
yes it is
my names rodney cole
you left a message on my phone
there were two from martin as well
what kind of trouble is he in
trains rumble and whoosh
hurried commuters pushing past
rodney cole hes the academic colleague weve seen in martins memory flashes an avuncular man about ten years martins senior
talks on a cell phone oh my god
thats unbelievable the poor man
well heres the good news ive just arrived in berlin
yes ive been teaching in leipzig at the hochschule fur technik
i came up for the last day to hear bresslers speech
ill come right over its not far
no its no problem
i appreciate it herr cole
puts the phone down
another look at the airport scans of martin
studying them a moment
jurgen opens the bowling bag up ends it onto the table
bowling shoes a shirt a hand towel
taking a knife from the counter jurgen cuts around the bottom of the bag
lifts away a false floor
the contents hidden from us
a shadow of tension crosses his face
then a slow enigmatic smile
the mournful howl of its whistle
jurgen turns off the gas
spoons nescafe into a mug
opens a closet reaches over a musty clutter of jars and boxes
finds a rusted sugar tin
inside is a single ancient sachet of sweetener
a beat pensive
he tears it open adds it to the nescafe
he looks up
the lively knock at his door
jurgen opens the door
its rodney cole grinning
shaking rain from his coat
please come on in
jurgen ushers him in
leads them into the living room
ive a bottle labelled brandy which is more than likely hair lacquer
or some vodka my neighbor gave me after it made her husband go blind
no thank you
maybe some coffee
im making some for myself
cole looks around the tiny apartment
sees the framed photos on the mantel
you were in the military
in east germany
wow wait till i tell my son
he loves all that cold war stuff
look at that car
what is that
suspension of a donkey cart and smelt like a tannery
vanished as quickly as the wall
cole studies the other pictures
notices martins rolex beside them
jurgen pours the kettle into his mug
this business with martin
a hell of a thing
how did he find you
quite by chance as it happens
sounds like he was damn lucky
so what can i do to help
come with us to the authorities
help them confirm his identity
jesus its that bad
a guy comes to you with a story like that
what made you take the case
is that all
theres not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me
coles face tightens
his back still toward jurgen
a few questions i still think over
one in particular
from when i worked for the aufklarung our foreign intelligence wing
cole still hasnt moved
discreetly slips open a button on his jacket
jurgen cradles his coffee steam rising
there was this rumor
of a us based assassination unit called section
theyd work for whoever would pay public sector private sector
second to none in their planning and efficiency
they never failed
whats more they were invisible
theyd strike and nobody would even know there had been foul play
it was only rumor of course
cole turning to face jurgen
glint of a gun inside his packet
jurgen looking steadily back at him
takes a deep gulp of coffee
you had fifteen minutes after i called
why didnt you run
where would i run from section mr
i can hardly walk
the edge of a smile another large gulp of the coffee
jurgen sets down the cup
before i could get chesterfields i smoked sixty machorkas a day
filthy soviet things
killed more russians than stalin
my doctors assure me ill soon be joining their list of casualties
cole looking back at him impassive
i want to know how he found you
i want every number every source youve contacted on his behalf
and then what
we shake hands and you go away
cole reaches a hand inside his jacket
theres no need for that
coles eyes flicker
jurgens body tightening
the empty sachet of sweetener
cole looks at jurgen
a moments glimmer of respect
he doesnt move
his gaze lingering
you never think
youll have the courage to use it
but we do
the best of us
jurgen coughs again
puts a hand out to steady himself
knocking over the mug of coffee
as the cyanide sweeps through him
trembling hands clasp the edge of table
his piercing eyes never leaving cole
through the pain tell me
if he remembers everything
jurgens hands slip
he slumps forward his head hammering down onto the table
a final convulsion
then hes still
a long beat
cole buttons his jacket
slips on some gloves
gently lifts jurgens head from the table top rests it on a forearm as though jurgen were asleep rather than dead
restoring some dignity to him
cole goes to the mantel wipes off the one framed photo he picked up
takes martins rolex drops it into his pocket
he turns casting an expert eye over the apartment
the legs of the stove
ever so slightly askew
the phone rings
cole ignores it moves forward
martin hits re dial on his cell
the phone ringing and ringing
he flips it shut
ginas eyes meet his
a long beat
she looks back out the window
sleeting rain streaks the glass
endless grey city scape
he tracks a clock
looks back at gina who senses his gaze keeps hers straight out
he finds a section of loose kick board
carefully pries it away
reaches into the hole the photograph of martin and liz arriving
and jurgens notebook
he turns up the gas feeds the photograph to the flames
as he watches it burn he leafs carefully through the notebook
cathedral like overcrowded
carts loaded with luggage
watchful police and security
martin and gina heads down under caps navigate a surge of passengers rushing out of the doors clutching bags competing for taxis in the pouring rain
deja vu overload
his fractured memories
past and present merging
an airport security man glances over concerned
gina tracks the attention moves into martin fake romantic her face close to his
gina touching his face
bringing him back
he glances to a clock on the wall
martin and gina wait at a counter
a woman returns with a leather briefcase
a name tag on the handle
martin stares at it
reaching for memories
the woman checks her computer
may i see some identification
she looks up
martins expression distant
he doesnt have any
he was in an accident thats why the bag was unclaimed
for the lock
the woman and gina both looking at martin
the woman enters the numbers
the locks pop open
she lifts the lid picks something up
then her expression softens
she turns it toward martin
filled with personal effects
sitting on top a us passport
a long beat
martins hands unsteady as he opens it
and his name
doctor martin harris
noisy and busy
watching martin as he carefully examines each item in the case
everything familiar yet strange
his but somehow not his
a copy of scientific american magazine a comb some gum a newark airport parking ticket
his published paper the same edition jurgen found at the library
his leather wallet
martin studies it
identical to the one martin b had
new hampshire drivers license
martin fumbles inside a pocket pulls out
the exact same photo we saw in bresslers lab of a younger liz with a younger martin b in paris
except this time its a younger martin beside liz in the photo
gazing at it
he runs his fingers over its dock eared corners every bump and crease
looks up to find gina watching him
a long awkward pause
she reaches over
takes the photo from him
can you remember now
how you felt
martins silence hangs in the noise and activity around them
gina handing back the photo
he stares down at liz again as gina stands start to collect her things
we shouldnt stay here its not safe for you
her voice trails off as she looks at martin really sees him in this moment
he looks up at her torn back down at the pictures the relics of his life his memories spread out in front of him
he glances at the clock
gina tracks his gaze
gets it takes a step back
im an idiot
shes meeting you here
martin meets her gaze open book
shes my wife
shes in danger
i have to nodding auto pilot thats good
im happy for you
i have to go
i meant what i said
we can take care of you
i can get you money arrange stop
youve got what you wanted
you dont need me anymore and in case weve forgotten i take care of myself very well
she starts for the door
martin getting up
gina stops turns
one kiss and suddenly
everything thats happened
i know shes your wife
like i said im an idiot
she turns away again
martin frozen watches her go
gina keeps walking
roar of traffic
no look back
she joins the line waiting for taxis
martin still sitting there
the photo of him and liz in paris
sudden decision snaps the briefcase shut
gina almost at the head of the taxi line
a glance back
no sign of martin
martin out of the doors
eyes frantically searching for gina
in the distance
he sees her
gina at the front of the line
a taxi pulls up
she steals a last look back at the terminal
ginas face suddenly lighting up
she can see martin
spins back to the taxi driver
theres another passenger
martin weaving quickly through the crowds toward her
bumps past a man who looks back his face lighting up
martin hesitates turns
martin stares at him bewildered
jesus martin how are you doing
what are you doing here
you called me remember
you left a message on my machine
but how did you know
cole suddenly right up close
presses a rolled newspaper into martins side
cold steel of a concealed qun
stay one step ahead of me
any move ill shatter your spine
his voice flat with menace
martins mouth opening
martin glancing round
cole jerks him back guiding him toward the passenger pick up zone
gina looking back around
martin vanished again in the crowd
then a sudden stab of alarm
a man she doesnt know carrying his case
headed toward a parked commercial van
driver waiting for them
she recognizes him
martin hustled into the back
van door shuts
a voice snaps us
standing in front of gina losing patience
i aint got all day
points to a suitcase a few yards away
help me with my bags please
the driver goes to fetch the case
is stopped by its owner
the squeal of tires
the taxi driver spins around to see gina gone and his own taxi pulling away
he yells after her furious
but shes off in traffic
cole opposite him with the gun impassive
interior goes dim as smith takes a hard right into an abandoned parking structure taking a ramp spiraling up
dart between cole and smith
struggling to make sense of things
cole studying him in quiet amazement
shakes his head
thinking out loud
youre completely gone
you really think you are martin harris
what the hell rod
youre my oldest friend
you know who i am
its not that other guy
hes not martin harris
hes the guy who took over for you after you went missing
exasperated cole leans forward
spelling it out
but youre not martin harris either
there is no martin harris
martin staring at him
martin harris doesnt exist
you invented him
hes your legend
a fiction you created
you made him up as a cover to get bressler to invite you to the conference
liz she liz
how do you think she feels about all this
you two were a good team then you go and get norman fucking rockwell on her
they arent real memories
dont you get it
martin harris is a fabrication
but youve one and filled in the caps invented a whole damn life for him
they could write a textbook about you
refusing to believe
the van screeches to a stop smith gets out pops the doors
the distant sound of the city traffic a light wind whistling
gina driving through traffic searching no sign of the van
then her gaze locking across the river four stories up on a parking garage the white van
she hauls the wheel over taxi sliding through a u turn
martin is tossed out onto the asphalt
picks himself up trying to orient
the structure abandoned broke
no side rails just pavement to the edge
trash and graffiti everywhere
cole approaches losing it now
boiling with rage all that studying
hell you even had us take out that kid after we ripped off his thesis
a year of prep and you try to screw it up
we do everything to bring you back in but you go on trying to screw it up
do you know how much time youve wasted
its thanksgiving for christs sake
i should be eating turkey with my kids not here cleaning up after some wacko who bumps his head and decides his cover storys for real
staring back at him
who am i
cole shakes his head pats him on the cheek
you were my best boy
suddenly cole slams a fist into martins stomach
martin doubles over
cole whips the gun across his face
kicks him again
martin on his hands and knees spits blood
cole glaring down at him
smith covers martin as cole moves into the van empties out a junkies works dropper with needle bottle top cotton balls lighter
expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin
draws it into the syringe glancing back look at you now
a no one
just another dead junkie
streak of concern as the sound of tires screeching reaches them
cole looks up in time to see ginas taxi rounding the ramp accelerating towards them
smith steps forward gun raised firing
gina ducks as bullets pierce the front windscreen
the image of smith firing grows large
taxi catches smith carrying into the van crushing him as the two vehicles slide towards the edge
cole is hurled across the van like a rag doll his legs are crushed between buckling rows of seats as
the van slides with the taxis impact
front wheels pushed off the garage edge
teeters see sawing
gina scrambles from the wrecked taxi
runs toward martin lying on the ground
pulls martin away arm around him
martin breaks free walks unsteady to the rear of the van locks eyes with cole trapped clawing towards the back
martin puts a hand out
and takes his briefcase
is it true
caught the van teetering
sneers at martin starts to speak
eyes go wide as
falling off the edge smiths body going with it
a moment of calm silence and then crunch
a dull sick crash as the van hits below
stares down at the wreck
gina comes up touches his shoulder
he turns moves
she chases after him
vehicles hiss over the bridge
gina catches up to martin
her voice straining above the traffic martin
martin whats wrong
we were going to meet
i have to see him
weve got to go
weve got to get out of here
i have to
blood streaking in the rain
a long beat
gina takes a deep breath
a cafe looking onto the kochstrasse checkpoint charlie
rain mists the windows
two figures sitting in the shadows
martin and gina
he stares down lost shivering not from the cold
he glances up lost looks away
gina takes his hand in hers presses it to her lips
places it against the skin of her neck and collar bone
stares at him
he looks up
from far away he told me im one of them
the things he said
the things he said ive done
beat anguish how can i be that person
listen to me
martin looking up at her lost
his eyes back to the clock on the wall
martin closes his eyes
gina reaches out
hes not coming
a long beat
he nods heavy hearted
as they stand to go
a figure peering around anxiously
frau brunner jurgens neighbor breathless determination as she hurries over
the bowling tote b in her hands
she thrusts it at martin talking rapidly and urgently in german
shes sorry shes late
she says jurgen gave it to her
he said that youd know
that martin harris would know what to do
slowly almost dazed martin takes the bag
frau brunner looking at him intently still talking
herr jurgen told her to wish you good luck
that it was a pleasure knowing dr
martin looks at her nods slowly
frau brunner nods
then she turns bustles away out the door into the rain
martin looks at gina
in the half light of the cafe window he unzips the bag
digs down pushing them aside
the floor of the bag neatly cut out
a hidden compartment
thick roll of bills
euros us dollars swiss francs
and two passports
he takes one out flips it open
an entry stamp berlin
finds the photo page
but fair haired and in horn rimmed glasses
a canadian citizen
the second passport
with short dark hair
the liz from his recurring memory
liz towels short dark hair
door of a hotel bathroom
embroidered on the towel
now visible in detail hotel imperial
his chair falling
gina moves to help he pushes her away
leave me alone
he stumbles away pushing towards the bathroom
martin lurches in locks it goes to the small sink stares at himself in the mirror
the door to the eisenhower suite bedroom
moving through the suite
towards the bathroom
he puts hand out against the memory covers his reflection
his eyes stare back at him all the same
liz towelling short dark hair
she smiles up
are you ready
and martin enters the frame hair cut and colored differently
theres drywall dust on his hands and clothing
as he leans to kiss her we continue
into the bathroom
to a wall beside the shower
panels cut away exposed plumbing
something integrated into the wall behind the pipes
circuits and wires
diii video timer connected to a high tech detonator
shaking his head knowing
tears streak he wipes them away hard
his fingers find his shirt pull it open
stares at his own body in the mirror
fingers trace a scar across his chest a healed knife wound
three small raised bumps on his torso healed bullet wounds
his breath flows out of him
gina uncertain with the passport
looking at the small photograph of tim carmichael
notices martins paper in the case the one he was reading on the airplane
she removes the document
opens to the end
a biography of sorts
martin harris principle biography
married to elizabeth terman august
father died sept of a heart attack
encouraged scientific study from an early age
i made him up
i made him up to kill a man ive never met
gina starts puts the paper down
martin is at the table looking down at her
his emotions sick his gaze rotten
the entry stamp in your passport
you were in berlin three months ago
martin like a statue
prince fahad is going to be assassinated today
theres a bomb in the suite
i put it there
a long beat
ginas eyes meet his brief scared
martin stuffs the cash back in the bag
grabs her by the arm propels them both outside
martin pushes them into the alley next to cafe jams the bag into her arms
get out of berlin
gina shaking her head
take it and go
get as far away from me as you can
im not leaving you
listen to me maybe youre not the man who went into the water
but you are the man i pulled out
martin staring into his reflection on the wet street
martin theres no way you can show your face at the hotel
everyone is looking for you
martin lurches up at gina
he slams her back against the brick wall his hand around her neck cutting off her air literally lifting her feet off the ground
look at me
look at me
gina sputters tries to draw air
her eyes lock on his
is this what you want
is this the person you still want to help
you should have let me drown
she sputters eyes start to roll back in her head losing consciousness
martin releases and she drops in the dirt water of the alley hands and knees gasping for breath
martin stares down at her
he picks up the bag drops it in front of her face
pure instinct and adrenaline
gina grabs the bag stumbles across the street horns blare as cars swerve to avoid her
and shes gone
he waits at street corners crosses with lights moves through the city
martin stands at the broken railing where ginas taxi plunged into the water seven days ago
the tire marks are there
the railing is half repaired half taped off
he stares down into the oily black water toes near the edge
then his knees give
he sits hard his hands moving uselessly almost on their own
tears flow freely
sobs rack his body
to where gina stands hidden in shadows
shes followed him here
now frozen watching him suffer
lit up for the big night
taxis and limos pulling in
in the lobby beautiful people mingle with the celebrities of science
herr strauss scans the crowd watchful
two attentive security guards scan monitors roll through different views of the hotel
on monitors crowds pass through security on their way into the conference room
outside a line of mercedes pulling up
fahad entering the building surrounded by his entourage of security and beautiful women
the same entrance martin was led by before
two bellhops wearing only t shirts enjoys smokes in the crisp night air
one tosses the butt reaches for his jacket
martin buttoning the last button of the jacket moves into the hotel
no longer lost
here to make amends
prince fahad flanked by his entourage arrives at the door to the eisenhower suite
hum of a party from within
liz opens the door
were honored you could attend this evening
kissing her hand the honor is all mine
liz beams gestures him into the room filled with a dozen or so notable guests
martin b engrossed in a conversation
look i probably have it somewhere
perhaps my wife bressler held at the door by fahads security searching his pockets for an invitation
very un german of me
to his security i dont think the professor needs an invitation
he is after all the reason we are all here
bressler steps in takes lizs outstretched hand
he looks her up and down
matter of fact
now i can see why somebody would pretend to be martin
liz laughs her face lighting up
then chillincj as bresslers two daughters appear behind him smiling shy
i didnt realize the girls were coming this evening
but of course
lily and laurel are the real reason any of us put up with leo at all
fahad bends down and the girls run to him a familiar face
fahad hoists one up takes the other by the hand
looking to martin b who stares back cool
liz nods accepting the casualties
she takes bresslers coat reaches for his computer bag
let me take these
bressler hesitates a moment then lets go
just leave it there if you could
he gestures to a sideboard in open sight
she turns hangs up his coat
as she does so
her fingers slip inside the laptop bag
slide a tiny bluetooth connection card into the computers bus port
liz turns away
moves down the hall towards
weve seen in martins flashes
a timer vamped from a digital video recorder
a sleeping monster
the security guard on the monitors squints watches a bellhop moving down a hall
something about the way he moves
zooming in on him
german subtitled where is herr strauss
liz closes and locks the door
sits at the desk at another laptop firewire plugged into a linksys antenna
lizs fingers tap the keyboard
the desk top divides in two
files headlined in german bresslers computer
password blank pops up
liz opens a new copy of horticus to a marked page
finds the words
types in calochortus albus
another password blank flashes up
liz types umbellularia californica
screen blanks then refreshes
padlock icon gone
liz quickly drags them across to her desktop
spinning egg timer symbol
elevator doors open letting out a few guests and martin
an arrow indicates eisenhower suite
he starts to move clearing a corner up ahead the entrance to the suite
the wind taken out of him as four burly men in suits scoop him by his arms
egg timer disappears
file transfer complete
liz shuts the laptop
slips it in a case
she picks up the remote control for the suites plasma tv
selects menu thumbs in a ten digit code
points the remote at the wall
bresslers daughters shyness gone play hide n seek amidst the grown ups
bressler steps away from fahad heads over to his computer
stops as liz comes out of the bedroom
checking on your baby again
i cant help it
why dont you just wear it
as a nerdy accessory
here turn around
liz picks up the bag
adjusts the strap
slipping out the bluetooth
places the bag over bresslers shoulders
elevator doors open on an elegant couple who step forward revealing
gina at the back at the elevator
shes transformed an elegant designer dress plunging neckline
as she moves forward toned legs flash from a high slit in the dress
shes graceful beautiful heads turn
martin is pushed roughly into a chair facing a displeased herr strauss
a guard handcuffs his wrist to the chair
youre not listening
there is a bomb in the eisenhower suite
i put it there
but isnt that the suite you are staying in dr
or wait youre not dr
ive told you
theres no time to explain this
strauss rises starts to turn away
martins gaze lands on one of the video monitors
eyes lock p
on the monitor gina beautiful approaching the eisenhower suite
i can prove it
pull up your lobby recordings from august of this year
strauss startled by the ferocity in martins voice
do it or many people will die
im not lying
strauss nods to one of his technicians who starts to type into a console
gina reaches the door to the suite stopped by security
she meets the guards gaze with cool superiority
her eyes flick to fahad across the room
are you serious
why dont you ask the prince
the guard hesitates unsure
its all she needs
she moves by him into the room
gina quickly takes in the suite
far away bressler and fahad engrossed in conversation
one of bresslers daughters lily peeking out from under a table
at the bar martin b drinks in his hands turning towards her
she turns towards a picture window watches the reflection
makes eye contact with liz across the room she heads towards the back
he begins to follow
he looks back to the picture windows
martin sweating nervous eyes flicking to the monitors as the technician brings up the reception video starts fast forwarding through footage
images go by almost too fast
what exactly are you hoping to find
martin ignores him his eyes tracking
fahad finishes a joke
martin b still scanning the room
gives up turns to meet liz already there with their computer case and a sportsbag
she hands him the sportsbag they wordlessly leave through the rear door
unseen by anyone a monitor shows liz and martin b entering an emergency stairwell hurrying
martins eyes scan
the technician freezes the image a dapper couple checking in
he wears a sportsjacket light haired horn rimmed glasses
shes got short dark hair
strauss leans in sensing it
gina approaches bressler and prince fahad intense urgent
fahads security reads her expression grabs her arm
youre in danger here
there is a bomb in this room
bressler and the prince look over confused interested
and fahads security acts
a gun lined on gina pushing her back
two men grab the prince pushing back other guests hustle him toward the suites emergency exit
champagne crystal hors doeuvres and furniture flying
fahad in the middle looking back as hes swept out captive to his own security
the image rolls forward slowly the man at the counter kisses his wifes hair glances upwards
do you see
and then motion on the monitors the prince and his detail rushing down a corridor
german subtitled sound an alarm
evacuate the hotel
to of his men you and you youre with me
well meet the prince at the loading docks
to a guard you take him downstairs
strauss and his men flood out
the guard pulls keys starts to uncuff martin from his chair
martin b and liz stop in their tracks
doors opening above
sound of panicked guests pouring onto the stairs
hands martin b the computer takes the sportsbag from him
stop the timer
ill finish it
martin b nods takes the stairs back up two at a time shouldering his way past the folk streaming downward
guests press out
a german voice comes over speakers advising people to leave
gina moves towards the exit turns to see bressler standing in the middle of the room one daughter in his arms frantically searching for the second
gina at the table she saw lily at before lifts the tablecloth to find a frightened little girl staring back
its okay come on
the girl convinced swept into ginas arms
she and bressler head for the door each carrying a child
people doubling back down the stairs
automated evacuation announcements
guard begins to cuff one of martins arms
martin faces the monitors smiles as he sees fahads people meet up with strauss at the loading dock hustle fahad into a limousine
another monitor martin b rushing back upstairs
another monitor gina and bressler running into a corridor with the two girls
martin smiles a little relieved
he scans the many monitors locks onto liz moving down a corridor purposeful
fahad was never the target
you have to tell strauss
theyre after bressler
the guard shoves him against the console starts to cuff his other arm
martin lurches back both of them tumbling over
martin scrambles for the door
martin stumbles out into a crush of panicked stragglers ducks down lost in the press
moments after the guard appears at the door speaking into his radio
martin b rushes into the room
like pompeii a party abandoned
urgently searching for the remote
down on his hands and knees
looks at his watch
kicks at the wall
rips the heavy cistern lid off the top of the toilet
smashes it against the plaster
beginning to give
gina and bressler come out onto the floor with the girls heading to the bottleneck at the exits
liz moving purposefully towards the group closing her hand in the unzipped top of the sportsbag slung over her shoulder
glimpse of an oiled black uzi machine pistol
the other direction
martin appears handcuff dangling from one wrist
he scans frantic through the bottlenecked crowds
sees gina and bressler
martin starts forward ducks back as strauss re enters commanding his security
liz closes tracking finger flicks off uzis safety
martin is moving pressing through crowds
gina hears his voice cant find him through the crowds as next to her bressler comforts his daughters as behind them liz moves closer closer
suddenly seeing martin
a decision sudden shift
liz passes brushing gina lightly as she goes
gina registering the touch looks up at the woman walking away from her now recognizing martin pressing through the crowd towards her
ginas face lighting up
martin pushes by a group of people closing towards gina and suddenly liz is in his arms grasping him romantic
oh thank god youre here
martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him
one hand caressing his cheek
her other hand pressing a knife against his chest
seeing martin and liz embracing
liz still hugging him tight whispering hard her free hand sliding something metallic into his pocket
i just placed a gun in your jacket pocket
theres really only one person one right way to kill bressler now isnt there
the crazy man whose been stalking him the crazy man who pretended to be martin harris
oh and after youve shot him point the gun at the police
i wont do it
god youre weak
the martin i knew wouldnt have been able to go on living like you are
her eyes duck purposeful he tracks her gaze
sees the uzi in the sportsbag
ill kill them all
bressler the girls
your new girlfriend and whoever tries to stop me
look at it this way im giving you a chance to save most of them
you can be the hero
a kiss sexy
gina in the background taking a step back
ooops bet you wish you could explain that
times up martin
go finish what you came to berlin for in the first place
he turns walks
martin b has a small hole opened up
he can see the digital timer
jams his hand into the hole
trying to force it past the narrow opening
desperately feeling for the controls
martin on a suicide mission
walks in a daze towards gina bressler beyond
his hand moves into his pocket
gina stepping forward
he stares at her
tears in his eyes
strauss re enters commanding his security
stops as he recognizes martin mouths words to his men
martin b forcing his arm further
fingers reach the controls
search for the right one
his finger flips a small switch
martin b sighs breathes hard
holy shit that was close
martin and gina locked staring
her face a million questions
martin shakes his head turns away from her towards bressler his hand coming out of his pocket with the gun
in martins face horror deadly conviction
seeing the gun
weapons being drawn
also seeing the gun
a hand going out a scream building
bringing the vun up pointed at bresslers head perfect kill shot
finger on the trigger
martin b stands dusts off his coat starts to walk out of the bathroom
crunch he steps on something
a soft beep
he looks down reacts to the remote control
under his foot
as the bomb detonates
martin b atomized
sheets of flame bursting through windows
the blast rocks the room
people tumble chandelier falls
liz dives aside as a column slams down near her
sprinklers burst on
water rains down
main lights black out
beat then emergency lights come on
bressler clutching his daughters as security reaches them surrounding them searching for signs of martin
gina dazed bleeding picks herself up
searching the room for martin
food laden serving carts cook tops pots and pans knives
falling plaster and debris
liz walks through brisk angry
dress torn a cut across her forehead
she stops at a disposal chute disposes of the sportsbag
reaches high under her dress comes out with a knife starts to toss it as well
looks up into the distorted mirror of the stainless steel surface in front of her
to find martin there
bleeding hurt covered is debris but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands
be careful that might go off
she turns to face him
hair slicked clothes drenched
stunning despite everything five years as a team
and you end it like this
her hand almost casually moves back the knife still seated in her palm
martin tracks it steadies the gun
keep your hands where i can see them
groaning from the hotel structure
plaster and cables fall spark across the floor
martin flinches tries to keep steady
liz is steady cool
laughs a little
you know working with you
it almost wasnt work
we were so good
you were so good
at the job
at other things
she smiles a little warming
dont you want to know your real name
let go of the knife liz
dont you want to know y real name
dont you still want
she leans forward just a breath
warmth radiating martin stepping back
please just stop liz
her face reading him
his fear his uncertainty
she smiles just a little
liz throws the knife
martin fires as the blade sinks into him sending him reeling back onto the floor
his hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder screaming in agony as he rips it out looking up at
a soft distance in her face
a small hole in her chest just below her beautiful collar bone
her eyes find him focus smile
youll never know
youll never know who you are
a long beat
were not sure when exactly the life goes out of her eyes
finally martin pulls himself forward
gently closes her eyelids
police keeping people back
fire trucks everywhere jets of water fighting back the flames
a collective gasp
as the bomb damaged corner of the hotel starts to fold inward in a spray of dust and smoke
moves through the crowd anxiously searching the stream of people still pouring from the building
she jumps as a hand takes her arm
she stumbles back hands raised against him
fear betrayal love
him standing there empty bleeding
gut instinct wins
she takes a step towards him he pulls her tight to him
all he has
all he knows
bressler shaken oblivious that hes the epicenter and object of the destruction all around him
echoing chimes of a pa calling platforms
an espresso machine nearby
on screen cnn
the hotel imperial
day after shots of the blown out th floor
less than twenty four hours after the failed assassination attempt on the saudi prince
image switches to fahad seated in a press conference where bressler is speaking
nobel laureate professor leo bressler announced the development of a new strain of corn
fast growing self propagating drought tolerant and pest resistant
to be made available worldwide without patent or copyright costs
applauded the announcement while the dow jones saw agri business stocks plunge four percent
pull back from the tv
one of several in the central cafe area in
finding two figures nestled among the travelers
martin and gina seated close
the two of them gentle
getting used to peace
do you know
what you would have done
he looks back at her starts to speak
an announcement cuts through their train leaving
they stand move off
as we crane up slowly above the crowds streaming along a platform to board an inter europe express families business travelers soldiers on leave
another day in their lives
they say your whole life flashes before you
but its the little things
gina reaches out takes martins arm
draws him closer
i dont know who i am now what i would have done
but one things for sure
im not the man i was
and im going to try my best to find some sort of redemption for what he did
because maybe just maybe
slowly we lose them among the sea of bobbing heads
i can become the man i was always meant to be
