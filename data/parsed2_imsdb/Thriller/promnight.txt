written by william gray from a story by bob guza super april all is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny friday afternoon
cars idle in the driveway awaiting the three oclock onslaught of liberated children
two faded yellow buses stand ready
the lull is shattered by the clanging of the final bell
a swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses
moving slowly through the crowd robin and alex hammond nine year old identical twins appear at the doorway
attractive dark haired children they seem more sub dued than the others
as they walk quietly down the stairs robin lags behind staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby
he is nick mcbride eleven years old two grades ahead of robin and the most popular boy in school
the pretty girl laughing at his antics is kim hammond also eleven robins older sister
w w wheres d d daddy
hes got a meeting at the high school
were supposed to walk home with kim
sees robin watching the young couple shes too busy
lets go by ourselves
n n n no alex
lets w w wait
robin is staring at nick
alex looks understands
youre crazy im not waiting
he strides away
robins eyes remain on nick and kim
nick says something to kurt
she shakes her head and pains toward robin
robin quickly turns away as they look at her
when she glances back ki m is walking towards her and nick is bicycling away
okay lets go
the sisters start to walk across the lawn
y you like him
y you know
oh hes all right i guess
they walk on in silence with robin stealing glances at her big sister
are y y you g gonna m in marry him
robin smiles and takes kims hand
they walk along the road kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags
sud denly kim halts
robin looks up in surprise
debbie was gonna lend me her new record
look you go on home by yourself
tell mom ill be a little late
before robin can reply kim is hurrying away
robin watches her go then moves off alone breaking into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch
as she turns off the main road into a side street robin passes a construction site
the empty skeleton of a half finished apartment building looms up above the dark shade trees
hearing voices robin stops to investigate
the voices continue
robin moves closer peering through the tall bushes surrounding the lot
she sees nick playing in
the framework with three of his classmates
robin recognizes jude cunningham and kelly lynch as kims two best friends
the fourth child wendy richards is a dark haired girl domin eering and loud
as robin watches wendy jumps up onto the floor of the building
i want to play murder
whos the killer
youll never catch me
hide your eyes killer
as nick turns his back hiding his eyes against an ex posed beam the children scatter through the structure
robin watches with mounting excitement as nick finishes counting and whirls around
the killer is coming for you
he moves into the building chanting kill kill
in a low monotone
as he disappears from view robin cau tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the building
the killer strikes
robin hears judes squeal of laughter
nick has caught her
immediately judes voice takes up the kill chant in unison with nick
robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark gloomy structure
suddenly she hears a shriek
ter rified she backs against a wall
laughter follows im mediately and robin hears kellys voice taking up the chant
as the three killers move through the vast structure searching for wendy kill kilt echoes off the walls and hardwood floors
robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im mense unfinished lobby
ominous shadows slash across the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless chanting of the children
robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door
it slips off its temporary hinges crashing down to the floor
the noise is like a rifle shot suddenly there is absolute silence in the structure
petrified robin crouches behind a wall waiting
the chanting quickly resumes and she breathes a long sigh of relief
robin moves through a dark corridor hugging the walls
flushed with excitement she imagines herself a killer searching for wendy
as she moves past an empty room she hears a soft giggle
robin stops and listens care fully
once again she hears the giggle louder this time coming from nearby
stepping to a doorway she leans around the corner and peers inside
in the darkness she can see nothing
gathering her courage she quietly slips into the room
the room appears empty but a closet door is slightly ajar
as robin approaches she hears a faint gasp from behind her
whirling around she sees wendy crouched behind a cardboard box in the corner
you better not tell
before robin can react she hears a thud from above
looking up she sees nicks head appear through an opening in the ceiling
seeing robin then wendy standing in the corner he howls in triumph
here killers here
nicks head disappears from the opening and robin hears the pounding of running feet
now youve done it you idiot
the chanting grows louder as the killers rush towards the room
trapped wendy looks frantically for an es cape but finds nothing
turning around suddenly she grins at robin a cruel hard expression on her face
kill kill kill
picking up the chant wendy begins to advance on robin
terrified robin turns and rushes out of the room bowling over nick in the doorway
delighted that the game is continuing with a new victim he follows wendy in pursuit of robin
robin flees down the long dark corridor kill kill echoing in her wake
as she rounds a corner jude ap pears looming up in front of her
robin screams and sprints in the opposite direction
kelly leaps out of a doorway and grabs for her but robin swinging out blindly escapes the killer
darting into the large room robin collapses against a wall gasping for breath
as her eyes adjusts to the darkness she spies a rickety ladder extending through a hole in the floor to the basement below
stacked up right near the opening are several sheets of window glass
before robin can make a move towards the lad der she hears a horrible screech and wendy appears in the doorway a vicious look on her face
terrified robin begins to back away
n n n no
nick jude and kelly appear in the doorway chanting kill kill
moving quickly robin grabs the ladder and starts down into the basement careful not to knock over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening
peering into the pitch black basement robin hesitates
but as wendy and her fellow killers close in on her robin continues down the ladder
wendy rushes up and grabs the ladder
p p please
wendy grins and shakes the ladder
the chanting is deafening
robin hugs the wooden slats
wendy shakes even harder
nick moves around wendy to get a better look
he accidentally bumps the glass stacked next to the opening
the sudden movement is just enough to dislodge a razor sharp pane of glass and send it hurtling down directly at robin
the girls last scream catches in her throat as the glass slices through her neck
she is instantly decapitated
horrified wendy watches the glass and the body crash to the concrete basement floor
jude sobs loudly
nick can only stare in shock
finally he manages to speak
we gotta get somebody quick
nick starts to go
wendy instantly whirls grabs his arm
are you crazy
theyll put us in jail
confused nick cannot reply
the other girls grow silent
if we tell anyone theyll say its our fault
whod believe it was an accident
nick starts to protest
listen to me
well go home now and never ever tell anyone
theyll think it was an accident
one but us will ever know
she looks at each of them
they are still too numb to respond
everybody swear never to tell
wendy glares at jude
kelly looks from wendy to the mangled body and begins to whimper
the frightened girl looks up at wendy
i dont wanta go to jail
wendy turns to nick
at first he appears defiant ready to object but he wilts under her withering gaze
i wont tell
with a final glance down at robins mutiliated body wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the room
as their footsteps echo away across the hardwood floor there is a terrible silence
then starting very quietly more footsteps are heard this time a single person approaching the ladder from above
the foot steps stop and a deep black shadow falls across the ladder heavy breathing punctuates the oppressive quiet growing louder and more anguished
we slowly tilt up to the tortured features of raymond hammond robins father
a handsome dark haired man in his late thirties he teaches history at george winston high school
wracked with grief he stands near the opening in the floor and watches as two paramedics bring up the body of his daughter from the dark basement
a young policeman standing nearby raises the white sheet covering robins remains
hammond steps up and gazes at his daughters decapitated body
a look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes on his face what he sees he will never forget
paralyzed hammond barely hears the car pulling up in front of the construction site
he turns and looks out the window
a police officer is getting out of his car
walking around to the passenger side he opens the door for an attractive blonde woman in her mid thirties
vivian hanmond robins mother appears pale and haggard as she steps out of the car
kim and alex slowly climb out of the back with the police officer escorting her vivian and her children move toward the skeleton of a building
catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window vivian suddenly breaks
away from the police officer and runs inside the building
hammond moves quickly to the door grabbing his hysterical wife as she bursts into the room
where is she
where is robin
seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher vivian moans in anguish
struggling furiously she strains to break her hus bands hold but he is too powerful
they are both in tears shaking with grief when kim and alex step into the doorway
angrily why did you bring them here
vivian collapses burying her head in his shoulder and sobbing furiously but hammond pushes her out of the room
stay out in the hallway
kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to cry softly
alex takes his mothers hand and tries comfort her
the paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it out of the room
as they pass through the doorway into the corridor a corner of the sheet slips off robins corpse
before a paramedic can replace it the de capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family
alex is shocked
kim doesnt appear to realize what she sees
but vivians horror wells up in her throat bursting out in a deranged scream
another scream as throbbing disco music pulsates from a large portable radio sitting on a dresser
a young woman with long golden brown hair and a trim figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans
pull ing on a halter top she sways to the music
turn that music down
youre driving me crazy
turning around at the sound of her mothers voice kim hammond reaches for the volume control now eighteen she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open innocent quality
kim quickly finishes dressing whirling around the room to the pounding disco rhythm
giving her hair a few final strokes with a brush she gazes at a photograph of a young man stuck in her mirror
on the picture is written to kim the best on the floor
dancing that is
kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror
this one shows her sister robin taken a few days be fore the accident
her sadness passes as quickly as it came
gathering her textbooks she switches off the radio and exits
raymond and vivian hammond are just finishing break fast
the years have favored him except for a touch of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds he looks much the same way as we remember him
vivian however wears the strain of the past seven years in her gaunt drawn features and high strung manner
thumbing through his morning newspaper hammond steals quick glances at his wife
she does not look up at him but stares at the table toying with her spoon
reading the paper ill tell you vi im thinking of starting up an armed robbery course at the high school
ive got a feeling itd be popular
he smiles at his joke looks at her
she doesnt seem to have heard him
i just hope theres no trouble at the prom tonight
kim bursts into the kitchen interrupting her father with a kiss on the head
mmmm sounds like fun
and how is the next queen of the winston high junior senior prom
she leans over to kiss her mother
vivian automatical ly turns her cheek to kim without looking at her
we got any yogurt
fix yourself a good meal
youre getting awfully thin
kim and her father exchange glances
he shrugs whos your lucky escort tonight
you know daddy
ive been trying to forget
the boys too sure of himself
mom tell him
seven years ago today
hammond carefully folds his paper and places it on the table
affects a casual vi i made you an appointment with dr
vivian finally looks up at him
its this morning actually
sorry i forgot to mention it
youd better get ready
hes fitting you in early before his other
it doesnt help
you know that
vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch en before he can finish
with a glance at kim hammond hurries after his wife
going out through the swinging door he bumps into a young man just entering
alex now sixteen a tall slender boy casts a knowing look at kim
shakes his head then begins to rummage through the pantry pulling out a hostess vitikie
lopping down at the table he flips open his electronics book and begins to read
munching on his twinkie he swipes sips from kims glass of milk
have you got a date for tonight
his mouth crammed
full of twinkie alex mumbles his reply
i happen to know jude might be available
of course she is older but
alex almost chokes
cmon kimbo i may be hard up
besides shes funny and really smart
give you somebody to do equations with
anyway im in charge of the sound system tonight
not bad but its not romance
itll do for tonight
kim shoots him a look then backs off
if you get a chance dance with jude once or twice okay
he returns her glass of milk empty
any more milk
hammond and vivian are standing by the fireplace
his hand is on her shoulder
she faces the mantel her back to him
on the mantel is a small shrine to the memory oftheir dead daughter a framed photograph fresh roses two candles and a lock of her hair in a glass case
vivian does not move
finally after a long pause she turns toward her husband
her eyes filled with tears she nods
hammond is driving
vivian stares blankly out the win dow at the grimy city streets
sitting in the back kim and alex exchange uncertain glances
a tense si lence pervades
the hammonds car pulls up in front of a towering modern building
hammond cuts off the engine and turns to kim and alex
ill just be a minute
vivian is already reaching for the door handle alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his mother
taking her arm he helps her out
kim leans over in the back seat
see you later mom
vivian gives her a thin smile
hammond takes her arm and leads her into the imposing building
hammond and vivian cross the room
though she offers no resistance it appears he is pulling her along
they hurry into an elevator after an elderly cleaning woman carrying a mop and a bucket
they stand in silence
the cleaning woman puffs on a cigarette blithely ignoring the no smoking sign posted on the wall
vivian nervously reaches into her purse and removes a bottle of valium
quickly popping two pills into her mouth she swallows with difficulty and snaps her purse shut
hammond says nothing
just as the elevator doors slide open the cleaning wo man touches vivian on the shoulder causing her to jump in fright
could i have one of those
my nerves are shot this morning
with a terrified glance back at the woman vivian rushes out of the elevator
hammond and vivian move down the long empty hallway
as they round a corner a figure is visible unlocking a door
rupert fairchild straightens up and turns around
portly man in his fifties trying to disguise his girth with careful tailoring
fairchild bustles about the reception area turning on lights checking his messages and appointment calendar
fairchild is obsessively neat the office reflects him
we appreciate your seeing
i know how busy you must be
vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing with a kitten
catching fairchilds eye hammond nods toward the outer door
vivian does not notice the gesture
fairchild nods in return
stepping over to his inner office he opens the door
have a seat vivian
ill be right in
she slowly crosses the room turning suddenly in the doorway
dont forget were going to the cemetery this afternoon
i want robin to have her flowers
hammond moves over to his wife
taking her by the shoulders he kisses her lightly on the forehead
i wont forget
vivian looks from hammond to fairchild who smiles
she enters the office leaving the door open
hammond shakes hands with fairchild and for vivians benefit adds
hai i i iond thank you doctor
hammond leans against the wall outside fairchilds of fice
he glances at his watch
the door opens and fairchild steps out holding a container
hammond walks with him down the corridor towards the water fountain
shes at it again
todays the date
seven years ago today robin was killed
fairchild looks up from filling his container with water
this would have been her first prom
tonights the junior senior prom at our high school
robin would have been sixteen she and alex
how is alex
i just thank god he was too young to really understand what happened to his sister
and your older daughter
kimmys my princess
sometimes shell get depressed for a while
but it never lasts long
young people seem so much more
they walk back to the office
looking up at hammond and yourself
after a pause ive learned to live them
vivian seems worse this time
the persistence of vivians trauma
i wonder if there isnt something more serious at work here
something more serious than her daughters death
vivian fidgets in her chair
she seems very small and vulnerable in the large somber office
alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat
kim is in back
easy listening music plays softly on the car radio
alex fiddles with the tuning dial searching for music more to his tastes
lost in thought hammond does not see the young girl skipping through the pedestrian crossing
hammond slams on the brakes throwing alex against the dashboard
the car screeches to a halt inches away from the terri fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the crossing
after a moment realizing she is safe the girl giggles nervously and skips away
hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children
you all right
they both nod
alex massages his wrist
hammond slips the car into gear and cautiously continues driving
youre worried about mom
he is interrupted by disco music on the radio
play ing with the tuning dial alex quickly tries to pass over the music
hey keep that
alex groans but does as she asks
turns back to disco bites it
thats much better
the car pulls into the winston high school parking lot
they pile out
hammond kim and alex walk through the empty lot towards the school
suddenly we hear a loud grating sound coming from nearby
the sudden noise startles kim and she huddles against her father
a seedy little middle aged man with a stubble of gray beard appears from behind a row of bushes brandishing a pair of electric hedge clippers
good morning mr
sanford sykes the newly hired custodian bares his yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring blades in salute
kim shudders and stays close to her father as they walk on
i heard hes wacko
the man is not
kelly says hes a pervert spying on the girls undressing in the locker room
sykes may have some problems but hes no peeping tom
hes been thoroughly checked out
they climb the broad front steps of the high school
hammond glances at his watch
youre early today
plenty of time to study with no one to bother you
kim reaches up
and kisses her father on the cheek
pulling out a fashion magazine she rushes off call ing back over her shoulder
ve got to decide on my hair style for tonight
im building an atomic bomb in shop
smiling he moves inside
hammond shakes his head and hurries off
hammond moves through the empty hallway stopping at a door which reads principal raymond hammond
he is fumbling for his key when he sees through the frosted glass a figure moving around in his office
reaching for the doorknob he very quietly opens the door
as the door slowly swings open hammond sees the outer office covered with pieces of paper sheets are scattered across desks and chairs and over most of the floor
stepping inside hammond spies a woman bending over frantically picking up paper from the floor
he slams the door
at the sudden sound the startled woman whirls around still squatting and falls on her rear
who are you
flustered the attractive young woman hastily gets to her feet and straightens her skirt
they told me you wouldnt be in till nine
whatre you doing robbing me
no im your working girl hammond stares wide eyed
your temporary secretary
whats her name is sick
extends her hand hi
taking her hand what happened
well you see mr
hammond the air conditioner fan was set for high but
i have some important calls to make
please see that im not disturbed
wades through the papers to his inner and put all this back where it belongs
he enters his office
hammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops into his chair
he stares at the telephone for a long moment drumming his finger on the desk
a pink telephone rings
the plush bedroom is empty suddenly wendy richards rushes in
now eighteen wendy is a raven haired beauty with a full figure accentua ted by a low cut black blouse and tight designer jeans
tossing her books onto the bed she eagerly grabs the receiver
a long pause followed by heavy breathing
wendy is about to respond when the inhuman voice speaks in an eerie androgynous stutter
t t tonight its m m my t turn
wendys shock quickly turns to anger
screw you lou
wendy slams the receiver into its cradle
grabbing her books she storms out of her bedroom
wendy hurries do in the ornate staircase
waiting at the bottom holding the girls sweater is maude the richards elderly housekeeper
you be home for dinner wendy
wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman
how the hell do i know
the expansive residence sits back off the road in this upper middle class suburb
wendy climbs into her white mustang and starts the engine
tires squealing she roars out of the driveway with the radio blasting
kelly lynch is just finishing breakfast when the telephone rings
the petite blonde eighteen year old stuffs a last bite of toast into her mouth and picks up the receiver
a pause then heavy breathing
kellys eyes grow wide as the dreadful voice speaks
k k kelly
t tonight its m m i iz horrified kelly drops the phone
the doorbell rings
frightened she gasps hugging the wall
the doorbell rings again
very slowly she moves out of the kitchen
kelly cautiously approaches the front door
peering through a crack in the drapes she sees a dark figure huddled near the door
with the latch secured she takes a deep breath and opens the door
christ kelly cmon
relief floods across her face
kelly quickly unfastens the latch
oh drew thank god
she throws herself into the arms of the pleasantly sur prised drew shinnick a muscular blond athlete
holding her tightly im glad to see you too
she looks up at him
drew this horrible voice
on the telephone
it sounded so evil
whatd you get a heavy breather
worse than that
turned you on did he
maybe i should try that
she breaks from his grasp
drew makes a grab for her but she avoids him hurries inside
he sighs and leans against the doorjamb to wait
so am i
drew is driving his arm around kelly
she still appears shaken by the telephone call
the radio is on
his right hand slowly descends towards her breast
she swats it away
the hand moves to her back slid ing down
she leans back pinning his arm against the seat
the car stops at a light and drew is instantly on kelly biting her neck and kissing her hard on the mouth
she pushes him back
i thought we were late
well get there
drew honks the horn at another driver
hell you should be glad
a lot of girls would love to have someone steady like me
his irrepressible right hand starts up her leg
you mean persistent dont you darling
grabbing his hand she holds it firmly in her lap which doesnt bother drew at all
jude cunningham is leaving her house when the tele phone rings
the chubby brown haired girl rushes back into the hallway
a plump middle aged woman hurries out of the kitchen wiping her hands on an apron
cunningham eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver
the pause the heavy breathing and the strange terrifying voice
t t tonight its my my t t turn
a disappointed jude slowly replaces the receiver
cunningham looks on sympathetically
still no date
shakes her head getting closer though
an obscene call
and not very obscene at that
cunningham starts to say something
sorry mom gotta run
giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek jude exits
the small house appears almost identical to the other dwellings in this lower middle class neighborhood
jude pulls an apple from her large purse munching while she walks to the bus stop
a gaudily painted van pulls up alongside her
the win dow slowly rolls down and a young curly haired guy wearing glasses sticks out his head
hey beautiful need a lift
jude continues walking the van moving slowly alongside her
cmon i wont bite
jude chomps down hard on her apple
so who are you
theguy leans further out the window
seymour stone but
hes cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk
the flustered boy steers the van quickly back onto the road
but they call me slick
jude laughs almost choking on her apple
i can see why
how old are you slick
ive heard about guys like you
running over girls on the sidewalk
just some girls
if theyre good lookin i give em a ride
can you stop that thing
slick jams on the brakes
the van jerks to a halt
he opens the passenger door
im going straight to winston high understand
straight to winston
she climbs inside
the interior is decked out in plush red carpet with a bed in back a stereo cassette deck and a small fridge
music is playing
jude looks around
looks like a cheap motel
thats a two hundred dollar waterbed there
jude turns around for a look
hand me that history book
you think this is the time to study
she grabs the book gives it to him
he places it on the fold down table between them flips it open
the inside is hollowed out into a container
it contains nearly a hundred neatly rolled joints
straight to winston high
the van weaves through the parked cars passing up several vacant spots
it finally screeches to a halt at the far end of the lot near some high bluffs over looking a lake
the air is thick with smoke
how old are you really
you wont believe it
i believe it
they both break up giggling
you going to the prom tonight
jude looks away embarrassed
sure of course
my date got sick
well as a matter of fact
my date is uh not that certain
something might be happening hes not sure you know
jude watches him
hes slow picking up her hint
so i guess were both maybe not going
he looks at her
hey you think
id love to
she kisses him on the cheek
see you at eight same spot
she exits hurrying across the parking lot as he grins foolishly after her
suddenly it dawns on him
whats your name
a tall rugged looking man wearing a police uniform stands in the center of the room checking over his revolver
hes darryl mcbride forty eight years old and a veteran sergeant on the police force
satisfied with the condition of the gun he jams it back into its holster turns calls out
lets go son
a handsome dark haired boy of eighteen emerges from a back room
hes nick mcbride
his father pulls open the front door
for a guy who moves so fast around a disco floor you are the slowest goddamn thing
nick nods sleepily yawns
right i know
mcbride steps out into the hallway
nick grabs his books and follows
the telephone rings
nick hesi tates
shaking his head he exits shutting the door
the telephone keeps ringing
mcbride looks at his son
why didnt you answer i its just wendy
shes pissed off
she wants me to take her to the prom tonight
i thought you two broke up
the telephone continues to ring
three months ago
you cant tell wendy anything she doesnt want to hear
arent you going with the hammond girl
the principals daughter
god i wish i had your women problems
they walk down the corridor as the telephone continues to ring
alex is alone in the large room
rock music booms out of two huge speakers suspended from the ceiling
alex sits behind a console flipping switches and turning dials electronically distorting the music
a wall telephone rings
caught up in his own manufac tured sounds alex ignores it
after several more rings he reluctantly leaves the console and answers the phone
he listens expressionless then hangs up
he flips a switch on the console and the music stops
he sits there a moment thinking
then he turns out the lights and exits
kim walks down the long deserted corridor
she hears footsteps
shaking her head she continues walking
the footsteps return louder
kim begins to hurry
she rounds a corner and slips against the wall waiting
with a deep breath she moves on to her locker
kim quickly twists the dial on the combination lock and yanks open the door
grabbing several books she slams the door shut
a mop handle crashes into the locker missing her head by inches
the sharp report echoes down the corridor
terrified kim jumps back spins around
sykes is standing there
s s sorry missy
her heart pounding wildly kim rushes into the gym
sykes picks up his mop
kim runs into the huge deserted gym glancing frantical ly over her shoulder
her footsteps clatter across the hardwood floor
she stops waits to recover her breath
the room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off the silver decorations put up for the prom
stretched across the bleachers is a banner reading disco gazing around kim feels the excitement of anticipation
imagining herself in nicks arms she begins to dance whirling through the gym to the music in her head
suddenly someone is clapping slowly
kim stops abruptly
standing onstage watching her is wendy
practicing for tonight
yes as a matter of fact
i was just
thinking about nick maybe
thats my business
nick is king of the prom you happen to be queen of the prom
thats all there is to it hammond

so who are you going with tonight

the corridor is packed with students flirting gossiping fighting a few even studying
we pick up kim and vicki cantrell eighteen moving down the crowd ed hallway through the various conversations
so then she threatened me
wendys a jerk
swear to god
in the teachers lounge
thinks hes a fox
dustll run you
long and slinky and tight
swings like my mother
how much for half a lid
jude joins kim and vicki as they walk

i didnt ride it
i thought you were too big to hide
i got a ride
none of your business
vicki and kim are left hanging waiting for more
jude can hold it back no longer
im going to the prom
and vicki excitedly hug jude
a big bushy haired youth with a stubble of beard strolls by smirking when he sees the girls embracing
lou perano a twenty year old high school junior stops and stares
i knew there was some reason kim wouldnt go out with me
she likes girls
the girls separate
say goodbye lou
to vicki and jude lets go
they head down the hallway to their lockers
lou tags along
you girls get bored with each other im always around you know
they pass kelly and drew huddled at her locker
his hands rest on her shoulders
they are talking intently
poor girl must be exhausted
look how he has to hold her up
sees nick approaching uh oh
kim stops suddenly and turns to look
lou bumps into her his hand purposely grazing her rear
go play with yourself lou
im saving it for you
kim sighs with disgust and turns around as nick walks up talking to wendy
wendy for christ sake i never
seeing kim wendy quickly reaches up and kisses nick on the mouth
well talk about it later lover
wendy smiles and strolls away
lou follows her
i told her to leave me alone

the bell rings signalling first period class
kim turns to vicki and jude
wed better go
kim brushes past nick without a word
the two girls ex change puzzled glances and follow her
kim does not turn back
walking next to her vicki watches her friend curiously
a sneaky smile creeps across her face
oh no you dont
turns back and calls to nick shes smiling nick
big grin spread all over her face
kim punches her friend but the damage is done
nick grins broadly
blushing kim turns back flashes him a quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots of vicki and jude
a tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor ridor
from somewhere nearby loud voices splashing water can be heard
a shadow moves behind the opaque glass plate of a heavy door
the door edges open
raymond hammond appears
prop ping the door open with his shoulder he starts down across the narrow gallery to the pool below
a class of senior male students occupies the water among them nick mcbride and drew shinnick
with no phys
instructor in sight its a general goof off period
nick walks out onto the diving board
drew is treading water below him
as he watches nick intently from the gallery door
nick launches himself out over drew in an apparent belly flop
at the last moment he tucks in and hits the water in a flipped over cannonball
he surfaces to a chorus of whistles and cheers
it was a close shave
you wanta take care of yourself man
kims expecting a lot from you tonight
the door is easing shut
hammond is nowhere to be seen
a side door opens
hammond steps in gazes around
the gym is empty silent
he walks to the stage steps climbs up pushes through the thick curtain
its a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions discarded flats from old student productions banks of lights
hammond crosses to a rear door tries it
he turns back
as he does so theres a sudden whirring sound
a row of spotlights flashes on right in front of him almost blinding him
he tries to shield his eyes
he spins around
another bank of lights flares at him
he staggers downstage
the curtains begin to swing open
startled he jumps away from them
his foot lands on a package of photo flood bulbs
theres a loud pop
then a voice
hammond shaken looks across to the far wing
theres an elevated platform where the electronic control panel is located
alex peers down
what the hellre you doing
im testing the board
i didnt hear you
nobodys supposed to be here yet
he looks around
hes still trying to get himself together
im thinking we might have a fire hazzard here all these extra lights
he looks awkward as if hed been caught at something
a ll ond all right
he turns climbs down the stage steps and starts back across the gym
at the other end of the floor a door opens sykes looks in
hammond sees him
sykes waits as hammond hurries across to him
the two men go out together
alex walks out onto the stage watches them go
first period biology class features monty weller a tall thin englishman in his late thirties
this stuf fy dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps daydreams or passes notes
seated in the back near the door jude is furtively opening a handwritten note
she quickly reads it
stifling a giggle she looks up to see kim and vicki across the aisle eagerly awaiting her reply
jude tears out part of a page from her biology book and scrawls her answer
folding the note she taps the boy next to her and motions for him to pass it on
vicki grabs the note from the boy
quickly scanning it she nods impressed
kim reads it and mouths the word wow to jude who blushes happily
glancing out into the hallway jude notices slick walk ing past
seeing her in class he stops and waves
jude frantically tries to motion him away
their backs to the door kim and vicki watch with curiosity as jude gestures in their direction
seeing her friends watching her jude smiles and tries to ignore slick
not to be denied he exaggeratedly mimes weller nose to his textbook lecturing on oblivious to his class
jude laughs in spite of herself
kim and vicki turn around
glancing out the door the two girls stare in disbelief at the small weird curly haired boy doing a perfect im itation of the eminently boring weller
their surprise turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be judes prom date
kim holds up the note raising her eyebrows as she gestures toward slick
kim and vicki can barely contain their laughter
they do not notice mr
weller eyeing them suspiciously as he rattles on about frog intestines
slick mouths the words see you at lunch
in the van
jude nods and smiles
with a final bow and a wave he exits
kim suddenly looks up to find a red faced mr
weller looming above her
wide eyed kim desperately tries to crush the note in her hand
since you obviously find your own words more interesting than those of farnsworth on the anatomy of a frog
pauses to share his wit with the class read the note
barely a whisper read the note
now miss hammond
kim swallows and steals a quick glance at her friends
jude tries to disappear beneath her seat
clears her throat well its mostly talking about
word for word please
exactly as it is written
coughs and finally begins slowly in a what a hunk
titters from the class
a great the class roars with laughter
kinda the latin lover type
reading ahead and his name is slick
the classroom erupts into laughter as the bell rings signaling the end of the class
still laughing stu dents gather their books and shuffle out several giv ing kim sympathetic glances as they pass
after school miss hammond
one hour detention study hall
you and your friends
kim looks from jude to vicki
weller tonights the prom
tell that to your
he spins on his heel and marches back to his desk
the three girls hurriedly exit
a hand is flipping through the pages of the winston high yearbook the back pages where the individual photographs of graduating students are placed
the hand stops moves across an open page to a smiling head shot of nick mcbride
the hand rips the picture from the page sets it down on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures with similar torn edges
the other pictures are of jude cunningham kelly lynch and wendy richards
the yearbook is slammed shut
kim jude and vicki enter the crowded room
music from several portable radios can be heard above the clamor as the girls move into the long lunch line
kim spots alex seated nearby and waves to him
here comes the incredible hunk himself
jude looks up to see slick slowly making his way down the line towards them
he is carrying a tray piled high with snack food potato chips cookies candy
jude smiles as he passes her grinning
looks like a party
yeah i dont think hes gonna be too good for my diet
slick moves down the lunch line
suddenly he is bumped from behind sending the tray and the snacks flying across the room
looking around slick jumps back startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask
hey clown what the
three of lous gang quickly step up behind the masked figure
forget it lou
thats what i figured
slick bends over to pick up his lunch
lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is standing behind kim
lou nuzzles kims neck
muffled by the mask like me better now
startled kim spins around
her fear quickly becomes anger
its an improvement
she turns her back to him
you like it so much
spins her around to have a taste
he kisses her hard on the mouth
swinging at him kim breaks away
laughing lou grabs her wrists and rough ly pulls her to him
alex instantly jumps to his feet
holding kim close be nice
alex leaps over the metal railing separating the line from the tables
crashing into lou he drives the larger boy back into the salad counter sending food and utensils flying
as they tumble off the counter onto the floor alex gets in several furious punches before lous gang can pry him loose
two of the gang pin alex against the counter
wiping blood from his mouth lou grins maliciously and slugs alex in the stomach
the boy groans and doubles over
lou grabs alexs hair and slams his head back against the glass shield of the counter
as lou rears back to throw another punch his two friends suddenly release alex and scatter
the boy crumples to the floor
lou turns around to see two male teachers rapidly approaching
the larger teacher grabs lou
this time youre out perano
lou points to alex who is being helped up from the floor
he started i ill bet
alex nods leaning on the other teacher for support
thats not true
alex was trying to help me
the teacher looks from kim to lou to alex
youd better come along to your fathers office
wonder wholl get off with just a warning
several students laugh
the two teachers march lou and alex through the silent cafeteria
lou swaggers bask ing in the attention
alex walks with his head bowed
lou and alex accompany the teachers down the corridor toward the principals office
nick and wendy approach from the opposite direction talking heatedly
i dont care who
just somebody else
you never had it so good as with me
ive got it now
you dont even know
spots lou and lou
the surprised lou tries to stop but the teachers hurry him and alex past the couple
wendy watches nick
turning back to wendy i got this appointment
wendy turns to see nicks reaction but he is already walking towards the cafeteria
the irate girl glares after him
hammond is talking on the telephone
he appears agi tated running his fingers through his hair and tugging at the knot in his loosened tie
i didnt forget
i told you wed go to the cemetery
the door opens and adele coopers head peers around the corner
seeing hammond talking on the phone she nods toward the outer office
hammond gestures for her to wait
she persists until he angrily takes the receiver from his ear and covers the mouthpiece
what is it
there are some gentlemen here to see you mr
cant it wait
i didnt ask
but one looks a little like that child in the picture on your desk
hammond automatically glances at the photograph of robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family
into the receiver ive got to go now vi
well be there within the hour
theres a loud click on the other end of the line
frustrated hammond slams the receiver into its cradle
all right send them in
the two male teachers enter first followed by lou and finally alex
hammond gives his son a sharp look then turns to glare at lou
brawling in the cafeteria
both of them
he places lous ski mask on hammonds desk
the prin cipal glances at it
ill handle it
the teachers exit
he looks at alex
the boy stares at the floor and says nothing
hammond holds the mask up to lou
i was just foolin around with this girl
when this your son tackled me and
is this true alex
i knew it
hammond whirls on him
you knew what
it just figures
his voice rising that ill play favorites
that ill go easy on alex because hes my son
pauses waiting for lou to back down and damn right i will
youre a disgrace to this school and this community
youre suspended indefinitely
now get out
what about your son
if youre not off school grounds in five minutes ill have you arrested for trespassing
lou stalks to the door
opening it he turns to alex

he exits slamming the door
have the nurse take a look at you then get back here
hammond angrily grabs lous ski mask and hurls it at the trash can
kim and vicki are sprawled on the grass eating lunch
lou storms down the front steps
pausing at the bottom he turns strolls over to kim
watch for me little girl
you know im just a kiss away
lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot
wendys white mustang slides up to the curb
the pass enger window rolls down and lou leans over to look in side
after a moment he climbs in and the mustang peels out of the lot leaving twin black tread marks in its wake
what a pair
made for each other
kim opens a carton of yogurt
you wearing that green gown tonight
that was last year
smiles and runs her hand from her neck to her waist cut to here
cut to where
kim and vicki turn to see nick ambling across the lawn toward them
anywhere you like
on the prowl
wendys white mustang streaks through traffic dodging in and out of lanes running yellows burning around corners
lou sits pinned to the passenger seat eyes wide staring straight ahead as if he cant quite believe this trip
his bravado seems to have left him
he glances over at wendy in the drivers seat
shes puffing on a cigarette handling the wheel almost casually
shes in control the mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left turn narrowly beating a horn honking oncoming van
the big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps into the end slot at a sprawling fast food drive in
lous still pinned to his seat
wendy shuts off the engine looks at him
he looks at her lets out a long deep breath
a cute little car hop in a cut off costume and roller skates glides over
she leans into wendys window talks through a wad of gum
ready to order
what do you want
lous shifting around in his seat pulling himself together
a little short on cash
you can owe me
okay then a couple of burgers a large fries
what kind of beer you got
cmon man this is a drive in not a bar

the car hop shrugs wheels away
wendy turns to lou

i dont want anyone hurt

anything your little heart desires
lou shouldnt we go over this
lou puts his finger to her mouth silencing her
ill take care of it scouts honor
dont worry about it
he caresses her cheek and lips then kisses her
at first reluctant wendy quickly takes over
when they finally break from their passionate clinch he is gasping
dont worry about it
she unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his chest
slowly she works her way down
lou begins to writhe
wendys head disappears from view
lous eyes snap open in surprise
damn stick shift
lou starts to protest then dissolves
the car hop wheels up to the mustang carrying a tray loaded with food
she leans over and peers inside
wendy is behind the wheel perfectly composed
a mind blown lou is hurriedly doing up his belt tucking in his shirt
he glances at the car hop then turns away to finish the job
enjoy your meal
a wide view high weather worn bluffs tumbling down to a strip of beach and the calm blue waters of the lake
above the bluffs theres a narrow shaded park and then the buildings and parking lots of winston high
nick and kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs
nick has his arm around her
she leans into him
i am excited its just
in some ways its such an awful day
its robins day
my mothers all upset as usual
my father too
he doesnt show it so much
its hard to get over something like that
robin would have been a junior like alex
this wouldve been her first prom
i guess thatswhy it seems so much worse this year
she stops turns and faces nick
its hard for him to meet her gaze
the queen of the prom is determined not to let it get to her
she must maintain her
whatever at all costs
she tries a weak smile
nick stares at her then sud denly takes her pulls her to him embraces her
shes caught by surprise but she responds
i love you too
i want you to know that

so sorry about it
kim looks puzzled
i know what youre feeling

across the school parking lot a car horn blares inter rupts nick

she hesitates a moment then kisses him quickly turns and goes
nick looks shaken up
he stares after her as she hurries away
behind nick in the other corner of the parking lot a metal door slides open loud raunchy rock and roll sud denly infests the air
nick turns sees jude climbing out of slicks van
jude looks about as stoned as she can get
she spots nick waves
nick turns and heads the other way
theres a small marble headstone inset with the carved face of an angel and the inscription robin anne hammond too soon taken from us
kneeling beside the grave is vivian hammond
shes ar ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers fussing with them trying for some kind of impossible perfection
hp i mond

she doesnt react she keeps playing with the flowers
hammond moves in behind her puts his hands on her shoulders
she looks at him
we have to get back
she stands with her husbands support
kim and alex are standing quietly at the foot of the grave
vivian looks at them both
her eyes hold a terrible rage a terrible sadness
hammond carefully guides her away
kim has a flower of her own a white rose which she drops on her sisters grave
she turns meets alexs stare moves off after her parents
alex remains a mo ment longer then
he too goes
during the afternoon phys
class the girls play tennis kim with kelly and vicki with jude
sykes lingers nearby watching the girls
their instructor is miss henri anne benton a stocky woman in her late thirties with teased lacquered hair
a product of genteel southern womanhood henri anne stalks the courts in her baggy bermuda shorts constantly blowing a silver whistle hanging from her neck
a very stoned giggling jude runs vicki ragged hitting balls over the fence straight up in the air and occa sionally even back over her head
each time a ball flies over the fence vicki runs to retrieve it to the delight of sykes
at one point vicki bends over to pick up a ball under sykes appreciative gaze
the shrill whistle inter rupts her as henri anne rushes over
no no miss cantrell
never bend from the waist
always squat to retrieve
otherwise you look like the broad side of a barn
glares at sykes isnt that so mr
embarrassed the custodian scuttles away to the girls laughter

kim jude and kelly gatheraround with the other girls
kelly takes jude aside as kim and vicki approach henri anne

he keeps making kim stay after school in detention study hall for no reason

kim nods meekly
lost in thought henri anne fondles a tennis ball a curious smile playing across her face
leave everything to me
she hurries away
kim turns on vicki and starts to protest
it worked didnt it
kim and vicki and behind them jude and kelly are walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the tennis courts
vickis in high spirits and jude still cant stop giggling
vicki spots old sykes heading out toward the playing field
she calls out to him
sykes stops turns around

she turns bends over quickly yanks down her shorts and moons him
theres a squeal of laughter from jude and from kelly
vicki whips her shorts back up and runs to the gym door the other girls in pursuit

the girls wrap towels around themselves and walk to wards the showers
a girl melanie is leaving as kim andkelly enter
wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair
kim ignores her and wendy returns the compliment

wendy finishes brushing her hair shoots kim
a dark look exits

kelly looks at her friend
wendy finishes buttoning her blouse
shes pulling on her jeans when she hears a scuffling sound

curious wendy moves around the lockers investigating
the room appears empty
theres a sudden loud creaking
wendy whirls around
a locker door is swinging slowly open

shaking her head wendy returns to her locker
shes about to shut it when she sees something a pic ture taped to the side of the door
its her photo torn from the school yearbook
she rips it from the door looks at it
whats this for melanie
her voice echoes through the empty room
she gazes around fear creeping into her face
she quickly finishes dressing grabs her books turns to leave
suddenly she screams
wendys scream is all but drowned out by the showers
rinsing off kim and kelly hear nothing
i think ill let drew do it
the door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them
she looks at kelly
neither girl hears the squish of rubber soles moving across the wet tile floor
suddenly there are loud voices
melanie comes through from the locker room laughing
behind her wendys angry words are audible
if you ever try anything like that again you cow
melanie thinks its hilarious
to kim and kelly you shouldve seen her jump
nadia comenici never did better
wendy storms in
shes got the photo in her hand
she waves it at kim and kelly

wendy is furious
she turns glares at melanie

she storms out
melanie looks at kim and kelly shrugs follows wendy
a door slams in the locker room
kim and kelly look at each other laugh turn their faces back to the steaming water
neither one hears the sound across the room a harsh rhythmic heavy kelly bends her head away from the water clears her eyes
she squints out through the steam at the big wall mirror across the room
she sees something
she steps back into kim her eyes wide with fear
kelly covers her breasts with her arms presses against the wall terrified
suddenly theres an explosion of sound
kim screams jumps back stares
theres a jagged hole in the cen ter of the mirror huge cracks radiating from it spidering across its surface
for a moment no one moves
splinters of glass trickle down to the floor
theres no other sound
kim grabs for her towel steps out of the shower looks
theres no one
she heads for the locker room door
kelly runs after her
kim rushes into the room kelly right behind her
theres no one
kelly is quivering
she clutches at kims arm
kim looks at her

kelly just shakes her head
a shadow or
kim heads for the exit door across the room
kelly stays with her
kim opens the outside door peers down the walkway to the tennis courts playing fields
theres no sign of anyone
she closes the door
kim turns back
to kelly whos started to cry

kim is taking charge
she moves cautiously back to the shower room door opens it looks in
kellys on the edge of hysteria
she runs over to kim
they both look
what the girls see is the mirror
something has changed
a long wedge of glass has been lifted out o it
kim shuts the door presses against it stares at kelly
kim walks quickly down a long school corridor and turns into her fathers office
adele cooper is seated behind the secre tarys desk thumbing through a fashion magazine
id like to see my f ather

he said hed be back but
she trails off
kim is obviously upset
somebody broke a mirror in the shower room
there was somebody in there
seven years bad luck
she tries to smile
kim just looks at her
kim turns a corner heading for class and almost runs into sykes cleaning the floor
for a moment their eyes lock
then kim hurries away almost running
sykes stares after her
kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door
theres a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes sage taped there
it heads detention postponed until monday emergency

kim is startled turns
vicki and jude and approach ing
vicki hurries to the door reads the note
she lets out a whoop embraces jude
kim stands back somehow less impressed
several students are putting last minute touches on the decor as kim comes in
huge speakers are being hoisted on pulleys to hang from the ceiling
a vast raised platform covers much of the gym floor its plexiglass surface designed to be illuminated from below
perched on a ladder weller is hanging shimmering silver strips while henri anne benton supervises from the disco floor
a little higher
sees kim and im glad you could make it
something came up
looks at weller afternoon mr
oh hello miss

henri anne mercifully interrupts him
lets get started
nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a platform near the stage

alex emerges from the booth
davy matlock a pudgy fifteen year old sophomore and alexs technical assis tant leans out behind him
all set miss benton

kim smiles as nick joins her
she takes his hand clutches it
they start to walk away talk ing quietly
nick puts his arm around her
come with me
henri anne bounds up onto the stage
kim and nick fol low her behind the curtain
henri anne takes kim to one of the wings of the dark cluttered area
youll wait here
looks around for nick
nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves up directly behind henri anne
he mimes choking her a crazed expression on his face
kim has to laugh at his clowning
you have to stand up here tonight not me
if you dont know what to do youll look the fool
nick glances at kim
nick follows her to the opposite wing
kim cannot see them from her position
continuing calls out can you hear me kim
kim leans against a wall gazing around at her gloomy surroundings
she does not hear the whispered conver sation coming from behind a nearby partition
she does not see wendy and lou lurking there watching her
all right alex start the tape
a trumpet fanfare blares out of the speakers
listen for your cue king and queen
professional music is heard
start walking slowly
kim begins to cross the stage
she smiles when she spots nick
the curtain slowly opens
the king and queen of the george winston high school junion senior prom for nick mcbride and kim hammond
they meet backstage center and turn towards the parting curtain
henri anne stands at the front of the stage her hand resting on alexs shoulder as kim and nick proceed downstage
these two seniors were selected by their fellow students as the most popular boy and girl in the class
to kim as they bullshit
peeking out from behind the curtain wendy turns to lou
nick is a three sport letterman and president of the key club
he plans to attend state university in the fall
because he cant get in anywhere else
kim is the head cheerleader and ranked number one on the girls tennis team
she hopes to become a teacher
if she ever graduates
nick and kim stop downstage center
self consciously alex stumbles up to kim and pretends to give her a bouquet of roses
thats it alex

alex awkwardly kisses kim on the cheek
now the king
kiss the king
on the mouth
kim laughs at alexs discomfort
alex step back
alex moves next to her
kim and nick start down the
looks at the where are the steps
continuing to the you expect our king and queen to jump to the floor
a student in the back timidly responds
ill find them miss benton
henri anne turns back to nick and kim
youll descend the steps
nick and kim climb down from the stage
nick give kim your arm
as he does move to the center of the floor
nick and kim self consciously cross the room aware that everyone is watching them
wait for the spotlights and your music cue then dance
itll be beautiful
kim strides down the empty corridor flushed and ex cited from the rehearsal
arriving at her fathers of fice she flings open the door
kim enters and surveys the apparently empty office
hearing grunts and groans from behind the desk kim steps around and sees adele cooper stretched across the floor
the secretary is practicing her rainbow exer cise arching her body towards the ceiling while keep ing her hands and feet on the floor
adele twists her head around to look at kim
her rainbow collapses
spinning around adele sits cross legged on the floor and smiles at kim
ive calmed down a bit
adele launches into another contortion
this works for me
has my father been back
havent seen him all afternoon
and he didnt leave a message
not a word
he usually gives me a ride home
let me finish and ill give you a lift
thanks but i can walk
kim starts to leave turning around at the door
guess i wont be seeing you again
standing on her head adele smiles
three different students asked me to the prom tonight
i thought you had to be enrolled
not with any of them

ill keep my eyes open

she exits as adele slowly lowers her legs to the floor
jude approaches her locker stops
theres a picture taped to her locker door her picture ripped out of the winston high yearbook
she looks at it reaches up and pulls it off the door
she winces looks at her finger
she looks at the picture
theres a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it
jude hears someone coming
she turns to see kelly com ing toward her
she has something in her hand
its a photo of her a yearbook photo with the same torn edges
jude holds up her version
the door creaks open
a light is flicked on
sykes stands there a broom and a big waste pan in his hands
he stares at the broken mirror with its center hole and its missing wedge
he shuffles across the floor and starts to clean up the debris
the split level suburban residence sits on a tree lined street in an older middle class neighborhood
walking up the driveway kim hears a loud thud from behind the house
as the sound continues kim walks around back to investigate
stepping around the corner of the house kim sees her father furiously chopping an old stump in the flower garden
hammonds axe slashes into the rotten wood sending splinters flying in all directions
kim watches him work
he appears angry and upset
oblivious hammond buries the axe in the stump
kim moves around to face him
when he sees her hammond jumps startled
i didnt hear you
wiping the sweat from his forehead hammond struggles to catch his breath
im getting too old for this
why are you doing it now
your mothers been hounding me to get it done
you got nay message
i told that woman to tell you i had a meeting and couldnt drive you home
i liked her
hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump
this thing with your mother
have you seen her yet
how is she
one minute shes depressed the next shes bubbling over like a child
she wants to go with me tonight
im not so sure
i think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her
shes had a bad day kim
im not sure she can handle it
see if you can talk to her
hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the stump
kim enters from the backyard
looking around she no tices that nothing is being prepared for dinner
curious she moves toward the living room
vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine when kim enters
the girl stands for several seconds watching her mother before she speaks
dont eat anything
dinners almost ready
disturbed kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to her mother
nothings cooking mom
you mustve forgotten
slipping out of her reverie vivian turns around to face kim
i dont know what i was thinking
it doesnt matter
have you seen the new satin pantsuit im wearing
vivian smiles at her daughter
kim studies her for a long moment then leans over and kisses her on the cheek
youll be beautiful
as kim walks down the hallway she notices that alexs door is closed
she enters her bedroom
kim crosses the room and switches on her radio
rock music is heard as she tosses her books onto the desk and moves to the closet
she carefully pulls out her prom dress a mid length off the shoulder gown in a white clinging material
holding it up against her body she inspects the gown in the full length mirror on the closet door
watching her reflection kim twirls around hugging the gowm to her body
satis fied she gently lays the go
m on her bed
kim begins to undress
outside the twilight shadows deepen
through the vindom a slight movement is sean among the trees suddenly a dark figure becomes visible ap proaching
kim does not notice the figure as she finishes undressing
she wraps herself in a robe and sits at her dressing table
putting her hair up she does not see the shadowy figure peering inside
when kim stands up the figure slips away from the window
as she crosses the room the face reappears hidden by the shadows watching her enter the bathroom
wearing only a bra and panties wendy is sprawled across her bed talking on the telephone
a black silk gown is draped across her legs
into the receiver what im wearing now
smiles gently stroking the gown youll find out soon enough
now are we all set
i dont want her to ever forget tonight
wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night table
a photograph of a grinning nick mcbride stares back
wendy smiles and caresses her gown
seated at her dressing table kim puts the final touch es on her makeup
her hair is swept up and back fall ing in soft waves to her shoulders
wearing the rav ishing white gown she looks older and very beautiful
vivians voice is heard from down the hall
vivian comes in looking anxious and flustered
shes dressed in an elegant black satin pantsuit
kim turns looks at her
mom it looks great
vivian doesnt seem to hear her
shes rummaging through her purse
kim have you got any of my makeup
that deep red lipstick you remember
you liked it
i wouldnt take it without asking you
vivians very wound up
it was on my dressing table i set it aside
shes looking around kims room as if she expects to see it
why does this always happen at the last minute
hammonds voice bellows from downstairs
lets go we cant be late
i set it aside
she heads for the door stops looks fully at kim for the first time
you look lovely dear
she goes out
hammond stands in front of a hall mirror straightening his bow tie
he seems agitated nervous
he turns as vivian starts down the stairs
he looks surprised at her outfit
theres a certain similarity between it and his own formal suit
my god were going to look like twins
vivian stops dead looks at him
hammond forces a smile
im joking vi its beautiful
she hesitates then comes down to him
i told you id bought it
of course you did
he opens the door for her
she pauses to check herself in the mirror
weve got to go
he puts an arm around her kisses her gently on the cheek
she just stares at herself in the mirror
hammond takes vivians arm as they step outside walk toward the car in the driveway
someone is watching hammond and vivian from a car parked across and just down the street
a shadow moves in the foreground in the front seat of the car
hammond guides his wife to their family car opens the passenger door for her he looks past her down the street sees a car parked there
a streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents him from seeing inside
vivian interrupts his speculations
im going back to change
she turns back to the house
hammond holds on to her arm
theres no time
im not going to look ridiculous
you dont look ridiculous you look fine
the figure in the front seat watches the confrontation in the hammond driveway
hammond takes vivian by the shoulders faces her
this is a big night for the school its a big night for me
i know how youre feeling
its difficult for all of us
but weve got to make a special effort vi
we cant let the
terrible memories of this day affect us
that may seem cold and
insensitive to you but its the way it has to be
he pauses staring down at his wife
shes holding his gaze
now vi if you think its going to be too difficult for you
you dont want me to go
certainly i want you to go just saying
you dont think i can do it
you think ill embarrass you
then why are you saying these things
hes trying to stay calm to keep the lid on
shes on the verge of tears
i didnt mean to upset you
you treat me like a child
im your wife
she glares at him
he releases her from his grip ges tures toward the car
lets get going
he walks around to the drivers door
vivian stares after him with hard cold eyes
the figure in the parked car watches as hammond starts up the car waits for vivian to get in backs out of the driveway and moves off down the street
the figure climbs out of his car gazes at the fading taillights of the hammond car
the figure is nick mcbride
kim reaches for a small bottle of cologne
as she gently tracks the perf me across her skin she is startled by another reflection in her mirror
whirling around she sees alex
standing up she pir ouettes and curtsies before her brother
alex gapes stunned by his sisters appearance
you look almost like a woman
she picks up her corsage from her dressing table
you want to help or just leer
youre my sister
pin this on me you creep late
alex takes the corsage
as he attaches the bright red flower on her gown she playfully dabs perfume on his neck
he pulls back pricking himself on the pin
you shouldnt have pulled away
the doorbell rings
ers face is revealed
it is the nine year old alex
kim cradles the killer on the ground
she turns his head toward the light
we see his face full on
she rushes forward lunging for the body
hammond grabs her restraining her
alexs dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family
his resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny
his hair falls onto his forehead in bangs as robins had done seven years before
his makeup has been slop pily applied
the rouged cheeks and the smudged red lips amplify the grotesque impersonation
kim strokes her brothers hair
hammond presses his hysterical wife to him
the onlookers slowly close in
we slowly dissolve from alexs face to a photograph of the hammond family taken seven years earlier
we move in close on the twins
alex and robin are smiling
