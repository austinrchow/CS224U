rewrite by may revised first draft aime cesaire dan pienaar school is a typical johannesburg afrikaan school
the students are mainly from middle class families
school athletics are in progress
the stu dents in their smart school uniforms are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately kept sports ground
gordon ngubene a years old african laborer is work ing in the school garden
a few feet away is his years old son jonathan leaning against a wall watching the games
ben du toit a year old afrikaaner history teacher is enthusiastically cheering his son johan a years old who is leading neck and neck with another boy in the last
leg of the race
the excitement increases as they approach the tape
ben is beside himself egging his son with shouts
the young teacher viviers standing next to ben is shouting come on johan and slapping the father on the back
johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy
the ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate johan
ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son the proud father pushing his way through the animated boys
as he reaches johan he pats him on the back
this was your best race
excited i beat him papa
proudly you did son
come on shower
they walk happily towards the school buildings in conver sation johan being slapped on the back by friends
ben stops to talk to gordon who jumps to his feet
ill be expecting you
there isnt much to do only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers
well be there mr
bensir jonathan come to help me
ben hadnt seen jonathan
he turns to him
and hows the algebra

with respect just a little mr
straightening himself hes working hard mr
bensir and your money will not be wasted
emily and me will always thank you
as he leaves see you both later
gordon returns to his work a little distance further
a group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously
as they near jonathan two nudge each other and giggle
then one of them trips jonathan
he falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively about to attack the boy
gordon shouts jonathan
the headmaster mrs
cloete aged years has observed the incident but takes no action
jonathan stands panting with rage
he suddenly strides away towards the gate in a rage
shouting angrily u ya phi
where are you going
jonathan turns to look at his father and continues to walk off
the beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area with long rows of low benches
men sit drinking african beer in one half and one gallon plastics containers
the place buzzes with noise
several people are touting wares for sale
suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the drinking area obviously to cause trouble
the leader starts to address the clients
your children are starving and you are drinking
we demand freedom and our fathers are drunk
we ask you to boycott these beer halls
revolution and drink dont work together
a large man with sideburns obviously drunk stands up a stick in his hand
since when do children talk like this to their fathers
they need thrashing
the man and several others advance on the boys
the boys run into the serving area close the doors and start breaking up the place
two police land rovers screech to a halt outside
the boys run out through a side en trance
they are chased by the police who are black
jonathan and his best friend wellington also years are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come running out chased by the police
it is prudent for them to run down the street
the boys and police are bearing down on them
their escape is cut off by the apperance of another police land rover
two policemen two blacks and two whites join in the capture
jonathan wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested
as they are hundled into the vehicle they protest their innocence without success and are driven away
the charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench along a wall
there is a reception counter with sgt van zyl in charge
the boys are lined up against a wall
the sergeant stands with a tall blond man with a scar on his chin captain stolz
the sergeant reads out a name and looks at stolz if he nods the boy stands aside
after this ritual the ones that stolz has chosen are marched to a waiting police van and driven away
the others are taken to the cells at the police station these include jonathan and wellington
the music stops
the doors open
the years old minister bester comes to the door then stands and greets his parishioners as they file out of the church
amongst them ben du toit his wife susan a clean cut immaculate toe the line beauty and his son johan the blond blue eyed tanned and torsoed fourteen year old
every father dreams of
susan greets friends and acquaintances pausing to chat
johan his eyes on a girl his age
she is with her father mr
cloete the headmaster she smiles at johan from a distance he waves awkwardly as she drives off with her parents
suzette his daughter sophisticated groomed
she takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car carries the child to the group chatting with chris her husband
she shows it off proudly
ben is chatting concerned to a woman
she looks drawn and worried
he wont come to church
he lies in bed all day listening to his headphones
i wondered why he wasnt at school
would it help if i came to see him
hes always seemed a good kid to me
oh would you
ill phone and we can fix a time
coetzee smiles her gratitude
shes waving impatiently at him
he crosses back to her
suzettes baby is howling
she rocks it back and forth holding it at arms length
the baby screams
the nanny comes forward suzette hands it over
she looked worried
shes having trouble with her boy
he wont come to school
so you said youd have a word with him
she smiles and walks him to the car affectionately
the du toit family
susan is bringing out the salads
chris her son in law is at the barbecue stinging his eyes
ben is bouncing his grandson little hennie in a small portable pool
the black nanny sits in attendance in the shade a towel at the ready
the good life
suddenly disturbed by
gordon and jonathan standing uncertain at the far side of the garden gordons hat pressed flat against his chest jonathan defiant
susan looks up as do each in turn curious at the intrusion
then the black nanny and finally ben
after a moment ben walks up to gordon
what are you doing here
six cuts like six knife gashes revealed on the blood stained buttocks of gordons son who stands in painful truculent embarrassment
ben is shocked by the severity of the canning
thats not why im complaining mister ben sir
if he did wrong id beat him myself
but he didnt
he did nothing and they wouldnt listen
they wouldnt believe him
im sorry gordon
but there must be a reason
he says he wasnt doing anything wrong mister ben sir
and i believe him i know my son
its an injustice
what about the court
didnt he state his case
what does he know about court
before he knew it was all over
i dont think there is anything we can do about it now
outside peering through the half opened door is johan shocked at what he sees
ben tapes jonathan on the head he pulls up his shorts painfully yet fiercely anxious to cover himself up again
we can get a lawyer to appeal
that wont heal jonathans buttocks
susan appears at the door
ill be out in a minute
she nods ushering johan away from the door back outside
you dont understand mister ben sir
i dont want him to have a police record
it will be there for the rest of his life and make it difficult for him to get a job in the future
dont worry gordon
im sure therell be no record its such a minor case
please dont worry
ben calls johan from the outside
johan get some iodine from the cupboard
johan rushes in the house
im not worried about the wounds
theyll heal in time mister ben sir
its the wounds here
slaps his chest i worry about
johan comes back with a small bottle of medicine
to gordon rub it on the wounds and it will help
ben watches the black man and his son trudge down the long drive the fathers arm on the sons shouldre
at the foot of the drive the nose of an exotic soweto cab can be seen waiting
a large butterfly painted on the hood
ben takes his place at the table
susan brings a piece of boerwors and a mug of beer
jonathan has been caned by the police
she places the boerwors and the beer before him
he probably deserved it
school grounds of the orlando secondary school
students are milling around in high spirits
one group is putting finishing touches to a banner reading no to aparhteid education
there are two other banners being carried around the school yard followed by the younger children
they read no to the oppressors language bantu education is slave education
a boy one of the eldest aged about years calls for silence
the students immediately obey
you all know why we are going to march
the crowd shouts no to bantu education no to apartheid freedom now
there must be discipline
we start marching from here and well join up with the others at the main road
please take care of the younger ones
the students start marching led by one of the banners singing a freedom song
amongst them is jonathan and wellington

several groups of students marchers converge to join the march that has already started including jonathans group
there are several banners condeming bantu education apartheid etc
examples equal education now there are chants of slogans as they march if we learn afrikaans vorster must learn zulu
they also start singing a freedom song
three police jeeps block the route of the march
a little distance behind are police troops carriers hippos
about six police dog handlers in camouflage uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to approach
as the march gets closer the students singing increases in volume
the soweto police commandant steps forward with a loud speaker in hand
he confronts the lead of the march
he signals for them to stop
the dogs are straining at their leashes and their handlers taunt the leading group
now listen to me this is an illegal demonstration
i order you to disperse immediately
the students start singing the african national anthem nkosi sikelele
children of years singing lustily with their fists clenched as everyone else
jonathan and wellington singing
camouflauged police scrambling out of jeeps with guns and tear gas grenades
they stand with the rifles pointing at the marchers
the singing continues
the commandant confers with a junior officer who hurries to the group of policemen and gives them instructions
the ones carrying tear gas move towards front
the police start donning gas masks
this is the last warning
disperse immediately or i will take action
a voice in the crowd shouts banutu education
the crowd shouts back stinks stinks stinks
the commandant gives a hand signal
tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd the dog handlers attack
there is panic with students running in all directions several choking
some of the students start throwing stones at the police hitting one in the face he is helped away by a black policeman
without warning shooting starts
children drop wounded friends trying to help the dying and seriously wounded others helped away
some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they pelt the police with stones
the police in the hippos are jumping off and pursuing students some shooting
woman grabs two of the running children age about and hustles them into house
jonathan and wellington are running with a group
in the distance the sound of an ambulance siren
a jeep cuts off their escape they turn back running as shots are fired towards them a little girl drops shot in the back
jonathan shouts to wellington who is ahead of him
wellington looks back sees jonathan trying to help the little girl
he runs back to help
another girl aged about years is also trying to help
two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house they are about years old
the girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen shouting hysterically
come on shoot me
she slumps to the ground crying
jonathan wellington and the girl are hustled into a crowded van amid punches and kicks from the police
the van drives off leaving the injured girl on the road neighbors run to assist the girl
as the van is passing see a burning car in the distance a building on fire another ambulance siren
b the screams the laughter of white kids playing at their school massed in conviviality johan one
c behind aboard a mower motors gordon in the blue overall of a groundsman intent in his task
over this white pacifist content hear
the carnage the dead the wounded
the stunned bewilderment of blacks and police alike
even the latter unnerved by their own brutality
soweto train rushing through suburb of johannesburg
reverse shot from train
the third class carriage is crowded with african commuters returning to soweto
the passengers represent all the social and economic strata of soweto laborers factory workers domestic servants clerk secretaries the unemployed etc
in the carriage gordon returning from work standing
a large middle aged woman is standing in the crowded aisle at one end of the carriage
she suddenly shouts
to man in front of her careful with your bag
cant you see where its touching
standing half way down carriage can i see where its touching
men of today only like looking
laughter in the carriage
gordon is also enjoying the joke
standing by a door its the electricity
what has electricity to do with it
a few voices also ask same question
today with the electricity they say in an affected voice darling lets not switch off the light
laughter and voice saying thats true
standing very near gordon i hope you have electricity with those thick glasses of yours
with your eyes you couldnt find anything
tell us does your wife also wear thick glasses
quickly you should know shes your sister
there is more laughter
suddenly a man jumps on his seat waving his arms hes about years old in blue overalls
he cannot take it any more
the noise goes down
they are killing our children and you are making jokes
they say hundreds of children have died and soweto is burning
talking about the information
the white people they will pay and soon
they will pay they will pay
since when have they been killing us putting us in jails starving our children to death taking our land
hundreds of years
and what have you men done
only talk talk talk
you are not men
the conversations in the carriage become muted and serious
the train enters soweto there is smoke hanging over sev eral parts of the township and official buildings are on fire
suddenly the passengers are gripped by the seriousness of the situation
there are snatches of conversation such as thats the superintendents office on fire
i hope the children are home
we have to dodge bullets tonight
vorster must hang for this
i hope the world hears about this
a small three room soweto brick house the living room is modestly furnished
emily gordons year old wife is sitting on a narrow iron bedstead against the wall clutching her youngest year old son her mind is preoccupied
sitting next to her is a ten year old daughter
gordon is sitting on a chair at the table with his second eldest son robert aged years standing by the side of the table sitting on an old easy chair
is a soweto resident with his year old daughter standing beside him
to girl are you sure it was jonathan they took away
the girl glances at her father
he coaxes her to talk
yes baba with wellington
black parents waiting
at the counter with gordon a large black man stanley a friend his big easy smile is working hard on a white policeman the station sergeant van zyl about to
run out of patience
no no i understand baas but is that all the names

stanley walks up to a woman
youre here too sis paulina who are you looking for
they picked up my girl year old girl
comforting her we are all searching
the policeman calls her she hurries to the counter
a white uniformed assistant leads a line of african parents reeking of sadness into a cool room where metal drawers open from the walls
stanley and julius their black lawyer the two men seem to be very well known people shake hands with them salute them gordon and emilys sadness is tinged with anger
they have dignity defiance bowed with grief as they are
stanleys large hand is placed gently on emilys shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them
they belong to children some in torn dirty clothes others naked some mutilated others whole and seemingly unharmed as if asleep until the small neat hole in temple or chest
and the small crust of blood is brought to our attention
a woman behind them starts to scream
they look around to see her holding onto a drawer her legs buckling
another woman pulls her close to grieve with her
the assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body
the woman cant wont leave her dead child
her friend has to pull her away
the crowd parts to let them through
other women reach out to touch her
gordon looks into the last drawer jonathan is not there
they make their way out past the other parents and a group of mourning women sitting
gordon emily and their friends cross to stanleys great white elderly dodge this etembalami with the big butter fly
for amongst other things he is the owner and driver of a pirate taxi
they get in
stanley pauses looks across at a small red vw beetle parked nearby waiting
he shakes his head the vw flashes its lights and drives off
inside they sit in silence
recovering from the ordeal
only emily silently whispers thank god thank god
after a while
he is our son
we must find him
ill make more inquiries john vorster square the special branch but i dont hold out much hope

laughs a black lawyer

bitterly when the boy was flogged he didnt help
why should he help him now
gordon is at work already am mowing the lawn
hes intense unsmiling burdened as he goes about his task expertly
sounds of ben and johan laughing coming from inside
ben and johan in robes their hair still wet from their showers having an imaginary boxing match
johan has ben on the ropes backs him out of the house
ben adjusts the sash of his robe and takes the offensive towards johan as he sees gordon
ben does a double take and stops playing
to johan hold it champ
he crosses the yard to gordon fluffing his hair dry johan follows behind
gordon you okay

gordon continues to work
ben and johan exchange puzzled looks

ben at the phone
thanks a lot dan
ill tell gordon
ben hangs up and stays there
until the bell snaps him out of his thoughts
the playing fields not of eton but as good as
cries and whistles rise through the still warm air from a game of schoolboy rugby being played below us by immaculately fitted teams
on another part of the field gordons lawnmower off to the side two figures pace slowly one white one black a voice overlays all this
mister ben sir
if it was me all right

the game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle
the kids run off past ben and gordon
gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and starts the engine
the police if theyve said
i dont care what they say
he is my child
god is my witness today i cannot stop before i know what happened and where he lies
his body belongs to emily and me
and drives away chugging across the field
leaving ben helpless behind him watching
from his in the school behind a worried headmaster watches
we hear his voice over
this business of gordons son
be careful ben
these are not normal times one has to make allowances
the car park
he and ben are getting into their cars at the end of the day
im no crusader
ive known gordon a long time thats all
i understand its your christian duty to your neighbor
something like that yes
just dont get too close
teachers must stay out of politics
love to susan
and drives off leaving ben watching him shaking his head at the mans obtuseness
emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard with a bucket and a pierced tin
robert is playing nearby with the youngest child
robert sees gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby look whos coming
emily turns to look
she immediately realizes that some thing is wrong
she drops the tin and walks a few steps toward the gate
gordon sees her and stops
emily starts to break down
oh no lord
gordon hurries to embrace her
sobbing and repeating please dont tell me
gordon starts to lead her to the house
margaret emilys neighbor comes hurries helps her comforts her escorting them to the house
stanley and gordon are driving along soweto main road
a years old boy stops the car
to stanley baba i heard youre looking for wellington
hes out baba
where is he
where is he
hes with some boys at dubes shop
thank you very much
youve worked like a man
turning to gordon lets go
stanley turns the car round and drives off at speed
wellington and a few pals are standing outside the shop they greet stanley as they see the car stanley shouts back greeting
take it easy boys
wellington comes to the car
hes limping wearing sunglasses
as hes approaching the car stanley opens the back door for him
he enters and removes the glasses
stanley notices a deep scar from the forehead to the cheek
dont tell me
did they do that to you
wellington has a nervous arm twitch
and nods to the question
anxiously i want to know what happened to jonathan
isnt he out yet
pause i last saw him weeks ago
jonathan is dead
i have to know how he died
sizette and chris with the family at dinner
suzette is passed the rand daily mail newspaper by chris folded at an article headlined what really happened to jonathan ngubene
by melanie bruwer
isnt that tragic
jonathan was such a nice boy
even played with my johan when they were small god
and he was such a nice boy well mannered
you said he was very bright at school
chris helps himself to more
suzette looks at the paper
well this kind of journalism doesnt help the situation
look at her face
what does she look like
the rand daily mail always exaggerates
she passes the paper to ben
he looks at melanies pic ture she looks years old long black hair large dark eyes with a fierce unsettling uncompromising stare a small nose and a generous and sensual
looks quite attractive to me
chris and johan laugh
he surveys the article then with a serious tone
is only the latest in scores of black youths who have disappeared whilst in police custody
what does she expect
theyre out of control
give then an inch and they take a hundred miles
its in their nature
the only language they understand is force
chris jonathan was fifteen like me
would you use force on me
youre not a terrorist
if you were like an increasing number of them youd deserve it
look every time you pick up the newspaper
interrupts focusing on the paper my god one hundred shot
they didnt have to kill them
this bloody bruwer woman reports one hundred shot but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first
i thought the idea was to give them their own areas banstustans
let them live with their own kind
no chance of conflict then
and who would do the work
the work whod do it
you for a start
help me clear these dishes
as johan stands to clear the table
he turns to his father with a smile and shrugs an irritated suzette joins them
the small dark room is crowded
the one oil lamp on the table at the table sits gordon
his glasses on the end of his nose
emily is sitting by the stove
robert stands beside her chair watching listening
the youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed
wellington is sitting beside gordon at the table
there is something wild in his manner
he looks everywhere as if he is scared of being attacked unawares
the black cleaner from john vorster sq
stands near the table
gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten document
on the second day of our detention at john vorster square we were taken to one of the top floors
we were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks
this for a long time
wellington nods and gets more paranoid
the black cleaner puts an understanding hand on his shoulder
on one day me and jonathan
pushes his glasses up his nose
clears his throat
we were asked questions for the whole day and night by capt
stolz and different policemen they never stopped
they tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school that we were working for the a
and got money from overseas
stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find toni mtimkulu everytime they asked question they beat us
it was bad beating
wellington nods again
emily closes her eyes to shut out the image
we told them we had done nothing and didnt know about all the things they are asking us on two occasion they put a wet bag over my head and
i couldnt breathe i thought i was going to die
one day i heard jonathan being beaten
he was screaming and crying and then a noise like tables and chairs being knocked down and capt
stolz shouting you bastard get up do you hear me
ngubene dont pretend here get up
then the next day i heard he had gone to hospital and i never saw him again
theres a long silence
gordon closes his eyes and struggles with his grief
emily sobs robert looks on in anger
then finally gordon offers a pen to wellington who is about to sign the foot of the state ment when
suddenly there is the sound of a truck approaching
wellington rushes to the front window and peers outside then panics fear in his eyes he runs into a bedroom and jumps through the window
everyone in the room is bewildered
the front door bursts open
emily sits impassively look ing at the five policemen two whites and three africans
the youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry
emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns to her chair
stay right where you are
he notices the papers on the table and picks them up
he looks at them and realizes their importance
stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and its occupants
lieutenant venter hands him the papers
he goes through them nodding to himself as he reads silently
he folds them neatly and puts them into his inside jacket pocket
he walks up to gordon
to gordon on your feet
so you must be gordon ngubene
gordon doesnt answer
he turns to the cleaner who automatically stands
we know each other dont we
calmly he paces round the room looking around then when he reaches the bed where the years old girl is watch ing terrified he pulls off the blankets yanks the
girl off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed
the child cries
robert the brother goes to his sister and hugs her as he glares at stolz with anger and hatred
turning to venter gert in daardie kammer
gert that room turning to the other one jaimie in die ander
jamie the other room niks kaptein
nothing captain take the bastards away
the other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty handed
gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as they are handcuffed by the african security police
over his shoulder gordon manages to give emily one last look as hes hustled out of the house
emily sits motionless anger in her face
she can hear the sound of the cars driving away
margaret her neighbor appears at the door
behind bens house are the servants quarters attached to the garage
ben has adapted what would have been a maids room into his study and the adjoining room into a do it yourself workshop
the study has photographs of bens past as a provincial rugby player of his family school staff and trechikoff reproduction
on a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at university
he works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe rack with several pipes
his indulgence is a comfortable easy chair
bens study containing only the figure of ben
hes hunched over his desk looking blankly at the newspaper
his shirt is unbuttoned his jacket slung across his chair
he draws heavily on his pipe wreathing his head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light
he sits in his chair gordons voice rises in his thoughts
that day mister ben sir when they whipped jonathan you also said we can do nothing
god as my witness today i must know what happened and where he lies
his body belongs to emily and me
he mutters more a prayer than a curse
jeezus jeezus jeezus christ
good night papa
johan is entering knocking on the half open door
hes in his pajamas and dressing gown ready for bed
ben looks up at him
johan kisses his father who suddenly clasp his son hard clinging to him for dear life
the boy throws his arms around his dads neck
susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee
shes had a bath her hair is wet and shes in her housecoat
ben and johan dont notice her approach
she watches sympathetically for a moment then
come on johan
time for bed
johan pulls back from his fathers arms
go and get some sleep
the boy nods and leaves
as susan rests the cup of coffee on the desk before ben
she notices the rand daily mail
im proud of you ben
what youve done for that family
but darling you shouldnt take these things to heart so much
what more can you do about it
i dont know
im just tired i suppose
stroking his hair gently come come to bed
her housecoat has fallen open
he lifts his face to hers and kisses her
i will in a minute
ill just put the thoughts of standar six away
they mustnt be lost to posterity
she chuckles satisfied leaving him
he picks up his cup and drinks
he thinks again for a moment
then he removes a photocopied letter from an envelope and reads
seeking the whereabouts of a certain jonathan ngubene regret to inform you we have no record of anyone of that name
afrikaan boys in uniform hunching over their desks writing
on the blackboard the date and history test what year did the first white man arrive in south africa
when was the battle of blood river
who was the zulu chief who was defeated at the battle of isanadlawana
who was the president of the first afrikander republic
give the route of the voortrekkers from the cape
ben walks through the aisles and from time to time oppor tunities to glance at the window at gordons motionless tractor sitting in the field
he turns back and notices a boy focusing on the ceiling
his pen in his mouth trying desperately to find the answers
ben has a smile then crosses to him bends down and strikes a similar pose
the class breaks up into laughter
slapping the students back all right time up
hand in your test
moans from the students
ben appears on the other side of the veranda
he is in cloetes company the little big man
they stop in before bens colleague vivier passing shakes hands with him
a woman arrives and waits
cloete says something to ben then laughs
ben smiles and cloete goes into the office
the woman approaches ben
talks to him
they both turn back to see
emily standing there a soaking headscarf tied native style around her head
ben thanks the woman and crosses the yard
whats happened emily
calmly im sorry baas
but its gordon
stanley is waiting in his car
his sunglasses on his nose
the school bell rings to give the end of the tea inter val
ben walks out with emily to stanleys car
stanley gets out they stare at each other
finally stanley breaks the silence
putting out his hand hows it
i heard about you
ben feels a little uncomfortable
this is stanley makhaya
he helps us all the time
stanley opens the door to emily
dont worry too much emily im sure gordon will be home in a few days
stanley slaps the door with a big laugh
he gets into the car and drives away
gordon stands facing the wall his arm raised
he has wetted his trousers
captain stolz is pacing behind him
lieutenant venter sitting on the edge of the desk is smoking
come on kaffir talk
please ive done nothing
all i tried to do was to find
stolz interrupts him with a blow to his face
as gordon drops his hands the officer shouts to him
up with those bloody arms
we dont like gramophone records here
now who has been giving you informations
gordon doesnt answer
the lieutenant walks slowly to him calmly removes his fag end of cigarette from his lips and stubs it on gordons neck
very calmly why dont you answer the captain han
he walks back to his place
captain stolz opens the door and shouts johannes
gordon has a look of terror
immediately a black security policeman walks in with a bag
johannes goes to wet the bag in a bucket in a corner
lieutenant venter grabs gordon throws him onto a chair and handcuffs his hands behind the chair
stolz is supervising
the lieutenant places the wet bag over gordons head and ties it
gordon starts groaning and wriggling
under the gaze of a uniformed policeman in a bulletproof glass cage ben fills in a slip then hands it to the policeman who then makes a phone call
whilst waiting ben notices a video surveillance camera
just then a year old african girl afro style hair is brought in held on both sides by two white policemen
she is taken into a lift
ben watches them enter the lift and follows the progress of lift to the th floor
the policeman stamps the slip and gives it to ben
somebody will meet you on second floor
ben enters a lift
gordons still sitting on the chair slumped johannes removes the handcuffs as the lieutenant removes the wet bag
gordon is breathing heavily and semi conscious
suddenly captain stolz punches him heavily on the face
gordon drops on the floor with blood gushing from his nose and mouth
captain stolz grabs him by his collar
hysterically come on you bloody black bastard
who has been telling you lies
the phone rings
stolz drops gordon and walks to answer
calmly ill be down immediately colonel
behind the large desk colonel viljeon replaces the tele phone receiver there is a knock on the door and a young policeman ushers in ben
colonel viljoen stands and ex tends a hand
come in mr
du toit come in
how do you do
hes a large friendly man ruddy face gray crew cut
nice to meet you colonel viljoen
i used to watch you play for the transvaal
you were one of the great wing forwards
grinning long time ago
theres a knock on the door
the door opens revealing captain stolz
captain stolz mr
captain stolz nods correctly unsmiling comfortably dressed english style
he shakes hands with ben
then walks toward the window and stands there
as hes watching ben he begins to clean out his pipe with a silver penknife to ben do sit down
ben sinks into a low leather chair before the desk
be hind him he can feel stolzs eyes
viljoen peers through his half moons at the letter in front of him
the pipe scraping continues behind bens ear
all right now gordon ngubene
to put it simply colonel
smiling im always grateful for that
i thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding i could help straighten out
i know him colonel
he works at my school
hes done work for me too
and you feel you know him enough to vouch for him
yes after so many years
gordons not the type to get himself in trouble
hes an honest hard working church going man
youd be surprised how many honest decent church going men we come across during a working day
he leans back comfortably in his chair
its routine mr
du toit a routine enquiry
cleaning up these townships we must leave no stone unturned
i appreciate that but gordon would never
interrupting not an easy task either the press screaming blue murder especially the english
and theyll be the first to squeal if the reds took over make no mistake
rushing back overseas clutching their bloody british passports
have you any idea what will happen here if we dont follow every lead
we have a duty obligation
you have your job we have ours
ben hastens to reassure him
he looks directly at ben frank open trustworthy
colonel believe me im with you all the way
but in this case im sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have unwittingly involved the innocent
after all were all human
we all make mistakes sometimes
viljoen laughs again
we are indeed mr
du toit we are indeed
though theres many who might need persuading as to that fact
while youre here would you mind if i asked you a few questions about ngubene
genuinely colonel id welcome it
theres another pause
the colonel takes out a fountain pen unscrews it and arranges a sheet before him before speaking
shall we start with his son
he died some time ago
viljoen doesnt react
what do you know about gordons activities since jonathans death
the noise stops behind
did gordon ever discuss the death with you
of course he did he was upset
the colonel pauses
but he accepted the truth
he is a religious man
in the end he would have resigned himself to it
you mean he didnt
was he angry
come on colonel
if one of your kids died
nods to family picture on desk and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried wouldnt you be upset
we told him how his son died mr
ben turns back surprised
you have a son mr
the colonel looks up at him
the first sign of steel in his eyes
then back to the papers
the noise starts again behind ben
does he burn and destroy everything he can lay his hands on
no and neither does mine
thats what i cant understand
after everything the government does for them
looks straight at ben think about it mr
were for you not against you
irritably ive never doubted it colonel
its you who appear to be doubting me
youre making me feel like a criminal
theres a moments pause then a burst of laughter
im sorry mr
its force of habit
once a policeman always a policeman eh
more laughter ben joins in
viljoen stands signalling an end to the meeting
johan is sitting waiting in the parked car
the radio on
as soon as were satisfied hes innocent he will be released
we know what were doing mr
you want your wife and that boy of yours to sleep safe tonight dont you
ben nods smiles makes for the door turns
one last favor colonel
gordons wife shes very worried
may she bring him some food and a change of clothes while hes still here
thank you for your help
ill rely on you then
will you find your way out
i think so
i feel much happier now
and give my regards to your father in law tell him well have a drink sometime maybe go to a game
and the door shuts behind him
theres silence for a moment
viljoen staring at the closed door stolz looks expectantly at him
pointing up is the little bird singing yet
im working on it
stolz leaves shutting the door behind him
ben opening his car
johan is sitting in the front seat
as ben gets into the car he glances at the john vorster square building
ben is motoring through and out of johannesburg
johan is silent beside him impatient
i talked to them
gordon will be released soon
the colonel was very understanding
did you see gordon
ben suddenly realizes that he didnt ask to see gordon
did they say anything about jonathan
johan he is dead
we cant do anything for him
dont mention this visit to your mother
suzette and susan in the kitchen arranging the dessert tray
the kitchen is surprisingly neat
laughter is coming from the dining room
what extra mural interest
champion of political detainees
ben comes in to open extra bottles of wine hears susans line
laughing turns to ben is that right papa
thats right suzette
but only one detainee gordon
disbelieving my god
what on earth for
susan leaves the kitchen without a word with the dessert plates on the tray to the dining room
susan reaches viviers and the minister dominee bester with their dessert plates
the candles have burned down amid the detritus of dinner glasses disarranged and dirty the cloth spotted with food and wine and ashes
in addition to viviers dateless and bester and his wife the schools headmaster cloete and his wife
ben hastily uncorking a bottle of wine while talking to suzette
it must be a mistake papa
of course it is
i went down there told them
theyre looking into it
went down where
john vorster square
suzette giggles amazed
you old devil you
does ma know
and youre not going to tell her
she looks at him
i dont want my favorite papa in trouble gordon or no gordon
she ruffles his hair smiles kisses him
they go back into the dining room
not for me oom ben
im drunk enough
ben serves her
susan passes to fetch milk jug and sugar basin from the chine cupboard
bester oh i saw those sheets you liked sally on sale at blooms
will you be free on wednesday afternoon
i have one or two other things to buy
susan enters the kitchen
as she is about to place the jug and basin on the table next to the tray with cups of the same set there is a knock at the door
turning to the door come in
the door opens and stanley steps in
surprised who are you
what do you want
ben and guests hear susan
ben jumps up hurries to the door
viviers starts to follow
ben stops at the door sees stanley turns to viviers
its all right
viviers returns to his seat as ben shuts the door behind him
oh its you
stanley isnt it
to susan thats all right darling
ben leads stanley out of the kitchen closing the door behind him
lewinson is at the phone behind him his wife too is entertaining guests for dinner
a friday night man
im no doctor im not on standby all the bloody time
cant they wait til monday
im standing here with gordons clothing in my hand
there are broken teeth in the pocket
monday may be too late
pause the lawyer has been banned
stanley is waiting his great hand on his hips the other one on emilys shoulder
she is sitting on a chair
obviously stanley doesnt expect a positive response
interested do you mean julius nqakula
pause too bad hes a good lawyer
why are you getting so involved ben
im just trying to help gordon
you represented many cases tell me does this happen often
pause but gordons not political
pause okay dan im sorry for disturbing your weekend
ben replaces the phone
turns to emily and stanley
he agrees to see you tomorrow and will apply to the supreme court for an interdict to stop any assaults on gordon
and well find out whats going on
youre all right lanie
ben can just hear emilys soft voice
thank you baas
come on sisi
tomorrow itll all be first class again
ben has rejoined the party in the lounge
the women are together talking laughing and the men on their own
more coffee anyone
the security police dont arrest people for nothing ben
leave it alone
they could make a mistake
blacks lead double lives
one you see and one you dont
these people surprise you all the time
joking thats what i like about them
were not concerned with blacks
were talking about gordon
a good man and very loyal
serving coffee to cloete and a hard worker too
a hard worker
i had to get rid of him
susan doesnt react
she leaves to join the womens group
i fired him a few days before he was arrested for staying away from work for days
and for the sake of the school i say good riddance
what do you mean good riddance
i have a responsibility for the children
these are troubled times ben we cant trust the natives any more
you have to be extra careful about any influences oom ben
even their churches are breeding grounds for all sorts of evil ideas
gordons not subversive and definitely not a communist
then hes got nothing to worry about
except his three teeth
our government mustnt allow such things to happen
after all its a christian government
turning to bester what do you say dominee
bester doesnt answer
irritably im not talking about the government
i believe in our government damn it
his sharp tone surprises everybody
look i know the police often know more than we do
im not questioning that
im as loyal as the next man
but i do know gordon ngubene
there is something wrong
theres a moments embarrassed silence broken by suzettes entrance with a tray of glasses and a bottle of brandy
putting the tray in front of ben anything else papa
ben starts pouring and offers the first glass to bester
bester shakes his hand
ben hands the glass to viviers
immediately viviers raises his glass and laughingly says oom ben may your problems be small ones
gordon is undoing his trousers
venter roughly drops the trousers and pushing him to the floor
he handcuffs him while johannes pulls off the trousers and underpants and manacles his ankles
johannes fetches a rod
venter goes to a cupboard pulls out two electric wires with electrodes attachments and places them on the desk
all the preparation is done with practiced efficiency
from the adjoining room there are angry shouts of a woman
venter and johannes place the rod between gordons elbow joints and the back of his knees
the door opens
gordon has a look of terror on his face
sorry im late
captain stolz enters carrying a thickish file under his arms goes straight to the desk and sits down
johnannes the table
johannes moves the table in line with the desk
lieutenant venter and johannes lift the trussed gordon and the ends of the rod between the desk and table
youre a heavy shitface
too much mealie porridge
captain stolz holds gordon by the head and swings him like a pendulum
how do you feel today
ready to fly
very calmly captain stolz pulls out some papers from the file
pointing one sheet of paper yes mister ngubene we know about this wellington
pointing another affidavit we know about him
and him now we want the names of the others
and today youre going to tell us
the woman in the next room shouting louder than before that one is a real and tough activist to himself bloody woman
to johannes water
as johannes is fetching the bucket of water
venter goes to the cupboard and stays there
samson is ready captain shall i switch him on
johannes empties the bucket over gordon
stolz attaches the terminal to gordons earlobes
to venter okay
gordon is given a short burst of electric shock
that was a small taste of samson
we have a whole day
a knock at the door
a black policeman in uniform
johnson seroke enters with a letter in his hand
what do you want
a letter for you captain
stolz goes to take the letter and turns to place it on his desk
he notices seroke still standing
what are you bloody well waiting for
no reply captain
get out of here
to gordon now about these affidavits who told you to collect them
who recruited you
gordon mumbles something
he bends forward to hear and gordons swollen puffy eyes hold his gaze
i dont know anything about the youve had your chance
now youre going to shit
to lieutenant in afrikaans reg gert
okay gert gordon suddenly shakes violently and shouts repeatedly
dominee bester is preaching from the pulpit
god created the whole human race so that they could occupy the entire earth
he decreed how long each nation should flourish and what the boundaries of each territory should be
our task is to preserve that creative diversity
behind him in his deacons black tails ben listens with clasped hands
on the opposite side another man is lis tening standing in the love of his family cloete
brothers and sisters like our forebears the voortrekkers who trekked into the wilderness preserve the afrikanere way of life given to them by god
today we also live in times of great danger
let not fear overcome you
cling to the ways of justice and truth preserved by our leaders
so shall god be honored
the faces of his friends scattered among the pews suzette and susan listening intently johan beside her visibly bored his eyes wandering to the cloetes daughter at the end of
so shall the afrikaner people flourish
the organ plays the opening notes to a hymn the congre gation rises and sings
bens garage workshop the door is open
ben and johan are together building a strong desk for johan
the radio offers music to keep them company
susan is confronting ben
why didnt you tell me youd been down to john vorster square
what difference would it have made
im your wife damn it
she turns the radio down irritably
i didnt want to upset you
it upsets me when you share your bloody secrets with a child
johan is embarrassed
ben glances at him
johan shrugs and shakes his head not me
ben planes on
look at me for god sakes
turns to johan johan uit met jou
posing down the plane now what
we have a good life
we may not have everything we might have had if
interrupts if id been more ambitious
looking at him ben whats happening
pause sometimes it seems to me i dont know you
ben looks at her
her tone is panic urgent
she looks afraid
he crosses over to her takes her in his arms
whats happening its something ive never had to face deal with before
hes the gardener for gods sake not one of the family
be patient with me
when gordon is free youll have me all to yourself again
nuzzling into his chest ben
were growing old
ones as old as he feels
i feel young and very attractive
i can still do my duty
she smiles up at him chuckles and then they kiss
smiling indulgently at johans interruption stanleys here papa
oh bloody hell
susan exclaims in angry frustration and flees
stanley appears at the garage door
the news leaves ben speechless
stanley continues in flat emotionless tones
the bastards say he committed suicide
ben recovering from the shock
is that what they told emily poor woman
they didnt tell her
she heard it on the radio like the rest of us
i contacted lewinson immediately
he then rung the police to ask why emily wasnt informed
would you believe it they said they were sorry and they didnt know where to contact her
ben walks slowly out of the garage in deep thoughts stanley follows him
almost to himself god
i never thought gordon could commit suicide
did you understand me
i said they said he committed suicide
how do we know
gordon wasnt a coward
interrupts aggressively what do you mean but
what about timol who they said had jumped from a top floor window
what about ngudle
what about mosala
they all died in that john vorster square
all suicide eh
ben stares at him
there is something like a strange silence between them
ben is confused and stanley is staring at him
ben breaks this embarrassing mood
anything i can do to help
hes got brothers
im his brother man we all are
well take care of everything
with pride thats the african way
stanley id like to see gordon
dont look for trouble man
you know there are riots all over soweto
youre out of it
why dont you stay out
dont you understand
ive got to go
with a mischievous smile you got to go
of course lanie
the last farewell
but we have to be careful
stanley drives sportingly as he talks to ben seated in the back
we expected it
how can you talk like that
a guy gets picked up by the s
hes part of history man
you mean you had no hope you didnt believe hed be released
hopes a white word lanie
its not hope we need
theres silence for a moment
well thank god emily has you to lean on stanley
emily is like my sister
we go back many years
do you belong to the xhosa tribe too
i am an african
looking through the rear mirror comprende
i am an african too
stanley turns abruptly
i was fourteen before i wore shoes except for church
i grew up on a plaas miles from any town
watching sheep and
next youll have me believing we grew up in the same country same laws same freedom same everything
like a tour guide we are now about to leave the white jungle and entering the land of love and glory
the car approaches a huge perimeter notice ben is driven into a different world children playing in dirty streets in wrecks of cars open spaces devoid of vegetables smoke from
large rubbish dumps burnt out skeletons of buses beer halls and buildings
clusters of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance
so this is soweto
like an actor with big expansive gesture land of love and glory lanie
turning suddenly to ben but watch out for the police and army
theyre patrolling all the time
the car follows an isolated broken stretch of tarred road hill cluttered with rusty tins cardboard containers bottles
a group of young children playing under the blinding sun in a muddy ditch notice the big painted butterfly on the hood of stanleys car
they wave and scream at stanley in their language and he screams back at them
two little girls start running heading toward the car
stanley notices the red vw parked in a corner
he man euvers and parks his car nearby
opening door hurry up lanie
a modern funeral parlor with its name painted on the side stanley notices the two little girls with dusty smiling faces standing there waiting for him
checking his pants pockets no sweets today
im sorry babies
the children give stanley a coy disbelieving look as they watch him go with the white man
on the doorstep of the funeral parlor stanley and ben run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag and a camera
the young woman and stanley exchange a quick friendly greeting its melanie bruwer the rand daily reporter and keep moving
ben turns back for a moment
her face seems familiar to him
he would like to talk to her but there is no time
stanley is already inside
ben and stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively dressed in a dark suit
gordons coffin stands as one of many in the room
inside the casket brass fittings white satin lies gordon incongruous ludicrous in a black sunday suit
his hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face barely recognizable is gray the left side distorted blackish purple
there are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips
stanley speaks in an african language to the undertaker
the man opens gordons shirt and reveals the bruised and battered chest
stanley observes ben who looks at the wounds with horror
then another command from stanley and the undertaker opens the shirt to the waist
stanley thanks the man and turns to leave
ben remains a minute
he shuts his eyes tightly
now he saw it
now he must believe it
he must accept that this battered corpse is gordon
as he follows stanley he thanks the undertaker
outside the sunlight the childrens laughter and stanley hands in pockets waiting for ben by the car
the same two little girls approach stanley who gives them some coins they run off happily
ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight
stanley glares at ben who is pale shaken and silent
they get into the car in silence
turning to ben the living close the eyes of the dead
the dead open the eyes of the living
stanley starts the car
please take me to emily
stanley looks at him
look wed took one hell of a chance to get here lets not push it
i really have to see her stanley
stanley drives off
determined looking through rearview mirror i said dont push it
i have to keep you alive
whats more the house is full of mourners
they drive in silence
then what are your thoughts now
what do you mean
aggressively come on
i know you came to see the body
what do you think now
i cannot think
you either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version
for christ sake just get off my back stanley
it was a simple question
stanley turns his radio on and bantu music invades the car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust
the big brassy dodge is threading its way through the leafy calm of the white suburb
the bantu music is still playing on the radio under stanleys animated conversation with ben
you know lanie when you run a taxi especially a pirate taxi like me you have eyes and ears everywhere
even when a policeman farts in his bed you know
people want a reference book a permit to stay in soweto a house anything we taxi drivers know the routes
ill tell you something
a news bulletin in african language interrupts the music
hassiem has been picked up
stanley silently pulls up along the curb and comes to rest at bens gate
hassiem is the doctor we got to represent emily at gordons autopsy
we wanted the truth
ben suddenly realizes the significances
he would have testified
a smart move by your boer brothers
they have silenced hassiem
his report has to be important
we can only use what we have
therefore lewinson must get a very good advocate
pause if only we could get hold of this hassiems report
whats the use
its one big game and we blacks are merely spectators
hey lanie can one be a spectator as hes being kicked around
its not a question of being spectators
the courts are impartial the law is what matters
quite seriously thats what you all say
i have to move man
now be careful
they will put their marks on you
stanley takes an empty cigarette packet from his pocket he writes on it
youll find out
handing the packet to ben in case you need me
dont give your name just say lanie phoned right
ben gets out of the car
now tomorrow at ten
at our smart liberal friends office yeh
stanley drives vigorously away
ben walks slowly and thoughtfully towards his house
he notices susan watching him through the window
he slumps on a chair on the veranda as susan comes out of the house followed by johan they both stand slightly worried at his moroseness
i went to soweto and saw gordons body
they have lied to me my own people they killed him
i saw the body
johan looks horrified
ben youre not a doctor
his death was announced officially
they wouldnt say anything unless they were certain of their facts
more animated facts
theres a doctor who participated at the autopsy
a doctor hassiem and he
interrupts you mean the indian doctor whos been arrested
it was in the five oclock news papa
thats him he represented emily at the autopsy
suddenly desperate ben im sorry about gordons death but please for all our sakes forget about this whole thing
lets get back to a normal life
can i have a drink
you always know what i need
johan hurries into the house
pleading please ben im frightened
she turns and walks into the house leaving ben
the large soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for burials
the chief mourners emily robert his sister margaret four relatives and stanley are standing on either side of the priest
gordons coffin is in the grave several wreaths are on the side of the grave
there are about fifteen hundred mourners and half are youths
there are several local reporters and overseas television reporters
the police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge of the crowd some in battle dress and some with dogs
before i conclude i have to say we are tired of making this journey every day sometimes twice in one day burying our children and those like our departed brother
ngubene who were merely seeking the truth and those who have been denounced by traitors amongst us and those who have been brutally killed for no reason yes i shall say it by the police
let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of god let them listen to our peaceful and just demands let them be humble and go down
on their knees and seek forgiveness then listen to god
the crowd roars amanda
the priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in
at the end of the hymn
we will have a few words from mr
pilani our father and leader
the crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised
the funeral has now become a political demonstration
pilani who is a dignified educated years old walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners
he is handed a loudspeaker
a senior police officer threads his way through the crowd a loud hailer in his hand
as he reaches the grave he turns
the crowd is quiet
he says something to the priest then addresses the crowd
the funeral is over
i order everyone to go home
this is not a political rally
i repeat disperse
as though by signal the police start attacking the mourners with truncheons and dogs
there is pandemon ium women screaming people falling into graves or covering in them
the priest and stanley lead emily and the family away in the opposite direction
the press and television are recording the scene
the police start throwing tear gas canisters
there is no confrontation the crowd is fleeing in all directions
one television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave by a very young policeman his round recordist is pulled up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord
melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes
ben susan watching the main evening news bulletin on tv
on the screen a sequence of rioting
despite repeated warnings young blacks attacked the police with rocks and petrol bombs
five policemen were injured
susan briefly glances at ben
several arrests were made
one youth was killed and five wounded
follows the newscaster and then reports this morning there was a serious disturbance at the funeral of gordon ngubene
susan leaves the room
the detainee who committed suicide by hanging himself at john vorster square
an overseas television cameraman broke an arm during the disturbance
its been reported that several people had been killed by a car bomb in belfast northern island
ben turns off the tv and stays in his thoughts
stanley and ben are driving in the outskirts of johannesburg
stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds which he maintains through the streets of soweto
using his horn to scatter people out of his way to the anger and indulgence of others
the car screeches to a halt outside emilys house
stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled neighbors
and acknowledges the friendly shouts of children
stanley looks around then goes back to the car opens the back door leans and says something
suddenly to everyones astonishment ben crawls out of the car stanley hustles him into emilys house
stanley waves at the people a sign of assurance then closes the door behind him
ben stands awkwardly for a moment taking in the room and the people in it
he then walks over to emily who is standing at the table
he goes to shake her hand
how are you emily
well thank you mr
eh thats father masonwane our priest and thats margaret from next door
ben nods at them
stanley sits himself down
raising his hand in greeting mfundisi
sister to ben please sit down
take this chair the other one is broken
apologetically i didnt mean to disturb you
ive come to talk to you
as she sits on the broken chair yes its good
what i want to know is why did they kill him
he didnt do them nothing
you know mr
ben sir i washed his whole body for he was my husband
and i know a man who killed himself he doesnt look like that
master you must understand shes still raw inside
robert walks in looks at ben and walks into his bedroom to fetch something then as hes about to go out robert where are you manners today
dont you greet visitors
robert stops momentarily and looks at ben with hostility and hurries out of the room banging the door
im sorry for his rudeness
to ben you have to understand whats happening to our children today theyre like wasps when you burn their nest
our children are saying thats enough
things have to change in this country
they accuse us of being cowards
emily i have really come to assure you that i will do all i can to help you find out what really happened to jonathan and your husband we cannot
bring them back to life but we can make sure that this sort of thing wont ever happen again
you mean well sir but its better to forgive
if we keep the pain alive then hate and bitterness will remain with us
the air must be cleared
so we can breathe again
the air can only be cleared if we forget about yesterdays thunder
ben is right
its not that i want to go on with this thing because its a bad thing that jonathan died that gordon died thats hard enough to bear but i can
but they covered gordons name with dirt and we must clean it up else hell never have peace in his grave
to ben you must understand for us suicide is a cowards way out how do they say its a cop out
gordon wasnt a coward and well prove that
we have a very good advocate for the inquest
his name is de villiers
i have confidence in him and the truth will come out
the truth must be known
they killed my husband who wouldnt hurt a fly and they killed jonathan who was only a child
those people who did it are sinful people who dont know what theyre doing
mfundisi what are you saying now
we must help them
thats the only way
they need our help not hate but love
i pity them and i ask the lord to help me so i can learn to love them
if thats what you preach in your church you will soon be starving
they covered his name with dirt
arent you afraid sis emily
in the end one grows tired of being afraid
ben has been listening to the discussion with interest this being the first time he has heard africans talking seriously about their problems
emily stanley and i will do all we can
as i said we have a good advocate
everyone involved with gordons death will be questioned and all thats known regarding what happened in john vorster square will come out
how can anything come out of that john vorster square
who there will say yes we killed the boy and gordon
lawyers ask questions
and dont policemen lie
thank you mr
ben sir for what youre doing
standing im pleased i came
to ben as he goes to the door wait let me check the situation
he opens the door and walks out
a small group of youngsters are there hands thrust into their pockets hanging around in a stony silence
robert is standing by the door
stanley calls one of them and talks to him the boys look around and say something
as stanley goes back to the door passing robert he ruffles his hair
to robert take it easy
then to ben its okey dokey but hurry
ben hurries out of the room
the children stare at him
as they go to the car do i
interrupts yes on the floor man
stanley opens the back door for ben
who crouches on the floor
some of the boys snicker and one bursts out laughing
as stanley gets into the car he shouts at them okay
kids time to go home
shouting back sure bra stanley
take it easy
stanley drives off at speed
stanley is driving they have left soweto
ben still on the floor
are we still in soweto
why dont you look for yourself
ben rises and sees that theyre at least a mile out
he is not amused
sitting up what the hell are you playing at
as he bursts into loud laugh precautions lanie
exposing dont call me lanie
what does that mean anyway
still laughing you will not understand lanie
they drive off
susan and ben are in bed
susan is in bens arms she is relaxed and loving
ben talks quietly and calmly
i think i am without awareness
i have always cared about people call it a social conscience
but my visit to gordons house made me experience another dimension of human conditions
the poverty ja
no i expected that
but listening to them talk made me realize that i did not know the blacks
now i question my attitudes my concerns as ben and complacence as a white person
ben i know your anxiety about the inquest
all will be cleared up in a legal way and youll be back to your normal self
now lets turn off the lights
susan kisses ben tenderly
the inquest of gordon ngubene
conducted by magistrate klopper
in the witness box is dr
jansen the state pathologist giving evidence
advocate de villiers is cross examining
jansen you are a state pathologist of many years standing and i have no doubt a well qualified pathologist
could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased
i found that death had been caused by the application of force to the neck consistent with hanging
theres a vigorous reaction to this around the court which gives us a chance to discover the crowd in the white section of the public gallery are ben and about
eight other whites
the black section is filled to capacity with a few stand ing
in the front row is sitting stanley next to margaret
at the entrance a white policeman
in the press section are several reporters amongst them melanie bruwer the rand daily mail reporter
colonel viljoen and several policemen are sitting around the court
you are sure about the hanging
this pressure on the neck could it also have been exerted in other ways
it could but it is not for me to speculate
of course not doctor
the list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long bruises swellings abrasions broken rib lacerations etc
how long before death do you estimate he received these injuries
i couldnt say exactly
some were fourteen to twenty days old others three to four days and others even more recent
even more recent
i understand you had a dr
hassiem present at the autopsy
there were two reports ours and his
did they tally
yes it was
in most respects
on stanley listening
isnt it normal practice to have one report
why did dr
hassiem decide to draw up a separate report
if he really co signed yours
thats for him to answer
i would very much like to dr
jansen but hes been detained you know of course that he represented the ngubene family
theres a murmur around the court
ben looks across at viljoen who returns his gaze smiling
the police physician giving evidence
herzog did you examine the deceased
yes one day captain stolz called me in
the man had toothache
aggressive thats all
uncomfortable as far as i could tell yes
you didnt examine him thoroughly
why should i
the man was perfectly healthy just complaining of toothache
i extracted three decayed teeth and gave him aspirin for the pain
did the captain or anyone else assist you during the examination
i cannot remember
more aggressive and accusing dr
herzog tell us
have you been intimidated by the security police or did you deliberately cooperate with them in playing their disgusting little game of hide and seek
jumping up from his seat i protest your worship
advocate de villiers will you refrain from insinuations
thank you doctor herzog
im sure gordon ngubene was extremely grateful
herzogs face is impassive
on crowd reacting
during the hubbub de villiers and the state advocate trade places
the courtroom is quiet
thank you your worship
id like to call captain stolz
theres a buzz from the spectators as captain stolz walks up to the witness stand
hes given a bible
on ben watches him
in witness box swearing in afrikaans
youre a police officer stationed at john vorster square
thats right your worship
you arrested gordon ngubene
could you describe what happened
acting on information we had received i went to the house of the deceased accompanied by lieutenant venter lieutenant botha and three native members of the security force
this was about p
i informed ngubene that he was under arrest under article of the terrorism act
he then became violent and resisted arrest
a certain force had to be applied to restrain him
on stanley listening
on ben listening
we found several incriminating documents
these pointed to his involvement with the a
and activities endangering the security of the state
on ben looking at stolz and shaking his head bewildered
was the deceased ever assaulted to your knowledge
he was always treated with courtesy and correctness
but one time we had cause to use force against him
it was the day before his death
the deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression
he tried to jump through the open window of my office
he was acting like a mad man
it took six of my men to restrain him and he had to be manacled hand and foot for his own safety
but once he calmed down he was ready to make a statement about his activities
the next morning we found him dead in his cell
is the statement in evidence
no your worship
it cant be disclosed in court without damaging our investigation but i would like to offer into evidence a suicide note written by the deceased
louw taking it from his file on the table
stanley and margaret listening
i prefer to die rather than betray any more of my friends
he hands it to the court clerk
theres uproar at this
thank you your worship
advocate de villiers
ben is disgusted
he looks about the court as if seeking allies
his eyes meet melanies just for a second theres recognition then he returns to de villiers
advocate de villiers cross examining captain stolz
thank you your worship
captain stolz you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness then how do you account for the injuries found on the body
sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes
the gallery screams its objections
stanley leans forward and grins across the partition at ben
the magistrate warns the crowd
finally the gallery quiets down
you say he tried to jump out of the open window
are there no bars to prevent such an act
they had been removed for repair
and why did he wish to jump out
because you were torturing him
he wasnt tortured
perhaps it was the toothache then
no reaction from stolz
you said you seized incriminating documents at the deceaseds home can you produce them to see how subversive he was
to magistrate those documents cannot be introduced as evidence your worship in view of the fact that state security is involved
the magistrate makes a note
i put it to you captain that the only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his efforts to establish what happened to his son jonathan allegedly shot
during a riot although several witnesses are prepared to testify that he died in detention one month later
jumping up i protest
this would support my case that an innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable circumstances
if it please your worship
this unwarranted slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable
and based i may say on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the present inquest
turning on louw if the police are really interested in retaining an unsullied reputation they should not object to the real facts being presented
thank you captain
the real facts are being presented as the following affadivits prove
they are all by detainees who testify that they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his detention to the time of his death and on all
occasions he was in good health
as the documents are passed to the magistrate they are scorned by de villiers
imperviously he requests i trust the signatories of these documents
are available to corroborate their evidence in person
detainee in the witness box
he swears in zulu
de villiers holds his signed affidavit
archibald when did you first meet gordon ngubene
looking at black crowd then to de villiers i never saw gordon ngubene
a sudden stillness in the court
are you saying that you didnt sign this statement
i never met mr
they forced me to sign
captain stolz he hit me many times with a rubber hose
he said he would kill me less i signed
this is what he did to me
he pulls up his shirt his back is covered in bruises
the crowd cannot restrain itself any longer
ben is aghast by what he sees
thank you mr
uncomfortable no thank you your worship
as archibald leaves the witness stand held by a special branch officer he raises his fist in salute and shouts to the crowd amandla
the crowd responds ngawethu
ben looks at archibald
he is very impressed by this strength in the prisoners eyes
an officer of the court shouts at the crowd silte in die koort silence in court bailiffs collar a few of the loudest protesters and pull them with brutality out
of the courtroom
to town wearily may we put up the second signatory
louw confers hurriedly with the prosecution officers then turns back to the court
your worship the other three signatories cannot appear for reasons of state security
he sits down bland examining his papers
your worship id like to recall captain stolz
as captain stolz returns to the stand he crosses archibald being handcuffed by the s
ben watches him passing by the detainee straight im passive without a look to him
captain youre still under oath you took archibalds statement
was it voluntary
im sure youll say it was then how did he come by the injuries on his back
he fell down the stairs a few days ago
fell down the stairs
you should do something about those stairs captain so many people fall on them
the crowd laughs
to the magistrate your worship may i be excused
i have to escort detainee archibal back to john vorster square
you may captain and thank you
to the crowd i think thiss a good moment to adjourn well reconvene at two thirty
emily margaret stanley and a man are sitting outside the court eating fish and chips
there are various africans sitting around for their lunch break
ben and dan lewinson having a light lunch in a nearby cafe
buoyant de villiers is making mincemeat of them
hes very good
his cross examination has got them rattled
its obvious to anybody
the evidence is clear
pause did you see archibals back
he didnt have to tell the truth
dan lewinsons dry laugh catches in his throat
thats what stolz is saying to him right now in his torture room
advocate de villiers and a dignified emily in the witness stand
captain stolz lied
my husband never fight the police when he was arrested
they were rough with him pushing him and threatening
when your husbands clothes were given to you in what condition were they
there was blood on them and in the back pocket i found three broken teeth
ngubene you have seen the note thats said to have been written by your husband
do you recognize the writing
firmly thats not how my husband writes
strongly he never wrote that letter they lie
thank you mrs
he shakes his head
facing the magistrate and in firm voice they killed my husband and son
on ben satisfied
to a policeman next to viljoen will you take the woman out
id like to call my last witness
graces name is called
she is an attractive years old girl
as she passes by ben he watches her with concern her face looks familiar
of course he remembers having seen her at john vorster square the first time he went there to meet the colonel
grace nkosi is the african girl the two security officers were lifted to the ten flour
he recognizes her
grace nkosi in the witness stand
she swears in xhosa
were you ever detained
yes sir at john vorster square
for how long
can you tell us what happened to you during that time
i was interrogated by many special policemen but mainly captain stolz and the one they call venter
as they were searching somebody i know they wanted me to tell them where that person was hidden
as i refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok
after some time i fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach
on ben obviously shocked
i spot blood and they try to make me lick it
then captain stolz threw a wet towel and started twisting it around my neck
she illustrates until i lost consciousness
they did this several time and the last one captain stolz said come on meid speak up or do you want to die like gordon ngubene
a few days later i was released
on melanie taking notes
thank you miss grace
thats all your worship
rising and looking at grace for some seconds you made that up
say you made it up
its the truth
i have nothing more to say
louw sits down
we shall adjourn until tomorrow morning
ill hear the arguments and give the verdict
the crowd stands and starts to leave the courtroom
a silent black crowd emily margaret stanley anxiously awaiting the verdict
today the public gallery is more crowded than before
i wish to thank both advocates for conducting this case without rancour and in the best traditions of the south african legal profession
on bens face
on dan lewinsons face
on viljoen and stolzs faces
i have listened to all the evidence and the arguments
to begin with i have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the security police had been guilty of assault or
any irregular conduct on the deceased
there were indications that ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be restrained with force
there was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck consistent with hanging
consequently i find that gordon ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a
criminal offense on the part of any person
viljoen and stolz smiling shaking hands with advocate louw in congratulations
the predominantly black crowd obviously dissatisfied with the verdict discussing it as it moves slowly towards the main entrance
in the crowd stanley margaret and emily controlled dignified but obviously pained
totally depressed walking up to emily
to ben over noise of the discussion dont worry man
theres another day
ben leans towards emily
im sorry emily
several press photographers are taking pictures osten sibly of emily the widow
stanley gently guides emily out of the building
ben who is following is besieged by the insistent reporters shouting mister du toit how do you know mrs
mister du toit can you answer is it true he was a terrorist
ben tries to get through
mister du toit what do you think of the verdict
do you believe the police
melanie appears grabs ben and pushes him away through them
hang on melanie im coming with you
shouts back fuck off
the press is still pursuing them
as ben and melanie reach melanies car my car is over there
opening the car never mind your car
lets get away from these vultures
they get into the car and as they drive away melanie introduces herself
by the way im melanie bruwer
obviously of the rand daily mail
i read your article about jonathan
ten out of ten mr
i know about you too
uncomfortable you do
we have a mutual friend
the mortuary in soweto
pause the ambiguous stanley
a big black rough uncut diamond
dont be fooled by his happy go lucky attitude
theres much more to him
he couldnt have given you a glowing report of me
suddenly aggressive im sorry but where are we going
i thought a cooling drink at my house
on the defensive mrs
bruwer im not
interrupts i promise you
im not after an interview or anything like that
i really must go home
du toit and youll meet my darling father
she smiles again
a disarming smile
melanie drives into the yard
the house is an old colonial style house amidst flowers bushes and trees a controlled wild garden
a figure is bent over a beehive
a large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features
melanie stops the car in the driveway
pointing from the car there he is by the eucalyptus tree on the left
thats old bruwer
they get out of the car and walk towards him
how long have you lived here
oh about twenty one years
i love this house
without looking up is that you melanie
of course dad
i want you to meet a friend
does anyone have a friend nowadays
he straightens up and throws the net over his head and studies ben
bruwer is seventy years old an interesting face with a goatee beard
du toit dad
do you like bees
smiling i have nothing against them
to ben be careful i can see philosophy coming
you shut up
to ben let me tell you about bees and for that matter ants a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose based on the common good
a course from which he cannot be deflected
greed ambition they mean nothing to him
he lives solely to serve his fellow bee
what about individuality dad
theres the rub my girl
theres the rub
one of these days ill ask the bees
im sure they have the answer
now you two run along
he replaces his net and continues with the hive
a drink dad
ive been peeing too much this morning
as they walk toward the house thats my daddy
melanie and ben enter the house
the bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers of books on shelves on tables on the floor paintings records african sculptures
on the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous speakers
a settee a chess set
the furniture is old and well used dominated by a large leather club chair two big cats sleeping on it
its civilized pandemonium
gesturing to the room now you see in what environment i was spawned
ben looks at the shelves and smiles
please sit down on that chair
pointing to club chair thats dads
interrupts mischievous a brandy
looking at her surprised then smiling no thanks a beer will be fine
melanie goes into the kitchen leaving ben
he cannot forget what he heard and what he saw in the court
she returns barefooted with two beer mugs and hands one to ben
the mugs are the few things that dad brought from germany
he studied philosophy in tubingen and berlin before the last war
i thought they were german
melanie sits her legs propped up on the settee hugging her knees
du toit tell
interrupts please call me ben
all right ben tell me why are you so depressed
you really expect a different verdict
disgruntled why do you ask
can you understand it
of course i understand it
what could they have
im not cynical
im only trying to be realistic
tell me miss bruwer
ben and melanie thats fair
tell me do you believe in the notion of justice
lighting a cigarette ill never stop believing
but in this country ive learned its pointless to look for it in certain situations
what use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations
and you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well
youve got to know your enemy first
thats a tall order know injustice
know the enemy
it seems i have a long haul ahead of me
not at all ben
you have already taken the first steps
pause welcome to south africa
susan is sitting at the dressing table
she is applying cleansing cream to her face
she is relaxed
ben is getting ready for bed
did you enjoy the bobotie
when i heard the verdict on the news i knew youd be upset
softer i wanted to make you something special
thoughtful thank you darling
susan starts to remove the cream
im glad its all over
you take things to heart too much
ben comes and stands behind susan looking at her through the mirror
trying to keep control of himself they killed gordon first they kill jonathan and then him
how can they get away with it
soothingly now come on ben
gordons death upset me too
but the magistrate had all the facts
he must know what hes doing hes had years of experience
the case has run its course and nobody can do anything more about it
its all over and done with
looking at her im not so sure about that susan
susan swivels around and faces ben
im damned well sure
its over ben
you better get that into your head
ben just stares at her with seething anger
she stands up and starts being hysterical
a teacher always a bloody teacher
you never moved yourself for us
but for the blacks oh yes
whose side are you on ben
and im sick and tired of those natives coming here
why dont you bloody well go and live in soweto
ben strides out of the room
following and shouting now where are you going
without looking soweto
then shuts the door behind him
susan stands stupefied
theres the sound of the spare ben is standing in the middle of the room in the dark
on the wall behind him is a young suzettes picture
after a few seconds ben moves slowly to the bed and sits on it still in deep thought
slow move to a and its a saturday morning
a shopping center in a white suburb
ben goes into a newspaper shop
there are two children buying sweets and a woman leaving
the proprietor is an afrikaner in his middle age
more meneer van de merwe
morning mister van de merwe
in offhand manner more meneer du toit
our boys gave the eastern province a thrashing
ben realizes that the man is not his usual conversational self
is anything wrong
ben goes to pick up an afrikaans newspaper and the rand daily mail
walking up to counter and a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners
the man gets them and takes a note from ben and gives him his change
by then a man is waiting
see you tomorrow
as he walks out the other man turns around to watch him
ben walks out of the shop
the newspaper under his arm
a group of three middle aged women turn to look at him
ben didnt see them
a little further on he meets mrs
he tries to greet her but she walks straight by
further on he notices two men obviously talking about him
then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they pass him
he begins to wonder whats it all about and spontaneously checks his clothes
susan and suzette sit there
suzettes holding a news paper the ossewa susans thoughtful her face is red and discomposed obviously she had cried
the phone rings but they deliberately ignore it
ben appears with the newspapers under his arm sees suzettes sports car and hurries to join them
suzette doesnt even give him a chance to kiss her
jumping up and showing the cover of ossewa now papa this is going too far
how could you
surprised hows that suzette
ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover
a picture of himself and emily outside the courtroom
the two faces are close together with the notes emily ngubene wife of native who died in detention comforted by a friend of family mr
ben du toit
and in parenthesis see page two
he throws the ossewa on a chair and checks into the rand daily mail
inside there is a long article with emilys picture titled the face of grief
ben folds up the newspapers and shakes his head
he suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside
you didnt stop to think of the family
poor mother how can she face anyone
and tomorrow is sunday
johan steps into the veranda
whats everybody yelling about
you listen papa just tell me why
recognizing his father in the photo johan has picked up the newspaper from the chair
do you really think i specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture
and whats more its distorted
whats distorted about it
your face is practically touching that meids face like you were about to kiss her
disgruntled suzette pull yourself together
today the whole country has seen that photograph
we your children are going to suffer
at this very moment chris is negotiating with the provincial council
would you like to see them cancel it
you have no feeling papa
she leaves in rage
conciliating whats papa done anyway
if something happened to him wouldnt you be upset
standing up not enough johan to throw myself into the garden boys arms
that goes without saying
trying to joke there must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper
before she can stop herself susan slaps him across the face although not hard
johan leaves without a word
she clutches her hand shocked at having it against him
the phone starts to ring
susan runs out sobbing
ben looks at her then walks into the living room to pick up the phone
into phone who
i dont know you and have nothing to say to you
no thank you for your advice
he puts the phone down
the phone rings again
ben picks it up and waits
its you viviers
i appreciate it
any thank you
he replaces the receiver and is about to light his pipe when the phone rings again
id like to say
cloete may i ask what on earth has the picture to do with politics
im sorry mr
cloete i have to go
he replaces the telephone and walks out of the house
the phone keeps ringing
the farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of acres
in the distance theres a range of mountains
several cattle are grazing herded by a poorly clad african and his son aged years
bester and ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the cattle kraal with calves penned in
everything was examined in depth in court
did you read the papers dominee
were you happy with what came to light
and is it the magistrates work to pretend that the facts which came to light didnt exist
was it really facts ben
just then the african herdboy walks up to them taking off his lattered greasy hat
what is it tom
does the baas want me to bring the bull now
tom hurries away
i bought a bull last week
i know gordon
what they said about him that he was plotting against the government is a downright lie
he was only doing what i would have done as a father searching for his son
no one but god can see whats in our hearts
isnt it presumptuous to pretend we can speak for someone else
have you no faith in your fellow men dominee
dont you love your neighbor
confronting ben wait a minute instead of criticizing blindly dont you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we have
suppose this had been russia what do you think would have happened then
whats the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom
the one man they allowed to speak for himself that young archibald chigorimbo didnt he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement
and the girl who spoke of her own torture
that did not refer to our situation in this south africa
do you know what i believe in dominee that once in ones life just once one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it
one can gain the world and still lose ones soul
tea must be ready
bester and ben walk towards the house still in conversation
the staff is having coffee during morning break in the staff room
the room has several easy chairs a table with the morning newspapers on it
the walls have pictures of south african scenes
there are several conversations in afrikaans
this is the first morning since the photograph
ben walks into the staff room
the conversations stop
everyone looks at him with hostility
the teachers all place their cups on the table and quietly file out of the room
ben pours himself a cup of coffee as he takes his first sip cloete looks in sees him
he walks in
i hope you dont mind us talking here
i dont mind mr
ill come to the point
you cant imagine how shocked i was by that scandalous photograph in the ossewa
the woman lost her husband she was shattered with grief
a kaffir woman du toit
angrily i cant see that it makes any difference
have you gone color blind then
and what about the apartheid laws
our first responsibility as teachers is the reputation of the school the pupils entrusted to us
we have to be an example to them in and out of this school yard
ben looks at him calmly
i thought i had warned you about involving yourself with kaffirs
obviously you didnt heed my advice
thats all i have to say for now
cloete walks out of the room
viviers hurries into the room he is late for his coffee
morning oom ben
acknowledging greeting viviers
pouring coffee private coffee with cloete
ben picks up the copy of the ossewa with the photograph and shows it to viviers
ben stops the car in the bruwer driveway
from the driving seat he searches the garden for bruwer
he walks up to the front door and knocks but theres no reply
he goes round to the back and finds the old man on his knees weeding his vegetable garden
good afternoon professor
looking up melanie isnt home
ben du toit
you have a nice vegetable garden
you mean the area or the produce
what plants are these
whats the world coming to
its herbs cant you see
thyme there oregano over there feunel next to the tomatoes sage here and rosemary somewhere
poor plants they re not in their ideal soil or climate
next time ill bring some soil from the mountain of zeus
perhaps the old mans holiness will do the trick
he throws down the small weeding fork
come you are just the person to sample my greengage wine
i dont suppose youve ever tasted it
im sure im the only person in the country making greengage wine
he leads ben to the two old chairs by the back wall
he enters the kitchen and returns with a bottle of greengage wine and two glasses
as he pours the first bottle this year and you dont have to tell me if you like it or not
tell me did you ever study philosophy
ive read a few books
taking a sip not bad in fact quite good
now where was i
oh i was going to say after decades of philosophy i find myself being forced back to the earth
do you know ben were all living in the spell of abstractions
hitler apartheid the great american dream the lot
what about jesus
referring to the wine you dont have to finish it
lying its quite nice
melanie has told me a little about you
its not an easy road you have chosen
i feel i have no choice
bruwer farts loudly ben is taken aback but the professor continues
of course you have a choice
one always has a choice
only thank god you made the choice you did
but all i want to say is keep your eyes open young man
we are both boers ben
we know how hard our people worked to get a toehold on this land it was a good life
now look at the mess
its all systems and no god
sooner or later people start believing in their way of life as an absolute unmutable fundamental a precondition
saw it with my own eyes in germany a nation running after an idea
sieg heil sieg heil
i left there thirty years ago because i couldnt take it any longer
and now i see it happening in my own country step by step
this sickness of the great abstraction
he farts and sips his greengage wine
ben is so fascinated by the old mans conversation he didnt react
he is learning form his old afrikaner
what you say is very interesting and important
take for example the way the government is handling the electorate like a bloody donkey
carrot in front and kick at the backside
the carrot is apartheid dogma
the kick is quite simply fear
black peril red peril whatever name you want to give it
pause fear can be a wonderful ally ben
i talk too much i always do with younger people they dont fall asleep to me
laughs we afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye and look around us and at ourselves
you are right
we still have time
history should teach us about those who regarded themselves as the chosen people
standing up comforted professor bruwer may i say i have needed to hear somebody say some of the things you said
i still have hope for our country
if you lose that you have lost everything
ill get back to the earth
shaking hands thank you
ill tell that hot head daughter of mine that you came to see her
ben takes his leave
ben and dan lewinson are sitting opposite cups of coffee in front of them
there is absolutely no doubt that they were killed in custody
those responsible must be punished whoever they are or whatever their rank
the problem is laying our hands on them
tell me dan we lost at the inquest what next
the family can file a civil claim
what does that entail
to put it briefly it means we have to have witnesses affidavits and any information relating to the arrest and death of gordon
we also need similar information on jonathan
you see ben for example stolz figures in both cases
thats one link at least
i know what i have to do
its lunch time and the working population of joburg has paused for lunch
ben and melanie are sitting at a table outside
the cafe is on the outskirts of a very affluent part of johannesburg
i didnt think you would want to have anything to do with me after that crap in the ossewa
you didnt write it
im a journalist perhaps tarred with the same brush
so what happened
i can imagine
the family the dominee colleagues neighbors
a distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer du toit is a leper
thats why i called on you the other day i needed to talk to somebody rational
thanks for the compliment
but remember youre an afrikaner youre one of them
in their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor
you are an afrikaner too and your articles in a liberal english paper
my mother was a foreigner im not pure wragte afrikaner
they dont expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you
what kind of loyalty
until the deaths of jonathan and gordon i gave all the loyalty i could give laager loyalty
you know melanie we afrikaners have always lived in our laager we have not seen whats beyond the mountains
has it ever occurred to you that the volk may be scared to leave the laager
thats the downfall of this country
so where do you go from here
we carry on
there has to be justice
we lost at the inquest so we pursue them in a civil action
i consulted the attorney dan lewinson
we know each other well
du toit if you knew what were working with every day of our lives and what were up against you would understand why we have to be so thorough
however you go about it
i can understand youre upset about having your house searched but
i wasnt thinking about myself
what are you talking about then mr
my thoughts captain im sure are an open book to you
stolz picks up a book of picassos peace paintings starts leafing through it carefully scrutinizing each page
he puts the picasso book carefully back in the place he took it from
an interesting book picasso not one im familiar with
not on your list of banned books captain
stolz doesnt react
the search continues in the living room
susan is standing pale rigid shocked
if youre keeping anything from us we can turn this whole house upside down if we want to
we have all the time in the world
throwing ben a warning daggers look im afraid i dont understand
nothing from stolz
one of the men starts to roll up the carpet to look under it
susan has to move out of his way
gently to susan why dont you go upstairs
im afraid she has to stay where we can see her in case she wanted to warn someone
my fathers an m
all four tires of bens car have been slashed to ribbons
ben and johan are there
ben takes a file from under a toolbox and measures it carefully against the drawer base
then he selects a piece of wood approximately the size of the drawer and tries it for size
we should be in no doubt thats hes constructing a hiding place
susan is preparing a roast
theres music from a trans istor radio
susan is startled by a voice her fathers bens father in law
she turns off the radio
roast beef i hope its like your mothers
he is aged about years thick set
she rushes to him and he hugs her tightly and practically lifts her off the floor
she kisses him
she disentangles herself and goes to the living room as excited as a child the mother is standing by two cases smiling
susan hugs her
she holds her mother at arms length inspecting her
the perfume and a new hairstyle
your father insisted that i dont disgrace you
hugging her again i expected you a little later
she insisted we start early
where is ben
walking in with golf club bag in the study
ill get him
have you put on weight susan
please dont say that papa
ben walks in
didnt hear you arrive
he shakes hands with father in law
how are you ben
he goes to mother in law
he kisses her on the cheek
and how are you ma
well ben still have trouble with my feet
why doesnt everyone sit down
ill prepare some tea
i baked a cake
she goes to the kitchen
ben and father in law are having a drink after a round of golf outside the club house
im getting tired of the trek to cape town and then back to pretoria
if i had my way parliament and government would be in the same city
theres nothing wrong with pretoria
i thought youd prefer cape town the sea and table mountain
thats for holidays
anyway ben one of the reasons for this visit was that i wanted to have a discussion with you
its that photograph in the papers
ben a thing like that could be an embarrassment for someone who is a member of parliament
its a grievous day when ones familys behavior comes between him and his duty to the fatherland
are you blaming me for trying to help those people
ive been doing that all my life be they black or white
but no member of our family has been seen with a kaffir woman before ben
father signals the african waiter for more drinks
i am glad you mentioned it father
because id like to discuss the whole thing with you
first theres the matter of gordon ngubene himself
what about him
i thought the case was closed
the inquest didnt clear up half of what happened
we have no irrefutable evidence yet but we have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up
youre jumping to conclusions ben
i know what im talking about
the black waiter places the drinks on the table
all right ben im listening
perhaps i can use my influence
but youll have to convince me first
if they have really nothing to hide why is the special branch going out of its way to intimidate me
practically choking whats this about special branch
they raided the house they are tapping my phone and i have been threatened by one of the officers
im sorry ben id rather not have anything to do with this sort of thing
if the special branch are involved they must have good reasons
its exactly what i said father when jonathan first got into trouble
of course they have good reasons hushing up how gordon died and how his son died
angry ben how could you side with the enemies of your people
you mean youre prepared to sit back and allow an injustice to be done
his face grows purple its you ben who talk about injustice
a man who teaches history at school
did you forget what our people have suffered under the english oppressors
now that we have at along last come to power in our own land
now were free to do to others what they used to do to us
what will you do if you were a black man in this country today father
dont you realize what the government is doing for the blacks
its a slow process ben
one of these days the whole bloody lot of them will be free and independent in their own parts of the land the bantoustans what can be more just than
but theyre not ready yet
the waiter returns father in law pays the bill and as he rises to leave he puts a paternal arm on bens shoulder
we have nothing to be ashamed of before the eyes of the world my boy
standing his golf bag in his hand we dont
im not sure were going to survive
they walk away
dont underestimate us ben
our power of survival
we are afrikaners
stanley is parked in a street corner in the last white suburb on the way to soweto
ben pulls up in his car behind stanleys
he walks over to stanleys car and enters the back
stanley smiles as he points at his watch
they drive off towards soweto
doesnt matter lanie as long we are on time for the revolution
the special branch searched my house four days ago
searches your house
chuckles did they take anything
a few journals letters nothing much
just wanted to scare me thats all
dont be so sure
they may think youre onto something big
theyre not that stupid
lanie dont you believe it nothings as stupid as the old s
if they decide its a bomb theyre looking for you can shove a turd in their face and theyll swear to god its a bomb
making ben smile
and did they
they tried too hard
stanley laughs again
offers his huge hand shake man
join the club
ben accepts the handshake
susan sitting on an armchair sewing
she is aware of a car stopping opposite the house
then several young voices shout kaffir lover kaffer boetie red communist the car drives off at speed
susan sits petrified
ben and stanley driving in soweto
its a different city by night
the dark seems to soften the violence of the confrontation hiding the details which by day assault and insult the eyes
there are several gunshots in the distance
the only light comes from the small square windows of the innumerable houses
did you hear that lanie
more kids dying
ben says nothing
further on theres a group of people outside a house
as they pass they hear hymn singing from the house
whats the singing
a wake for a child eight months old
she was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it
they drive on
ben stanley and emily are sitting round the table
ben has pulled the lamp closer to read one of two notes from gordon one is written on ruled paper the other a square of toilet paper
the notes have been smuggled out of john vorster square
shakily my dear wife you must not worry about me
i miss you and the children
you must look after them in the fear of the lord
im hungry and i dont know what they want from me
but i think ill be home some day
i think about
they are interrupted by a knock at the door
emily snatches the notes and stuffs them into her bosom
everyone is tense as emily slowly walks up to the door
she opens it and a man with a hat and dressed as a min ister walks in
before anyone can say anything stanley bursts out in a loud laugh
the man is slightly built aged years
he is julius nqakula
on your knees everyone prayers time
ben is perplexed
emily closes the door and locks it
hey man you should have been a mfundisi holiness oozer
removing this hat okay stanley
its stupid but one is forced to do these things
he walks up to ben and offers him his hand
im julius nqakula
im banned and also under house arrest
thats why i have this ridiculous garb on
hes one of the most solid lawyers we have theyve immobilized him thats the right word isnt it
stanley has told me about you
i appreciate the risk you are taking by coming here to meet me
i was reading the notes gordon smuggled out of john vorster square
may i have a glance at them
emily produces the notes
julius takes them
he starts reading the toilet paper which is harder to read
speaking with great difficulty my dear wife
i am still in these conditions
and too much pain
they dont want to believe me
you must try to help me
they wont stop
you must care for the children
i dont know anymore if i will come home alive
theyre very a word mumbled but god will provide
i love you and i miss you very much
try to help me because
the voice breaks off
to emily when did you get the letters
uncomfortable the first one two days after they took him away
and the other one came later
but emily why didnt you tell me long ago
i had given my word to the man who brought them to me emily i have to meet the man
he said he didnt want anybody to know who he is
i cannot make trouble for him in his work
he has to be persuaded
he is very important to us
to julius you as a lawyer will understand
we intend starting a civil suit against the police to do that it is necessary to have as many affidavits as we can from people who have any information about
gordon since he was arrested
and this man is vital and so is the indian doctor
you mean dr
how are you going to do that
you know of course that he is detained
i know with luck they may release him
but emily this man is important please try to tell him we will protect his identity
no one will know
nothing will be done without his approval
i only want to talk to him
why dont you leave it to stanley and i
what do you say stanley
may i call you julius im not very good with some african names
laughs nqakula thats a hell of a name
please call me julius
this case must be reopened and we must win
we have to dig up everything
we need your cooperation julius
where do i start
dont forget my restrictions
they did not ban you so you could sit on your backside and have a soweto holiday
you could help with the affidavits
lewinson the lawyer has stressed their importance
we know each other
hes a good lawyer for this kind of case
of course ill do what i can
my commitment forces me
how are you planning to safeguard the documents
stanley told me you have already had a said by the s
i wouldnt worry
i have a secure place
lets hope so
ill make some tea
not for me sis too strong for me
in my house
you know better than that stanley
turning to julius and god forgive me
ben is standing by the workbench the new drawer he and johan built for the toolbox open before him
hes rereading gordons letters to emily
sound of approaching footsteps
ben quickly puts the letters into the drawer and shuts it
susan appears at the door she looks ten years older
ben its johan
youd better come
johan sits ben crouched before him
the boys shirt is torn his eyes swollen his lip cut
he looks at the floor
he wont tell me why it happened ben holds his sons arms gently
was it because of me
he doesnt answer for a moment
then he nods
its gone too far ben
youve got to stop it
shouting at his mother i dont care
it doesnt hurt me
susan stares at him at ben turns abruptly walks out of the room
johan looks at his father
it was my friends dad
theyre so stupid
they wont listen
they dont even want to know what youre trying to do
are you sure you know
does it worry you
johan looks at his father through his tears
dont stop dad
you mustnt give up now
ben hugs his son
the gordon ngubene name cleaning team on the move
in a phone box dialing a number
ringing ringing on a desk full of scattered files and papers
by the phone a photograph of a six year old indian girl
sound of the phone a young nurses frightened face as she remembers peering in at a young boy struggling and moaning
policemen closing the door
her hand signing the affidavit and handing it to a mans hand
ben in the phone box hanging up the phone with rage
a young black mans face listening to juliuss voice and on the morning of the autopsy as i was cleaning the mortuary captain stolz gave me a bundle of ngubenes
and ordered me to burn them
the young man nods
having a look on the two affidavits before hiding them into the drawer of the stool box
loud sharp terrifying
the window a lamp and a mirror shatter susan screams standing her hands clamped over her ears eyes tight shut hysterical the television chatters on an afrikaans play
ben bursts in holds her tight as she screams into his chest
hysterical call the police ben call the police
johans voice comes from his room
calling its okay son
were all right
shouting its okay stay there please
gently he leads susan who is sobbing now out of the room
in disbelief my god
they were trying to kill us
shes seated at the kitchen table
ben has poured her a brandy which she cups in her hands
they were trying to scare us thats all
her fear turns into anger
screaming oh is that all
what the hell more do you want to happen
were ordinary people for gods sake and youve pitched us into this this nightmare
i cant take any more ben
i cant take any more
she drops her head and sobs
ben sits beside her and takes her hands to comfort her
susan puts her head on his shoulder
in a quiet pleading voice please ben stop
ben is obviously moved
he squeezes her hands then takes her in his arms
the colonel amiable cool behind his desk
a dishev elled ben pitched angrily forward in his chair
now you must be exaggerating mr
my house has been searched
my phone is tapped
my mail is opened
and last night three shots were fired through my window close to killing my wife
du toit if shots were fired into your premises we will investigate
all i want to know colonel is why dont you leave me in peace
now wait wait a minute mr
du toit youre not trying to blame me
tell me colonel why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about gordon ngubene
is that what you are doing
he pauses well now
if you possess any information that may be of use to us i trust you wont hesitate to discuss it with me
he leans forward towards ben his tone darkening
because if there are facts you are deliberately hiding from us mr
du toit if you give us reason to believe that you may be involved in activities that may be dangerous to both yourself and us then i can foresee some
is that a threat colonel
smiling and sitting back lets call it a warning
a friendly warning
for gods sake open your eyes mr
dont you see youre being used
sarcastically by the communists i suppose
ben gets up to go
the colonel doesnt rise to see him out
at the door turning back im sure
the colonel immediately picks up the phone
a year old african woman walks up to bens kitchen door
ben opens the door in pyjamas and dressing gown
she hands him a note and leaves
ben reads the note and goes back into the house
vrededorp is a colored section of johannesburg
its rundown area vacated by whites
there are children play ing in the street
some unemployed men are sitting on old chairs outside a doorway a vendor is serving two women from his milk churn
ben drives into the street searching for an address
he stops outside a house
as he gets out of the car the children and everyone stop to look at him with interest
he walks up to a door and knocks
a colored woman appears as the door opens
she is young and obviously educated
ben nods hesitatingly
please come in
ben walks into the living dining room
its a very tidy room with a three piece sitting room suite a sideboard with a clock on it
at one end of the room is the dining area
the floor is linoleum and covered with a rug in the middle
stanley is lounging on a settee beer in hand
on the chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit drinks orange squash
thirtyish pleasant face but very tense
he rises as ben walks in
rising and shaking hands with ben hows it
no trouble finding this place
you met sadie
shes one of us
ben nods to her
and this is johnson seroke
the man of the letters
nodding in greeting johnson
please sit down mr
a beer tea or orange squash
a beer would be nice
sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer and a glass
she opens the beer and hands it to ben
she disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the door
you know they call this place vrededorp but we baptize it malay camp
your first time in malay camp lanie
ive driven through here many times
the main road eh
the woman re enters
youll excuse me
stanley you know what to do with the key
and thank you
can i help myself to another beer
you know it is
du toit and you be careful
to the seroke
trying to smile okay sadie
that woman can die for you
we mustnt be long johnson has to be back on duty
alright lets get on with it
stanley tells me you work at john vorster square
i had no choice they transferred me there
yet you smuggled out letters to emily
pulling the fingers of his left hand one by one cracking the joints over and over what do you do if a man asks you and hes in trouble
if they find out hed be in very big trouble
i know that
tell me what do you know about gordon
you did talk to him from time to time
he gave me the letters
when was the last time you saw him
just before he died
did you attend any of the interrogations
im not a member of the special branch
but once i had to deliver a letter to capt
stolz gordon was there
concerned how were they interrogating him
seroke hesitates and looks at stanley
tell him what you told me
they were using the pole
the pole whats that
demonstrating they handcuff you and manacle your feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees
then youre like a chicken ready for the oven
they hang you between two tables
then they do what they like with you
call it the aeroplane
ben is horrified
who were in that room
lieutenant venter and a black s
you are sure
to himself its very interesting
when was the last time you saw him
nervous i saw them take the body away to the cells
he was limp
johnson why do you stay with the police
you dont really belong there
its a job
and how can i go away
i love my family
he jumps up and faces ben with a look of anger and panic
they must never know i told you anything
this is strictly between the three of us
dont worry man
seroke shakes hands with them as hes leaving
slapping his back take it easy
stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer
a beer lanie
shouting no thank you
you know stanley after what happened the other night i was about to give this whole thing up
intrigued what happened man
my wife nearly got killed
three shots were fired into the house
what right have i to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger
thats what i asked myself
three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like stolz and say i give up
what is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life
shit i thought you had more guts than this man
i didnt say im giving up
but you thought about it
johnson has revived my determination
its a hell of a time lanie but well survive
you and me
i tell you
you think we may still win in the end stanley
of course not lanie but we neednt lose either what matters is to stick around
by the way man im off on a trip botswana thought id tell you in case you get worried
why are you going there
tell you next week
now for the bad news ive been saving to the last
julius has been arrested
he broke his banning order and visited his sister
you know what that means
at least a years imprisonment
a year in jail just for visiting his sister
thats the chance he took
and hell be the last to complain
dont you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us
lanie youre not getting guilt complexes now are you
thats a luxury only liberals can afford
julius will be back man
all refreshed by a spell in the deep freeze
how can we shrug off a man weve been working with
who said were shrugging him off
best way of remembering a man lanie is to carry on fighting
bens study is in chaos
the books have been plucked from the shelves and the contents of his drawers emptied on the floor
ben standing in the middle of the room surveying the vandalism
this is a medium sized kitchen with two doors leading from it one to the dining room and the other to the living room
it has not changed since it was furnished twenty years ago the only modern appliances being the electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table
ben is leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the living room drinking coffee
melanie bare feet her long black hair tied up in a ribbon is washing up
she looks younger and fragile with this hair style
smiling what about you
i mean not married
and living in this chaos with my eccentric father
i love him and we get on perfectly
we have been together since i was a year old
my mother could not adapt to south africa
she went back to london and weve never heard from her since
being a professor and bringing up a child how did he manage that
dorothy dear dorothy she was a fantastic mother
in fact she had two families me and her three children in alexandra township
and this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist
why a journalist
laughs sometimes i ask myself the same question
she leans against the sink and picks up her mug of coffee
ill tell you
i was brought up in a sheltered way not that dad was possessive not openly anyway
i think hed just seen enough of the mess the world was in to want to protect me as much as he could
then i went to university
i dont know what youll think
being a teacher
then i married my ex teacher
he must have been young
fifteen years difference
he too protected me like dad
then one day i visited dorothy in alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township
i was shocked ben and ashamed
melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up
that made me think that i was a parasite something white and maggot like
just a thing
a sweet and ineffectual thing
i felt more and more claustrophobic
poor brian who loved and pampered me
had no idea what was happening
i left him for a whole year and we divorced
and then you became a journalist
melanie goes to the living room as she passes ben she touches his arm and continues talking
i thought it would force me or help me to expose myself
to force me to see and to take notice of what was happening around me
did it work
she returns to the kitchen with a cigarette
i wish i could give you a straight answer
what did help me was my wanderings in africa
how did you manage that on a south african passport
we south africans are white devils in africa
my mother was english remember
so i get a british passport
it comes in handy even for the paper
you really are your fathers daughter
i wonder what hes doing right now
most likely standing on a rock looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever
one of the two large cats approaches them tail in the air and goes to melanie drubbing against her legs purring luxuriously
she picks it up into her arms
how often does he go on these trips to the veldt
it depends approaching ben with cat bonjour ben
im porto and my friend is bello
ben smiles and starts to caress porto in melanies arms
parked outside the house is a municipality truck already half laden with emilys furniture and possessions
four africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck super vising the eviction of emily are a white soweto official captain stolz and lt
in the b
a hundred yards away is a hippo with black and white armed policemen
behind the truck are two police land rovers
emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes
her daughter is carrying the youngest child and standing next to emily several children are watching
a woman in the crowd starts singing a freedom song umzima lomthwalo this burden is heavy
the song is taken up by the other women
venter tries to stop them and disperse them
stolz signals to him to leave them alone
one of the africans then walks up to her for the chair
she refuses to get off the chair
the man looks at the white official as though to ask what do i do
the official looks at stolz
venter walks up to emily and about to pull her off the chair
dont you touch me
venter pulls back
the women start to ululate
emily rises majestically takes the youngest in her arms and walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter
people cluster around her singing with rage and shaking her hand
stolz observes the scene impassive
emily and the children are helped onto the back of the truck which drives away preceded by the police hippo and escorted from the rear by the land rovers
the crowd continues singing
ben is leaving his home
this is a saturday morning
two men are sitting in a car a few yards from the entrance to the house
ben doesnt pay attention to them
when he is about twenty yards past one of the men jaimie who was present when gordon was arrested gets out of the car and follows ben
ben stops at a corner for a car and again the footsteps stop
he turns furtively and sees the man stopped turning his head
ben decides to turn the corner and listens to the footsteps
the man is still following
ben then decides to turn right back to have a good look at the man
they pass each other and ben takes a good look at him and turns back onto the streets to the local shops
the man decides not to follow
ben and stanley sit
ben on his desk
stanley in an armchair with a drink
they look perplexed
irritated shes a widow man
thats what happens in soweto when a woman loses her man
they throw her out of the house and out of the city
the whole thing smells of being an excuse to send her hundreds of miles from the case
and how will they live there
i was about to find her a place but i had to go to look for robert
so thats why you went to botswana for
sis emily asked me but it was no use
his mind was made up
he was going to join wellington in zambia
couldnt you stop him
hes a little boy stanley
stanley gulps down his whisky and stands up
focusing ben in the eyes hell be back in a few years
and he wont be throwing stones
then puts the empty glass on the desk
stanley peers through the curtains he sees a car parked outside the house
in it jaimie and another s
they are watching the house
stanley quietly opens the door and walks outside
stanley walks past his car and approaches the policeman
using his usual humor good evening
id like to invite you into my humble home but its full of terrorists
the two policemen get out of their car obviously angry
pointing at stanleys car open the boot
you cheeky bastard
okay with pleasure
they search and find nothing
open the door and remove the seat
stanley executes the order
jaimie and the other police man peer in their eyes sweeping the car
now your pass bliksem
stanley produces his passbook and hands it to the police man who inspects the pages laboriously then throws the book to the ground
stanley doesnt pick it up and just watches the man
you watch your bloody step
they return to their car and drive off
stanley looks at them thoughtfully then picks up his book
all the students are in classes
cloete walks out of a classroom and sees capt
stolz walking towards the build ing
cloete stops to wait for him
they shake hands and walk to cloetes office talking affably
they enter office
ben and susan in bed asleep
the phone rings
waking them both
theres no one there
he puts it down
the ringing starts again
ben puts the re ceiver down
calmly ben please stop whilst theres time
focusing on ceiling its impossible to stop now susan
i believe im right in what im doing
if i stop now ill go mad
despaired whatever the price you pay for it
painfully i have got to
susan shuts her eyes tight and turns her back on him to hide her tears
its a functional office
picture of the south african president john vorster on the wall
various staff pictures
ben summoned by cloete sits
think of your heritage man
my god think of your wife your family friends neighbors
whats going to happened to them all of us if we cant depend on our own kind
were educationalists teachers
we are building for the future
without simple justice we dont deserve a future
were boers man afrikaners
we are your nation
whats justice for us is justice period
traitors like you are threatening centuries of afrikaner sacrifice
that last remark was slanderous im simply being faithful to the truth
my god man you slander a whole people
he walks silently through the office then continues
you have given me no alternative
i have to abide by the regulations of the department of education so i have made my report
and there will have to be a formal inquiry
but until such time
rising it wont be necessary mr
ill send you my resignation
thank you for making things much easier
ben stares at him for a moment then turns to leave
as he reaches the door cloete says and it would be better if johan left too
ben turns to stare at him amazed
are you serious
hes a kaffir lover too isnt he
the color drains from bens face
then he steps forward slaps cloete thunderously across the face hurling him back into his chair and strides out leaving the door ajar
its the end of the school day
the yard is practically deserted
only viviers waiting for ben under the veranda
oom ben i was waiting for you
i have something interesting to tell you
striding on towards his car later viviers
keeping up but oom ben its about the s
they came to question me
before they started questioning me i told them they were wasting their time
ben doesnt react
they asked if i was cooperating with you
what i knew about the a
can you imagine that
they then said mr
viviers you come from a good afrikaans family and its important that you realize that communists are looking for people like you and before you know where you are theyre
and oom ben
reaching the car interrupting him im sorry viviers
i never wanted you to get involved
getting into his car i have just resigned
ben drives away
christmas day lunch
assembled around the table are bens father in law his wife helen suzette and chris her husband johan ben and susan
theyre all wearing paper hats from christmas crackers
on the table is a large piece of roast lamb ox tongue a large turkey and assorted vegetables
ben is at the head of the table adjacent to the door lead ing to the kitchen the father in law is sitting by his side facing the door
ben is in the middle of carving the turkey plates are being passed to him
was last years turkey as big as this papa
about the same size
do you remember the turkey i had for easter
you said it was as big as a baby ostrich papa
i dont remember that suzette
you know johan when i was a boy in the karoo we used to fry ostrich eggs
you know how big they are
laughing as big as this table
to father in law i think he deserves the parsons nose for that remark
she does her best to compose
a knock at the outside kitchen door
as ben turns towards the door it opens and
stanley erupts into the kitchen like a great black bull in white suit and white shoes
a scarlet tie is matched by a huge handkerchief hanging from his pocket
he is a little drunk
obviously surprised by this family scene oh
then grinning and laughing thunderously merry christmas everyone
theres deadly quiet not even the clink of a spoon as the du toits look on aghast
slowly as if in a dream ben rises and goes to stanley who spots him
compliments of the season old mate
what are you doing here
before stanley answers the father in law gets up from his chair and goes to the kitchen
whos this kaffir ben
shocked why dont you tell the boer who this kaffir is
shut up stanley
to father in law thats all right
quivering with rage a kaffir calling me a boer
chris hurries into the kitchen ready for a fight
ben did you hear that
call the police ben
to father in law please go to the table
to stanley stanley wait outside
fuming who are these people anyway
stanley this is still my house
let me throw him out
ben steps between them and pushes chris back into the dining room
laughing let him try leave him lanie
to father in law please leave me with him
ill explain everything later
nothing has changed in this house
mother lets go
he strides into the dining room
susan sits with her eyes tight shut trying to shut out the horror of it all
as the father in law goes into the living room he pulls back his wifes chair and helps her to her feet
to his wife lets leave this house
ive been sworn at by a kaffir and ben protects him
from the living room she calls johan who is left alone at the table perplexed
johan goes to his mother
theres a general rush for the door and without warning the room is empty
only the tin angels tinkle merrily around their candles
with cascading laughter lanie
ever in your fucking life seen such a stampede hah
furious maybe you think its funny stanley but i dont
do you realize what youve done
he sighs deeply come into the dining room
stanley follows ben slowly swaying
chuckling jeez who was that old cunt with the potbelly and black suit looks like an undertaker
ben sits on his chair
my father in law
deliberately sitting beside ben you joking
he laughs shit
i fucked it all up for you
he laughs again
ben cannot take it anymore
now pull yourself together stanley
its not funny at all
whats the matter with you today
youre drunk and making an idiot of yourself
say what youve come to say
otherwise go to hell
stanleys laughter changes into a broad grin
he sur veys the table and takes a bit of turkey from a plate and starts to eat it quietly
after a pause right
put the kaffir in his place
ben grabs him by the shoulders and starts to shake him
stanley whats wrong with you
stanley shoves ben off and glares at him bloodshot eyes breathing heavily
emily is dead
ben stares at him in stunned disbelief
stanley doesnt answer he cries
ben grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him
what happened stanley
oh my god
please tell me
between two sobs a broken heart
all they said
bens hand still on stanleys shoulder he sits slowly beside him shaken his face ravaged by the news
through the window he sees suzette and chris carrying suitcases back down the path to his in laws car father in law shepherding his wife and an ashen dazed susan
helping them into the car
as they leave see johan leaning against the dining room door watching his father and stanley
a very tense ben is sitting on professor bruwers chair
melanie is curled up on the old settee
they dont know what youve got and youre a danger to them
i know theres a point of no return but with our system one has to plot the route with care
thats the main reason for coming here tonight
melanie i need your help
without emily we cant pursue our civil suit
the only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press and the media here and abroad
and your safety also ben lies in the press
pause that way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services here questions can be asked in parliament
and the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country
you know melanie im discovering that the enemy is not in soweto
the enemy is ourselves
our bigotry our laws our system
we have our own fight and its just beginning
we better win before the blacks have won
ben and melanie laugh
now before going to the press i have to have all the documents
i must have two vital affidavits dr
hassiems hes detained and jonathans friend wellington has fled to zambia
im going to rhodesia
i can go to zambia
surprised could you
and i can use my british passport
i know my way around lusaka
that would be very useful
melanie jumps off the settee
this calls for a drink
gin and tonic
as melanie walks away ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness
her dress swinging around her legs
her bare feet soundless on the floor
the quiet grace of her movement
on the way to the kitchen to get the drinks melanie goes to the record player
theres a record already on the turntable
suddenly as if rising from a dream ben murmurs melanie
as she plays the record and flippantly of course ben
she goes into the kitchen
as melanie hums to herself to the blues music in the kitchen ben walks over to the window and furtively glances out to assure himself that nobody is watching
he takes then a book on a pile next to the settee and pages slowly through it
melanie returns with two glasses still in her happy mood
she places bens glass on the side table next to the settee takes the book from him and makes him sit down
ben raises his glass and touches it with hers
do be careful
i wouldnt want you hurt
she reaches for his hand
with gentleness dont worry
and hurry back
a new track starts on the record
excited thats my favorite ben
jumping up and taking bens glass and placing it on the side table she pulls him to his feet
i cant dance
they laugh as they start to dance to the slow blues music
the laughing subsides as they hold each other closer
the dancing starts to lose the beat of the music
they look into each others eyes and ben envel ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him
they stop dancing
ben kisses her
a long warm and tender kiss
ben and melanie in bed
he is kissing her and fondling her passionately
during the love play ben reaches for the lightswitch of the bedside lamp and knocks it over
they make love
ben is shopping at the local supermarket
he is pushing a trolley
as he places some groceries into his trolley he notices a man standing near the check out counters
the man is similar built as jamie and similar hairstyle
hes reading a newspaper his face concealed
ben drops the package he was inspecting back on the shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and see his face
the man moves away
ben follows him and has decided to confront him
man picks up a pack of ham
ben is about to remonstrate with him
just then a lady and her daughter hurry to the man push ing a trolley
man turns to look at ben
darling put that down its not good for your cholesterol
to the man im sorry my mistake
he pushes his trolley away embarrassed
the immaculate blue of the pool
johan hurls himself out of the water flops down at the side
suzette and ben nearby sitting in the sun
pieter at the barbecue sizzling thick steaks
a servant in white uniform soundlessly laying the table on the patio behind him
the nanny with the baby in the shade
hows she doing
shes waiting for you to ask her to come home
i doubt it
she turns to ben squinting in the sun
papa i dont want to interfere
i know this is going to sound strange coming from me
i mean i havent exactly been supportive for the past months
i cant say i agree with what youve done but i respect you for what you are
on johan listening
destroyed by whats happening to us as a family
interrupts squeezing his arm
please papa for moms sake
for all of our sakes
lets try and patch it up
ben smiles sadly at her
johan looks at them
ben and johan in the car
suzette leans in through the drivers window
let me know if theres anything i can do to help
im glad you understand
i dont want to worry about you
that search this vandalism those shots
theyre really after the evidence youve been accumulating can i look after them for you papa
you dont have to worry
theyll never find them
smiling where on earth do you keep them
on johan looking at suzette then at ben with concern
ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket section of the asian township
he peers around him then walks away
ben knocks at a door
the door is opened cautiously by dr
hassiem a tall handsome indian aged years
his clothes are casual but expensive
his six year old daughter large dark eyes is clinging to his leg
we recognize the little girl of the photograph near the telephone from earlier
im ben du toit
im a friend of gordon ngubenes
raising his hands the inquest is over mr
not for me doctor
ive got to know what happened to gordon
hassiem looks shaky nervous
i only came home yesterday
after three months in detention and now im banned and confined to the house
theres nothing i can do for you
the little girl still clinging to his leg watching ben
i know it may be painful to you doctor but i need to talk to you
how can i be sure you werent actually sent by them
doctor we are in the process of filing a civil claim
and your help is vital
hassiem gives ben a long look
he picks up his daughter and opens the door fully
ben walks into the large living room tastefully furnished
ben is still looking round at the opulence
he sits in a chair
thank you for inviting me in
the little girl on his knees what do you want to know
just one thing doctor
why did you sign the state pathologists report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well
disconcerted what makes you think i signed dr
the report produced in court had both your signatures on it
what did you write in your report
jansen and i didnt disagree on the facts
after all we examined the same body in the same time
but just on the interpretation
for example if gordon had really been hanged the marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front
he touches his larynx but in this case the bruises were more obvious on the sides
ben nods silent
something else really upset me perhaps it isnt important
what was it
hassiem puts down his daughter
leaning forward you see through a misunderstanding i arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy
there wasnt a soul around except a young african attendant
when i told him id come for the autopsy he let me in
the body was on the table dressed
i noticed blood on the clothes
as i examined the clothes more closely a police officer came in and said i wasnt allowed in the morgue before dr
when i returned with dr
jansen half an hour later the body was naked
excited doctor weve already got the african attendants affidavit
he testified that capt
stolz ordered him to burn the clothes
pause did you mention what you said in your report
i found it most odd
doctor hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing
hassiem thinks it over for a while then please excuse me for a minute
ben watches him leave the room the little girl following him
he gets up from the chair walks to the window glances through it then steps to look at some family photographs on the mantlepiece
amongst them a photograph of dr
hassiem before big ben
hassiem returns with a file the daughter still following
opening the file this is my report
i only have one copy
astounded you have a copy of the report
i know how to hide things from the s
ben congratulates him by a deep laughter
ben and dr
hassiem working as a team tape the type written sheets of the report among a rand daily mail newspaper pages at the back
hassiems desk we recognize next to the phone the little girls photograph
i hope you have as secure a place as i have
with an accomplice smile i think so
a multi storied building half built
stanley standing on the fourth floor watching bens arrival
ben searches for stanley who draws bens attention beckons him up
ben indicates they meet halfway
he joins stanley whos sitting on a pile of bricks
with expansive gesture take a pew man
sitting and excited we have it stanley
you know what that means stanley
melanie arrives in two days
well have all the evidence
everything is in place
well get them yet especially stolz
thats fantastic man
stanley produces from his jacket pocket a newspaper rand daily mail
he opens it on a certain page with the picture of an african in police uniform and hands it to ben
its johnson seroke
late at night
a knock on the door
he opened and five shots point blank range
face chest stomach
reading a police spokesman when questioned said its not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life in the service of his country fighting
folding paper in disgust bloody bastards
they killed him
stolz must have thought he knew too much
whats the score
the nurse is detained the mortuary attendant has disappeared the police van driver who brought jonathan to hospital is detained
julius is in jail and now johnson dead
whos next on their secret list i wonder
how much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clear gordons name
are you going soft lanie
we must keep going even more so now
and for every bloke whos going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands
and for our childrens future
if i can no longer believe that right is on my side if i can no longer believe in imperative to go on what will become of me stanley
ben looks at johnsons picture again and shakes his head
a x black and white photograph on bens desk
on the photograph a naked man and a girl on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side
the man is ben and the girl is melanie
stolz in sports jacket standing next to the desk is speaking
were all made of flesh and blood mr
du toit weve all got our flaws
and if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence well thats his own business
but it would be unpleasant if people found out about it especially if hes a teacher
you mean if i cooperate if i stop digging embarrassing you threatening you
these photographs will disappear
lets just say i may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isnt used against you
suppose i refuse
stolz looks past ben
is this your son
ben whirls around to see johan at the door
he shoots puts himself between the photograph and his son obviously surprised to find capt
johan leave us alone please
johan walks away
dont you think this business has gone long enough
ben struggling to maintain his composure
thats for you people to decide
i wont be blackmailed captain not even by you
mind if i smoke
ben answers by a gesture
after lighting his cigarette now be honest
has all the evidence youve been collecting in connection with gordon ngubene brought you closer to the truth you are looking for
yes i think so and theres more to come
i really hoped we could talk man to man
its not possible captain
not between you and me
its high time mr
du toit we allowed the dead to rest in peace
im offering you a chance
you mean my very last chance
one never knows
it may not be important to you but we have to survive
if we can only survive through murder and torture then we have forfeited our right to exist
slowly and deliberately stolz stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray
is that your final answer
before you go
ill tell this captain
i have a pretty good idea of what i will eventually uncover
i mean the truth
and i wont allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth
ben walks up to the door to see him out
theres no response from stolz
he calmly takes a small card out of his pocket and rests it on bens desk
heres my card my private line
if you should change your mind
lets say before the end of the week
goodbye captain and dont forgt the photograph
stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase
leaving be careful mr
there are people who can make things very difficult for you
they are wasting their time
they just cant hurt me anymore
i trust youll give them the message captain
he walks out
ben follows him round the garage and watches him get into his car and drive away
johan joins his father
mischievous a brandy papa
smiling back ruffling his hair a gin and tonic would be fine
ben and johan are standing in the public enclosure on the top floor of the airport building
ben is unshaved he looks tired but happy
there is the usual bustle of airport staff for the steps and luggage two thirds of the staff being black
passengers emerge from the plane melanie amongst them
some waving to friends and relatives on the public en closure
melanie stops momentarily and looks up at the enclosure
she sees ben and johan and waves at them
they wave back and ben indicates theyll be waiting for her below
she walks off as they happily await her after the ususal formalities
ben and johan are waiting outside the arrivals exit
several passengers stream out some being met
eventually there is a trickle of passengers
an indian woman is one of the last to come out
ben approaches her
excuse me im waiting for a lady with a red dress
are there still many people to come
i did see her
she was ahead of me
maybe shes still in there
just then an official walks out of the door
ben hurries to him
can i help you
im waiting for a passenger miss bruwer
shes taking a rather long time to be cleared
what did you say her name was
ill go and check
the official hurries back
is there any other exit papa
they have to collect their luggage and pass through customs
joking maybe she cant find her bag
smilng back thats possble
just then stolz appears through the door
he slowly walks up to ben and johan
ben becomes apprehensive
afternoon meneer du toit
johan isnt it
ruffling his hair johan pulling away and glaring at him
what now captain
word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend miss bruwer
you know subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful
now lets take your friend she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country
but you know something else
she has been secretly holding a british passport
a south african passport and a british pasport
now you tell me where is her patriotism
the minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant
so she is being put on the first available plane to london
this must be heart breaking for you
good afternoon meneer du toit johan
stolz walks back
quietly lets go home johan
i dont understand papa
striding ill explain later
they hurry out of the building in silence
ben and johan arriving at the house
an unsympathetic small crowd is there waiting
they react murmuring in afrikaans watching them with hostility as ben and johan get out of the car and discover the chaos
the garage and bens study have been bombed
johan leaves ben and rushes to the house
the crowd starts to disperse
the entire tools cupboard has been methodically ripped apart and the contents strewn on the garage floor
everything is half burnt
ben has sunk onto the stool in total defeat
then johan appears at the door
he hands ben a large envelope in it the file with all the papers
ben looks up at johan
very proud i took it out
hide it in my secret place
ben grabs his son hugs him and holds on for dear life
thank you son
you did a mans job
ben is sitting at the kitchen table
before him scattered on the table the affidavits he collected the hassiem report cuttings of articles by melanie in the rand daily mail about jonathan newspaper pictures of gordon of
seroke of himself with emily the half burnt peace painting of picasso half burnt photo of ben with suzette a staff photograph ben amongst it and a charred trophy
ben starts putting material relevent to his inquiries into a large brown envelope
johan enters kitchen with a large envelope and hands it to his father
somebody has dropped it through the door
leaving im nearly ready papa
ben examines the unstamped envelope with his address with curiosity then opens it
the contents is wellingtons affidavit
happy wellingtons affidavit
he looks inside the envelope expecting a personal note
to himself good old melanie
johan is packing his sport kit and few clothes into a bag
ben and johan are walking towards the entrance johan wheeling his bike
ben hugs his son
johan gets on the bike and rides out
ben is pouring coffee
he looks tired and tensed
the phone rings in the living room
he hurries to answer it
who knows could be melanie from the airport
ben picks up the phone
a menacing male voice says meneer du toit tonight were coming to kill you
ben replaces the receiver obviously shaken
he becomes aware of footsteps approaching the kitchen
ben is terrified
a knock at the door and the door swings open its stanley
anxious whats happened man
obviously still scared its you
it was a bomb
and the papers
thanks to johan
incidentally i have wellingtons affidavit
melanie found him
shes being deported
the official reason is that she possessed a british passport
i dont know how she managed to smuggle the envelope to me
man its all happening
stanley walks out glances at the devastated study
he reenters the kitchen and slams on a chair
he takes a packet of lucky strike from his pocket and offers it to ben
like a joint
stanley lights a cigarette and surveys the table
he picks up the half burnt picasso book gives it a brief glance and tosses it back on the table and starts to chuckle
surprised whats so funny
still chuckling they drop the bomb on you
ben walks up to him puts his hand on his shoulder
theres an understanding trace of a smile on his face
ben sitting in a cafe smoking his pipe
a waiter serves him a glass of beer for which he pays
stanley driving in the rain on the same road as johan
suzettes sports car pulls up outside the cafe where ben is waiting
ben rises as suzette joins him at his table
they kiss and she sits opposite him
looking at her straight in the eyes how are you suzette
in a soft voice okay papa
would you like a drink
without taking his eyes off her he takes a brown envelope from a chair and pushes it slowly towards the uncomfor table suzette
she picks up the envelope
rising i have to go papa
looking out i know
suzette awkwardly kisses him on the cheek
look after them
suzette looks at him for a moment and hurries to her car
as suzette leaves ben turns back into the room his eyes glassy with tears
suzette gets into her car and drives off
the parked car follows
the two cars turn at the next corner
the two cars approach following each other
as the second car overtakes he draws suzettes attention with his horn and signals her to pull up
as she gets out of her car holding the brown envelope capt
stolz gets out of the other side
suzette walks over to the passenger colonel viljoen
smiling i see you got the goodies
happily i was on my way to your office colonel
we thought wed save you the trouble mrs
she hands viljoen the envelope
here it is colonel
this country needs more people like you
i must hurry colonel
she drives off
stolz gets into the car as colonel viljoen starts open ing the brown envelope
now lets see what weve got
stanley is parked near the building
hes drumming on the steering wheel to the rhythm of african music from his car radio
viljoen has just finished opening the brown envelope
he pulls out the half burnt picasso book and captain stolzs card which he gave to ben
on the card is written goodbye
ben du toit the bastard
johan hurries out of the building and is about to get on his bike
his attention is drawn by stanleys familiar johan turns sees stanley and with a grin makes thumbs up sign which happy stanley returns with his large thumb
johan cycles away followed by stanley
ben looks at his watch
he goes to the cash desk and pays
he walks slowly out of the cafe
stands at the door to find his car keys the rain has emptied the street
ben turns up his collar and waits for a break in the traffic
captain stolz alone in the car
he drives around the corner into the cafe street
just then ben is hurrying across the road to his car
captain stolz sees him accelerates and hits ben hurling him high into the air
and speeds away
people rush to bens side
crowd quietly gathers
freeze frame and
