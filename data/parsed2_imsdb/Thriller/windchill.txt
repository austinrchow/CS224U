written by joseph gangemi steven katz fills the screen twenty one years old pensive pretty
camera lingers on her in close up noticing details hair worn stylishly messy no makeup double pierced ears though no earrings today the corner of her bottom lip a little
frayed where shes been chewing it ruminatively
shes the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting institutional lighting florescents humming overhead joining the chorus of ambient noises a cough papers rustling the scribble of a
pen someone shifting in their chair etc
the shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable invasive scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment then a new sound breaks her reverie a muted buzzing o
and her eyes cut down to skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final exam book like a bug
she has an incoming text message
our girl is just one of two hundred other students filling a big auditorium style lecture hall
around her classmates sit grim faced scribbling to beat the clock
our girl traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right off the edge of the half desk looks at the display
our girl leans back a little in her seat gives a little nod to her friend seated across the lecture hall
types a reply
wind chill yellow revisions
yes she looks down as her friend text messages how r u getting home
bus she sends the message a moment later the reply appears sux u she glances up sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look
thats it people
wrap it up
theres a collective groan and the sound of two hundred panicked asses twisting in their seats
our girl feels her phone buzz looks down to see a final text message from her friend y dont u check the ride board
a slow smile lights up her face at the idea as all around her students rise and begin stampeding out
contd shouting to be heard test results will be posted on the philosophy departments web site in two weeks
enjoy your break and have a happy new year
she gathers her things begins to make her way down the stairs when hey
shes jostled from behind by a classmate bolting past her
she hands in her exam book waves to her friend and exits
wind chill yellow revisions
campus is a ghost town most students having already left for the holidays the dorms abandoned the library stacks empty the labs silent the dining halls eerie
our girl hurries across the deserted college green dotted with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm
she passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with christmas lights on her way to
she arrives at a large partially enclosed kiosk covered with dozens of student made notices printed in a rainbow of eye catching computer fonts and colors
a sign at the top reads she scans the posted notices
one catches her eye torn hastily from a spiral notebook on which is scrawled a handwritten message ne need a ride delaware
call a gust of wind riffles the notice
our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely empty parking lot
its late afternoon and already dark enough for the sodium vapor streetlights to have come on
a few snowflakes swirl in their sickbed glow
we follow her to
a beat to shit oldsmobile idling in the middle of the lot
an unbroken dusting of snow indicates its been the only vehicle here for some time
wind chill yellow revisions
an underclassman guy is asleep behind the wheel of the oldsmobile
hes skinny dressed in thrift shop clothes has the complexion of someone who doesnt get out in the sun much
his car is filled with all of his earthly possessions books cds in plastic milk crates dirty laundry etc
she knocks on the drivers side window startling him awake
he stirs blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot
do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance
the sight of her quickly snaps him awake
he scrambles out
still a little groggy there were still cars when i got here
i thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow
what time is it
quarter past three
wind chill yellow revisions
im two hours late
you shouldve just left without me
thats what i wouldve done
hurry up and pop the trunk so i can stow my shit
she walks back to the trunk which is stuffed to capacity with more of his things clothes a bag of groceries etc
girl contd calling to him jesus im just going home for christmas
what are you doing
pulling up stakes and movin your oakie family to californey
she starts rearranging the trunk making room for her bag
im kinda getting kicked out of my apartment
i didnt have time to find someplace new before exams
she takes out some of his things
puts them on the ground
guy contd here let me help you with that why dont you just get the engine started and put the heat on
i can handle this
he watches her rearrange his things a little flummoxed
girl contd smiling well
what are you waiting for
i thought you wanted to stay ahead of the snow
he hurries back to the drivers seat
starts the engine
she hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk
then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door handle
wind chill yellow revisions
now its her turn to look impatient
she jerks on the handle again until he leans over to open the door from the inside
she rolls her eyes climbs in
she climbs in tries to power her window all the way to the top
it keeps getting stuck leaving a half inch gap
she shoots him a look what the hell
thats as far as it goes
she rolls her eyes never once interrupting her phone conversation
he puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour roadtrip
as they drive off reveal a forgotten bag of groceries still sitting on the ground
they leave campus
he eavesdrops as she rattles on
on her cell where are you
listens no were just rolling out
listens believe me i tried but i couldnt get a flight
its my own fault for waiting til the last minute
wind chill yellow revisions
she looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south on the interstate
the road is wet though the snow hasnt yet started to stick
laughs on her cell what are you kidding
im bored to tears
no were still on the highway
how should i know all highways look exactly alike
she looks up catches him shooting irritated looks her way
girl contd what

focuses on the highway ahead
wind chill yellow revisions
on her cell uh oh somebodys upset
i better call you back
pause who do you think
ride board guy
she hangs up aims the camera phone lens his way and snaps another digital picture of him
she puts the cellphone away looks up to see him glaring at her
girl contd what
blurting this isnt cool
if i have to drive you have to talk to me
what im the in flight entertainment
thats how this ride sharing thing works
division of labor
we split everything fifty fifty
ive got news for you i dont get much more entertaining than when im on the phone
he darkens mutters under his breath sarcastic this is turning out great
whats that mean
they ride in silence for a moment
she tries to strike up a conversation by way of extending an olive branch
wind chill yellow revisions
so youre from wilmington huh
whered you go to school
falters for a second um
saint vitus academy
youre making that up
youre acquainted with every school in the area
pretty much yeah
including all the catholic ones
because thats where i went
saint vitus academy for catholic boys
they drive for a few moments in silence
we had a class together you know
intro to modern philosophy
he looks at her expectantly as if she should remember him
there were about a million people in that class
it was like woodstock
did you ever see so many eastern religion types
then so whats your major
wind chill yellow revisions
she hoots with laughter
but hes not kidding
he seems surprised by her response
guy contd you arent majoring in philosophy
i dont know
i just assumed
why would you assume anything about me
we just met
a little defensive i dont know
i guess you just
look like a philosophy major
she enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face lets him twist for a second before explaining girl contd i only took philosophy because i need a humanities credit
i heard it was an easy a
then hey that reminds me
whatd you put for the extra credit question on the final
nietzsches theory of eternal recurrence
which is basically reincarnation right
no theyre not really the same thing
reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you wind chill yellow revisions
guy contd live the same life over and over again
he looks out at the road reciting nietzsche from memory guy contd the eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over and you with it a grain of dust
she looks at him as if hes nuts
a beat then he died of syphilis you know
he stares grimly at the road ahead biting back a comment
girl contd high school and philosophy
pretty much covers everything dont you think
guess that concludes the entertainment portion of todays flight
she turns on the radio finds a station with christmas music
the oldsmobile passes slower moving vehicles and zooms by
its interior light is on
her bare feet are propped on the dash as she removes the old nail polish
shes turned the front seat into a nail salon
cotton balls emery boards bottles of clear and colored varnish are strewn everywhere
she picks a bottle opens it begins painting her nails
wind chill yellow revisions
concentrating next gas station you see do me a favor and pull over
i gotta pee
okay ill keep my eyes peeled
she looks up from her feet giving him a funny look
guy contd what
resumes painting that phrase
keeping your eyes peeled
its kind of creepy if you think about it
actually yeah it is sorta
his eyes linger on her freshly painted toes on the dashboard
she catches him staring
he blushes embarrassed
says guy contd speaking of peeling eyeballs
did you know thats how they do that corrective eye surgery
they use a laser
well yeah they do
but theres definitely peeling involved too
i saw it on discovery health
if more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife
im having corrective eye surgery over the break
wind chill yellow revisions
an awkward beat
im not really worried
im not worried
youre getting it done
because i hate wearing glasses
but they look good on you
how do you know
i dont wear them outside my dorm
he gets a cornered look
to class or anything
because i could swear i never
i wonder why i thought he breaks off saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead
guy contd hey look
heres your gas station
she looks at him across the dark front seat suspicious
wind chill yellow revisions
a florescent oasis in the gathering dark
a tow truck and several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it
the oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump
he starts the pump
notices her still seated in the car
he knocks on her window
she opens the door
i thought you had to pee
i didnt expect us to find a bathroom so soon
my nails arent dry
he looks over the roof of the car sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot
guy contd well if you want i can carry you
thats okay theyll be dry in just a second
come on im good at this
you are not carrying me inside
he opens her door pulls her legs around and crouches down between them
what are you doing
wait wind chill yellow revisions
suddenly hes rising and she throws her arms instinctively around his neck
unsettling as the deeply weird moment is she decides its best to just humor him
but first girl contd i need my purse
he crouches a little so she can reach to retrieve it
the door jingles as he enters carrying her
his face is red from effort hers from embarrassment
he just stands there
she taps him on the shoulder
you can let me down now
he crouches so she can slide off
she gives him a look slips on the pair of flip flops shes brought with her then heads off in search of the ladies bathroom
meanwhile our guy saunters up toward the front of the convenience store
he nods to the twitchy clerk s engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter
the toilet is gross tiled a queasy green graffiti covered
our girl finishes peeing gets up from the toilet uses her foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet
she washes her hands holding them under the automatic dryer
she wipes her hands dry on her jeans
is about to exit when she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror
wind chill yellow revisions
on impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse
slips them on
checks herself out in the mirror
with her glasses on she notices something scratched into the dirty mirror
where we see she frowns slips her glasses back in their case and moves to exit
but when she grips the doorknob she finds it locked
rattles the doorknob a few times
a look of panic crosses her face and she starts rattling the doorknob harder
did someone lock her in
suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand
she pounds on the door with the heel of her palm shouts nothing
she turns scanning the filthy bathroom notices something
a vent above the sink near the ceiling
she puts a foot up into the sink testing it to see if it can take her weight
then climbs up and straightens on wobbly legs until her face is near the filthy dust clogged vent
girl contd calling into vent her voice echoes weirdly
when the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl laughter
as if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense
pissed off now she climbs back down and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency
wind chill yellow revisions
and finally succeeds in getting the door to open
as she exits she sees the clerk and our guy talking quietly as if they know one another
she hesitates for a second spying on them around a display of chips
she strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water
didnt you hear me banging in there
startled puzzled smile when
you think its funny
me locked in
locked in where
youre telling me you didnt just hear me banging on the door
i dont know what youre cuts him off forget it
lets just get on the road
he gathers up the bottled water heads toward the door
the clerk calls to him remember highways your best bet dismissive dont worry about it man i got it all covered
she frowns following him to the exit
wind chill yellow revisions
are we lost or something
quickly no ive made this drive a million times
he holds the door for her then follows her outside
as they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty
he looks at the money as if hes never seen u
whats that for
my half of the gas
what do you mean
isnt that how ride sharing works
we split everything fifty fifty
i dont take money from friends
since when are they friends
they separate walking around to their respective sides of the car
she tries the passenger door handle only to find it stuck
wind chill yellow revisions
she rolls her eyes waits for him to open it from the inside
she stares out at the road ahead lulled by the sound of the windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side
a nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road
which wouldnt be cause for alarm or even interest except he suddenly turns the wheel sharply taking the exit
the car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two lane road marked with a simple sign paint on wood faded to illegibility scenic route
the tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half buried in the snow
attached to it is a diamond shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading rough road
she falls against him bracing herself against the dash
what the hell are you doing
panicking no way
get back on the highway
relax i checked it out on the map
it looks interesting
wind chill yellow revisions
i mean it get back on the highway right now
this is not going to happen
he looks a little pissed shes questioning his judgment
will you chill
its a shortcut
well be back on the highway before you know it
hard to argue with a shortcut
nonetheless she glances back with a look of trepidation out the back window at the highway receding into the distance
the oldsmobile cruises by the only car on the two lane scenic highway
as it leaves frame camera pans to the dead grass on the roadside where it finds a sad little shrine half buried in the snow two homemade crosses candle stumps
a rotting stuffed bear deflated mylar balloons
scrawled on the crosses are sean amanda dec dec she watches him suspiciously out of the corner of her eye
his face is eerie in the green light of the dashboard
he scans the radio dial for something other than static
not many radio stations out here
were in a valley
fm radio waves travel in a straight line
they cant penetrate big obstacles like hills
wind chill yellow revisions
where were you when i was flunking freshman physics
he switches over to am
finds a low wattage mountain station broadcasting bobby helms jingle bell rock
then he drives in silence
still stewing over her most recent digs
does your family do the whole traditional christmas thing
no my grandparents are dutch so i was raised on salted licorice and sinterklaas
hows that different from the regular santa claus
instead of the north pole he lives in spain
and instead of elves hes got an enforcer named black pete
basically hes like your santa only scarier
whats your christmas like
my folks split my freshman year so i spend the holidays racing between them
two turkey dinners
two sets of presents to return for store credit
so normally i can deal but this year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach
which is like what
two hours away
i dont know
the beach can be sort of nice in the winter
she gazes out the window at night overtaking the landscape
wind chill yellow revisions
so were you a rehobeth beach family or stone harbor
we always went to rehobeth
year in and year out
jesus ive never been more bored in my life
i was always so jealous of my friends who spent summers at the jersey shore
she turns from the window to look at him scowling
stone harbor is the jersey shore
oh yeah i know
what i meant was you arent from delaware are you
well see its kind of complicated who are you
im exactly who i said i was am its just what the hells going on here
nothings going on look just calm down
i can explain wind chill yellow revisions
headlights suddenly appear up ahead blindingly bright
guy contd what the hell
she turns to look ahead momentarily forgetting their fight as the oncoming headlights cross the median into their lane
you think he doesnt see us
how can he not
from a high angle overlooking the road we watch the two cars racing toward one another headed on a collision course
for the time being their fight has taken a back seat to the oncoming car playing chicken with them
pull over and let this asshole by
theres no shoulder
on the passenger side the road abuts a steep wooded hillside
opposite that it drops off into a ravine
they are both too distracted by the oncoming headlights to notice the christmas song thats just come on the radio brenda lees hit rockin around the christmas tree
rockin around the christmas tree at the christ mas par ty hop
the distance between the speeding cars is closing rapidly
the kids faces go white in the glare of the oncoming lights
wind chill yellow revisions
mistletoe hung where you can see evry couple tries to stop
rockin around the christmas tree have a happy hol i day
later well have some pumpkin pie and do some car rol ing
the other car continues barrelling toward the oldsmobile
the game of chicken fast approaching the point of no return
you will get a sen ti men tal fee ling when you hear
voices singing lets be jolly deck the halls with boughs of holly
relief turns to dread as they realize the other car isnt slowing
hes not stopping
he jerks the wheel hard sending the oldsmobile fishtailing out of control
the other car skids over a small bridge and drops out of sight
they spin out in the opposite direction
skid off the road and slam into a snowbank with a bone shuddering crash
rockin around the christmas tree have a happy hol i day
everyones dancing mer ri ly in the new
wa a ay
wind chill yellow revisions
the oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing the wrong way its drivers side jammed into a snowbank
snow boils in its headlights
the interior is dark
the girl has been thrown under the dash
its hard to tell in this light whether shes still breathing
finally she stirs disoriented
she climbs back into her seat piecing together where she is
it takes her a beat to remember him
she looks over slowly
hes not moving though thanks to his seatbelt hes still upright behind the wheel
his head rests limply against the drivers window which now looks out on nothing but snowbank
a link of blood trickles down the glass
shes not taking any chances
without a sound she slips into her shoes coat
gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet
suddenly he stirs groaning
the seconds ticking by on the dashboard clock
when he doesnt wake she resumes fumbling for her cell
then eases open the creaky passenger door
and launches herself into the frigid night
she hurries down the road away from the car
breath clouding in the frigid air
punches in numbers on her cell phone
wind chill yellow revisions
no signal bars
shes starting to freak now
she hits the redial button
suddenly from behind what are you doing
she screams spins around
hes standing right behind her his face in silhouette
or trying to
shakes head no cant
i cant get a signal here
he receives this news with a strange calm
girl contd what about yours
i dont have a cell
how can you not have a cell
ignoring her howre you doing
you all right
yeah im okay
what about you
i dont know
think i hit my head
he puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on it
like someone testing a melon for ripeness
come to think of it his speech is a little wooden
wind chill yellow revisions
she watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away
guy contd what happened to the uh the guy
asshole who ran us off the road
shes completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now
she turns to look puzzled
theres no sign of the other vehicle anywhere
i dont know
i guess maybe he decided just to hit and run
so where are his tire tracks
she looks sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow
in case you havent noticed its coming down pretty hard
points yeah but you can still see our tracks
the mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post accident fog bringing him back into sharper focus
she watches as he walks out in front of the olds headlights to the middle of the road where the other vehicles tracks should be
guy contd what the hell
he walks back to the olds and opens the passenger door the only access into or out of the stranded car thanks to the snowbank
he begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight
wind chill yellow revisions
deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it
she looks back down the long dark road
looks back at him bent over rummaging in the oldsmobile
curiosity getting the better of her she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself
just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints
to herself this doesnt make any sense
at that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight
he spokes it sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings
the left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlights beam cant penetrate it
he cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs
calling she jumps at the sound of his voice her nerves frazzled
guy contd calling his voice is swallowed by the dark
after the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the sizzle of falling snow and a weird otherworldly hum
he snaps off his flashlight thrusts it into his coat pocket
wind chill yellow revisions
i guess we see how bad were stuck
they trudge back to the car boots crunching in the snow
guy contd you steer ill push
he holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in scooting over into the drivers seat
he leaves the door open so they can communicate
he walks back to the rear of the stranded oldsmobile
hes pulling on gloves when something half buried in the snow nearby catches his eye
he takes out the flashlight shines it at the roadside
little wooden crosses
just two this time
another sad shrine to a different set of anonymous victims of route
their proximity to the stranded olds obviously unsettles him
he bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against the rear bumper
the tail lights come on as she turns the ignition
he hears her crank the starter motor
finally turning over
she slips the oldsmobile in gear and he starts pushing
the rear tires spin throwing slush but car wont budge
guy contd calling give it more gas
she floors it the tires screaming
wind chill yellow revisions
he puts everything hes got into pushing but its no use
suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side
he drops out of view disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust
a beat later he pulls himself up pounds on the trunk
guy contd stop
the tires stop spinning
shes sitting in the drivers seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch crunch crunch of his approaching footsteps
in that moment she makes a decision
scrambles across the front seat pulls the door shut hard
he arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the power locks all go thunk
hes locked out
hey open up
he tugs at the handle a few times
knocks on the window
guy contd you wanna pop the locks
when theres no response from her he puts his lips to the half inch gap at the top of the stuck window
guy contd you gonna unlock the door or what
she sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window
she keeps her eyes down focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone
wind chill yellow revisions
guy contd hey cmon its freezing out here
better get used to it asshole
he rattles the door handle starting to get panicked now
what the hell is wrong with you
what did i do
but shes in full blown paranoid mode now near hysterics
you drove us here thats what you did
what the hell did you think you were doing
i thought i was driving you home
youre not driving me home because one you dont live near my home and two this piece of shit isnt driving anywhere
now what are we doing here
why did you get off the highway
i told you this is a shortcut
anyway you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway
this used to be called scenic because theres an amazing view of the valley one youve never been anywhere near here before so dont pretend you knew its a shortcut
and two theres an amazing view of shit he stands there as she freaks out
let me get this straight
you think i intentionally arranged for us get stranded out here
it was an wind chill yellow revisions
guy contd accident
you saw the other car
you think he was in on it too
maybe hes like your black pete or something
why the hell did you tell me that story anyway
lying anyway ive got news for you
i got through to a friends voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious
im sure shes called the cops by now
would you listen to yourself
what kind of psycho do you think i am
he straightens exasperated puts a hand to his injured head
she looks at him standing there hugging himself against the sub zero cold his teeth chattering
he doesnt look like an ax murderer
she doesnt know what to do
theres a long beat
finally he throws up his hands in disgust decides to go to plan b
im gonna walk back to the gas station for help
youve got the heater and the radio so you should be all right here
though i really think you should consider coming with me
i bet you do
if you feel a draft and you want to patch this
wind chill yellow revisions
sticking his fingertips through the half inch gap at the top of the stuck passenger side window
guy contd i keep duct tape in the back
sarcastic i bet you do
he looks in at her one last time exits
she listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she cant hear them anymore
suddenly theres a loud bang against the passenger side window
he goes crazy on the stranded olds punching the roof jerking the door handle kicking the door screaming at her the whole time
she cowers inside scared to death
finally he gives up and with a final bang to the roof exits
he turns and heads back down the road
we watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away his boots crunch crunch crunching in the snow
leans his weight against a tree
looks back at the car
whatever it is hes doing hes clearly not walking to the gas station
he straightens and continues on until hes out of sight
the stranded oldsmobile sits on the roadside engine running hood and windshield covered in white
the interior lights are on giving it an enchanted look like a cottage in a grimms fairytale
wind chill yellow revisions
shes in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions looking for the duct tape
despite the heater its cold enough in the car thanks to the gap in the window to see her breath
a public service announcement plays on the cars radio
the national weather service has issued a winter storm warning for the entire eastern seaboard
box of condoms
a copy of the tibetan book of the dead
a cheap radio shack telephone wrapped in its cord
a crow bar which she tosses up to the front seat
radio psa contd carbon county residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches
suddenly we see a blur of movement outside the cars foggy rear window
but shes too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice
finally she finds what shes looking for silver duct tape
also a pair of scissors
she holds the scissors like a dagger clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself
she climbs up front rips off a three foot length of tape
again in the b
more movement outside the car
but shes too busy sealing the passengers side window against the frigid draft to notice that someones outside
radio psa contd state and local officials are urging residents to remain indoors wind chill yellow revisions
radio psa contd as wind chills plunge to fifteen below overnight
finally she glimpses movement outside the passenger window
she gasps ducking out of sight below the cars dashboard
she doesnt move listening her eyes bright with fear
after a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel
the windshield is fogged so she wipes a peephole in the condensate
its too dark to see much beyond the cars hood
she reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column
flicks on the headlights
a stranger is walking away down the middle of the dark road
she screams reaches instinctively to check the power locks
the stranger a black man dressed in a dirty suit walks with hunched shoulders
snow swirling around him in the darkness
who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm
over her initial shock now she reaches for the door handle
she gets out of the car clutching the scissors in both hands like a dagger
she stands behind the protection of the open car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead
theres a weird humming noise in the air she cant place
no reaction from the stranger
girl contd hello
do you live around here
maybe hes deaf
she moves out from behind the safety of the car door and starts after the stranger keeping her distance as she calls wind chill yellow revisions
girl contd we had an accident
my friend went for help
hell be back any second
the strangers dapper suit is more than dishevelled
its soaking wet caked in motor oil or some other dark slime
girl contd kinda crappy night for a walk dont you think
and theres something definitely off about his shuffling
its like hes crippled or injured
in fact he seems to be crying
or is it moaning
girl contd hey wait
but the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road headed in the direction of the dark stand of trees beyond
soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and disappears into the gloom
girl contd what the hell
spooked she begins to back toward the stranded oldsmobile
backs into hey
guy contd jesus
its just me
stay away from me
she brandishes the scissors
he puts up two hands defensively
take it easy
the guy what guy
wind chill yellow revisions
i dont know it was weird
i saw some guy walking down the road
where did he go
i dont know
into the woods
her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared as if not sure which is the greater threat
its freezing out here
lets just get in the car and you can tell me what happened
paranoid what are you doing back so soon
what about hiking to the gas station
it was closed
i was going to leave a note but i didnt
have anything to write with
she clutches the scissors tighter not believing a word
but those places are supposed to stay open
why wasnt it open
how the hell should i know
look can we continue this conversation in the car cause im freezing my balls off standing out here
shrieks im not getting into the car with you you psycho
he closes his eyes and shakes his head beyond frustrated
wind chill yellow revisions
im getting in
youre welcome to join me
he turns and trudges back to the oldsmobile climbs in and pulls the door shut after him
leaving her there in the snowy road clutching the scissors her teeth chattering
she stands there shivering looking very small and alone
hold on her as she weighs her options stay out here and freeze
or risk seeking shelter with a stalker
not much of a choice
he looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in
she pulls the door shut behind her then huddles against it
eyeing him warily
he starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors relax
and switches off the overhead interior lights explaining guy contd we need to conserve the battery
with the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow
she pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a
her eyes cut to the dashboard clock
thats not right
checks watch huh
no its not
it should read
he frowns looking down at his watch
he holds it to his ear
wind chill yellow revisions
guy contd my watch stopped
guess well just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock
he tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat
suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head
he touches two fingers to the left side of his head
they come away bloody
as he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood now beginning to melt
the collar of his coat is soaked with it
it doesnt look like nothing
scalp wounds bleed a lot
head wounds in general
thats why if youre ever in a bar fight the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose
itll make his eyes fill with blood and snot and buy you enough time to run away
softening amused thats really useful thanks
a tense silence fills the car
he closes his eyes and leans his head back as if trying to catch a few zs
girl contd so where are you from really
wind chill yellow revisions
eyes closed place called glens falls
thats not in delaware
thats like in the complete opposite direction
thats like twenty minutes from school
all right all right so i lied
eyes still closed he answers in a flat uninflected voice
i just thought you seemed cool
i dont have a line or a game or whatever the hell its called
so when i saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours i took it
she ponders this for a beat one piece still not clicking
but how did you know where i lived
which explains how you found out i was from delaware
but not how you knew i needed a ride home
i mean i always fly
how could you possibly know that for like the wind chill yellow revisions a
girl contd first time in my college career i was planning on going greyhound just then her eyes go wide as it suddenly dawns on her
wind chill yellow revisions
a series of quick cuts revisits events from earlier that day
the text message y dont u check the ride board
her looking up smiling
sitting behind her reading the message our guy
who bolts from his seat the instant class is dismissed
who turns out to be the one who jostled her on his way out
he races across the empty quad scribbling on the run
tears the improvised notice out of his spiral notebook
slaps it up on the ride board just in the nick of time
as she enters and sees ne need a ride delaware
she looks at him the pieces all finally falling into place
he makes no effort to explain
doesnt even open his eyes
bitter forgive me for attempting a romantic gesture
not if things worked out between us
i wouldve told you everything eventually and then it wouldnt be stalkerish
it would just be this sweet funny story wed have
he sits up sharply temper boiling over glaring at her
wind chill yellow revisions
okay youve made your point
im a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses
can we drop this already
changing subject christ
he leans over the seatback begins rummaging in the back
guy contd did you see a bag of groceries in the trunk
at mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of the gas station
i think i mightve left it in the parking lot
it was an accident shit
i spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like
saint andres cheese and carrs crackers and those stupid little french pickles i forget what theyre called quietly cornichons
i love cornichons
he sighs slumps back behind the steering wheel defeated
the wind blows
in between gusts its quiet except for the strange hum
wind chill yellow revisions
shes still huddled up front still holding her scissors
hes in the back seat scouring the car for anything edible scrounging tic tacs stale pretzel nibs a candy bar etc
i think i remember losing pack of big red down the back seat cushions last week
he thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef
his hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions among the seatbelts lost nickels and dimes lint
suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard
his face contorts in agony
then changes to a smile as he pulls his hand free unhurt holding a stick of gum
guy contd kidding
she looks at him in mute fury and disbelief
he shrugs unwraps a stick of big red and pops it into his mouth
suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the scissors
her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist but his grip is too strong
gritted teeth let go goddamnit
wind chill yellow revisions
give them to me
with his free hand he reaches over and wrenches the scissors away from her his eyes flashing
she gives a little terrified whimper as he pulls her close brandishes the scissors
i need these
with the blade of the open scissors he divides a stale candy bar divvying it up
he closes the scissors
serves up the two halves of candy bar on napkins with a side of stale pretzel nibs
i still cant believe you left all our food in a stupid parking lot
look im sorry okay
ill write you a check for sixty bucks if it will make you get off my case
i dont know what else i can say
lets just eat
they eat in silence each chewing the unappetizing dinner
guy contd to himself story of my life
you seem cool at first
wind chill yellow revisions
what the hell are you talking about
you should all come with a warning like car mirrors objects in belly shirts are flakier than they appear
you want to talk about fake
how about guys who pretend to be from delaware to meet girls
how about we just stop talking altogether
because now that im not some nietzche spouting sexbot suddenly im not worth knowing
and whos fault is that
he doesnt answer only withdraws into himself sulking
all of a sudden the oldsmobile gives a shudder
and then the engine dies
they leap out to investigate dropping down on all fours to shine the flashlight under the chassis
under the car
the beam illuminates a yellow crater of melted snow beneath the cars undercarriage
she reaches under to scoop up some of the yellow snow
retrieves it so she can hold it under her nose and sniff
wind chill yellow revisions
fuel tank mustve been ruptured in the accident
can you fix it
not unless you have a welding rig in all that shit of yours
and even if you did it wouldnt matter
were out of gas
but we still have the battery right
as long as we use it sparingly it should last the night
question is will we
what do you mean
she gives him a sober look as the storm rages around them
he looks at her a look of grim determination on his face
he marches to the car pops the trunk
retrieves her suitcase
he dumps her suitcase in front
she climbs in after it
slams the door
he rolls into the back fishes his suitcase out of the mess
wind chill yellow revisions
guy contd only thing thats gonna get us to sun up
so put aside fashion sense and start layering everything you brought
but i didnt bring anything
he raises an eyebrow leans over the front seat to unzip her suitcase and see for himself
christmas gifts skimpy tees panties and bras a bikini
defensive im sorry but who could prepare for something like this
ive got a complete winter wardrobe its just in delaware
and no that doesnt make me a flake
he unzips his suitcase
starts pulling out ragg socks long sleeve pullovers etc
he shoves a ball of clothes into her hands without a word
the kids have retreated to the front and back seats for privacy while they change
not an easy proposition in the cramped quarters
she strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible
puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things
he slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants
its obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her
also that he took the backseat because its more cramped than the front
wind chill yellow revisions
once theyre finished dressing he reaches up switches off the interior light
they lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence watching their breath plume in the cold air
note from this point on their breath will always be visible in the car
he hears her sigh restless
whats the matter
i cant feel my toes
nothing much they can do about it
they fall silent again
guy contd you know there is a better way for two people to conserve body heat dream on
but we see her smiling a little in the dark front seat
they lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable
finally she sits up
she starts to climb over into the cramped front seat intending to go outside
he winces when she puts a hand on his chest to steady herself as she climbs over him
testy why didnt you go before when we were outside
because its freezing out
were talking about an arctic air mass out of canada
wind chill yellow revisions
its still freezing out yeah but now ive got to go
promise not to look
she pops the door and exits
she climbs out into the bitter cold hunched against the howling wind and moves off as far as she dares from the car
she fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple layers turns her back to the car squats to pee
her teeth chatter as she does her business one wary eye peeled to catch the guy peeking
suddenly out of the gloom appears a dark figure moving by very near her
tumbles back onto her ass
as shes struggling to pull up her pants more dark figures appear moving in the same direction
as the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she glimpses his face elderly and unremarkable at first glance then for an instant changing into a twisted ashen deathmask
her scream brings our guy bolting out of the car
but it all happened so fast she doesnt believe her eyes
she gestures at the procession of dark figures disappearing ahead
still in shock did you see
they were right here
why didnt you stop them
maybe they have a phone
wind chill yellow revisions
our guy ducks back into the car retrieves a flashlight from the glove compartment
he eases the door shut carefully so it doesnt latch and accidentally lock them out
the he starts off running after the figures
scared as she is she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by herself
the two kids arrive at the place on the road top of a ravine disappearing thirty feet below where the dark figures seemed to be headed
only to find no one there
whered they go
she looks where hes pointing with the flashlight on the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are several tall old men in dark coats dispersing through the
as if whatever somber occasion that brought them to the ravine has ended
guy contd calling hey
we need help here
climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous so the kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away where they can follow the dark figures into the
they follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight through the trees in pursuit of the old man in black coat and fedora
our guy falls behind winded
wind chill yellow revisions
gotta just a sec catch my still unnerved maybe we should go back to the car
there must be a house or something
ill catch up
she trudges on ahead her footsteps growing fainter finally fading entirely
hes alone now
he leans against a tree to catch his breath wincing in pain
for an instant it seems like hes going to be sick
but then he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow
though still winded he pushes on
a few minutes later he trudges into view
no sign of our girl
he arrives at the top of the hill
silhouetted against the night sky
his flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing
windowless and long abandoned its ceiling and walls caved in around a large stone chimney
he crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large stone fireplace now stuffed with trash and dead leaves
his flashlight beam finds a small iron door built into the side of the chimney
wind chill yellow revisions
he kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open
gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox
retrieves a bunch of old newspapers
he stuffs them inside the front of his jacket
continues rummaging around in the firebox
as he rises he winces in pain one hand going to his side
he takes slow breaths until the pain subsides
he turns in a slow circle
his flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins the beam picking out what look like branches frozen into claws reaching from
its lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe teeth clenched in a terrible rictus icicles dripping from nose clawlike fingers eyes
hes so startled he nearly drops the flashlight
the wayward light finding another frozen corpse in a nearby bed mere feet away another rictus grimace clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him
and then another
all old men
frozen in their death throes like the bodies from pompeii
one of the beds is empty
our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the beds occupant frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair
eye to eye with him
he reels in horror trips loses the flashlight as he goes sprawling
then recovers snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies and sees nothing no beds
no old men
wind chill yellow revisions a
just his footprints in the snow
our girl emerges from the trees having decided to give up the chase and return to the safety of the car
just as shes reaching for the door handle she gasps as a figure suddenly appears out of the darkness
wind chill yellow revisions
its the black stranger from earlier shuffling and mumbling
this time hes close enough for her to make out some of the words hes muttering please officer please dont
determined not to let him vanish again she takes off in pursuit coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road
dont put me in the river
suddenly she glances down sees why hes shuffling so oddly
his ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with baling wire as are his wrists
shocked oh my god
who did this to you
please officer just take the booze and let me go
she reaches toward him
the instant her hand nears him the wind howls deafeningly
she experiences a sudden powerful jolt almost as if shes grabbed a live wire
only instead of electric heat she feels a terrible otherwordly cold
the jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze and for the first time he becomes aware of her
he raises his frightened eyes to her slowly and in doing so reveals his face
a scream builds in her throat at sight of him
the strangers face is bloodless bloated swollen with rot
a sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves as if hes trying to speak
but instead of words emerging his throat suddenly bulges
somethings in there fighting its way up his esophagus
wind chill yellow revisions
she watches in horror as it emerges blind and wriggling like a blood fattened leech
forcing its way out through his lips to land at his feet with a wet plop
it lies there writhing in the fresh snow
a river eel
pov of our guy running blindly through the woods flashlight beam throwing weird bouncing shadows across the trees boots crunching in the snow sound of his gasping breaths
he stops wracked with pain and doubles over with hands on knees to catch his breath
in the silence he hears her scream coming from ahead
he stands and though still winded starts running again
our guy emerges from the woods still carrying the newspapers he found in time to find our girl white with shock and screaming
he grabs her by the shoulders shakes her
her screams give way to hyperventilating sobs
where were you
i was looking for those guys
i didnt see anyone hesitating at the memory theres nobody up there
whats wrong whats wrong
did you see someone
there was another guy
she starts to tell him then stops not sure if she believes it herself
wind chill yellow revisions
suddenly he looks down notices her blackened mitten on her right hand
the palm is blistered and raw
he takes her hand gingerly examines it
she winces in pain
what happened to you
this looks like
i tried to
he raises his eyes from her frostbite looks at the dark silent stand of dense woods surrounding them
they exchange a look of knowing concern
lets get back in the car
they start back in the direction of the stranded oldsmobile
pan down to the road where something moves weakly under the fresh powdering of snow
the river eel in its death throes
they climb back inside
he pulls the old newspapers out from inside his jacket tosses them on the dashboard
she pulls the passenger door shut
the duct tape has come loose allowing a cold draft in through the cracked window
wind chill yellow revisions
she notices the newspapers on the dash grabs them
whered these come from
theres the ruins of an old house or something back in the woods
give me the duct tape
he hands it to her and she starts using the tape and old newspapers to seal out the draft
when shes finished he starts to climb over into the back
girl contd softly wait
she looks at him too embarrassed to ask him to hold her
it takes him a beat to understand
then he crawls over to her and they spoon together in the front seat finding their best fit
any awkwardness quickly passes
they lie there too frightened to sleep
our kids lie awake him spooning her listening to the radio quietly playing christmas music segue into brenda lees rockin around the christmas tree
are you awake
teeth chattering uh huh
d dont want to sleep
wind chill yellow revisions a
because im afraid i wont wake up
thats what they say happens
when wind chill yellow revisions
girl contd you freeze to death
its like going to sleep
there are worse ways to go
someone is outside knocking on the oldsmobiles window
they both jump startled
he glances up into the rearview mirror sees headlights behind them and a red flashing light
guy contd a cop
she cranks down the icy passenger side window revealing the silhouette of a highway patrolman standing just outside s wearing a trim fitting uniform and a stiff brimmed troopers hat
everything all right in there
the kids speak over one another in their relief to see him
you dont know how glad we are to see you
you wont believe whats been happening
the cop listens without comment shining his flashlight over the cars interior
having car trouble huh
someone ran us off the road
he shines the flashlight directly in our girls eyes
theres no parking here
what are you talking about
were not parking here
didnt you hear what she said
someone ran us off wind chill yellow revisions
of course i might be willing to let you off with a warning this time
if we can come to some sort of arrangement
what are you talking ab the girl quicker to catch on than the guy puts a hand on his arm
whispers its a shake down
hes probably partners with the guy who ran us off the road
wouldnt be surprised if he has a deal with the tow guy too
he turns to her says in an angry whisper you think this whole thing was a scam
jesus he couldve killed us
but shes already digging cash out of her purse
fierce whisper how much cash do you have on you
he looks at her in disbelief
sees that shes serious
he digs out his wallet starts to climb over her to exit
she stops him
girl contd how many speeding tickets have you sweet talked your way out of
he concedes her point silently
she plucks the money from his hand
opens the door
she exits the stranded car into the frigid cold
the cop waits facing away in the spotlight like glare of his idling patrol cars headlights
wind chill yellow revisions
she walks back toward him finds him mopping the back of his neck with a handkerchief
this is all we have
some weather were having
yeah its really coming down
indicating the money so what do you say
how bout a little christmas spirit here
still facing away you know this is one bad stretch of road
all kinds of trouble going on up here kids drag racing
niggers hauling booze across the state lines
lady drivers breaking down no one ever hears from them again
her bravado begins to flag
this isnt the kind of police officer shes used to dealing with
she glances worriedly back in the direction of the olds
we just want to get out of here so if you could just she holds out the money but he ignores it
let me tell you ive seen a lot of fatalities on this road
he takes off his hat so he can mop his brow
as he turns she gets a first good look at his face handsome but hard with cruel snake charmers eyes looking back at her
highway patrolman contd youre lucky i came along when i did
so why dont we get in my car
shes scared now
wind chill yellow revisions
she looks past him to where the highway patrol car sits idling in a red plume of exhaust fumes
backing away i think maybe i just want to go back she startles as if slapped too horrified to parse his meaning
she continues backing away until shes backed up against the trunk of the olds
the cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop
she glances over her shoulder to see what hes looking at a light on the hilltop where the burned out ruins stand
and weirder still theres a figure in silhouette standing nearby
the cop darkens enraged by this unwanted audience
his face contorts fury building in him until he trembles with it
he rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver says to her in a low urgent voice get in the damn patrol car
she starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him
the highway patrolmans boots crunching behind her
the patrol cars headlights are blinding
she moves towards them squinting as if moving down a tunnel of light
terrified beginning to cry please
just let us go
wind chill yellow revisions
weve got an audience
begging but we didnt do anything
we wont tell anybody if you let us get away from her you bastard
suddenly the guy appears brandishing a crowbar
he swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolmans head
the cops head crumples inward
the cops expression of fury suddenly stutters like film slipping in the projector as two worlds that should never intersect do violently for an instant the cops face appears
like a human face projected onto a scorched and melting balloon
the image flickers and on an ear splitting howl we suddenly jarringly the kids are seated back inside the car
as if someone hit reset
stunned what just
i dont know
unsure but it did happen right
our guy winces in pain
tilt down to reveal frostbitten still clutching the crowbar
she tries to take it out of his bloody blackened hands and he gasps in agony
wind chill yellow revisions
girl contd oh jesus
she pours water from a plastic bottle over his palms to try and break the seal between the fused skin and metal
girl contd ok hold on this is going to hurt
she fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free
it comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached
his palms are bloody pulps
he fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him
the pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes
his teeth chatter hes teetering on the edge of shock
guy contd how bad
frostbite second and third degree
how do you know
you take a first aid course or something
ski camp seventh grade
off his look dont make fun
what else do you have going on when youre thirteen
she stretches herself out alongside him in the back seat
tugs up her layers of sweaters to expose her stomach
weak im kinda not in the mood anymore
we have to rewarm your hands
you have ice crystals in your blood
if we dont get circulation restored you could lose your fingers
wind chill yellow revisions
she takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible presses them against the warm skin of her belly rewarming them
they lie there in silence for a beat faces inches apart
girl contd what just happened to us out there
what do you mean
you were there
i know but who was he
whered he go
its like one minute theres a a gun to my head and the next all the lights go out and hes gone like a like a ghost
her eyes cut to his afraid resistent to the very idea
and the old guys we chased no
how do you explain i dont know
this is crazy
i cant be having this conversation
forceful youre having it
i dont want to
you think i do
im just as freaked by whats happening as you
but we have to deal with it cause like it or not it is happening
wind chill yellow revisions
then how do we make it stop
i dont know
they dont cover this in philosophy
casting for ideas what about that book in the back
something book of the dead
its not a how to manual
its an th century buddhist guide on death and dying
why is this happening to us
he doesnt have an answer
they fall silent for a beat
hands on her belly i can feel your stomach rumbling
god id give anything for some of those carrs crackers right now
trying to take their minds off the grim situation
girl contd so what else was in the grocery bag i forgot
um lets see
duck liver pate with truffles
wind chill yellow revisions
some olives the normal kind and also some of the little shrivelled black ones
a bottle of white wine
and for dessert anisette biscotti and a thermos of espresso
she closes her eyes imagining the meal that mightve been
girl contd thats pretty much the exact meal id order for my last day on earth
i swear to god if we ever get out of here im going to have to get a restraining order against if they ever get out of here
her eyes brim tears spilling down her cheeks
he tries to sound optimistic
cant be too much longer until dawn
someones bound to come along then
a snowplow or something
how are your hands
starting to burn
it means the circulations coming back
winces yeah but i mean really burn
i think i have a few tylenol with codeine in my purse
wind chill yellow revisions
she climbs into the front seat and searches through her purse for the prescription bottle
with the poor light and without her contacts she has trouble finding it
she takes out her glasses and a little embarrassed slips them on
whats taking so long nurse i just shes about to climb back when something catches her eye
the one used to patch the small gap in the passenger window
theres a faded photograph of a group of elderly priests gathered around a mangled ford crown vic
we recognize one of them glancing back over his shoulder at the camera as the leader of the mysterious procession of dark figures from earlier
girl contd oh my god
i think i know who our old guys are
i mean were
below the accident scene photo are high school yearbook portraits of two teenage boys with crewcuts and letter jackets bearing a distinctive team insignia the cougars
across the top of the paper is a torn headline north granville youths killed in joy riding accident and below it cougars coach mourns loss
girl contd reading
first to arrive at the scene were roman catholic priests from st
christophers home for retired clergy
suddenly the interior light fizzles out making her jump
she reaches up and taps on it until it flickers back on
wind chill yellow revisions
hearing the crash on nearby route they braved inclement weather to administer last rights
that must be what we saw them doing
she skim reads ahead trying to glean more information
also killed was state highway patrolman
continued on page seven
she tears the brittle top pages of the newspaper away
finds there is no page seven
gritted teeth you got that tylenol
she climbs over into the back seat feeds him two of the tylenol with a sip of water from a bottle
then stretches out alongside him again
girl contd we should take turns keeping watch
in case he comes back
eyelids heavy okay
ill go first
you get some sleep
he drifts off to sleep
wind chill yellow revisions
both kids are asleep in the back seat
shes dreaming her eyes roving behind closed lids
all of a sudden she stirs eyes fluttering open in the dark
woken by a cold draft
she shivers sits up disentangling herself from the guy snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat
she locates the source of the draft
the stuck passenger window up front where the duct tape newspaper patch has come loose
she shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in
she grabs the roll of duct tape climbs up into the front
tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one
she smooths it in place her teeth chattering between yawns
just then the radio snaps on by itself
rockin around the christmas tree at the christ mas par ty hop
her eyes cut to the backlit radio dial as the song continues
brenda lee contd mistletoe hung where you can see evry couple tries to stop the radio shuts off mid song
she holds still scared to move scared to even breathe
her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in a weird staccato way thats more morse code than loose wire
after a few seconds it stops
the seconds creep by on the dashboard clock
she peeks over the front seat looking out the back window wondering where his highway patrol car is
wind chill yellow revisions
which is when a gloved fist punches through the window and hauls her kicking and screaming out of the oldsmobile
and into a sweltering summer night in the late s
what follows is brutal and hallucinatory a series of shots that thrust us into the sickening first person pov of a blonde young woman in the final moments of her
the rasp of cicadas in the treetops provide the only soundtrack to the assault as we see close on their feet high heels and boots doing a violent two step
as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder handheld footage as shes dragged toward his idling patrol car pov of a full moon in the tree tops dispassionate spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of road close up of the cops mouth twisted with lust as he whispers something obscene we cannot hear
close on his hand working its way up to her throat forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck
pov underneath his patrol car as his boots kick her feet apart and take up position between them the brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with
a scowl of surprise and the cops scowl curdles into a look of outrage at sight of silhouettes of old men watching on the hilltop roused by the commotion down on the road below wind chill yellow revisions
the cop wrenches open the back door of the car hurls her in slams the door shut
he shoots a warning look in the direction of the silhouettes on the hilltop that says dont fuck with me
then he climbs behind the wheel of his car and drives off
our girls face as her eyes snap open and she bolts upright in the backseat scaring the shit out of our guy
you were having some kind of seizure or someth he doesnt get to finish his sentence her eyes roll back in her head and she collapses again as if yanked
down by an undertow
she starts violently convulsing in the cramped confines of the back seat limbs flailing feet kicking windows etc
our guy tries everything to wake her shaking her shoulders slapping her face hard
but its no use the nightmare has her again
he sits back helplessly looking on
suddenly the radio snaps on mid song scaring the crap out of him
you will get a sen ti men tal fee ling when you hear
voices singing lets be jolly deck the halls with boughs of holly
the cars rear window brightens with approaching headlights of a highway patrol car its strobe light flooding the oldsmobiles interior with red
from our girls eyes going crazy in r
pattern we wind chill yellow revisions
in a series of hallucinatory shots we see the blondes lifeless body shoeless dress torn being dragged through the undergrowth and left in a secluded wooded spot
the cop kicks leaves and dirt over the body then exits
close on the radio midway through rockin around the christmas tree
our guy listens to the crunch crunch crunch of the cops boots outside in the snow circling the snowbound oldsmobile
whistling along with the song that always accompanies him
suddenly the dashboard air vents all open simultaneously
a gust of supernaturally frigid cold blows in like the icy breath of old man winter himself
white frost spreads with time lapse velocity from the air vents across the dashboard
our guy scrambles up front slapping the air vents closed
begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the vents to keep out the lethal chill
close on our girl as her nightmare becomes even more violent another night and a different victim
in a series of shots we see the black stranger pleading for his life as his wrists and ankles are bound roughly with baling wire by the cop
ignoring the strangers desperate pleas the cop drags him by the bound wrists through the woods and shoves him down a muddy incline
he splashes facedown in a shallow stream
wind chill yellow revisions
and our girl finally surfaces from the dream as if coming up for air with a huge gasp and eyes wild with fear
only to find herself in a waking nightmare
the car interior flooded with red
our guy terrified
she climbs up front to help our guy frantically taping over the vents
a shadow moves by the windshield and she gasps as another shadow goes by in a blur past the back window and he gasps the assault coming from everywhere at
once now the cop an elemental force like the storm itself
skittering along the undercarriage one moment across the metal roof the next
even appearing fleetingly impossibly in the snow on the blocked drivers side window
all the electronics in the car start going crazy power locks opening and closing the interior light flickering the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly the windshield wipers sweeping back and
then stop all at once
even the radio snaps off
dead silence for a beat
then an odd scuttling sound underfoot something crawling along the undercarriage of the car
our guy sits there frozen with fear too scared to move to even breathe
likewise the girl sits nervously watching her breath in the cold
her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror a blue faced dead baby stares back at her from the rear window ledge
she swings around looks back at the window
but nothings there
wind chill yellow revisions
she turns back he looks at her with concern
unsure of her own senses she shakes him off
suddenly the scuttling noises outside explode into to a full blown assault
theres the shriek of rending metal the thing outside begins hammering at the cars hood doors etc
the car gives a violent shudder side to side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe
the radio snaps back on the saxophone solo in the brenda lee song accompanying the violent clangs and groans of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car
rips away muffler brake lines wrenches the handles from the doors etc
rockin around the christmas tree have a happy hol i day
our guy claps hands over his ears so he cant hear the sound of the cops rage as he attacks the car fury growing and growing until its indistinguishable from
the howling wind outside
the attack ends
the red police light in the rear window fades
leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence
i guess when he couldnt get in he gave up
suddenly grinning i told you these olds were built like tanks
he turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at the rear window
guy contd nervous relief hah
next time pick on someone driving a hyundai wind chill yellow revisions
she claps a hand over his mouth
how do you know its not a trick
he could still be out there waiting hes not
they sit in silence listening but hear only the wind
but what if he comes back
we just have to stay in the car until morning
then well be safe
that cant be more than like a few more hours
someones bound to come along once the sun comes up
someone human i mean
think you can hold on until then
shy what if you know
we have to pee
we can use the empty water bottles
from this point on the back seat is a co ed bathroom
sound like a plan
sounds like a plan
guy contd why dont you try to get some sleep
ill take the next watch
she shakes her head eyes full of fear
wind chill yellow revisions
i dont want to sleep
he nods understanding
so they just hunker down in the front seat staring at the snow covered windshield and start the long wait to morning
the snow is slacking off
the stranded oldsmobile is now completely snowbound a car shaped hillock of white on the roadside
the interior of the car is eerily quiet cocooned in snow
the kids sit in silence in the front seat fighting to stay awake
his face is pale skull visible beneath the skin
she stares at the black snow covered windshield
i gotta pee
she climbs over into the back seat and crouches down urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle
guy contd teasing i swear i never met anyone who had to go so much
you should ask santa to bring you a bigger bladder
wind chill yellow revisions
its hard enough doing this in front of you
what are you one of those people who cant pee with the bathroom door open
but its not something i usually do until much later in a relationship
she catches herself at the last second but its too late the word relationship hangs in the air
finished peeing she twists the cap on the water bottle
sets it on the floor with the other urine filled bottles
noticing one bottle that doesnt look like the others
she climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine bottle which is tinged with pink
girl contd what the hell is this
is this blood
girl contd how badly were you hurt in the crash
shrugs no big deal
just your average day in the nhl
but she sees through his tough guy facade
how long have you known
since i tried hiking back to the gas station
you were right i never got anywhere near it
i wind chill yellow revisions a
guy contd started hurling blood so i turned around and came back
why didnt you tell me
i didnt want to scare you wind chill yellow revisions
suddenly he goes rigid in pain his teeth clenched
she looks on helplessly
weve got to get you some help now
you wont make it to morning
im going to try and hike back to the gas station how far do you think youd get out there before running into mr
im not going to just sit here and watch you die
they sit there a moment in silence
she digs out her cellphone and checks for a signal no signal bars
girl contd to herself damn it
we need a land line
a long beat
then shes struck by an idea
she switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield
wipes at the foggy glass until shes got enough of a peephole to peek out
what are you looking at
they must have a junction box or something to test the lines
see that one
she indicates a telephone pole twenty yards up from them
theres a small grey steel junction box near the top
she turns leaning over the seatback to rummage among his junk in the back
she retrieves his old wall telephone examines the jack at end of its cord
wind chill yellow revisions
so maybe theres some way i can
i dont know
jack into it or something
try and call for help
you want to climb a telephone pole
of course i dont want to
but its got rungs
cant be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym
big fat repair guys do it all the time right
trying to convince herself
but youre forgetting one thing
hes out there
they both go quiet
she sits there with the phone in her lap brooding on this
until something clicks
that old christmas song on the radio
it always comes on just before he shows up
she switches on the radio
they hear elvis presleys blue christmas playing
girl contd keep listening
if rockin around the christmas tree comes on yell like hell
trying to convince herself hopefully ill have enough time to get back
wind chill yellow revisions
looking down at the stranded oldsmobile from the top of the telephone pole
the grey junction box in the foreground
the weird humming is louder here
he watches her prep for her mission out into the bitter cold
she disconnects the telephone receiver from its base wraps it in its chord stows it for safekeeping under her sweater
weak ive been thinking
maybe it wouldnt be so bad
repeating this life
over and over
exactly the same each time
even the last twenty four hours
wind chill yellow revisions
he shows a weak smile
even the last twenty four hours
girl contd yeah but its even nicer to think maybe we get a chance to fix all the things we screwed up the first time around dont you think
they fall silent both thinking about this
know what id do different
next time id just to walk up to you after class
and say hey
smiles you should
she uses her sweater cuff to make clean spot on his cheek
kisses him tenderly
the kiss working its way to his mouth lingering a beat
their lips part
he catches her arm as she reaches for the power window switch holds tight
urgently dont let me die out here she looks at him with fierce eyes full of determination
the look calms him at least a little
she keys the ignition lowers the passenger side window
the duct tape rips away as the window glides down admitting a mini avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold
she climbs out
viewed from high atop the telephone pole she looks small and vulnerable as she climbs out of the oldsmobile shaped igloo
wind chill yellow revisions
an eerie hush has fallen snow muffling sound except for the occasional forlorn wailing of the wind through the trees
she sets out through deep powder toward the telephone pole
teeth chattering he watches through the windshield as she begins her long trek across the moonlit expanse of white
he turns up the volume on the radio which is now playing a funereal church organ instrumental of silent night
the deep powder makes her trek difficult and shes soon winded
her breath plumes in the frigid arctic cold
close on the backlit radio dial as silent night concludes
in between static we hear a pre recorded public service the state weather bureau has issued an extreme cold warning
she leans into the wind as it gusts the cold bringing tears to her eyes
she puts her head down and soldiers on
residents of carbon county are advised to seek shelter as sub zero temperatures produce wind chills in excess of twenty below
arriving at the base of the telephone pole she peers up at the grey junction box high above
from here the top of the wind chill yellow revisions
telephone pole looks much higher than it did from the car
and the iron rungs look a lot narrower too
shes losing her nerve
she glances back to check no police lights are coming
then puts her foot on the first rung and hauls herself up
close on the radio where between increasingly long snatches of static we can just discern gene autrys version of here comes santa claus
the rungs are icy forcing her to climb slower than she would like
she keeps her eyes forward never once looking down
when the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside
shes midway to the top when her foot slips on an icy rung
she clutches the pole tightly wind whistling in her ears
she waits until her heart slows and shes recovered from her near fall
then looks up to gauge the distance left to the junction box
she reaches the last rung at the top of the telephone pole
its noisy up here thanks to the wind and the icy telephone wires source of the mysterious humming shes been hearing
she tries the little metal door of the grey junction box
she fumbles in her coat takes out the scissors uses them to try and pry open the junction box which turns out to be frozen shut not locked after all
it finally yields opening
wind chill yellow revisions
revealing a rats nest of multicolored wires and phone jacks
hurrying now she tugs her glove off with her teeth and with her bare hand retrieves the cord wrapped receiver from inside her sweater
in her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the scissors
which drop all the way down to disappear in the snow below
she concentrates now on the receiver
but her fingers are so clumsy from the cold she fumbles it
and the receiver falls too
then jerks to a stop a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord
which shes managed to catch
she winds the receiver up by its cord finally plugs the jack end into the junction box
hears a dial tone
girl contd stunned she did it oh my god
teeth chattering she thumbs for the operator
girl contd as it rings please please please please please on the third ring an operator answers
filtered nine one one emergency response
we need help
filtered whats that
can you repeat were on highway
oh god please hurry
we need help
my friend is hurt can you repeat your wind chill yellow revisions
the connection sparks and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone
when she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is dead
no way of knowing if her message got through
its a moment of such soul crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet
above the earth
close on the radio playing nothing but static now
her eyes open and she commences climbing back down to earth
she reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet
the snow does little to cushion her fall and she goes sprawling lays there for a dazed moment
she starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded olds
suddenly she stops as she comes upon standing in the snow veins visible through gravid skin
a thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot
our girl raises her eyes to see its the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of
her dress is in tattered ruins coated in leaves and dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave
her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck
our girl gasps and scrambles to her feet fleeing
only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with wind chill yellow revisions
the joyriding teens killed on christmas eve
both wear blood soaked letterman jackets bearing the distinctive cougar insignia and stand in a post accident haze
ones chest is concave stove in by the impact with the steering wheel
the others teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away
she reels away in horror forced to take the long way back to the oldsmobile
she runs the last few yards to the car where we can hear the eerie sound of static emanating from the radio as she hurls herself inside
she sits there out of breath
she glances over quickly at our guy gravely pale slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel
she chafes her hands to get the circulation going again
she turns down the volume on the radio
chattering teeth i did it got through but i dont know how much she understood the operator i mean he doesnt respond
girl contd just have to hope maybe they can trace the line when this too gets no response from him she looks over frowning
she scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him
which is when we see standing outside the car slack expressioned and staring
he stands there a beat then drifts off into the night
wind chill yellow revisions
girl contd hang in there cant be much longer
she reaches to jostle him awake
one touch confirms her worst fears
she reaches up to switch on the interior light to get a better look at him
girl contd oh god
her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it seems for a moment shes going to be sick
she covers her mouth muffling a cry of raw throated terror
then shakes him again harder this time desperate to wake him
girl contd no
dont leave me alone
tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria
she shakes him harder
his inert body spills to one side slumping against her
her grief turns to something else instinctive and immediate revulsion at the feel of his cold dead weight against her
she scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse
cowers against the passenger door
the interior light flickers out as the battery finally dies
the door opens and she backs out hauling the dead body after her
her face is red tear streaked
she strains to move his dead weight
her feet slip on the ice and she lets go of him catching herself on the open door
wind chill yellow revisions
she grabs the body under the armpits hauls with all her strength
drags him a few yards away from the oldsmobile
his boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow
behind her gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice
she goes down hard on her ass sprawling
sits there a beat as headlights appear on the dark horizon
we see them a split second before she does
when she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction and for an instant it almost seems as if
they dont register
then her eyes widen in terror she lets out a small whimper and leaps into action
she scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the oldsmobile only to find when she tugs on the handle that its stuck
she yanks on it harder getting frantic now as the headlights get brighter bearing down close enough now that we can hear the roar of the oncoming engine
she kicks the handle tugs with all her might rocking the car but not succeeding in getting the door open
as the headlights become blinding
suddenly theres the sound of brakes being engaged and the headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where shes standing in the middle of the road
she shields her eyes with an upraised hand
its a snowplow
the snowplow driver s sticks his head out the window
you kids okay
shes too stunned to speak
wind chill yellow revisions
the snowplow driver is a hale townie dressed like a high school principal on a hunting trip
he and our girl transfer our guys lifeless body to the back seat of the snowplow
inside the cab its blessedly warm
the dashboard panel gps and cb radio are lit up like a christmas tree
while the snowplow driver tests the front tire chains our girl checks on our guys body
the snowplow driver climbs up behind the wheel gives her a sympathetic look
picks up the c
dispatch come in
im out at the site of that reported accident on
one of them didnt make it
im taking the other directly to the trauma unit in hadleyville
the driver puts the snowplow in gear and sets off driving
her eyes cut to the where she sees the stranded oldsmobile receding in the distance
wind chill yellow revisions
the snowplow cruises along its plow blade throwing twin white roosters tails of ice and snow to either side
she stares blankly out the window at the snow swirling in the headlights
the snowplow driver makes small talk to help pass the time
been some real bad accidents on this road over the years
when i was growing up there was a family from new york city found out here froze solid three blue corpses sit in the car mother father infant
their gaping mouths frozen open in a silent rictus scream
the snowplow driver shakes his head at the eerie memory
fire department had to hose them down with hot water for two hours to thaw them out
i remember back in high school there was a stupid rumor going around if you went driving out here on moonless nights and looked up in your rearview you might
see the dead baby in your backseat
she frowns at this reminded of her earlier vision
wind chill yellow revisions
what about those ruins up on the hill
the retirement home for old priests
winter of they were all found froze to death in their beds
elderley priests lie motionless in their beds faces frozen in blue rictus deathmasks
the snowplow driver squints out at the murky horizon ahead
mustve been a pilot on the boiler went out or something
close on our girl processing this
she has her suspicions the truth isnt as simple as a pilot light blowing out
snowplow driver contd actually theres no big mystery why this is such a bad stretch of road for motorists
you got low lying fog that gets trapped in the valley reduces visibility to just then bright headlights appear out of the pre dawn gloom
snowplow driver contd who in the hell is out driving in this mess
he scowls raising a meaty hand to shield his eyes
a dread look of deja vu crosses our girls face
wind chill yellow revisions
snowplow driver contd must be tom mcclintic
only fellow i know who lives way out here
he reaches for the c
mike thumbs the switch
snowplow driver contd into microphone tom is that you
its not tom
and as the oncoming headlights of the highway patrolman get brighter she calmly buckles her seatbelt
the oncoming car roars down the middle of the pickups lane the distance between the speeding vehicles closing fast
the game of chicken is fast approaching the point of no return
they watch the oncoming headlights
doesnt this stupid son of a gun realize were bigger than him
no way hes going to win this fight
he blasts his horn but the headlights just keep coming
she braces for impact
at the last possible moment the snowplow driver jerks the wheel hard to the right
the snowplow fishtails out of control its plow blade slicing through snow and ice until metal bites blacktop throwing up sparks
the s highway patrol car the highway patrolman behind the wheel veering off in the opposite direction
wind chill yellow revisions
the snowplow flipping ass over teakettle inside the snowplow the world somersaults our guys body thrown halfway out of the shattered windshield onto the hood
the highway patrol car skidding off the side of the road and dropping from sight crashing with a splash somewhere in the darkness
as the snowplow comes to a rest right side up on its tires as we the wrecked snowplow has ended up on the edge of the ravine where the highway
patrol car disappeared
theres a metallic groan of hinges as the snowplows drivers side door opens and the snowplow driver dazed but unhurt climbs out
he calls down into the gloom below where we hear the faint sounds of the highway patrol cars radio playing rockin around the christmas tree
hang on officer im coming
then he begins to make his way down
our girl rouses from her post accident daze
sees the body of our guy thrown through the windshield
she eases it back inside and onto the seat beside her
she looks up in time to see through the windshield the snowplow driver making his way down the steep slippery ice and leaf covered embankment
her eyes go wide as she suddenly realizes where hes headed
she unbuckles her seatbelt throws open the passenger door exits
wind chill yellow revisions
the instant she sets foot outside she stops dead the blood rushing from her face and her eyes going wide in disbelief
pan degrees to reveal a landscape she knows all too well the stranded oldsmobile
the telephone pole she climbed
they havent gone anywhere
no time to puzzle it out
the sound of the snowplow driver making his way down the embankment o
stirs her to action
she starts down the steep snowy embankment after the snowplow driver who is now far enough below to be out of sight
calling down wait
dont go down there
suddenly the snowy leaves gives way under her and she slips
lands hard and slides the rest of the way down on her ass
she comes to a stop thirty feet below at the bottom of the ravine beside the surprised snowplow driver
and the highway patrol car
its resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the ravine wheels in the air
it looks like an overturned beetle
something moves in its front seat
the snowplow driver calls to the trapped highway patrolman
hang on officer
well get you out
she catches his arm to stop him
wind chill yellow revisions
dont go near it
we have to get him out of there
smoke rises from the cars gas tank a small fire burning
hes already dead
what the hell are you talking about
inside the overturned car the trapped highway patrolman struggles
his hat has fallen off and floats in the icy water flooding the car threatening to short the radio
which is playing the same song as christmas eve fifty seven years earlier
rockin around the christmas tree
despite being pinned upside down and in pain from injuries sustained in the accident he chuckles at his predicament
we realize hes been drinking
as he struggles to free himself the cop looks in the direction of the snowplow driver and our girl
shouldve known you vultures would turn up
try not to move officer you might have a neck injury
but the cop continues to struggle pain sobering him
what are you waiting for a letter from the bishop
suddenly it dawns on our girl that he isnt talking to them
also that they arent alone
widen to reveal a dozen elderly priests in black winter coats and fedoras are standing all around them on the snowy embankment faces grim
wind chill yellow revisions
the residents of st
christophers home for retired clergy
suddenly theres a whoosh as the engine fire spreads across the cars undercarriage moving toward the fuel tank
the priests exchange a look reaching some silent decision
the leader of the elderly priests comes forward
highway patrolman contd hurry it up i smell gas
the snowplow driver stands there confused by what hes witnessing
the old priest crouches down reaches through the open window past the trapped highway patrolman
rips out the chattering two way radio by its cord
the cops face registers disbelief then fury as he realizes the priests arent going to help him
are in fact condemning him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road
highway patrolman contd struggling oh no you dont
you bastards have no right to sit in judgement of me
i know what youre thinking but i had nothing to do with that drunk girls disappearance
i saw her home safely
just ask the county investigators
and anything else you think you saw
all of it was lawfully done
he sputters as gasoline drips on his face from above
another whoosh blue flames spreading out from the fuel line
the cop smells smoke a pleading note entering his voice now
highway patrolman contd please father
for the love of christ have mercy on a poor sinner
theres a small explosion and the inside of the car starts filling with flames and black smoke
the trapped highway patrolman begins burning alive cursing
wind chill yellow revisions
highway patrolman contd goddamn you filthy bastards
you think youll be rid of me
youll never be rid of me
ill be your worst nightmare
ill be the rest is lost in a second larger explosion
flames flicker on the elderly faces of the priests gathered here to bear mute witness
they watch the burning patrol car for a moment longer then one by one climb the embankment
the crash scene we saw depicted in the news clipping
the wrecked crown vic
priests administering last rights two the two teens in letter jackets one already dead the other breathing his last breaths
our girl and the rattled snowplow driver stand there in the silence and the flickering firelight from the burning car
we can go now
the snowplow driver stunned speechless can only stand there and nod
suddenly the cop launches himself out of the window of the overturned car at them
skin peeled and blackened he starts crawling over the rocks dragging his paralyzed lower body after them
the snowplow drivers eyes go wide and he stands rooted in place unable to move
she grabs him by the arm pulls him away
girl contd wind chill yellow revisions
he comes to his senses staggers up the embankment after her
he loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling
as the cop seizes him around the legs and starts crawling up the length of his body
we hear the sizzle of instant frostbite the frost spreading with time lapse speed up the snowplow drivers limbs as he shrieks in agony
until even his shriek is frozen in his lungs
as she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the horror below
suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below
she whimpers fingers clutching at anything
finally she succeeds manages to haul herself up the steep embankment climbing with everything shes got left in her until she reaches the road
she hauls herself up from the gloomy abyss wrenches the driver side door open and scrambles inside she pulls the door closed twists the key in the ignition
urgently come on come on
she tries again
but the engine is dead
just then she notices the power light glowing on the c
she ducks under the dashboard retrieves the microphone sits up again the cop
wind chill yellow revisions
standing right outside the snowplow restored to his former glory grinning at her
then the smile curdles
he reaches through the shattered window
grabbing for her
she scrabbles just out of reach
pins herself against the opposite door
suddenly get away from her you bastard
and our guys ghost appears out of the gloom
he swings a crowbar into the cops skull
and just like before theres a violent flash of light and its like someone pressed reset
shes back inside the stranded oldsmobile seated beside the body of our guy
her panicked breathing turns into hyperventilation as she realizes all efforts to escape the road are futile
suddenly she spots something through the windshield that causes her breath to catch heading down the road toward the trees
throws open the door and scrambles out
the sky is showing the first signs of approaching dawn
she watches our guys ghost moving into the woods back toward the direction from which they came
wind chill yellow revisions
she stands there exhausted spent
suddenly a familiar song begins to chime on her cellphone ringtone rockin around the x mas tree
ding da da ding da ding da ding
her eyes widen in terror
she fumbles out the cellphone
stabs the off button with her thumb
she instinctively starts back to the stranded oldsmobile stops looks at the ghost
and in that moment decides for better or worse to follow him
she takes off down the road
we follow as she hurries to catch up with our guys ghost
crying breathless wait
shes close enough now to hear that hes mumbling something
i wouldve told you everything eventually
exhausted shes having trouble keeping up with him
then it wouldnt be stalkerish
out of breath i know
it would just be this sweet funny story wed have
wind chill yellow revisions
but its no use
she stops trying to keep up and pauses briefly devastated catching her breath
then she pushes on in the direction he went
its almost light out now and shes alone staggering along the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows
its like running in a dream never fast enough to outdistance an unseen pursuer
but then she hears it she cant believe shes made it back to civilization
the gas pumps are crowded with emergency vehicles and personnel
the morning calm is broken by the beep beep beep of trucks backing up the bleet of arriving ambulances the constant chatter of two way radios
our girl is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a blanket draped around her shoulders allowing emts to treat her frostbite
she watches attendants from the county morgue zip the bodies of our guy and the snowplow driver into bodybags
suddenly she remembers her cellphone and takes it out
its the digital picture of our guy when she first met him asleep behind the wheel of the olds in student parking
she closes her cellphone
the emt helps her into the passenger seat of the ambulance
as the ambulance drives off we crane up to see
wind chill yellow revisions
in the distance the haunted road snaking through the white forest
