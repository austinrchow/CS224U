mirrors are the gates through which death comes and goes
tell no one
orphee jean cocteau a subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in harlem
a man runs for his life in the deserted space
hes an african american male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform
he turns into an empty corridor climbs a set of stairs towards the exit but the gates are down and the station is closed
desperate and out of breath he is forced to trace his way back searching for an exit or a place to hide
he sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside
the place is deserted as well
one of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt the neon lights are flickering bringing the place in and out of the dark
the man checks each stall one at a time
his face lights up as he looks inside the last one he steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight
after a brief struggle he swings it open only to discover a wall of bricks
panic returns to his eyes
he slowly opens the stall door fearful of what could be waiting outside
a faint sound of shattering glass is heard
he quickly shuts the door holding his breath
his heart racing he exits the stall in the direction of the sound
the place is empty
the room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights
he moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror
his image is fragmented and deformed
it resembles a cubist portrait
i wasnt trying to get away
he talks to his own reflection in the mirror no please dont
he approaches and starts crying like a child
his head resting against the mirror he pleads for his life
then seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror his behaving shifts to another extreme
he starts cleaning it frantically with his hands
too frantically a piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground
immediately he bends down to pick it up but looking up the man realizes his reflection has become independent
a separate being
terrified he slowly stands staring at his stationary double
the pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade
his eyes turn cold with fear when void of any facial expression the mans reflection slices his jugular from end to end
in reality the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror turning the image to a dark deep red
all the reflections catch in the glass buildings of manhattan the traffic in the streets the old turn of the century facades the people walking on the sidewalk the pigeons
flying away the brooklyn bridge and the manhattan skyline reflecting off the surface of the hudson river
seen through the mirrored surfaces everything in the city seems to move in a distorted way
the softness of the suns rising light is contrasted with the eerie haunting music
the blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment
the sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the living room
seen in the reflection of the tv set a man is sleeping on the couch
he switches off the alarm and rises to go into the bathroom
like a thick fog the steam from the shower fills the bathroom
the shower turns off
a hand reaches out to wipe away the mist on the mirror above the sink revealing the face of ben carson years old
his eyes reflect the hardships of life
a life that from the lines on his face we suspect hasnt been easy
on his chest and shoulder several ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his day old stubble
ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened bedroom door
inside angela is asleep in the bed
she is younger than ben
angela awakens slowly what time is it
no youre going to be late
go back to sleep
ill call you ok
yeah i wont be working until later tonight
he comes to kiss her on the forehead
she opens a sleepy eye and smiles
she strokes his face gently
i like it
it makes you look younger
ben slips on his old military parka before leaving
see you later angie
ben walks down the hallway
the building is old and clearly not well maintained cracks and graffiti cover the walls
the downtown streets are clogged with the early morning rush hour traffic
on the honorary board of the nypd we can read the names of all the officers decorated for their courage
in the reflection of the copper plate we find ben sitting on the bench across from the office of
captain larry byrne who appears at the end of the corridor sorry im late
have you been waiting long
i just got here
they shake hands
you look awful
you know you should sleep at night
ben follows him into the office
larry takes a seat and briefly looks over the messages and files that have been dropped off on his desk so did you find an apartment yet
no not yet
you need a place to stay
no im staying at my sisters in queens
i didnt know you had a sister
what does she do
shes a bartender
thats not too good for you
anyway you know you are always welcome to stay at our house
larry looks up at ben slightly uneasy
i ran into amy the other day
how are things going between the two of you
ben remains silent
he obviously doesnt want to get into that subject
so why did you want to see me ben
you know what i want
im ready to come back im feeling much better now
listen ben i cant bring you back on the force
nobody in the squad wants you around right now
im sorry but i have to be honest with you
you understand right
larry im telling you im ready
if it was up to me i would bring you back tomorrow but im not the only one who decides
listen i think ive got something else for you
i know a guy at the mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores
come on larry a security guard job
im not ready to retire yet
im just trying to help here
i know youre over qualified for that position but its a good opportunity for you for the time being
until the situation here quiets down
also the money is not that bad
ben is having a hard time to contain his anger
you need the money ben
youre in the middle of a divorce and youve got child support to cover
if you want to see your kids youve got to get a job any job
deep inside ben knows larrys right
do you know the mayflower on west th street
the one that burned down
yes their night watchman hasnt shown up for work in several days
they need someone right away
take it relax and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months
yeah in a couple months
i gave everything for the nypd
i almost died out there
everyone seems to have forgotten that
we discover a whole different world in the sterile environment of the nyc chief medical examiners office forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand describe the corpses
we are a world away from the hollywood cliches of neatly laid out immaculate cadavers
here some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions expressing their ultimate agony before dying
from the homeless man fished out of the river to the woman killed by gun shots each corpse tells his own story
amidst the group of doctors year old amy deeply immersed in an autopsy is interrupted by her cell phone
amy checks the display for the incoming call ben
she hesitates for a moment and doesnt answer the call
amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder
dozens of pigeons fly away as the above ground subway passes by
you have reached amy carson
i am not available to take your call
please leave a message and i will get back to you as soon as i can
caught in the pouring rain ben has taken shelter under the scaffolding at a street corner
he plugs his ear with his finger to block the traffic and city commotion on amys voicemail amy its me
i just wanted to let you know that i got a job today
its nothing special just a security guard job
if you still want to go ahead with it we can sign the divorce papers
i mean if thats what you really want
he hesitates ive been thinking about michaels birthday tomorrow
it would be nice if we could celebrate it together
you know for the kids sake
ben hangs up the phone
he lingers under the scaffolding for a moment watching the falling rain
the glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above as they slowly break up giving way to the sun
on th street just off of broadway the mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down the damage from the fire
is still noticeable on the facade of the building the fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top
some of the windows are shattered while others are boarded up
what was once an impressive ornate building a fine example of s architecture standing on one of manhattans most dynamic streets now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation
what is left of it is a mere ruin a sort of neglected ghost ship abandoned in the heart of the city
the last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes
inside the department store everything has remained the same since the fire as if time stood still
the display cases the departments the mannequins and even the clothes are all burnt or blackened by the fire
a thick coat of soot covers the floor and rainwater drips down all over the place
its been five years and theyre still in a legal battle with the insurance companies
even cleaning up that mess is impossible
in his dark brown uniform the daytime security guard lorenzo sapelli s seems pleased to guide ben through what was once a temple of beauty and vanity
you know the meredith family acquired this building after st
johns hospital closed in
it was the very first mayflower to open on the east coast
on the cracked walls the huge mirrors that have survived the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past
the customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying in and out of the gaps in the roof
the company wants us to patrol the premises every couple of hours but i do my rounds every three hours and thats more than enough
anyway youll see theres not much going on
its pretty calm around here
ben follows lorenzo through the burnt display counters
he listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere
this place makes him uncomfortable
its not only the lingering smell of a fire but also a sense of death that hangs over it
the whistling of the wind through the stores old ventilation system sounds like faraway voices
ben and lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the nd floor
here you go
mens department or whats left of it anyway
ben observes the surroundings yet another spectacle of devastation
thank god you didnt show up any later
this place gives me the chills at night
no electricity and all these mirrors
you know i live in brooklyn near a jewish neighborhood and when someone dies they cover all the mirrors in their house
some say that its just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period but others say something else
they say its to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors
believe it or not theres always a bit of truth in any superstition
am i right
amused and skeptical at the same time ben contemplates the mirrors that surround him i guess you just have to keep your eyes away from them
unlike the rest of the scenery the mirrors are perfectly clean did you clean them
the mirrors why are they so clean
lorenzo smiles thats gary lewis the fellow who worked here before you
he was completely obsessed with these damn mirrors
hed spend the entire night polishing them
why did he leave
just didnt show up one night
i take it hes found a better opportunity somewhere else
im not one to complain but i never really liked him much
could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask how are you doing
i mean damn do we work together as a team or what
you on the other hand seem like a nice guy
how long has it been since you left the nypd
almost a year
why did you resign from the force
you were a detective is that correct
i was wounded during a holdup
it kind of changed my perspective on things
ben and lorenzo reach the next floor
you gotta be careful here
when the wind blows sometimes the tiles fly off the roof and theyll just snap your ear off if you follow what im saying
lorenzo checks the time on his watch
well ill let you get acquainted with the rest of the store on your own
they turn around
follow me ill show you our headquarters and ill get you one of these uniforms
its almost night
ben and lorenzo have finished their visit and exit the department store
we were a pretty big team working here before the fire
when you stop to think that of all the department stores in new york this one was the most beautiful the most luxurious
it breaks your heart it really does
outside the building behind the fence blocking its entry a construction trailer has been outfitted for the guards
here you go
this is where youll be spending most of your time
at least youve got electricity in here
its nice and warm and theres even a tv
cartoons flicker on an old television set
all bundled up in a coat and wearing a woolen hat a young boy is watching tv
lorenzo and ben enter the mobile home lorenzo junior my grandson
say hello lorenzo
lorenzo and i are going to the movies tonight
lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the back of the mobile home leaving ben alone with the child
the boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on tv
how old are you lorenzo
shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares ben in the face do you work in the department store
i do now
grandpa says there are ghosts in the store
is that true
i think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little
lorenzo senior has changed clothes and returns with a uniform which he hands over to ben here this should fit you
lorenzo put your coat on
we are already late
to ben on the sly theres a drop of jack daniels in the cupboard
to keep yourself warm
lorenzo hands over the keys well ben the place is all yours
hes about to leave when oh
i forgot the most important thing
youll be needing one of these at night
weve got two of them
they run on batteries
dont forget to charge them
see you in the morning ben
see you tomorrow
lorenzo and lorenzo jr
exit the trailer
through the window ben sees them walk out to the street
ben inspects the trailer scattered with knickknacks the decoration of the place corresponds well with lorenzos personality warmhearted and humble
the clock on the wall shows p
a long night lies ahead
ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on
the beam of light is dazzling the flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall
wearing the security guards uniform marked with an embroidered m ben makes his first round of the store
the pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him
ben proceeds slowly up the stairs
in the mens department bens flashlight is a mere luminous spot twirling in the night
the ever present mirrors magnify the space to infinity
ben walks through the different sections of the ladies department
he examines the remains of the charred garments sagging on the hangers
the silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of the night
wide exterior shot by night the department stores ornate facade takes on an entirely different appearance more menacing almost evil
ben continues his rounds
we follow his path through reflections in the mirrors then for the first time we discover another perspective another pov from within the mirrors
it feels ominous slightly detached
the sound is muted
ben crosses back the third floor the second floor
in the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance hall we see ben come down the stairs
he stops for a moment facing his reflection in the mirror
he fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes not quite an nypd uniform
suddenly his eyes freeze
intrigued he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward he touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off unsuccessfully
he picks up a rag from the ground spits on the mirror and rubs the mark fervently
the print remains
this confirms his hunch by angling the flashlight another handprint is revealed
and yet another as he looks back up in the mirror he sees the access door to ben turns around
his gaze freezes the access door to the ben swings his head back and forth between the shut door in reality and the opened door in the mirror
what is happening
is he dreaming or hallucinating
ben walks backwards towards the basement door keeping his eyes fixed on the mirror
as he goes to reach for the handle he sees his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door
ben opens it in the mirror has been restored
ben tries to reenact the phenomenon
he opens and closes the door over and over while observing his reflection but the mirror is no longer deceitful
the staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark
ben walks down the stairs step by step lighting his way with a flashlight
the beam of light dims the battery is almost dead
he gives it a few taps to make the light reappear
last step fuck
a few inches of water cover the basement floor
one of the water pipes must have burst due to the cold
the light flickers back for a moment revealing before him the narrow subterranean corridors of the department store
along a wall ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the switches
further down in the corridor a couple of fluorescent lights flicker to life two tiny sources deep inside the darkness
its been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines the trees and houses
on the front lawn of their house year old michael and year old daisy are building a snowman
why did they say on tv that it wasnt supposed to snow today but tomorrow instead
why did they lie
sometimes they make mistakes michael
grown ups dont make mistakes
only little children do
slightly annoyed the little boy places the eyes on the snowman
daisys face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight of her fathers car approaching daddy
michael turns around and sees ben exiting his oldsmobile with a big wrapped package in his arms
the children abandon their snowman and rush towards their father
ben takes michael into his arms pointing to the wrapped present what is that
well i dont know i just found this package hidden behind a tree
is it for me
to his daughter daisy has michael been a good boy
does he deserve his birthday present
yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece
yes its true
no its not true
shes lying daddy
ive been a very good boy i promise
they enter the house
is mom back
rosa came to pick us up from school today
in the kitchen rosa the nanny is rinsing the dishes from the afternoon snack hello rosa
hello senor carson
how are you
im good very good
what time will amy be back
not before six sir
ok ill wait for her
do you want me to fix you a snack
no thank you
ill be fine
ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room
he hands over the present to his son
daisy is sitting in the armchair holding her cat tiger in her arms
happy birthday michael
what is it
duh open it stupid
michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote control car
the little boy is on cloud nine
through the front window we see a volvo station wagon park in front of the house
amy gets out of the car loaded with shopping bags
she enters the house and hands the groceries over to rosa
where are the kids
in a low voice with senor ben
the expression on amys face shifts
noticeably irritated she goes up to the second floor
michaels remote control car drives at full speed down the hallway
ben shows his children how to operate the remote control while the bathtub fills up
he seems as excited as the kids by the new toy
ben turns around to find amy watching them
look mommy look what daddy got me
its great you will have to show me how it works
its so fast mommy
ben can i talk to you in private
ben puts down the remote control to his kids ok kids its time for your bath
no fooling around
ben follows amy into the bedroom
she closes the door behind them
amy is not equally pleased to see him shes beside herself with anger what is this
i already asked you not to drop by without calling didnt i
i do but you never take my calls
i dont need your calls in the middle of the night
im better off without them
i havent had a drink in three months but then again how would you know
i dont want to know ben
i dont want to hear about it
its not my problem
youre not my problem
youve done more than enough harm already
you dont think people can change
we are not talking about people were talking about you
how many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened
it only got worse
ben moves closer to his ex wife just give me another chance
she smiles how many other chances did she already give him
behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys we sense amy is torn
she still loves him as well
i need more time ben
listen i will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some rules
out of nowhere ben hits the wall with his bare fist in the bathtub daisy and michael cannot avoid overhearing their parents arguing
in denial michael blocks his ears with his hands and lies back under the water
amy seems distrustful of ben scared of how close he is to the edge
we can see the anger in his eyes
look at yourself
youre still carrying around so much of that anger
he catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror and of the desperate violence in his eyes
ben steps back
trying to calm down im sorry i didnt mean to yell at you
things could be so different between us
yes i know but its up to you ben
anyway i wasnt planning on staying
my shift starts in an hour
ill just kiss them goodbye and then im leaving
ben exits the room
amy is left alone through the window she watches ben exit the house and get into his car
when she turns away she discovers michael and daisy standing outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels
she smiles and quickly comes to dry them
is daddy coming back to live with us
she smiles gently
i dont know sweetheart
i dont know
the beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of water flooding the basement corridor
since yesterday the water level has continued to rise
the outline of ben and lorenzos silhouettes appear in the staircase leading to the ground floor i havent managed to find the source of the leak
my guess is it doesnt come from the store
it must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold
ill call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it
on the gas stove a kettle is whistling
ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers
he finds some instant coffee next to the bottle of jack daniels
he briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky
he grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant coffee
in the reflection of the clock we see ben watching tv
it is past midnight
ben gets up and grabs his flashlight its time for his rounds
through the shattered panes of the central dome we see ben walking through the store
since the mysterious occurrences of the night before his attitude has changed
he avoids as much as possible looking into the mirrors
he is on guard fearing another supernatural manifestation
the shadows the mannequins and the shapes in the mirrors are all disturbing and unsettling
even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble columns seems alive in the dark
as he crosses the entrance hall a glint of light catches his attention
despite himself he stops and gazes into the mirror how is this possible
ben turns around to see the same spot in the real world only its in ruins
ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror the vision of the past prevails
unable to ignore it ben decides to check it out for himself
ben wanders off towards the far end of the store a landscape of dust and desolation
his reflection in the mirror on the other we follow him in the mirror ben has left the night behind and enters the daytime department
everything is in perfect order and unspoiled
ben continues his journey into the past
the customers jostle one another while shopping during a big sale
children run wild in the aisles
women fight over articles of clothing
ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices around his shoes a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor he bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid
gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor of the department store
ben turns around and sees under the shelving a hand lighting a the lighter falls to the floor in slow motion
the liquid bursts into flame instantly
the cheerful vision of a frightened ben steps back the flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has rushed to escape death in the midst of the flames
through the heat waves ben spots the face of the firestarter is it his own
ben has no time to react
in a split second his uniform catches fire
panicked he attempts to put out the fire with his hands he comes back to reality ben catches his breath trying to come to his senses
whats happening to him
what he just experienced certainly felt real
during his panic the flashlight rolled under one of the counters
ben bends down to pick it up
the beam illuminates the ground and throws light on an object a bit further away a leather
he stretches out his hand to pick it up
the leather is worn out but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed there recently
ben examines the object with the experienced touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence
between the collection of cards and scraps of paper ben finds a drivers license belonging to gary lewis years old a sturdily built african american man
we recognize the man running in the subway at the beginning
the name rings a bell for him ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet he stops when he finds another uniform
a name is embroidered on the shoulder the wallet rests on the table and piques bens curiosity
he cannot hold back his police instincts
he finally empties out the contents on the table a blockbuster card restaurant receipts a drivers license phillips business card from mayflower cash and a sheet of paper folded in
four ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees written in ink ben chews over these seven letters
is it somebodys name
he folds it up again and puts everything back neatly in the wallet that he stows away in one of the drawers
a busy street under the subway overpass
we see a neighborhood bar on the corner at this time of day the place is deserted
a plasma screen shows a baseball game
a drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table
sitting at the bar ben is nervous tense
he removes the steeped tea bag from his cup
ben stares at himself in the mirror behind the bottle display shelves
it is not his mirror image that he is observing
his gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection to dive beyond into the very depths of his soul
angela interrupts across from him behind the bar
she works here
intrigued what are you looking at
playfully come on youve been looking at yourself for more than half an hour
you never used to be so vain
you cant avoid them
what are you talking about
in the department store at every street corner in the windows of every fucking building in this city
i feel like im not the one looking into the mirrors but rather theyre looking at me
angela smiles not sure if he is serious you need a drink
no im serious
dont you think youre being a little bit paranoid
ben observes the palm of his hand
mirrors are just glass and silver ben
angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking glasses
in the darkness a rat glides peacefully on the water surface
in the basement the water level continues to rise
with a flashlight in hand and his feet submerged in the water ben moves deeper into the tunnel
he is searching for the source of the leak
the beam of light sweeps across the walls and the piping
ben crosses an intersection
in the corner on the tiled wall he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of dust and dirt
he sinks his hand into the water and wipes it off revealing an arrow pointing to st johns department of he continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways
suddenly he notices a darker area on the wall
he comes closer and discovers a brownish damp spot covered with mold
the humidity has pearled into droplets
he has found the source of the leak
his hand brushes the wall causing it to crumble instantly
ben digs into the plaster as if it were butter bringing a cracked water pipe to light
the leakage has damaged the wall in which the tubing was embedded
ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water as if there were another room on the other side of the wall
he pushes against the saturated wall and pierces through it with his arm
he removes his arm
for a moment he observes the gaping black hole that he has just left behind
ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight but he cannot make out what is on the other side
he makes the hole bigger until the passage is large enough for him to crawl through one of the mirrors is opened ajar its a door
his image is reflected in all directions and from infinite angles
ben moves towards the center of the room its a well built man
he too is wearing the blue security guards uniform
from where he stands ben can only see the back of the mans head
as he moves in closer he can make out the name embroidered on the mans shoulder gary
the silhouette remains still
ben comes a bit closer
his gaze freezes when he realizes that gary is not standing in front of the mirror with his face pressed against it but ben steps back terrified
he doesnt know how to interpret this new phenomenon
ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror knock knock knock
he hits the mirror with his fist as if it were merely a glass window behind which gary lewis was standing on the other side no reaction
ben strikes the mirror harder
knock knock knock
the former night watchman turns around slowly towards ben revealing his face little by little
knock knock knock
in his bed ben wakes up with a jolt the encounter with gary knock knock knock
somebody is knocking at his door
ben gets up from the couch coming
ben opens the door to a ups deliveryman holding out a package mr
ben nods would you mind signing here please
ben signs for it and takes the package
you have a nice day sir
ben shuts the door and examines the ups box
hes not used to getting many deliveries
he flips it over to see who it is from ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel
he tears away the cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room table more or less recent all the articles relate to the department store and the fire
that burned it down
gary has meticulously cut them out and sent them to ben
bens car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance to mayflower
he runs into lorenzo who exits the trailer ready to go home from work ive just been through the craziest day here
your ex colleagues came to pay us a visit
you know gary the guy who was working here before you the cops found him dead in a subway station in harlem
i never liked him too much but poor guy he didnt deserve to go like that
did they mention the cause of death
they wouldnt tell me
lorenzo hands him over the keys
i better get going mrs
sapelli is waiting for me at home
have a good night at work ben
oh and by the way about that leak theyre sending someone over to work at it the beginning of next week
have a good night lorenzo
ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment his gaze fixed at the department store the beam from the flashlight appears in the distance determined ben
crosses the entrance hall in the direction of the basement door
he goes down ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight and follows the subterranean passageway
suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of deja vu he is in the darkness the rat glides peacefully on the water surface
he crosses an intersection and once again he recognizes the half visible psychiatric department sign on the tiled wall
the beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the piping bringing to light in the distance to himself damn
what is happening to me
the moisture has pearled into droplets
slowly his hand comes closer
the wall crumbles at the slightest touch
pushed by curiosity ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster just as he had done in his nightmare
he hears the echoing sound of streaming water coming from the other side of the wall
it confirms the existence of a hidden room
ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall creating a large enough opening to access the other side he inspects the interior with his flashlight revealing he enters
his image is reflected in all directions and multiplied into infinity
his dream was foreboding
everything is perfectly identical to the nightmare with the exception of gary lewis the former watchman is not there but
sensing something wrong ben turns around
in the silence he faces his infinite reflections all of them identical or almost
taking a closer look ben notices one of the duplicates faces bearing an expression slightly different from the others
knowing that it has been noticed by ben the rebel duplicate turns his face towards ben eyeing him with an evil gaze we can hardly recognize bens image
the duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other reflections and slowly walks towards ben
instinctively ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the vision disappear
when he opens up his eyes again ben steps back terrified
under the dazzling neon light of the nypd coroners premises amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to the police inspectors in charge of the investigation
she is interrupted by somebody who enters the room there is someone for her at the reception who insists on seeing her urgently
amy excuses herself removes her examination gloves and exits the autopsy room
we follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police uniforms and doctors in white coats in the endless comings and goings between the police station and the
the atmosphere here is highly charged reflecting the excessive activity of this particular department
there is no doubt we are in new york city
amy comes to the reception desk
ben who clearly hasnt slept since the night before is pacing back and forth
are you ok
what are you doing here
amy i need you to do me a favor
listen i am in the middle of work i dont really have time now
i need your help
it wont take more than twenty minutes
from his pocket ben takes out garys drivers license
he shows it to her you picked up this guy yesterday morning
i need to take a look at him
its very important
why do you want to see him
he used to work at the mayflower as a night watchman before i replaced him
where did you get his drivers license
i found his wallet in the department store
i need to find out how he died
you are no longer a cop ben
this isnt your business anymore
he sent me a package before he died with newspaper articles about the mayflower
i think he was trying to tell me something
i dont know him
ive never even met him amy
i need to figure this out
the refrigerated compartment bays containing the corpses are aligned along the basement walls
a young doctor escorts ben and amy down the corridors of the morgue
as he is walking the doctor flips through the register in search of a name
oh there he is b
he slashed his throat
to ben there you go
theres your answer
your man committed suicide
you know a lot of people who cut their own throats
interrupting well all i know is that the cops are still investigating this one
thats why we still have the body
people can be very creative when it comes to suicide
im sure its not the craziest thing youve seen
the young doctor stops in front of the number b
he opens the door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray carrying the corpse wrapped in a white sheet gary lewis
he lifts the sheet revealing gary lewis upper body garys eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open
his skin has become translucent almost purple
his contorted corpse is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering
his flesh has started to decompose and putrefy
ben stares at the body in search of a hint a clue any useful information
amy becomes impatient
ive got to get back to work ben
theyre waiting for me upstairs
what did he slit his throat with
the doctor checks the report
with a piece of mirror
ben looks up
he must have smashed it into pieces to have something to slash it with
the doctor has a smirk on his face seven years of bad luck
suddenly reflected in the stainless steel door of the compartment bay ben sees ben jumps out of his skin and backs away terrified
neither amy nor the doctor saw anything of course
they gaze at him with a puzzled look are you ok ben
whats going on
ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again gary is frozen in the same contorted position as if nothing ever happened
coming to his senses i need to see his files
ben raises his voice
come on ben what is it youre after
i am not supposed to show you any file
youre not even allowed to be here
i could get fired for this
the doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more personal turn
well ill be off
amy you know where to find me if you need me
amy is left alone with ben
what is happening to you
what is all this supposed to mean
what is going on ben
i wont leave until i see that file
on the shelves photographs of michael and daisy stand next to the medical records and legal medicine textbooks
sitting behind amys desk ben is studying gary lewis file
he flips back and forth through the different documents photographs and police reports
amy observes him perplexed
we sense that she is concerned about bens strange behavior and over sensitivity
look at this picture
come and see amy
he shows her a snapshot taken by the police
we see gary soaked in his own blood the throat slit open
the picture is real crude
he lies outstretched facing a mirror shattered into several pointy pieces like a spider web
in his hand gary still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself
ben points to the reflection in the mirror look at the piece of mirror in his hand
in the reflection of the mirror its covered in blood and look in reality its clean
not a drop of blood
dont you find it strange that this mirror doesnt reflect an exact image of reality
i cant see the difference
it must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken
what is it you are you trying to prove
what if the mirrors were showing us something different
for christs sake listen to yourself ben
what are you talking about
what if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality
this is way over my head
i dont have time for your barfly theories
ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her
thanks for your help
hes on his way out when she holds him back you should go home and get some rest
this guy probably just killed himself because he couldnt live with himself anymore
it happens to thousands of people you know
the steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet
ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower
he watches his blurry reflection
with his finger on the surface of the fogged mirror he writes he contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment trying to interpret their meaning
in the end he wipes off the mirror with his hand erasing the word
angela is standing behind him in the door opening im off
amy called me today shes worried about you
whats happening ben
please not you
im your sister you can talk to me
is it your new job
that place the mayflower has bad vibes
its getting under your skin
just think about what i told you
i made a deal angie
i cant just walk out on them like that
i need this job i need the money
im not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life
you wont have any trouble finding another one
a daytime job a regular job
while shes talking we see the scene from another point of view from inside the mirror as if someone else was listening to angela leaves the bathroom
ben brushes his teeth
he leans over to rinse his mouth and when he straightens up ben steps back and loses his balance knocking down a shelf
angela rushes into the bathroom what happened ben
are you all right
he refuses her help
ben gets to his feet and looks into the mirror
his reflection is back
everything looks normal but
the sun sets behind the harlem skyline
bens oldsmobile pulls over in the street he has decided to pass by gary lewis old house before his nightshift
he presses the doorbell next to gary lewis name
an old lady answers mrs
sorry to bother you
my name is ben carson
i worked with gary at mayflower
could i come up and talk to you for a few minutes
th floor apartment b
the entrance door of the building opens
lewis is at least years old and almost blind behind her thick glasses
she lives alone in the small apartment that she used to share with her grandson
we sense that she is distraught by garys death
my gary hadnt slept at home for three weeks
at first i figured he had found himself a girlfriend so i didnt worry much about it
the policeman told me that he was living in the streets
they found his body in the subway
he had everything he needed here
every morning i would have his breakfast ready when hed come home from work
did he use any drugs
he was a good boy
did you notice anything different the days prior to his leaving the house anything unusual in his behavior
oh yes but that goes way back to when he started working at mayflower
what kind of changes
he didnt care much for anything anymore
before wed sit up and watch television together
but once he started that job as a night watchman hed spend all his time off locked up in his room
he hardly slept anymore
he was way too busy
busy doing what
that i dont know
i never knew what he was up to
she reaches for a picture frame on the chest
look in this picture he was twelve years old
is that you standing next to him
yes back in the days
lewis i found a note that gary wrote
a piece of paper where hed scribbled down the name esseker
does that mean anything to you
esseker is that what youre saying
the old lady dwells on it for a moment no that dont mean a thing to me
she sets down the picture frame
may i see his room
yes of course
come follow me its down the hallway the door at the very end
ben follows mrs
lewis to her grandsons room it looks nothing like the room of a fifty year old man but rather like that of an old teenager
from what we can see gary grew up in here and each object recalls a stage in his life
everything is clean and in its proper place it is perfectly tidy
do you mind if i stay in here for a moment
lewis smiles at him
she too likes to gather her thoughts in garys room
ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue a hint that might help him on the esseker lead
he opens the drawers and looks through the papers nothing is of any help to him
the only place left that he hasnt searched is the walk in closet whose half open doors seem to invite him to enter
what ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have imagined the closet has been emptied out completely and ceiling
its a miniature replica of the hidden room that ben discovered back in the basement of the department store
he would spend hours looking at himself
lewis steps up behind him
to look at oneself too much is a sin
a terrible sin
do you know sir in the garden of eden in order to seduce eve satan did not keep the appearance of a snake
satan reproduced the young womans traits in such a way that eve would only see and listen to the image of herself
as in a mirror
night has fallen
the department store is calm and silent
we move down each floor to the entrance hall
the basement door is open and in the darkness we see the gleam of the flashlight
ben must be down there
all of a sudden a loud shriek tears through the silence
there is a woman somewhere in the store
ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed
the shrieks resound through the department store again
they seem to come from one of the floors above
without hesitation ben dashes up the stairs he arrives on the second floor and searches through all the departments
impossible to tell where the cries originate from
he climbs up to the third floor
the beam of the flashlight sweeps past each nook and dark corner somewhere in the store the woman continues to scream and wail to death
shouting no answer
ben goes up to the fourth floor
the shrieks are heard again but this time coming from one of the floors below
ben dashes for the ladies department the screams come closer
ben passes the counters and enters the dressing rooms or rather what is left of them since the fire
the woman must be in here hiding somewhere
im here maam
short of breath ben inspects the dressing rooms with his flashlight
the woman seems to have vanished
im right he
another shriek is emitted right next to him
he turns around no one there
about to leave the dressing rooms ben catches sight of a mirror
in the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms ben runs to it but finds it empty
in the reflection of the ben stops to think if he can somehow move the mirror to have it face the last booth he might be able to see what
truly happened inside
ben unhooks the mirror
it is way too heavy and bulky to carry
he lets it slide down the wall
inch by inch ben hauls the mirror across the floor
he reaches the last dressing room through the reflection in the mirror he examines the interior of the cubicle
in the dark he catches sight of bare feet stamping against the tiled floor
the torn half burnt curtains conceal the rest of the body
with his eyes fixed on the mirror ben walks backward towards the dressing room
he is scared of what he is about to discover
he gives the curtain a quick yank revealing
we are in the darkness of daisy and michaels bedroom
michael is terrified and cries out for his mother mom
amy swings the door open and turns on the light
what is it michael
the little boy throws himself into his mothers arms
daisy wakes up
what is it
did you have a bad dream
theres a lady screaming
michael points to the mirror wall facing the bunk beds
in the mirror
look theres nothing there
i saw her mom
i swear i did
it was just a nightmare
its late you have to go back to sleep
ill turn on the night light if you want
amy tucks him into bed and kisses him
before leaving the room she plugs in the night light
mom can you leave the door open
ok you two go to sleep now
amy leaves the room
in his bed michael cannot stop himself from staring at the dimly lit mirror
amy goes back to her room
the local news play on the tv
she gets into bed and turns off the light
she reaches for the remote and clicks the tv off turning over the entity watches amy while she is sleeping
once again the pov from behind the mirror
ominous slightly ben secures the padlock of the department store entrance
he walks towards the trailer while keeping a fixed eye on the facade of the building
the scene he just witnessed in the dressing rooms has shaken him up
he goes inside
through one of the windows we see him pick up the phone and dial a number angela is in the bathroom when the phone starts ringing
she turns on the tap of the cast iron bathtub and goes to answer
sorry im calling you this late
were you sleeping
no no i just got home from work
you sound strange
on the phone ben struggles to put his feelings into words dont worry everythings ok
are you sure
i think maybe im losing my mind
you were right about the mayflower
ill quit tomorrow
thats the smart thing to do ben
you deserve better than that
you should come back here and get some sleep
no ill wait till the daytime guy gets here to tell him
are you sure
see you later angie
love you too sis
she hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment concerned
the sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality
we follow her into the bathroom
she dips her fingers into the water to check the temperature
the bathtub is almost full
angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror
when she turns around to climb into the hot bath her reflection unaware angela soaks into her hot bath
the water continues to pour from the tap
angela shuts her eyes its been a long day
without a word angelas reflection brings its hands to its face and digs its fingers into its mouth
in a sudden jerk it pulls open its jaw the mirror cracks by itself
the bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white tiled bathroom floor
the camera flashes illuminate the crime scene
angelas body lies afloat in the bathtub
the apartment is entirely flooded
two men in police uniforms close off a security zone to keep the intrusive neighbors away
a detective is interrogating an old puerto rican couple the downstairs neighbors
they were the ones who alerted the police after having noticed the water leakage
the old woman explains how it was raining blood into her living room
amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad we find larry
he is in charge of the case
leaning over the bathtub larry examines the visible parts of the corpse
angelas face is concealed by her own long black hair floating in the murky water
larry slips on an examination glove pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood red bath
he feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub
the water level begins to recede gradually revealing angelas naked corpse
with the tip of his fingers larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering angelas face
taken by surprise he steps back from the horrifying sight of this jaw less face
larry removes his glove wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention he comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet
a tiny drop of blood is dripping from one of the cracks
a dark silhouette passes behind him in the reflection
he turns immediately the bloodied bathroom is still and silent
angelas destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub
a police inspector in the next room calls out to him larry
take a look at this
what is it
come take a look for yourself
larry exits the bathroom
the police inspector in the living room holds a picture frame in his hands
he turns towards larry look
isnt ben carson in the picture
still wearing his uniform ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station
his haggard face expresses great grief
his sisters death has left him distraught
he fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands
the classic two way mirror facing him throws back his reflection
ben knows that he is being watched
behind the two way mirror amy observes him
larry is standing next to her
the water has obliterated most of the marks
no trace of struggle or broken entry the entrance door was locked
the person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment or otherwise it was somebody she knew
he would never have laid a finger on her
when their father died ben took care of his sister
angela meant the world to him
listen so far his statement is pretty consistent with the facts
we checked it out he did place a call from work at and the womans downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning
the daytime security guard lorenzo sappeli confirms he came on after bens shift at seven a
the only strange thing and it may just be a coincidence is that ben told sappeli that he had decided to quit his job as if he was planning to
go away somewhere
did he mention anything about it to you
no lately communication hasnt quite been our strong point
she smiles i only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sisters
what are you going to do with him
i figure well let him go
at this point we havent got any real reason to keep him here
and i think hes had his share for the day
you know whats gonna happen if you let him go
he wont stop here
i know him he wont stop until he finds who did this to her
listen where we stand now we got nothing not a single clue
im sure he can help us
what kind of friend are you
you are using him
hes not a cop anymore
hes still the best one i know even if hes one of the suspects
amy comes closer to the two way mirror
she looks at her ex husband on the other side
he seems overcome with grief and confusion
she can see the distress in his eyes
try to keep an eye on him
ben has been released
under the pouring rain on the front steps of the police station amy tries to reason with him you have to see someone ben
you cannot stay in this situation any longer
you need help psychological support
ben is not listening
his mind is elsewhere
why dont you
if you want
come spend a few days at home with the kids
no i dont want to put them in any danger
what do you mean
ive got things i need to deal with
ben look at me
i dont want you to get into any trouble
think about daisy and michael
you are not going to solve this case
please stay out of it
she asked me to quit and they got to her
who are you talking about
i know who did this amy
in that case you have to tell them everything
they wouldnt believe me and neither would you
ben walks away leaving amy alone on the steps of the police station ben wait
ben does not turn around
the rain is beating down harder and the thunder grumbles in the distance
the first lightning flashes light up the sky
another flash ben ignores the crime scenes restriction perimeter and enters angelas apartment
without turning on the light he goes straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes
magnum his former cop weapon
another flash the lightning bolts illuminate the facade of the department store
bens car is parked in front of the construction fence
the rainwater pours through the openings in the roof penetrating the interior of the deserted department store
it dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half burnt mannequins
we hear the echo of the roaring thunder outside but in the gloom of the flooded basement there is another blaring sound
a dull metallic thud
it gets louder and louder closer and closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room inside we find ben out of his mind throwing a chair against
the mirrors with all his strength in an attempt to demolish them hes exhausted and hes forced to stop
not a single shard of glass not even a scratch the mirrors seem completely indestructible
ben is not through with them
he drops the chair to the ground and pulls out the gun from his belt
without a moments hesitation he opens fire of the bullets
in the spiderweb cracked mirror his image is deformed
having found a weak spot ben savors his sweet victory when suddenly something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes bens shock and disbelief give way to rage
he fires in a fury emptying the entire clip this time again the bullet holes vanish leaving ben alone face to face with his own reflection
he breaks down nervously why did you do it
why did you silence
what is it you want
what do you want from me
what is it you suddenly one after the other letters start appearing in one of the mirrors as if an invisible finger were tracing them in the dust ben turns
around and in the reflection of the opposite mirror he recognizes the inverted word the same word he found on the note in garys wallet the word ben himself had traced in his bathroom mirror
back in the queens apartment ben still hasnt gotten any sleep
on the wall he is assembling all the newspaper clippings articles and photographs that gary sent him
each and every mirror in angelas apartment has been covered with sheets blankets old rags anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces
with the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation look up esseker
yes echo sierra sierra echo kilo echo romeo
no idea my guess is that its a name
no i havent got a first name
yes in new york
over the past five or six years
i know its hazy but thats all ive got
i already looked it up in the phone book
i also called someone at the irs and at the dmv but nothing there
its very important larry
youll call me back
ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment
now he can have a clear overview of garys investigative research
all the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged mayflower five years ago
but not a hint of esseker
ben studies the newspaper clippings trying to piece the story together deadly fire at mayflower dead and wounded brutal massacre mother and her three daughters slaughtered
the children drowned in the bathtub
the throat slit open
mayflowers security guard taken in for questioning
the night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family
terrence berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty the security guard at mayflower finally confesses
he started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors responsible according to him for the death of his wife and three daughters
ben observes terrence berrys face in one of the archive photographs
he looks like a perfectly normal guy rather kind surely he was a good father
ben cant help but empathize with him
as he looks up ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window what if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family
or what if the mirrors would do it
the phone rings yes so whatd you find out
nothing under that name
shit shit shit shit
can you look up berry terrence berry
ben holds on the line for a moment
no i already know all that
is he still alive
can you find out where he was committed before his death
wait im writing it down
ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a piece of paper
roosevelt psychiatric detention center
yeah i know where it is
he hangs up the phone
under the blanket next to him he spots the t shirt that his sister was wearing the other night
the pain is too strong
he cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying
the next morning heavy eyed and sleepy michael is hypnotized in front of the weather forecast on tv
the hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold
his sister daisy pours herself some more orange juice
amy shaking a box of cereal interrupts the little boy in his dream state do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl
the little boy does not answer
in the chocolate
in the chocolate please mom
repeating after her please mom
she pours the cereal in his hot chocolate
yuck thats gross how can you eat that
come on come on lets get going or youre going to be late for school
michael begins to eat his breakfast his gaze still fixed on the weathermans forecast on tv
as amy fills the cats bowl with pellets tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family
what is it sweetheart
do you know that michael has a new friend
no thats not true
really whats his name
to his sister you promised not to tell
does he go to your school
michael doesnt answer
daisy shakes her head
pretending to be indifferent very well
if you dont want to tell me about it
the little boy stays quiet
he doesnt want me to talk about him
amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to michael why doesnt he want you to talk about him
is he a grown up
so hes a little boy your age then
michael gives a reluctant nod
amy is reassured
he finishes his mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink
amy gives daisy a questioning look to michael does he live in our street
is it one of our neighbors
michael remains silent and daisy answers for him he lives in the mirror in our room
daisy bursts out laughing
michael glares back at her furious
puzzled amy reflects briefly on daisys remark
is it your father who told you that
michael remains silent
michael answer me
did your father talk to you about the mirrors
amy questions him with her eyes
michael lowers his
come on come on guys lets get our teeth brushed and our coats on
the first one in the car is the winner
the two kids dash up the stairs
amy is left alone to clean up breakfast
she casts a glance at the front hall mirror
daisys comment lingers in her thoughts
dressed in their coats michael and daisy come running down the stairs and rush out of the house
amy exits the house
the car drives away
daisys cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to the mirror wide shot the high security psychiatric hospital stands under a leaden sky you know mr
carson when one starts to perceive ones own reflection as a completely separate being one is suddenly confronted with two entirely separate egos two entirely separate worlds that can surface
at any given moment
morris the doctor who had once been in charge of terrence berry escorts ben down the corridor a feeling of self hatred generally triggered by a psychological shock can split
the personality in two hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories or behavior patterns within the same individual
the patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds which are principally the real word and the world inside the mirror
the two men pass a number of guards and security check points as they head down towards the hospitals film and video archive did you consider terrence innocent
morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic device unlocking the door to the archives
in my opinion he was convinced that he was telling the truth when he claimed he didnt kill his family
i too am convinced that when it happened terrence was not himself but rather his double his mirror image one might say
he enters the archives followed by ben dr
morris finger glides across several dv tapes dated in search of one particular tape these recordings are from terrences trial
you will find that they speak for themselves
he pushes the tape into the deck
a grainy picture appears on the screen we discover terrence berry sitting behind a desk
his hands are cuffed
facing him dr
morris is leading the cross examination
terrence is tense and uncomfortable
he keeps his face down never looking into the camera
why did you set the department store on fire
in order to
to destroy the mirrors
only fire can destroy a mirror isnt that right doctor
what made you think you absolutely had to destroy those mirrors terrence
terrence remains silent
morris repeats his question what made you want to destroy those mirrors terrence
they killed helen and my three little girls
for what reason
why would mirrors want to kill your family
because i didnt
terrence breaks out in tears
didnt do what
with his eyes fixed on the video monitor deep inside ben already knows the answer that terrence is about to give
they asked me to find esseker
like they did with the others
who are the others youre talking about
i wasnt the first one they asked
and what happened
i didnt succeed
i didnt succeed in finding esseker
ben realizes that hes in the exact same situation amy
morris i have to go
he stands to leave
the monitor keeps playing the old footage tell me about esseker terrence
terrence doesnt speak
who is esseker terrence
suddenly terrences behavior shifts to another extreme
he stands up and flying into a rage he becomes brutal and hysterical terrence becomes uncontrollable
he wrecks the folders lying on the desk and throws himself head first against a wall mirror that shatters to pieces
bens car comes to a screeching halt in front of his old house
ben rushes inside
he is beside himself
after seeing the video footage on terrence he has been struck with fear and panic for his family before the perplexed gaze of rosa and his children ben agitatedly comes
and goes in the hallway of the second floor
he is removing the mirrors from each and every room
he tears away the bathroom mirror unhooks the one in the far end of the hallway and removes some from amys room
rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under her protective arms
amy is not back yet
the only mirror left that ben cannot remove is the one in the childrens room
he rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of old paint
he immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in order to neutralize its reflection
what are you doing dad
dont worry theres nothing wrong
everything is ok
but why are you doing that
im doing it to protect you
at the same time amys car pulls up in front of the house
as soon as she sees the front door open and the mirrors laid out on the landing of the front steps amy rushes into the house panic stricken
she races up the stairs to the second floor barging into the childrens room where ben is painting the mirror
she signals rosa to take the kids out
do you mind telling me what the hell youre doing
focused and determined ben does not answer her question
look amy youve got to trust me i know what im doing
its for your own good
i want you to stop what youre doing and get out of our house right now
youre scaring the kids acting like this
ben continues to paint the mirror
if you dont leave immediately im going to call the police ben and i warn you you will never see your children again
do you understand what im saying
ben stops you have to trust me amy im not completely crazy
these mirrors are dangerous
at first i thought it was only the ones at the store but now i know they can get you anywhere
they got angela
i promise ill leave the house once ive taken them all down
do you realize what youre saying ben
what is wrong with you
i know that what youre going through isnt easy
angela was a part of our lives too but you have no right to do this to us
ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death
your son has nightmares
hes scared ben
your behavior is starting to rub off on him
hes only years old
and i have to protect him
ben can see that she is very upset about the situation
he sets down the paint bucket on the floor come amy come with me i want to show you something
he leads her back down through the first floor and out on the front steps of the house look youll see
ben pulls his magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one of the mirrors he has dragged outside
amy steps back terrified
what are you doing with that gun
put it down ben
put it down right now
without a moments hesitation ben opens fire
the mirror shatters to pieces ben smiles all excited wait look youll see
through the front window daisy and michael witness the scene ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror waiting for the magic to do its trick and
for the cracks to dissolve again behind the front door ben notices michael watching him in tears
without any evidence ben is in over his head
i swear to you i
the neighbors alerted by the blast of the gun come out of their houses to find out what has happened
ben stands alone looking like a mad man
amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control get out
i dont ever want to see you here again ben
and ill have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids
you are insane ben and dangerous
youve got to get help
with gun in hand ben walks away dismayed as he gradually becomes aware of the situation he has just created
he enters his car and drives off at top speed
ben drives nervously
he feels guilty about his conduct in front of the children
a thousand thoughts rush through his head leaving him in an utter state of confusion
he doesnt know what to do nor what to think anymore
ben reaches for his cell phone and dials larrys number hello larry
im going to need your help again come on ben
for christs sake
what are you doing
mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store
do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down
how am i supposed to know that
go to the city hall archives
they must have something considering it was a public hospital
ive got others things to do
i cant go to city hall today
ive larry larry stop it
if i could go myself i wouldnt be asking you
go to the city hall archives and ask them to look up esseker among the former patients
ben for gods sake what are you trying to prove
please do it for me
you know youre a real pain in the ass
talk to you later
ben hangs up
he glances back at the rear view mirror and sees angelas startled he loses control of the vehicle
a truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane
he barely avoids the collision
two other cars appear
ben zigzags in and out just barely avoiding a fatal crash
he stops along the edge of the road
ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind
he looks up into the rear view mirror again angelas reflection is still there
behind her long black hair she fixes him with a milky gaze
ben flies into a rage
he smashes the rear view mirror with his ben is alone and lost
what have i done
i dont understand
what have i done
insert on what is written on the side rear view mirror under the pouring rain the police patrol cars come and go in front of the police station
a bit further away we recognize bens oldsmobile parked on an adjacent street
ben is waiting inside
a man approaches knocks on the car window and enters the vehicle
its larry the rainwater drips down his raincoat
under his arm he holds a file of documents wrapped in a plastic bag
this ought to make you happy
handing him the file anna esseker
ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping i wasnt quite sure what you needed so i got all of her medical records
ben skims through the pages
he cannot believe that he has finally discovered who esseker is
everyones real edgy up there
youre still a fuckin murder suspect
people are wondering why i let you out
you have to tell me more
what does the history of the mayflower have to do with the death of your sister
i dont know exactly
i cant tell you but some really fucked up things started happening to me when i took the job over there
nothing makes any sense to me either but i have to follow my instinct
larry notices the broken rear view mirror what happened
did you have an accident
ben is too absorbed in the records
he doesnt answer
where did you find her files
did you go to city hall
no you were wrong about that they had nothing
all the medical records from st
johns hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases
ben squints at him
she was a patient at st
johns in the psych ward run by a dr
kane between march and september
she was only twelve years old when she died
when the nurses went on their rounds first thing on the morning of october th they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered
in the main room
all of them were dead including the girl
apparently they had killed one another
a slaughter house
after that they shut down the place
nobody ever found out what really happened
what about the doctor
he was arrested
they found him dead on the first day of his hearing
he had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror
ben heads home with the file containing annas medical records
he walks through the lobby of his building
angelas apartment is plunged in total darkness ben lays anna essekers file on the coffee table and aims the desk lamp at his research corner on the wall
he turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it
on an index card filled in by annas parents in september ben finds a pennsylvania home address
kanes first diagnosis is irrevocable despite her young age anna esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia leading to withdrawal from reality delusional and violent behavior
he shuffles through the first few pages of various administrative documents
his eye lands on several photographs of anna taken at the time she was admitted to the hospital she is just a child yet six male nurses were needed to
restrain and immobilize her in front of the photographer
her face is hardly discernible as she struggles like a wild animal
a high pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind
ben turns around another loud crack it comes from one of the covered mirrors in the apartment
ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer
he removes the sheet hanging on the frame a crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror
ben casts his eyes over the reflection
his glance comes to rest on annas file laying on the desk he goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents it to the mirror kraaaaack the
crack in the mirror spreads as if some kind of pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a reaction to the photograph
youre still alive arent you
all of a sudden ben realizes something
he runs back to the file on the table and goes through the documents again one by one
he stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks the date
youre wrong larry youre wrong
his eyes light up she left the hospital on the th
according to the document anna left two days before the massacre
the next morning
through the half opened door at the end of the hallway we see daisy brushing her teeth before going to school
the little girl is humming as she watches herself in the mirror
amy comes out of her room come on come on
she passes in front of the childrens room and stops inside michael is talking to somebody
amy listens closely but she can only hear michaels voice
on the other side of the door the little boy bursts out in laughter she opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the mirror talking to
his own reflection
what are you doing michael
come on were going to be late
the little boy does as his mother says
he gets up and dashes out of the room
amys glance freezes in horror
terrified she almost loses her balance amy attempts to speak but cant the mirror image of her son remains silent
amy steps closer to the mirror and in the reflection behind the boy she discovers the phone rings
ben wakes up in a jolt and picks it up amy is amy
you have to come over
amy cannot get the words out
the convulsive sobs overtake her voice
im so scared ben
theres something in the house
something in the mirrors
where are daisy and michael
are the kids all right
theyre with me
theyre right here with me
come over please
get out of the house
ill be right over
ben runs to his car and throws the esseker file on the passenger seat
he drives off at full speed and disappears at the far end of the road
on th street away from the hustle and bustle of broadway the mayflower facade is unsettling and disturbing
when he arrives ben finds his wife waiting in front of the house
the kids are playing in the snow
bens car pulls up in the driveway
amy throws herself into his arms crying with relief
im right here amy
im here now
thank god youre alright
ben comforts her holding her tightly with all his strength
we cant stay here we have to leave the house now
we can go to my mothers or to a hotel
anyplace is gonna have mirrors or windows
anything you can see your self in is dangerous
we have to make the house safe
the only way is to cover all the reflections
if we keep them in the dark we can avoid them
we need paint we need tape
ben has brought up some more paint from the basement
with amys help he paints over all the mirrors in the house
in the face of this hardship all the arguments seem far away
we can feel a connection between the two of them
the windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely with newspaper and tape
every inch of reflective surface in the house such as the tv screen and the shiny taps have been neutralized with strips of masking tape
the front door of the house opens
on the landing of the front steps ben kisses daisy goodbye
when will you be back dad
as quickly as i can sweetheart
he kisses michael who hugs him back i love you dad
he strokes michael gently on the head and goes to his car
daisy and michael watch their father leave
amy walks him to the vehicle what if you dont find her
maybe she doesnt live there anymore
maybe shes really dead
they want her im gonna find her wherever she is
we dont have any other choice
ben holds her tightly in his arms and plants a tender kiss on her forehead
im sorry about everything ive put you through
i didnt want to
amy interrupts him
ben gets into the car
amy i want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over
all the mirrors are covered theres no more danger
ill come back as soon as i can
tears well up in amys eyes
he takes her hand hey baby everythings gonna be fine
i love you
she smiles tenderly
ben drives off
through the back window we see amy in front of the house growing more and more distant
annas medical file lies open on the passenger seat at the top of the page we can read her old address in pennsylvania
aerial shot we fly over a lake the waters are so placid that the forest and outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off its surface creating two perfectly symmetrical
we glide over the treetops diving deeper into the forest to follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill
a sign on the edge of the road indicates miles to pennsylvania
ben focuses on the road determined to put an end to what hides behind the mirrors and to rescue his family
bens car slows down as he reaches a dirt road
on one of the mailboxes standing on the edge of the road he spots the name esseker the wind blows over the land
in the winter season the muddy fields have little to offer to the few starving crows flying over them
a feeling of desolation and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape
bens car has left the asphalt road behind driving through the countryside down a winding dirt road
an old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path
if it werent for the parked pick up truck and the few piglets running wild one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned
ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door
his shoes sink into the mud
he walks up the steps of the porch and peeks inside the house through the front window
in the dark he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching tv
he cant help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or turned towards the wall
a big dog barks behind the window
ben steps back surprised
the front door opens before ben has even made his presence known
a young man stares at him in silence
is this the esseker farmhouse
the young man nods
a womans voice is heard from inside what is it jimmy
i dont know mom
to ben what can i do for you sir
i am looking for anna anna esseker
the young man looks at ben questioningly
apparently he has never heard the name before
to his mother inside theres a man whos looking for
back to ben you said anna
ben confirms anna esseker mom
jimmys mother in her fifties an obese woman who has trouble moving around shows up in the opening of the door what is it you want with anna esseker
she catches him unaware
ben makes up a false identity
i am doing some research for a book on the history of st
johns hospital in new york
jimmys mother stares at him for a moment with a suspicious look jimmy go tell grandpa that theres a man here whod like to talk to him about his sister
we are in the dark basement under the farmhouse
the door to the first floor opens letting the light in
ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man robert esseker years old annas elder brother
robert walks down the steps signaling ben to follow him you know up to this day the visions of annas fits still haunt me at night
they walk through the basement towards an old wooden door
i helped my father fix up this part of the basement especially for her the old man turns the key in the padlock
slowly the door swings open revealing her fits were too violent
my mother couldnt take her screams anymore
whats left of a very primitive childs room surrounded by double wire fencing and iron bars
rather than a cell it more resembles a human sized cage capable of resisting the most as hes talking images flash on screen painful memories from that time come back
to him anna being carried to the basement her innocent eyes full of hate
its even hard to recognize the face of a little girl
her howling screams
her nails digging into her own flesh
her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs
we had every priest doctor healer coming from all over the state one after the other
but no one could help her
ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage
he can see annas scratch marks next to the bed giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering
kane from new york answered my parents cry for help
he rejected the idea of demonic possession said he didnt believe in it
he was convinced that anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder
he wanted anna under his care at st
my parents were very poor but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs
in less than five months dr
kane had cured anna
it was unbelievable
she was her old self again
a real miracle of science
and after the hospital
you dont know
she died there with all of kanes other patients
ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to robert
anna left the hospital two days before the massacre
kane changed the records to make her disappear
youre not a journalist are you
what do you want
i want to know
johns where did she go
robert stares at ben unsure of saying what hes about to reveal to this perfect stranger anna came back to live with us for a while
for a while
robert lowers his eyes
why did she leave
because strange things started to happen in the house
no not with anna
the old man obviously doesnt want to get into the details
the memories are too painful
with the mirrors
robert stiffens eyeing ben with a dark look how does he know
esseker tell me where i can find your sister
its very important
its a matter of life and death
robert hesitates before he died kane sent us a letter asking us to keep anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the
mirrors could never find her
where is she now
to protect us she left the house and joined the monastic orders where mirrors are forbidden
augustines monastery on the road to midwich
bens car does a one eighty turn in front of the farmhouse heading back to the main road
standing on the porch with an anxious look on his face robert watches him disappear in the distance
he sits down on the steps and wipes his glasses
the crows fly low in the sky its a bad sign
the nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard
a deadly silence prevails over the monastery where time seems to stand still
all these women have taken vows of poverty obedience and chastity to serve god
on the other side of the cloister wall a small winding road zigzags between the pine trees
bens car draws nearer
he parks in front of the entrance to the monastery
ben pushes open the heavy front door
the place is dark and silent
he goes to the front desk behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in charge of admissions
they are the only nuns granted exposure to the outside world
for the rest physical and visual contact is strictly prohibited
yes how can i help you
i have come to visit a member of your community
her real name is anna esseker
is she expecting you
no not really
are you a relative
listen sister i must see her
if you are not listed i cannot help you sir
we have strict regulations concerning visitations which are exclusively for family members
please tell her that i came all the way from new york and that i work with dr
kane at st
wait here for a moment
she stands up and escapes through one of the back doors
the other nun behind the screen observes ben with curiosity
time goes by and ben grows impatient
inside the house in jersey amy has isolated herself with the kids in the parents bedroom
shes reading them a bedtime story
even if all the windows screens and tv are covered by newspapers or painting amy acts in front of daisy and michael as if nothing has happened
in the rest of the house everything has been meticulously covered wrapped painted or reversed
still here and there a barely audible rustle pierces through the silence in the childrens room the paint covering the mirror slowly begins to flake off
the newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip
ben is losing his calm
time is running out
the nun reappears behind the wooden screen sister anna has agreed to talk to you you may proceed to the parlor next door
ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures him to
he enters the parlor alone
in the spare room a chair stands by a wooden screen fencing him off once again
behind the screen a silhouette awaits him
johns closed down in
who are you
ben sits down
even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of anna esseker who is now sister anna
my name is benjamin carson
i work as a night watchman at west th street in new york city what used to be st
what is it you want mr
i need your help
i dont quite see how i could possibly be of any help
my wife and children are in danger
what is threatening my family is asking for you
for a split second ben makes eye contact with anna behind the screen
she has understood
if you dont help me i may lose the only thing that matters to me
i cannot leave the precincts
tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you
sister anna remains silent i must know sister
it is not the wish of the mirrors to find me but of what is imprisoned inside them
the mirrors are merely windows on our world
at the time that i was at st
kanes therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end in order to force him to confront his own image
i spent the darkest days of my life in that room
on the th day the nurses found me lifeless almost dead
since that day i have never had another fit
but deep down inside ive always known the truth
there is no cure for schizophrenia it was something else mr
and whatever it was it entered the mirror
we can feel the emotion in her voice
i thought that after fifty years this would have all gone away
they would have disappeared from the mirrors
i didnt know
im sorry but if i agree to go with you and return to that place i will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real
everything is now making sense for ben it entered with you and they need you to get out
the consequences of such an act mr
carson would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now
im going to pray for you and your family
thats all i can do right now mr
god bless you
she stands to leave
please listen to me terence berry gary lewis and many others before me
those are the people who died trying to find you
because they failed their families died too
my sister was murdered two days ago
my wife and kids will next if you dont come with me
look from his wallet ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of michael as a baby in amys arms
daisy stands next to them in the picture
ben presses the photograph against the grating for anna to look at it
my wife and two children
theyre all ive got
anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves
anna doesnt respond and disappears in the distance
hes desperate and lost
he has a hard time containing his anger
on the horizon a red sun sets behind the treetops
its almost nightfall
the bells from the monastery begin to toll
the cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle of rain water
frustrated ben walks back to his car and dials his home number on his cell phone in the distance the lights of manhattan sparkle in the night
in the house all the lights are off
all is quiet too quiet
in the hallway the shiny doorknob leading to amys bedroom is the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten
in the distorted reflection we see michaels silhouette approaching
the little boy reaches for the knob but inside the bedroom amy fell asleep with daisy in her arms
on the bedside table the home phone starts ringing she wakes up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver hello
where are you
did you find her
did you talk to
she stops speaking as she realizes daisy is asleep next to her but michael is no longer there
on the phone ben hold on michael is gone
to ben on the phone i dont know i fell asleep with the kids on the bed and
she sees that the bedroom door is half opened
the sound of pouring water is heard coming from the hallway
michael must be in the bathroom
amy whats going on
are you alright
amy runs to the door waking daisy up
what is it mom
to her daughter you stay right here sweetheart im going to look for your brother
stay right here
to ben on the phone ben i have to call you back i have to find michael
no amy stay with me
amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is completely soaked
she turns on the light in the hallway only to discover the entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water all the taps in the bathroom are turned
on and have transformed the surface of the floor into a large natural mirror
to ben on the phone fuck
there is water everywhere
amy freezes when she realizes that all the picture frames and all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped bringing the reflecting surfaces once again to the light
scared ben someone scraped all the mirrors
there is someone in the house
where is michael
panicked i dont know where he is
i dont see him
as she turns in the hallway amy sees a dark shadow moving in one of the mirrors
terrified she steps back and hits the opposite wall
she drops the phone on the flooded floor at the same moment ben still outside of the monastery is cut off in his conversation with his wife
he tried to redial but that doesnt work
he knows something weird is happening there
without hesitation ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks back towards the monastery gates
unsure of what she saw amy makes a step towards the mirror but only finds her own reflection
she picks up the phone the water shorted it out
cautiously amy walks up to the bathroom
she opens the door the sink and bathtub are filled with water overflowing onto the tiled floor
michael is not there
a hand enters frame to light some candles
sister anna is back in her cell
the way her hand shakes as she carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset she is by the confrontation with ben its been too much
time that shes carrying the guilt
she runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels down in front of her bed to pray when a loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation
is heard outside the cell
someone has broken into the monastery
she recognizes bens voice like a mad man hes looking for her everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way
anna stands up when ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his hand
behind him the other nuns are terrified
ben points the gun at anna my kids are not going to die tonight
youre coming with me now
not intimidated by the weapon anna steps towards ben
for the first time ben can see her face the old lady seems more determined than ever if i come with you mr
carson you have to promise to do everything i tell you
ben lowers his gun you have my word
daisy waits patiently in the bed following her mothers instructions
suddenly she hears her mother calling her from the childrens bedroom daisy
daisy steps into the corridor and stops for a moment when she notices the flooding
she enters her bedroom following the voice that calls out for her daisy
daisy explores the bedroom
the voice is still calling but her mother is not there
the door shuts behind her
she walks up to the mirror on the wall
the paint has been partially scraped off she turns off the tap and sinks her hand into the depths of the bathtub to pull the plug when she sees michaels
reflection on the surface
she turns around but michael is not behind her
the reflection lied
daisy walks up to her mothers reflection in the mirror
come come closer
daisy is mistrustful
she senses that something is not right
in the mirror her mothers attitude is different and strange
what are you doing in there mom
come closer dont worry
everything is all right sweetheart
daisy obeys when suddenly she notices that her mother holds a pair of scissors in her hand
daisy has no time to react with her head still submerged in the bathtub amy is drowning
she tries to fight back
her head stays under the water
with the tips of her fingers amy feels her way to the plug
she pulls it out
slowly the water level begins to go down
amy struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again
the water continues to recede
amy has reached exhaustion her hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub
she is suffocating
at the last minute she turns her head to gasp for air
the remaining water swirls down the drain
the bathtub is now empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished
amy collapses to the ground spitting and coughing
she comes to her senses gets back to her feet and dashes out of the bathroom
as she runs past the bedroom she notices that the door is open daisy
daisy is no longer there
panicked amy crosses the corridor and barges into the childrens room
inside she discovers in the mirror amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp blade of the scissors to her daughters throat
the blade glides over her skin
in reality a trickle of blood appears on daisys throat
instinctively amy throws herself against daisy tearing her away from the grip of her own reflection
they land on the floor and crawl to the corner of the room safe from the danger of the reflections
amy tears off a piece of her clothing which she presses against daisys throat in order to stop the bleeding
oh my god dont move baby dont move
amy is out of control holding daisy tightly in her arms
she is terror stricken by the events in the house
dont move sweetheart
fortunately daisys wound is not deep
the blade did not reach the main artery
amy saved her life at the very last minute
daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood
she struggles to speak why did you do this mom
in tears it wasnt me daisy it wasnt me
i would never hurt you you know that
where is michael
i dont know where he is
im going to take care of you and then were going to find him
ok but for now we have to get out of here
is daddy coming back soon
yes hell be here soon as he can
a bit further away in the scraped section of the mirror we can see amys reflection on its knees above daisy who lies on the floor in this evil version
of the reality amys double has killed her own daughter
using the scissors shes working on the dead body
what exactly is she doing to the little girl
she turns toward us revealing her face and hands covered with in search of the real amy and daisy the forces of the mirrors are determined to get them
away from the field of vision of the mirror amy crawls on the floor towards the door
amy comes back to the bedroom carrying daisy in her arms
as she passes the bureau she grabs the first aid kit from one of the drawers
she sets her daughter down in the walk in closet away from the mirrors
the little girl has trouble moving
amy examines the cut on daisys throat
quickly with a professional touch she disinfects and bandages the wound
listen to me carefully daisy
i want you to stay in here and be quiet
daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength she holds on to her mother tightly
you have to be brave sweetheart
i want you to stay in here and not get out until i come back no matter what happens
im going to find michael
do you hear me
not quite convinced daisy accepts reluctantly
i am so proud of you
amy shuts the door of the closet
through the wooden slats she can see her daughter inside dont move
amy exits the room
even though she turned off the taps upstairs amy can still hear the water pouring downstairs
on guard amy walks down the stairs step by step
she is frightened and her heart is pounding
at the bottom of the stairs amy catches sight of michael at the other end of the living room
the first floor is completely flooded
all the space is covered the little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the paint off the mirror with a sharp knife
it was michael who had scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force of the mirrors free
he doesnt answer
he doesnt seem to hear her
amy comes down the last step
what are you doing
the little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile they want to come play with us mommy
amy moves slowly towards her son
michael i want you to drop that knife do you hear me
you know very well you are not allowed to play with that dont you
michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool
thats a good boy now give me the knife
instead of obeying michael runs off and disappears into another room on the first floor
amy rushes after him
amys cell phone laying on the night table begins to ring
on the display we can see the call is from ben
through the wooden slats of the closet door daisy catches sight of the phone
she thinks about leaving the closet to answer but remembers her mothers strict instructions about staying in the hiding place
the phone continues to ring but no one answer it
amy hears the phone ringing upstairs but she cannot answer it now she must find michael first
bens car drives down a manhattan street
behind the wheel ben is on the phone and gets amys voicemail
he dials again answer
god damn it
answer the phone
once again he gets the voicemail
ben is losing his calm
bens car pulls up in front of the department store
through the windshield anna catches sight of the devastated building
ben hangs up the phone somethings wrong over there my wife is not answering
ben is torn he knows that going back to amy isnt going to help we have to get inside the mayflower now
anna steps out
she cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs through her when she stands in front of the former hospital from now on im going to close my eyes
take me to the basement to the mirror room
it has to stop where it began
ben grabs her forcefully come on lets go
carson no matter what happens in there i want you to do as i say and make sure i never get out of this place
ben pulls out his keys and unlocks the front door
anna closes her eyes and follows him inside
anna has barely crossed the threshold when the hall mirrors start trembling they can feel her presence
she tightens her grip around bens hand
she is anxious and even with her eyes shut she can sense the threatening vibes sent off by the mirrors
ben is focused gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground floor in the direction of the basement door
yet from the corner of his eye he cannot help but glimpse the mirrors
what he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares they are waiting for me
ben turns towards anna and realizes that in the mirror theres something else annas reflection is different its not the old nun anymore but
we are back in the house
amy is still searching for michael
she goes into the kitchen to turn off the tap
above the sink the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as well and the hot steam is now covering the glass
a hand print the forces are everywhere
amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen
the sound of rapid splashing footsteps catches her attention
amy turns around and leaves the kitchen michael
michaels reflection sweeps over the water surface
amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of him
michael is hiding under the living room couch
she comes closer and bends over there is no one under the yet in the reflection of the wet floor michael is there
he smiles at her playfully
the blood gushes between her fingers
michaels reflection has disappeared
she turns around just in time to catch sight of the little boys reflection escaping
his invisible footsteps splash in the water as he moves further away
she hears michael run up the stairs to the first floor
protected from the mirrors in her hiding place in the closet daisy inspects the room through the wooden slats
suddenly the bedroom door squeaks open
daisy curls up in the corner of the closet overtaken with fear its only the cat who enters the room with a meow
come here kitty come here
she opens the door a tiny crack to let him in
the little girl takes the pet in her arms reassuringly
in the dark the surface of the water lies perfectly still
we are no longer in the new jersey house but in the subterranean passageways corridors of the department store
ben and annas silhouettes appear walking down the stairs
ben turns on his flashlight
the lights along the corridor are too weak
watch your step a water pipe has burst the whole basement is flooded
ben guides anna with her eyes still shut through the tunnels
the beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls and the piping
they pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the demolished wall
you stay outside
anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror room
when she places her hand against one of the mirrors cracks appear instantly
the pressure on the other side is growing stronger and stronger
anna positions herself in the center of the room from where her reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible angles
she kneels down with her eyes closed
compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light
michael is sitting quietly in front of his room
as narcissus did he is observing his reflection mirrored in the surface of the water that covers the wooden floor
hypnotized by his mirror image the little boy does not hear his mothers call
amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him
michael look at me
im right here
michael doesnt answer
gently he caresses his reflection in the surface of the water
amy comes up to him slowly determined to pull him away from his reflection
she lays her hand on his shoulder
this time michael reacts and turns towards her
before he can utter a single word amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him
too late the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of water covering the floor
michael has been pulled into the other amy sees her son struggling under the water as if he were caught under a coat of ice
in desperation amy beats her fists against the floor with all her strength trying to break through to the other side
flying into a rage she beats her fists again and again in an attempt to break the surface and save michael from drowning
she sees michaels body sinking into the depths
back to the subterranean world of the department store
ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand
in the mirror room anna recites a prayer for strength
in the the mirrors around her shake more and more violently anna remains with her eyes still shut
ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the water at his feet trembling
annas eyes freeze her pupils constrict thousands of shards of glass are sent flying into the air piercing through her body like a dozen sharpened daggers
the blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble
instinctively ben takes shelter behind the wall
amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water
the little boy is unconscious
she begins to shake him and to perform mouth to mouth resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest
amy tries not to lose her head determined to bring her little boy back to life
her eyes fill with tears blurring her vision
she mustnt lose faith
she mustnt give up
cardiac massage mouth to mouth resuscitation cardiac massage
ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror room
in the silence he waits
he must establish beyond a doubt that its all over
he aims his flashlight at the surface of the water everything seems to be back to normal
his reflection is deformed by the slight stir of the water slowly becoming placid
ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room all the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the metal cage that was holding them in place
the floor is covered with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water shimmering in the shadows
the beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of anna or her dead body nothing
ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure the woman has vanished
he aims his flashlight at the ceiling
the beam of light instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him its her or at least what is left of her a possessed
ben has no time to react before anna charges at him
he drops his flashlight to the ground trying to resist her as much as he can
ben manages to pin the creature against the wall
anna spits blood in his face
he applies all his strength to immobilize her the shards of glass dig deeper into the elderly womans flesh which only seems to provide her an intense pleasure
anna froths at the mouth
her speech has become a deep animalistic incomprehensible gurgle
in an effortless movement anna pushes him away
her demonic strength is ten times his
ben is merely a puppet a rag doll that she sends flying into the air only to crash violently against the brick walls
blood squirts onto the surface of the water
ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways
on the other side he lands on the ground in the dark
he strives to regain consciousness
ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but anna appears from the dark and in a flash she strikes a backhanded blow that sends the
gun off into the air
she lifts ben up and throws him across the room
he rams into the wall
with the absence of light in the basement ben is defenseless
he cannot see his assailant
ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards
his hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back
suddenly under the water his hand lands on the gun
he grabs it turns onto his back and fires point blank at anna
the bullets go flying through her body but they dont stop her
ben is being dragged
he manages to grab hold of one pipe after the other trying to hold on but the pipe gives way and breaks off from the wall letting out a powerful
jet of gas
once again ben is sent flying down the tunnel
he struggles to get back on his feet apart from the sound of the flowing gas a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways
ben makes out annas silhouette hiding behind the leaking gas pipe
with his bloodied face ben is no longer the same man anymore something in his eyes has shifted
rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread
he is determined to put an end to the creature no matter what happens
he slides the weapon in his belt and steps with his bare hands towards what once was anna
crouched over in the water the demon looks up ready to charge
ben takes another step forward with the same determination
the creature thrusts itself against him the clash is extremely violent
ben uses all his strength to keep his assailants jaw at a distance
in a swift movement ben turns around and impales anna on the despite being momentarily immobilised the demon seems unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell
on the contrary it struggles more violently to escape from the trap
ben moves away keeping an eye on anna
he takes his gun and aims it at her
ben is exhausted
with his arm outstretched he is ready to shoot waiting for the right moment
the silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark
ben stands by the demon goes through the cloud of gas ben fires ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames
cracks appear everywhere
the brick walls begin to fall apart
a part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in
ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs
totally burnt flesh charred anna is enraged by her preys resistance
the blazing demon runs after ben
behind them one after the other sections of the walls collapse
ben runs as fast as he can
anna is coming closer to him when suddenly ben narrowly escaped the collapse
he reaches the staircase and catches sight of the exit above when suddenly ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the mirroring water surface disappearing on the other
side of the all of her efforts are in vain
amy is unable to bring back her son
nonetheless she continues with the same determination refusing to accept reality
she finally breaks down pleading with the sky above
lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place ben turns and sees michaels body soul which is also trapped in this parallel dimension on the other side of the
in the distance he can see the surface leading to the hallway of the new jersey house
above it amy tries to resuscitate michael
ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms for a moment then pushes him towards the surface michael comes around coughing out the water from his lungs
amy bursts into tears sobbing with joy
she holds him tightly in her arms with all her strength with all her love
holding michael in her arms amy comes back for daisy in the bedroom
she opens the closet door and finds her little girl inside
the child throws herself into her mothers arms it is over mom
amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror
everything seems back to normal
yes sweetheart its over
amy holds her two children tightly savoring this moment of joy and relief
through the window we see the first light of dawn appearing on the horizon
the sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome above the entrance hall of the department store
the pigeons fly in and out
the burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the ruins
on the walls all that remains from the mirrors is their s the floor has completely subsided
it looks like there was just an earthquake under the building
in the middle of the pile of debris something in the rubble begins to move its ben
he gasps for air
wounded and covered in dust it is a miracle that he has survived
he struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of concrete to regain the ground floor
limping he crosses the entrance hall
his discovery of the absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face he has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to be indestructible
ben steps out of the department store walks out of the closed off area and reaches the street
police cars fire trucks and ambulances with spinning lights have surrounded the fencing
ben approaches the scene
he needs medical attention
he catches sight of lorenzo talking to some policemen
ben stops dead in his tracks ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates how is it possible
everything is reversed
ben steps back in panic
as he walks away from the scene we discover something else in the back of the ambulance ben walks up west th street to broadway and stops at the intersection
of the streets paralyzed with fear the activity of time square seems normal for an early morning cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the pedestrians but all the signs all the billboards are reversed
ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless person is sleeping his eyes fill with horror
ben presses his hand against the glass
the reflection of the world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but he remains invisible
he removes his hand from the mirror leaving a clear and well defined handprint on the reflective surface
ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him back in the ambulance a paramedic comes to close the back door
the vehicle starts and leaves the mayflower
the ambulance turns on the avenue
in the back of the ambulance as the vehicle drives away we discover that another corpse is laid out next to annas its fingers suddenly twitch
was it the bumpy road
