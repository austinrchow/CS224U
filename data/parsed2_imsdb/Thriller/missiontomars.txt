screenplay by jim thomas john thomas graham yost story by lowell cannon jim thomas john thomas blue sky a few puffs of cloud pierced by slanting rays of sunlight
late afternoon on a perfect day
as we hear after a few more beats an astronauts voice
t minus ten nine eight start ignition sequence five four three two one ignition
a tiny red streak zips into the sky then bursts with a faint ludicrous pop
a bottle rocket
we hear childrens laughter excited shouts
descending we see phil ohlmyer late s kneeling with a gaggle of eager children around him
phil an astronaut has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube
all at once my turn
no i was next
uncle phil uncle phil can i do one
i want to do one
guys guys please
this is risky stuff here
and im a highly trained professional
derisive groans from the kids more shouts
theres little danger nasa will ever use him on a recruiting poster hes messy very hyper
phil waves his hands for silence
uncle phil will launch another booster
another astronaut renee cote a tall very fit french woman is walking by with a fresh six pack
she tosses a beer and phil catches it
just as soon as he completes his fuel intake
who grins walking away from phil and the kids as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party
we are in the big back yard of a middle class home in a houston suburb
dozens of people astronauts nasa personnel and their families are gathered around picnic tables or spread out blankets
lots of red white and blue bunting lots of balloons
we hear snatches of music mostly country flavored from dueling boomboxes
futuristic frisbees are being tossed about
a banner strung between trees reads bon voyage itll take us six months just to get to mars
another year on the surface then six months back
thats two years
passing the banner cote lobs a beer to another astronaut nicholas willis who snags it neatly
hes got his other arm around the waist of a pretty girl
as cote moves out of frame angle lingers on these two
willis a very young astronaut early s is recruiting poster material and knows it all too well
i guess what im trying to say is since this is my last night on earth its gonna be a very precious memory to me
nice try nick
as the pretty girl slips out of his grasp laughing and walks away willis shrugs philosophically
he pops open his beer swigs it
angle follows the pretty girl as she swerves around an open pit barbecue where other astronauts are gathered
cote has paused here too distributing the last of her beers
sergei kirov a russian cosmonaut is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball
he turns grinning beerily at the chef
hey woody our mars one crew wont be heading back to earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with mars two
thats a pretty good long rendezvous
woody blake late s is a big rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a hawaiian shirt and a kiss the chef apron
an entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames and woody is basting this as he smiles at malik
what are you suggesting sergei
maybe you should bring a baseball bat
our two crews could have ourselves a little solar system series
half you guys are foreigners
wed crush you
no no we have equal crews
three men one woman
he grins teasingly at cote who makes a face at him
easy now youre talking about my wife
seeing her approach and terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop
terri fisher early s passes by with a platter of corn on the cob
short sturdy body a face made attractive by its alert questing intelligence
she pauses to kiss woodys cheek theres a wonderful sexy spark between them
then she glances at kirov all business now
fast pitch no steals batter calls his own strikes
thousand bucks make it interesting
hes a bit rattled by her cockiness and looks at cote who smiles nods her cool agreement
winner take all
smiles sweetly at kirov bring some balls
the other men ooooh at this busting on kirov and cote as terri moves on
woody watching her go has a thousand watt grin
you wanna know the sad part
technically i outrank her
but if we want any peace at all on mars two im gonna be saying a lot of yes dears
the others laugh
angle follows terri as she dodges a pack of kids they run by her shrieking happily before she finally reaches a picnic table where astronauts wives are opening containers of
baked beans coleslaw and potato salad
just not sure how i feel about nasa allowing couples to go on this type of mission together
one of the other women raises a warning eyebrow and the st wife turns sees terri setting down her platter
embarrassed nothing personal terri
its just that well its kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind
carefully neutral all the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips
then they havent studied some of the couples ive known
laughter at this
terri smiles politely she doesnt really have much in common with these women before moving on
angle lingers on the wives who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy
one of them is looking around
anybody seen jim mcconnell
i dont think hes coming
god that poor man
hows he doing
totally losing it from what i hear
cant sleep cant eat
visits her grave almost every day
lowers her voice they say he could lose mission status
oh thats so sad
that is just so tragic
you go to a routine physical one day and wham
after all those years of training too
it was their whole dream
must be a pretty funny feeling for luke graham
now hes gonna be in the history books
first man on mars
she shakes her head awed by the thought
the others nod in agreement following her glance
in the distance a lone male figure stands by the garage his back to them facing the parked cars vans and suvs which stretch down the driveway and along the
another figure a woman can be seen approaching him
closer angle follows the moving woman debra graham early s very attractive until she reaches her husband
luke graham mid s has the lean fit body of an astronaut the restless intellect of a scientist
hes unaware of her approach until she touches his shoulder
he looks at her with an apologetic smile
hes not coming luke
jim deserves this too
all his friends are here
and its my last night
gently your last night with us too
he looks at her moved
she summons a smile
he slides his arms around her waist kisses her forehead
i love you deb
i love you too baby
but maybe you should spend some time with bobby
where is he
up in his fort
he kisses her again then goes
debras eyes follow him with a mixture of pride and sadness
angle follows luke away from the garage into luke moves through the crowd
phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets
red streaks arc high overhead
in the back corner of the yard where its quieter he passes willis whos sitting on a blanket murmuring soulfully to deep space is so lonesome
but i guess ill have my memories to keep me warm
luke shakes his head
willis is incorrigible
finally he reaches a tall redwood playset
he looks up the ladder
a small boy sits on the platform of the tower arms around his knees staring up at the stars
a telescope rests nearby on a tripod
he looks lonely
luke climbs up sits down on the wooden deck next to him
bobby glances over at his dad his idol then back at the sky
whos gonna read to me now at bedtime
luke is surprised by the question
i like when you do it
now were never gonna finish our book
his voice is unexpectedly fierce
hes fighting back tears
luke is moved
another brief silence
well ill tell you what
ive been thinking about that
and what i thought was how bout if i bring along my own copy
bobby looks at him then every night wherever i am ill read a little bit more of it
and ill know that you and mommy wherever you are youre reading it too
that way itll feel like were still reading it together
cause i dont know about you but im pretty anxious to find out how ol ben gunn got marooned on that island
what dyou say
bobby manages a smile
he nods feeling a little better
luke is proud of his sons courage
can i have a hug
bobbys arms go around his fathers neck
he hugs luke fiercely and luke hugs him back
his eyes over the thin young shoulders are brimming with love and impending absence
then from the distance the sound of an approaching car
they both turn
an open jeep is coming down the street
its driver is alone
lukes expression changes
recognition then happiness
the jeep stops its electric engine whirring down
the driver climbs out wearily reaching into the back seat and comes out with a champagne bottle hastily decorated with ribbon
the party sounds are drifting this way and he hesitates a moment seeming to gather himself
he starts gamely towards the party then pauses again
debra graham stands nearby on the front lawn waiting
she smiles tentatively
jim mcconnell early s manages a smile in return
he has dark circles under his eyes and his clothes look slept in
yet we sense even through his sadness a kind of quiet competence in this man an unforced authority hes a natural leader
debra hurries forward into his arms and he hugs her
they separate looking at each other
her eyes are shining
we were afraid you wouldnt come
i caught a whiff of your barbecue
after that i was helpless
all the way out in galveston
something like that
she smiles its his night deb
i didnt want to spoil it
hes been going crazy looking for you
over her shoulder he sees luke approaching his arm around bobby
the two men look at each other the bond between them so strong it needs no words
finally luke smiles
a whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you
mcconnell comes towards him accompanied by debra and together the four of them move out of frame heading towards the party
angle holds on the parking area as we
all the parked cars and vans are gone now except for two mcconnells jeep and woodys classic vette
willis one of the last to go is just departing on his motorcycle
perched behind him arms around his waist is pretty girl
they zoom away through the darkened neighborhood
the yard is nearly deserted
the bon voyage banner has torn loose at one end and flutters limply
here and there a napkin blows across the ground
in the distance three figures sit on the ground by the waning fire of the barbecue pit sipping beers
as woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames
for a moment he mcconnell and luke are silent staring at the sparks as they rise towards the stars red and gold dots mingling with the silver ones
abruptly i wish we were all going
the intensity in his voice surprises the others and even woody himself
luke glances at mcconnell
an awkward beat
then youve got a short memory
think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training
oh youre not gonna bring that up again laughing im trying to remember lets see which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there
you just cant let that go oh man three commanders on the same ship
if they sent us off to mars together there wouldnt be enough fuel to lift all those egos
laughs bullshit we wouldve made a great crew
that was never gonna happen
i was always teamed with maggie and we were mostly chalkboard jockies
listen to him
cover of time magazine
yeah who landed the crippled block ii shuttle
yeah and who scored highest on the lunar rankings
let it go luke
smiles sure i made a little noise
but putting the first footprints on mars
thats for guys who
looks at luke wrote their ph
thesis on how to colonize the place
and guys who
looks at woody read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little flash gordon rocketships around their necks
he grabs playfully at woodys neck
woody smacks his hand away laughing
you read the same damn science fiction books that i did
youre just not man enough to wear jewelry
he pulls from his shirt a little flash gordon rocketship emblem hanging on a chain and waggles this tauntingly at mcconnell as luke and mcconnell laugh
you want flash
you know you want him
well youll have to come through me
luke grabs woodys arm to give mcconnell a better shot at the emblem but woody cuffs his hands away laughing
mcconnell watching their horseplay shakes his head
god she wouldve loved to see you two clowns
just one more time
he tries to smile but his face reddens
then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions
woody sees this reaches out a reassuring hand but mcconnell shakes him off rises abruptly
he turns his back on them walking away a few steps
woody and luke exchange a worried glance
mcconnell and luke watch as woody starts up his corvette
mcconnell has regained his composure
hey woodrow isnt it about time you donated this thing to a museum
woody revs the engine which roars lustily
internal combustion boys
accept no substitutes
woody looks at mcconnell
jim if theres ever
if theres anything terri and i can do im okay
woody reaches out to shake lukes hand
see you when i get to mars luke
dont solve all the mysteries of the universe okay
leave a little something for the next guys
ill see what i can do
just make sure you bring some fresh beer
you got it
with a final glance at mcconnell woody slips the car into gear
mcconnell and luke watch as he drives away
luke glances at his old friend growing more serious
we sense hes been waiting all night for a chance to say this
shouldve been your mission jim
yours and maggies
mcconnell looking after woodys car becomes very still
none of us ever wanted mars the way you two did
not even woody
twelve years of hoping for this assignment training for it thats all over now
if maggie hadnt gotten sick if you hadnt pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her mcconnell turns to him his eyes flashing danger
he will not tolerate pity
luke sees this but presses on
no im gonna say this
i have to say it
pause i wanted mars one
hell i battled you for it every step of the way
never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life
but not like this
jim id give this all up in a second if it would bring maggie back to us
mcconnell is deeply moved and for a moment doesnt trust his own voice
i know that luke
you dont have to say it
mars is yours now
go get it
pause take care of yourself
they grab hands for a second then let go
luke walks back towards his house
mcconnell watches him for a moment then turns walks over to his jeep
he opens his door then pauses
looks up at a tiny reddish dot hovers there glowing steadily
mars itself a tantalizing prize
but for him now more distant than ever
for him perhaps never to be attained
as we see these thoughts going through him
after a moment he looks down at and the sandy verge of the front yard
are a map of complex emotions regret injured pride infinite yearning
gently a bit self consciously he lifts one shoe and sets it down again making a careful deliberate footprint in the sandy soil
sequence omitted from original script
instantly were hurled into an immense stunning landscape mysterious and vivid as a fever dream
a vast plain of rust orange soil
boulders the size of houses tossed about by the hands of gods
twin moons hanging in a salmon pink sky
on the horizon towering craggy peaks
and at center the only sign of life a small mysterious moving puff of dust
sequence omitted from original script
closer angle as a small sojourner like multi wheeled robotic vehicle ambles into frame jouncing along the orange martian soil pausing to snuffle its sensors towards the occasionally interesting rock
lettering on its side reads ares
suddenly ares pauses
its video lens whirrs out fine tuning focus as it becomes intrigued by something offscreen a higher more distant target
the little fellow almost quivers with excitement
a one man atv rover waits in the background in a dry streambed as luke in an eva spacesuit swings a clawed rock hammer against a multi layered sedimentary rock
reddish dust coats his bulky white suit
despite that bulk he moves easily in the light martian gravity earths
a hunk of rock breaks off and luke examines it more closely holding it up to his clear faceplate
hes very happy absorbed in this work when his radio crackles
luke you read me
luke i just got ares on line and
well we think youre gonna wanna see this for yourself
luke though reluctant to break off work is intrigued
as luke turns away headed for the rover to reveal a staggering prospect seen for the first time valles marineris that planet creasing slash
so wide so deep it boggles the mind on earth it would reach from new york to l
sequence omitted from original script
the crew of mars one kirov willis and cote have joined luke gathered around some display monitors
theyre in nasa jumpsuits the hab has artificial atmosphere enhanced gravity and heat
all are captivated by what they see
on a we see a low angle image of an elongated rubble and dirt covered mountain
hard to tell scale but it looks huge
whats most striking however is a white peak barely protruding through the rubble two thirds of the way along the mountains ridgeline
its whiteness is in clear contrast to the typical rust orange of the surrounding rubble whats more this strange little peak also displays an oddly smooth multi planed symmetry
what the hell is that
no idea boss
where is it
cote glances at the others
theyre all smirking as if they share some secret joke lukes not yet in on
you dont wanna know
cmon whats so funny
gimme the coordinates
he leans over to read a digital gauge but cote covers it with her hand enjoying the tease
latitude degrees north longitude degrees west
the plains of cydonia
pause oh no
youre not telling me they all laugh as the other shoe drops
lukes expression is incredulous exasperated
its kirovs fault he picked todays sector
weve got a scientific duty to check that thing out
luke sits taking over the ares remote control from cote
they all watch as he fine tunes the image trying without success to coax more resolution
the first anomaly we hit and its gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make nasa look ridiculous
you know how many books have been written about that damned mountain
the egyptians put it there
no the amazons
no it was little green men
and all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets
if this gets out well have every ufo kook on earth spouting off on the six oclock news
cmon people gimme a read here
is that a cinder cone
nah too smooth
its an upwelling for sure
but maybe not volcanic
the others look at him puzzled
luke leans in closer with growing excitement
he points to the screen
look at the color
and see how shiny it is
i could swear thats ice
this far south
you cant have ice at this latitude
they look at each other lukes excitement now leaping from one to another of them
theyre almost trembling
oh my god
how far away is it
sixteen kilometers northeast
take us twenty minutes to get there
considers a moment lets send a packet to micker
then well go check it out
slide back revealing the crew in eva suits carrying gear
they walk over to
the astronauts climb in through the hatch
the last one in pulls it shut behind him and locks the latches
we see cote and luke check their screens and press some buttons
luke puts the rover in drive
as the rover moves off across the rocky surface dust kicking up from the wheels we get our first exterior glimpse of the mars one base camp
the main hab unit looks like a huge tuna can with a conical top section it connects to a separate inflated bubble greenhouse
theres also an oxygen still propellant plant and on the other side a couple hundred meters distant the massive erv earth return vehicle which arrived as a separate unmanned flight
rows of solar panels arrayed on the ground and an american flag on a thin pole about man height complete the scene
a vast impressive multi sectioned spacecraft is drifting majestically above earth
the main hull displays both nasa and u
we move in towards another of the stations segments which is dedicated entirely as we see from more labels and insignias to the mars program control room training and living
quarters and a vehicle docking and launch area where mars two is already positioned for its eventual flight
we hear lukes excited voice over speakers
this is a truly anomalous formation
looks like nothing weve seen so far
the structure appears to be crystalline at least from the angle displayed by ares
on a large center display screen we see luke and the mars one crew sitting around their kitchen table in the hab finishing lunch while taping this video message
grins were all trying not to go too nuts up here but we think theres a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface geothermal column of water
and if were right
he looks at his crew
they beam like cats who ate canaries
then weve found the key to permanent human colonization
theres an excited buzz among the assembled technicians flight engineers and scientists
this would be a fantastic epochal discovery
sits at the center console wearing a headset
hes now the mars one capcom capsule communicator and his manner is brisk efficient all business
a technician leans in for instructions
tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this
full court press
the technician nods hurries away
mcconnell sharing the intense excitement of those around him stares up at where luke and his crew are still smiling well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create
anyway weare going out to take a closer look at it try to get an idea of its composition
checks his watch by the time you receive this we should be just about on site
the rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast towards camera
we boom down to reveal ares still faithfully holding its point like an irish setter with its video snout the rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby
the hatch door cracks open and some dust vents out
the door opens all the way and the astronauts climb out
they all look up in awe
we hear their voices on radios
gleams in the sun dazzling white its facets as planed and smooth as if an architect had drawn them
it pierces through the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain an isolated butte like giant stretching two miles from left to right in front of them
walk towards the mountain
theres a very deep very low staccato tone intruding over their headsets
anyone else hear that
what is it
sounds like our antennas out of phase
can you fix it
hey skip i can fix anything
renee sergei lets break out the radar see what this things made of
as they go to their jobs the deep barely audible rumbling tone continues
multinational crewmembers walk by in the artificial gravity of the busy station as ray beck mid s approaches from the opposite direction
beck is the tough crewcut pr savvy head of the nasa mars program idd by his name tag and just now hes leading a covey of u
ambassadors on a tour
the ambassadors of both sexes many nations and all races look as excited as schoolkids
and this is the mars mission control room nicknamed micker
i understand a comm packet is incoming from mars one base camp so you may find this interesting
he opens the doors ushering his flock inside
the ambassadors enter oohing and ahhing over the impressive array of gadgetry and personnel and especially over the big screen
some of them start taking souvenir snaphots
the nigerian ambassador turns to beck whispering curiously
that man over there
hes in charge
who is surrounded by a knot of technicians to whom he is giving quiet precise instructions
they hover then depart like so many eager bees
smiles indulgently at the ambassadors misunderstanding
no actually thats jim mcconnell the capcom
our voice link to the astronauts
jims been with the manned mars program since its inception
one of our real pioneers
will he be going to mars too
this is as close as he gets
luke and his crew have finished eating and are clearing away their dishes and leftovers
anyway thats about it
well send another packet when we get back
cote clears her throat gives luke a look
the others can barely conceal their grins
one more thing
today is a very special day for a good friend of ours and i know hes there right now
mcconnell looks at the screen worried
whats luke up to
now he hates it when any fuss is made so i wont mention his name
a look of relief comes over mcconnell
because the last thing in the world id ever want to do is embarrass someone like jim mcconnell
mcconnell winces dear god no as on the screen kirov appears from off camera holding a cupcake with a burning candle stuck in it and the mars one crew starts
singing happy birthday to him
and very off key
cmon you micker weasels sing
soon most everyone in mmcr is singing along even some of the jolly ambassadors with the noticeable exception of beck who stiffens unhappily
mcconnell is mortified
sings a line then to camera hey ray
take a look at him
is he all red with one of those fake im a good sport grins
beck looks over at mcconnell who indeed is red in the face with a fake im a good sport grin
and hey you guys check out ray
does he have on one of his this wasnt in my mission plan faces
indeed becks smile is thin sour disapproving
nothing you can do about it ray
were a hundred million miles away
luke and the crew finish singing the song
luke raises the cupcake in a toast
happy birthday jimbo
make a wish
he and his crew lean in blow out the candle
they laugh and applaud then wave goodbye
catch you again soon
take care buddy
end of transmission
luke reaches out turns off the camera and the display screen beck turns his gaze locking with mcconnells
hes annoyed as if this violation of protocol were somehow mcconnells fault
mcconnell returns his stare coolly
cote stands by a display screen mounted on the rover
kirov has a big radar gun on a tripod pointing at the mountain
luke turns to cote
whats under there
puzzled je ne sais pas
i think theres something wrong with the equipment
i mean it cant be right
it says theres metal under there
luke doesnt understand
he walks up to look at the display screen
points theres ten twelve meters of rubble and sand and then
that doesnt make any sense
youre reading a vein of ore
shakes her head no
its under the whole mountain
the deep pulsing tone continues
nick could the problem with the antenna be interfering
to cote and kirov try it closer and up the power
ill watch the screen
mcconnell is taping an audio message to be sent to mars as the rest of mmcr looks on
beck is gone
so are the u
ah were all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted mars one
the folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap theyve got
cote and kirov are close to the foot of the mountain resetting the radar gun on its tripod
the deep vibrating tone continues
luke is some distance away by the rover
he looks at willis whos still working on the rovers antenna
nick how we coming on that antenna
goin as fast as i can boss
cote and kirov are having some trouble with the switches on the radar gun
they turn towards luke and willis
come show me how stupid i am
i cant get this to work
willis looks at luke
luke nods go help them
willis starts towards the radar gun
mcconnell is handed a slip of paper glances at it
medical wants me to remind you that youre three days late on your blood tests
i know theyre a bore but youve got to get them done or else
or else i dont know what
just do them okay
willis cote and kirov get the radar gun up and running
all set here chief
luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover
crank up the juice and lets see whats in this sucker
mcconnell checks over his clipboard list of updates
i think thats about it for business
but on a personal note be advised that ah none of you can sing worth a damn
laughter in the mmcr
luke watches the screen on the rover as by the mound
flips a switch on the radar gun then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain
we hear and feel the radar signal
the immediate result is that the pulsing tone weve been hearing suddenly stops
looks up from the display screen
a puzzled expression
why did that stop
a split second later he gets his answer
we hear a whoosh a mighty rushing of wind as starts to swirl and rise straight up from the top or the mountain at its center
as it swirls the cylinder picks up debris pebbles sand from the sediment encrusted surface of the slopes
stare up at this spectacle awed
some kind of energy wave
they have no idea
at the moment theyre too fascinated to even be scared
we see the whirling cylinder rise higher and higher perfectly straight until in just moments its as tall as a skyscraper
as it rises it gains speed and power narrowing at its top into a conical vortex
its sucking up so much dirt so many rocks even small boulders now that the accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling translucent outer skin
exchange amazed glances
cant believe their eyes
mcconnell still hovers by the microphone
honestly luke if you guys dont have anything better to do with your time i can make some suggestions to mission medical
there are worse things than blood tests
laughter and groans from the staff in mmcr
luke still staring in fascination becomes aware of sand and pebbles flashing past his helmet
as the nearby landscape blurs
the vacuuming effect is becoming more general across the area
and the spell is broken
he keys his throat mike his lips moving but no sound can be heard over the roaring wind
he waves his arms motioning for the others to back away towards the rover
wind whips at their eva suits as they obey him retreating
luke backing away himself is afraid to take his eyes off the cylinder
then he sees that one man willis hasnt moved
in fact hes busily snapping photographs of the cylinder
luke hurries over to him tugs his sleeve
but still stares up transfixed like a man face to face with a cobra
luke follows the young astronauts frightened gaze and his own eyes widen as he sees beginning to tilt down then coil sideways
suddenly theyre looking into the huge open mouth of it as sand and rocks fly into the swirling darkness
the monstrous gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the mountain turning this way then that
and then with horrifying precision it locks in on the little group of astronauts
and lunges towards them
luke and willis turn running as hard as they can towards the rover
but the suction is so great its as if theyre held back by wires
the ground itself is shaking rumbling as earthquakes begin to open fissures across the plain
the roar of the vortex the groaning of the earth are like an onrushing freight train
in the maelstrom of flying debris they can barely make out cote and kirov still retreating leaning back with all their strength against the suction while staring up aghast
suddenly a hurtling rock the size of a basketball smashes into cotes helmet from behind crushing it and killing her instantly
blood sprays into the wind immediately crystallizing in the sub zero atmosphere into red pellets
as bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm
an instant later he sees snatched up by the wind then swept past him in a terrifying blur arms and legs flailing mouth open in a silent scream as he
abruptly opens and he slides into a fissure
scrabbling frantically with his gloved hands he manages to momentarily arrest his fall gripping the edge of the fault line with his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip
the air is almost solidly choked with debris deadly boulders bound over him and torrents of cascading sand are burying him alive
barely conscious as he watches for a horrifying final instant as
is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex spinning and tumbling like a rag doll
his features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at him before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood and
williss spacesuit explodes his entire body disintegrating into a million bits which instantly disappear into the hellish maelstrom
and then that maelstrom itself just as abruptly
there is an instant ringing silence as awesome in its own way as the roaring storm itself had been
on the plain as the last pebbles released from suction pitter down bouncing
swirls of dust and sand drift away settling gently
the harsh orange landscape is once again calm peaceful
and then from the direction of the nearby mountain we hear another sound the deep bass pulsing rumble returns
as mcconnell finishes his message to luke
oh and i talked to debra
she and bobby are doing fine
said to tell you theyre ah theyre on their third time through the book page glances at a note page
they send their love and say take care of yourself
same from us here buddy
till next time then
end of transmission
moving angle the camera exploring ground zero as the bass pulsing rumble continues
we pass the rover canted sideways into a little crater with its canopy missing one axle fractured but miraculously still with all four wheels
we pass faithful little ares lying on its side partially crushed under a boulder
it gives a final pitiful whine its video snout slowly extending then dies
and finally we come to the area where the fissure had been and see leaving only a slender crease of umber sand
no sign of luke
the pulsing rumble continues over as we see an extraordinary sight seen from high in the air looking back down
staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow crater scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and rubble is a structure resembling a vast humanoid face
the surface is gleaming white apparently metallic
the features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes slopes ramps
the eyes hatches of some kind
are closed and the overall expression is eerily calm but terrible in its power like some ancient tribal mask
we see the face clearly for only a few beats before thick scudding clouds obscure it but the deep pulsing rumble continues low and insistent
were inside the mars two spacecraft which is still in its docked position alongside the space station
woody blake wearing a nasa jumpsuit floats up into the cockpit in zero g studying a thick manual
reads problem hatch door malfunction backup power fail manual override fail
solution replace circuit breaker b
he straps into the pilots seat staring at an electrical junction box at one end of the console
piece of cake
he swings open the housing revealing a bewildering tangle of fuses and wires
he sighs heavily as terri drifts up beside him also in a jumpsuit and straps into the co pilots seat
god who dreams up these nightmares
dont try to change the subject
were talking about your sisters wedding right
were talking about dancing lessons
before my sisters wedding
honey do you mind
ive got a catastrophic power failure here
he peers into the housing with exaggerated concern
but terris not so easily sidetracked
woody were a married couple
would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile
i danced with you at our wedding
im not talking about shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt
i mean real dancing
cha cha rhumba jitterbug face it honey some couples dance some go to mars
weve got two more months in this training rotation but just as soon as we get home were starting lessons
if we never dance people will think theres something wrong
if they see me dance theyll know theres something wrong
reaching past him she pulls out the required breaker
as he reacts surprised she smiles despite her exasperation
you are such a lug
overhead an intercom crackles
we hear phil
cockpit this is control
control this is cockpit
uh terri they want us all back in the station
report to micker
who says report to micker
the little men who live in my head
we just started this drill
woody it was ray beck
he told me to round up the team
woody and terri exchange a worried look
sequence omitted from original script
a crisis atmosphere prevails
the big room is more crowded than weve ever seen it with engineers and managers hurrying by huddling in tense conferring knots or muttering feverishly into microphones
on the center screen a giant image of mars
a frantic flow of green numbers crawls above and below this and the site of the mars one base camp is marked in blinking red
are staring up at this screen appalled
mcconnell and beck stand nearby briefing them
then at the x band continuous data stream from mars went silent
all data med environmental everything suddenly stopped
while we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong we got a signal from the folks at the large array at soccoro
at the same moment we lost the data stream they picked up an intense burst of energy from mars
what do you mean intense
looks are exchanged among the mars two crew
what about the crew
the level of energy in the pulse
didnt seem survivable
what about the remo
it went into mars orbit last week
maybe that could give us some clue
good thinking woody
thats just what we tried next
he leans over punches buttons on a keyboard
an orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around mars leaving a glowing electronic trail
this dot gets isolated in a viewing box then enlarged and rotated into the computer animated image of a small ugly industrial looking unmanned cargo craft labelled remo
the resupply module checked out fine
no instrument failures no change in status
orbit holding steady
but there was something else
the remos computer contained an uplink message a very faint highly distorted transmission from mars one base camp
the message is almost indecipherable
two teams are still working on it
you better see for yourselves
fingers press buttons on a console
mcconnell woody terri and phil are crowded around a monitor with beck and two weary still concentrating on the audio
we managed to bring out a couple more words but weve got a long way to go
show us whatever youve got
the technician nods then gestures to his assistant who hits a play button
black for a moment then static
out of this static comes a faint image of luke sitting alone at the hab kitchen table
he looks awful dried blood on his face bloodshot eyes
the image is blurry heavily streaked and most of what he says is lost in waves of static
make this quick
may be only ch long section of static to the site when we
hit us just as we
thers are all dead
woody terri and phil look at each other oh god
following more static low sound that we couldnt understand
then all of a sudden there was this terrib
another long burst of static stems are holding up for now but i dont know how long i can
the monitor screen goes black
woody and his crew stare at the screen stunned
this is a catastrophe almost too huge to grasp
as beck leads mcconnell and the other shaken astronauts down a corridor phil pauses seeing
at her desk
two co workers are trying to comfort her
one of these women looks up and her reddened eyes meet
he looks back at her haunted
what did luke mean by a low sound
in an otherwise empty lounge the astronauts clutch styrofoam coffee cups
beck stands nearby
through a large viewport behind them stars glitter against the inky blackness
if this was a earthquake as were now assuming theres usually an auditory component
but that energy pulse they picked up in new mexico
not uncommon with large scale geophysical phenomena
incredulous causing this kind of damage
i dont buy it
were missing something here
mcconnell and woody exchange a glance
luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasnt blasted out of there in the earth return vehicle
that things designed so even one crew member could fly it back to earth
even if luke was in great shape he couldnt get home
that energy pulse wouldve fried the ervs computers
other than the computers how do we think the erv fared
well so far our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape
which means its gonna be up to us to get new motherboards drives and software to mars
as fast as we can
mcconnell looks at him nods
theyre on the same wavelength
but beck is more cautious
whoa slow down
its gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data
right but meanwhile weve gotta be working up a mission plan
luke needs us now
luke may already be dead
and even if hes not its doubtful hes going to be able to transmit again
so we wouldnt know whether its safe to land until you were almost there
what about sima
terri looks at phil sima
the saturn imaging probe
its going to slingshot around mars on its way through the solar system
it could be retasked to take pictures read radiation levels at mars one base camp
good idea phil
if sima tells us luke hasnt survived and its not safe to land we swing around mars and come right back home
we can design the mission to have a free return capability
its a long trip but if you dont land its the best option
were getting ahead of ourselves
youre forgetting the bigger problem
they look at him the orbits are all wrong
our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now
but we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel
weve modelled that ray
ive modelled it
on paper yeah
but those stresses have never been tested in space
the ship can take it
i wasnt thinking of just the ship
a tense beat
again we sense the test of wills between these two tough minded men once good friends
i know the protocols for a mars recovery mission better than anybody because i helped design them
and im saying these guys can do it
hes right ray
weve got a real shot
a pause with beck weighing the odds
he looks at woody
give me an updated mission plan by tomorrow
then ill put it in the works
youll have it by
he looks at woody phil and terri who are just as eager
lets get to work
mcconnell exits followed by terri and phil but as beck starts out too woody stops him
chief could i have a word
beck looks at him a moment nods
sequence omitted from original script
in a quiet corner woody and beck are alone
ive no longer got the right crew
surprised what do you mean
bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle
bjornstrom is a geologist
hes good but not for this
my people just lost eight months of training
this is a different mission with a different objective
i havent been given authorization for a mission yet
but when you are it ought to be given the best chance for success
i want mcconnell to fly right seat
becks expression hardens
hes no longer on mission status
because you washed him out
he washed himself out
he only had to pass a few more psych evaluations but he refused to take them
ray hes the best pilot i ever saw and youve got him benched at a desk
everybody has to pass the psych prelims
jim knew that
maggie was his wife
he didnt want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers
that was his call
but i had to make one too
it was tough as hell but id do it again
his wife wasted away in front of his eyes
what was he supposed to do
suck it up
get with the program
what was his crime
that he was upset
that he cried
i couldnt trust him
beck and woody stare at each other
a long tense beat
his voice softer not in a crisis
im sorry woody but jim lost his edge
are you gonna stand there and tell me jim mcconnell is the same man he was two years ago
you want me to bet four more lives on that
this stops woody just for a beat
then makes him press on harder with even greater intensity
when maggie died yeah it knocked the shit out of him
it knocked the hell out of all of us
but you know and i know that hes still the best weve got
he and maggie wrote the book on mars
hes got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together
ray we can do this
give me mcconnell as co pilot and we will bring luke home
and thats a promise
beck looks back at him his features taunt
woody terri and phil stand at the edge of the big control room waiting and watching in a tense silence as beck and mcconnell are huddled together at the capcoms
other personnel have moved away giving them room
both men are seated leaning forward with mcconnell listening intently while beck does most of the talking very quietly
after a moment mcconnell looks up in surprise
his eyes search the room till they find woody looks back at him nods cmon man
is a study in conflicting emotions
but after a moment he masters his feelings turns back toward beck
a few more quiet words are exchanged then beck offers his hand
mcconnell hesitates then shakes it
both men rise and mcconnell turns again to look towards who react with relief glad that hes now a part of their crew
woody grins giving him a thumbs up
as he smiles
then he starts towards them with a new energy in his step a new sense of confidence and purpose
and as he walks towards us passing out of frame
sequence omitted from original script
an infinite canopy of stars
after a moment some of them begin to be blotted out as glides into view
mars recovery formerly mars two looks much like its sister craft on mars a conical cockpit mounted above a tuna can crew hab module
the entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity we see window ports spinning past then an american flag emblem
behind this lower deck in an extending network of struts like the abdomen of a dragonfly are the three huge round propellant tanks
then vast delicate looking rectangular solar panels which sweep out to either side of the ship these also bear the dish of the earth pointing hi gain antenna
and finally comes the great mass of the engine bells housed within a curving aeroshell three hatches in the aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through
for a mid course burn
to the forward section of the ship approaching a viewport in the eva airlock chamber
inside we can see phil leaning forward concentrating on some task
sequence omitted from original script
are floating in mid air forming an intricate d pattern
in the eva airlock its zero g
phil strapped into a chair by a galley counter is just completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue m m
he looks bored sluggish
in the b
terri is hunched over a microscope
mcconnell emerges from the core tunnel behind them coming up from the lower hab then pushes off from the ladder floating towards phil
he grins admiring phils obsessive handiwork
is the exact chemical composition of my ideal woman
used to be
he plucks out a couple of the m ms as he drifts by
mcconnell grins snacking on the m ms
now what is it
phil looks sadly at his floating model
mcconnell and terri laugh as phil starts scarfing down the rest of the m ms
swooping at them with both hands
i guess now we have our answer to the effects of long term interplanetary travel on the human mind
the answer is phil
smiles im gonna get an update on sima
it should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images
hes drifted to another short ladder and now grabs it starts up to the cockpit atop the hab
as mcconnell appears in the cockpit he sees woody by the forward instrumentation panel looking at a monitor
the cockpit is also zero g
take a look
mcconnell pulls himself forward
mars completely fills the screen
surface details are clearly visible
something is moving down there an amorphous brown swirl
what do you make of that
southern hemisphere coming from the east
big fella too
headed for chryse planitia
could get a little hairy just about landing time
mcconnell pulls back from the screen looks at woody
well have to be ready to move fast
maybe even advance our eta
those things can cover the whole planet and last up to a year
they both hope hes wrong
when does sima do her fly by
tomorrow morning about
thats when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing
they exchange a glance
woodys right but the thought is too terrible to dwell on
mcconnell looks back at mars
softly my moneys on luke
just turning over to read
pulls her gaze away from these numbers
judging from her redrimmed eyes its been a long anxious night
restlessly looking to distract herself she reaches for a test tube of blood straps it into a centrifuge sets it spinning
nearby is her electron microscope
lies on his cot in his own cubicle with the door closed
the lower hab has artificial gravity ag and mcconnell can move normally
hands behind his head he stares at his bureau
rests there in its leather travel frame
beautiful smiling dark haired maggie mcconnell
her face glows with intelligence and energy
shifts his eyes
the clock on his bulkhead reads
stands in the communal bathroom still in his pajamas a towel around his shoulders brushing his teeth
he glances at another digital clock which reads
shakes his head impatiently
he looks back into the mirror then is surprised to hear music lilting incongruously over the loudspeakers elvis presleys blue moon
sequence omitted from original script
phil floats in through the connecting tunnel then stops himself at a handhold
he grins charmed by the sight of like a weightless fred and ginger
woody is surprisingly good at this
he sweeps terri gallantly about the little cabin pushing off from every handy surface even guiding her into some passable twirls and dips
she laughs shaking her head
what brought this on
my last chance to be graceful
once were in mars gravity its back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt
ill take what i can get
she grins kisses his ear as phil turns sees who has now arrived is also watching the dancing couple
a twinge of sadness crosses his features
but when his eyes meet phils he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile arent they something
over the music they hear a chirp from the ships computer then an announcement
they all look at each other
this is it
woody spins over to a console shuts off the music
the crew is gathered around a display screen
the lights are dim reflecting up off their faces
by their expressions we can tell the news is not good
its a color high resolution satellite image of the mars one base camp
ghostly dust covered
no signs of life
its still standing though
so is the erv
and look theres the greenhouse
we know luke survived for at least a few hours
question is are there any signs of recent activity
they all scan the screen
phil spots something
he grabs a stylus and touches the screen
they all look
using where the stylus touches the screen as the focal point the image enlarges
three longish dirt piles appear some fifty meters from the hab
what the hell are those
mcconnell gets it first
they all realize hes right
they sit back stunned
but then phil has another thought
theres only three
that means phil it means luke must still be no
it just means there was nobody left to bury him
this quiets everyone for a long moment
check the radiation levels
phil keys in some commands and data pops up onscreen
go to the disaster site
phil uses the stylus to bring more images into view
the frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the face first in swift blurs then slowing
scattered rock debris come into view
the image arrives where the mountain was and they see
debris in every direction neat spirals of it now dropped uncannily into place like some massive earth sculpture
as if but this makes no sense it had been swirled towards a large crater
the crater itself is a perfect circle
they focus on the center of the crater but the image gets distorted by static
i dont know
phil tweaks the stylus but the image wont clear up
go to infrared
phil works the keyboard
goes to infrared reading heat the middle of the image where the face is is still distorted refusing focus
sit back exasperated
must be a problem with sima
i dont see how an earthquake six months ago could give us this kind of distortion
that was no quake
he leans closer staring intently
then what the hell was it
mcconnell shakes his head
but his every sense is engaged hes like a predator just sighting his prey for the first time
we see in his eyes an utter determination to unlock this secret
mars recovery is speeding ever closer to mars which now looms large a dusty red mysterious sphere
mcconnell and crew are eating dinner while they watch a taped message from mmcr
as ray beck addresses them
other nasa staffers twenty or more have crowded in behind him and we sense their great hopefulness and high spirits the whole teams triumph is tantalizingly close now
were going to continue analyzing this data and try to determine what the problem is with those images
frankly were just as stumped as you guys but well keep on it
glancing around we agree that the evidence of the graves is inconclusive and that a ground search is advisable
be aware there are little sand storms kicking up near mars one base but the big one you spotted is turning south
it shouldnt be a factor
beck takes a breath smiles
were all pretty excited here and were sure you must be feeling the same
enjoy your meal and get a good nights sleep
we anticipate that tomorrow morning you will be go for mars orbital insertion
whoops of joy from mcconnells crew
woody and terri high five each other
god bless you and goodnight
end of transmission
the monitor screen goes black
the lighting is subdued for a sleep period but everyones too restless
theres a low hum of equipment
terri and phil are playing computer monopoly under a single light
terri is using touch screen technology to move her piece
she glances at phil
he has spread some m ms out letting them drift in mid air as he performs his ritual weeding out of the red ones
she shakes her head
what if you opened up your meal packs and found that instead of putting in everything but red ones theyd made a mistake and put in only red ones
hey thats a funny notion
and what if in your meal packs instead of brown rice there were spring loaded spikes that shot into your eyes
pause how did you ever pass the psych evaluation
when youre schizophrenic they take the higher score
he touches the screen to roll the dice
mcconnell in his cubicle looks away from the photo of maggie
haunted by memories
he rises flips through the cds in a storage case pulls one out
he holds this carefully hesitating then feeds it into his computer
immediately his screen saver vanishes and we see an impromptu celebration a bunch of friends gathered in a semi darkened living room
the footage is handheld a bit jerky
people have paper plates of food beers in hand everyone is a little tipsy
debra is there terri phil cote kirov others
theyre watching a still photo sequence shown on a large screen tv with commentary by luke and woody
is of a small boy young mcconnell in his pajamas kneeling in front of a christmas tree
hes grinning ecstatically as he holds up a brand new model rocket
jims first ship was seriously underpowered
laughter at this
some ad lib cracks about the painfully bad haircut and the pajamas
is of a gawky looking teenage girl young maggie standing on a porch at night posing a bit self consciously by a telescope on its tripod
maggie was always starstruck
more laughter plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and braces
videocamera swings around the room revealing the adult jim and maggie
they sit side by side on the hearth leaning into each other looking very happy
ill get you guys for this
everyones having a great time
the videocamera swings back towards the tv screen as jim and maggie young adults standing on the wing of a fighter jet
both in air force flight suits helmets in hand
suntanned cocky flashing radiant smiles
when they met at the air force academy it was love at first flight
groans and laughter from the offscreen watchers
after that nasa training was tough
all jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body
more ribald laughter as maggie and jim tethered together floating weightlessly in space suits
but maggie as you can see kept him on a short leash
shows mcconnell in a dress uniform leaning in to kiss maggie who wears a white bridal gown
as he smiles at this hearing the renewed laughter and cheers the ad libbed digs from the video
he becomes aware hes not alone
he looks up
stands in the doorway of his cubicle
their eyes meet
they both smile turning back to the video
luke and woody have stepped forward into shot standing at the sides of the tv where the last photo lingers
luke waves his hands hushing everybody
today we celebrate a new chapter in their story
and guys its a pretty historic one
both men raise champagne flutes
lets hear it for the newly announced captain and co captain of mars one
to jim and maggie
cheers at this repeats of jim and maggie
luke grins giving a little signal and we see of maggie in jims arms both of them in goofy tropical vacation wear smiling
evidently a photo taken in the surf somewhere but here its been crudely superimposed onto a martian landscape
laughter greets this unlikely image
when you guys land itll prove once and for all theres no intelligent life on mars
more hoots of laughter catcalls but maggie jumps in to protest as the videocamera swings to her and jim
terri sits nearby
hey cmon what if im right
oh no here we go
dont get her started
somebody put on some music
its our sister planet
laughter at this and maggie joins in
shes a good sport
maggie why does this have to be about us
mars is a great opportunity for pure science
well do the science
and well do it very well
thats what weve trained for
but what if theres more
in all our myths in every human culture mars has always held a special attraction
what if that means something
only we dont understand it yet
the mood of the party is changing as everyone is caught up in maggies spell
she has a radiant simplicity
the video camera drifts in on her we are caught up too
the universe is not chaos
life reaches out for life
she looks at mcconnell smiles
he takes her hand
this is what we were born for isnt it
to stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one
its who we are
a silence the guests are enchanted by the purity of her passion
she smiles suddenly self conscious
she hadnt meant to get so carried away
reaches out gently taps the keyboard freezing the screen
he and woody their eyes shining stare at her image
im good to go
woody glances at him
rather than being saddened mcconnell seems to have taken on new strength
a renewed sense of wonder
after all these years
can you believe it
tomorrow well be standing on mars
woody nods smiles
you know what
she may have been right
mcconnell looks at him
if that wasnt a quake down there then something else caused it
or planned it
youre thinking the same thing
its never been out of my mind
you realize what this means
looks again at maggies face on the screen
she knew woody
she was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there
yeah and were not leaving until we find out
they clasp hands briefly
then woody turns
before leaving he hesitates just a moment turning back
one last thought and he doesnt know hes going to say it until it comes out
maggie was the best of us
mcconnell looks at him silent but grateful
mcconnell turns back looking at her smiling face frozen on the screen
as seen through the cockpit windows
huge beautiful much closer now
we can make out swirling pink clouds large surface features
its just before martian dawn the next morning
range and closing
minutes till mars orbital capture
okay people lets look sharp
if we overshoot theres no coming back
yeah and drifting through eternity will ruin your whole day
in the cockpit woody and mcconnell are in the pilot and co pilots wearing space suits but not yet helmets
as camera pulls back and away we see them making instrument adjustments in preparation for moi
delta v systems initialized
charge primary apu
select hpu fuel cells for run
tie main bus to systems
select h o hpu and fuel cells for open
h o control valves open
where phil and terri sit side by side at a pair of computers relaying cockpit commands to the systems
charged and on line reset pw
set transfer protocol data from eva station
awaiting track confirmation
theres a sudden loud brittle pop from somewhere overhead and phils gloved hand hovering over a computer screen is punctured through and through
the screen itself is holed and spiderwebbed with a loud crack
as he and terri stare at it dumbfounded
thick droplets of blood leak out and begin to swirl away sucked up towards the venting puncture in the hull over head
the astronauts helmets dangle up there awaiting use
what in gods suddenly we hear high pitched alarms sounding then the pinging of more tiny missiles slashing across the ships outer skin
are staring back from the cockpit reacting in astonishment to phils drifting blood and to the alarms
then woody suddenly understands
micrometeoroids scanning sensors breach hits in the hull
as she seizes his wounded hand tries to stop the bleeding
hes staring at a gauge
woody seal the breech
as he unbuckles dives from the cockpit back down into the eva and floats quickly over to a storage hatch
he yanks this open pulling out a then spins around in zero g as his eyes track which give a telltale hint of the punctures location somewhere up among the
dangling helmets on the ceiling
rising to this area and shoves aside a helmet with a shattered faceplate its label reads mcconnell to reveal a breech in the hull
jagged metal edges dangling insulation
the blood droplets are whirling out through here going into the vacuum of space
quickly woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the puncture firing a thick grey sealant
we hear more pings echoing loudly but after a few seconds they diminish then abruptly stop
the klaxons continue to wail
kill those alarms
mcconnell punches buttons muting the alarms and they all strain to listen faces tense and sweating
a long beat
but the meteor shower has passed by as abruptly as it appeared
the astronauts turn becoming aware of a strange phenomenon
have stopped in place wobbling eerily as perfect spheres in the zero g
then suddenly they start moving again faster and faster in a new direction
down through the open core tunnel that leads to the lower hab
stares at a gauge that confirms whats happening
still outgassing in the lower hab
there must be another hole down there even bigger
losing pressure fast
were gonna decompress
computer how long until zero atmosphere
after a beat four minutes nine seconds
if we get below atmosphere the power will shut down
are you sure
a vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure
the nav computers will fry
to woody well lose all control
we wont be able to fire the engines to capture mars orbit
just then a computer screen flickers freezes
phil punches keys with his good hand
what he sees shocks him
its already starting
the primary l hub has been smashed
the systems are crashing
woody looks back at his crew struggling to project more calm than he really feels
everybody switch to suit oxygen
we beat this in the simulator we can do it here
jim youve got the ship
im going eva
they stare at him stunned by their immense task
cmon people lets go
lets work the problem
terri now helmeted is putting woodys helmet on him but somethings in the way chafing his neck
he reaches into his suit pulls out
from around his neck with his little flash gordon rocketship dangling
as they share a brief loving glance but theres no time for words
she tightens his helmet ring and he brushes his gloved fingertips on her faceplate
then he hurries towards the inner hatch door where mcconnell is throwing airlock switches
woody and mcconnell exchange a look
at the eva computer panel phil is shutting down non essential power drains trying to get the main computer system back on line
his wounded hand makes this difficult and painful
jesus its still bleeding
keep the pressure on
eighty percent atmosphere
the outer airlock door is now open revealing stars as woody drifts through it into space
hes now wearing the mmu an oversized jet pack like the ones used by the shuttle astronauts
with its shattered faceplate now useless drifts past terri as she is wrapping med tape around gauze pads on phils glove
floats up to them checking on phils work at the computer
jim youve gotta get your spare helmet from storage
phil can you keep the nav computers on line
i cant get this damn machine to re initialize
and the automated systems just went down
we cant shut down the hab rotation from here
ill do it from below
were losing pressure
you could embolize
seventy percent atmosphere
mcconnell looks at her knows shes right
but he starts off anyway
phil reaches out his good hand
jim ive got an idea
if you guys can save enough atmosphere ill disconnect the power in the main computer bay then jump start the systems
ill do a hard boot
this is a radical incredibly risky notion
mcconnell stares hard at phil
so does terri
has that ever been tested
are you kidding
these machines are much too valuable
mcconnell looks from terri to phil
its life and death
then he turns and the camera follows mcconnell as he pushes away from the console and dives down into the core tunnel heading towards the sequence omitted from original script
where he emerges from the core into the rotating hab deck and pushes himself down a ladder toward the floor
he accelerates as he gets closer to the floor then rights himself with a twist and lands on his feet now in gravity
woody in the mmu is hovering over the lower segment of the hab hull and right away we see his problem
he cant reach the damaged spot because its spinning past him spewing vapor
over radio jim how we doin on the ag
mcconnell runs to a computer terminal and starts clicking with the mouse
just one goddamn second
come on cmon
voice print identification
a beat accepted
shutting down artificial gravitational rotation
mcconnell hears a sound up at the core tunnel
he turns its terri
she holds an small cannister marked with a red cross
mcconnell grabs onto a counter edge as
attitude control thrusters on the hull begin firing in pulses
the rotation of the lower hab deck immediately starts to slow down
the great red ball of mars drifts by
terri lurching grabs a ladder strut and watches from the tunnel as
is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters
the rotation slows until the hab is still
he and terri can hear the terrifying sound of air whistling out into space through the breach hole
sixty per cent atmosphere
get some light on the hole so i can locate it
ive got a better idea
shouts to terri stay there
he starts rooting through phils storage area bags of m ms comic books looking for what he needs
phil is now strapped into the pilots seat
hes scared sweating hard but concentrating fiercely as his one good hand works a battery powered screwdriver
hes removing the panel of the main computer bay
over the intercom he can hear the merciless struggle going on elsewhere
im topside jim do you know which sector
im workin on it
the lower hab deck is no longer revolving
woody pops his thrusters and drifts over the metallic skin
but theres such a vast area to search
jesus uh ok this is gonna be like searching for a needle in a haystack
mcconnell locates a can of dr
pepper shakes this violently then tosses it up to terri whos still in the tunnel mouth
she catches the drifting can confused
when mcconnell speaks again hes gasping for air
shake out the liquid
jim i dont shake it out near the hull
terri shakes out soda from the open can
she and mcconnell watch the brown stream of fluid swirl up into the air caught by escaping oxygen
it rises towards the ceiling of the outer hull like a miniature tornado
sequence omitted from original script
woody still drifts over the hull searching intently as his frustration builds
cmon cmon where are you
fifty per cent atmosphere
terri staring at the ceiling sees something remarkable
swirling ever tighter has formed a whirlpool thats now being sucked out through the breach hole in the hull
she can now see the ugly puncture for the first time
gasping woody the breech is in sector four
sector four copy that
copy i heading there now
terri turns excited by mcconnells triumph shes just in time to see him collapse to the floor below her as he starts to lose consciousness
hes deathly pale
woody spots a tiny geyser of brownish ice crystals spouting out of the hull of the lower hab
its some distance away from him but clearly visible
to himself marveling sonofabitch
you never did that in the simulator
terri pushes off from the ladder drifting weightlessly down to mcconnell
she opens the valve of the oxygen cannister pushing the plastic mask over mcconnells face
he sucks in air color returning to his skin as he revives
an incredible tangle of tubes wires chips as phils gloved fingers both hands now probe desperately through them
where are you you little bastard where are you
as he moves his hands and forearms deep inside the computer bay
around him several of the smaller screens and gauges are starting to malfunction the data streams breaking apart streaking into electronic snow
he shoots a tense glance at which is flickering crazily
it shows the ship moving much closer to its critical moi point indicated by a flashing red triangle aimed down at the martian surface
forty percent atmosphere
woody popping his thrusters moves as fast as he can towards the protruding finger of crystal but hes not there yet
all of a sudden woodys thrusters cut out
the ship is moving by a meter beneath him
woody punches his arm controls
then just as the outer edge of the hab starts to pass him the thrusters kick back in
woody grabs the edge starts to move to the hole
woody lets out a breath
to himself whoa
mcconnell holding his breath grabs a patch gun from a storage locker
terris still got the cannister
he nods to her and together they push off from the floor leaping weightlessly up to the other side of the hab the ceiling
they reach the gaping puncture which they now see has been only partially dammed by the soda ice
as phils gloved fingers finally locate the plug hes been searching for
and grip it firmly
says a silent prayer
then he yanks the plug
shrill whines electronic crackles from all around him as the systems are abruptly shut down in a way they were never meant to be mishandled
terrifyingly a couple of the monitors arc to each other as they die
dodging sparks phil stares at as it also flickers and dies
now theyre flying blind
thirty percent atmosphere
woody arrives at the ice finger knocks away the big crystal then pulls his patch equipment from a pouch
in the hab terri uses the base of the cannister to smash away the interior ice chunk then mcconnell whos getting wobbly again blasts the hole with the epoxy gun
as he works terri gives him another hit of air
twenty percent atmosphere
the lights flicker out in the hab
outside woody slaps a big square patch over the hole rips off the backing
as it changes color and shrinks drawing itself down into the metal of the hull
as phils fingers re connect the same plug
from inside the computer bay
hes trembling sweat streaked inside his faceplate
blood has soaked through his gauze pads
his good hand hovers over the red main power switch
the moment of truth
with a dramatic click he throws the switch hard booting the computer system back on
he stares at the screens
frightened furious phil bangs on the switch with his cordless screwdriver
when all else fails hit something
feeble starlight from the viewports
mcconnell and terri drifting side by side stare at one another expecting to die within seconds
it feels like an agonizing eternity
twenty percent atmosphere
mcconnells eyes widen as he realizes this is the same as the last reading
atmosphere level increasing
terri and mcconnell look at each other
tears of relief in her eyes
he is exhausted nearly spent but manages a grin
she holds the mask up to his face and as he grips it breathing deeply they hug one another
the lights and computer screens are flickering back on
all of them
the cockpit lights up like a christmas tree
phil bounces up and down like a madman babbling in triumph
had it all the way
forgetting his injury he pounds his gloved fist on the console in triumph
he wrings his injured hand then his gaze is caught by which pops back on showing the ship and the moi point coming perilously close together
as he keys his mike urgently
get back in here guys
woody floats above the repaired hole scanning the nearby surface of the hull
jim theres a lot of scarring
id better check for other punctures while im out here
woody get back inside
weve gotta start the checklist for orbital insertion
a beat reluctantly copy im heading there now
woody jets back towards the open eva hatch
but as he reaches this about to re enter the ship hes captured momentarily by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him
as the huge planet is revealed in all its red unearthly glory
its so close now that individual features can be seen with the naked eye the vast chasm of valles marineris and then olympus mons poking all the way up through
the martian atmosphere
a stunning alluring spectacle
stares down at mars enthralled as sunlight floods the side of the spaceship sparkles off his visor
dawn after a very long night indeed
he whispers lovingly under his breath
then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through the eva hatch
camera drifts quickly back and down along the hull as stark sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks three in a row and the thick silver tubes that join them
theres a good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower
then as the ship begins to move out of frame
on one of these tubes a feeder line to the engine bells we see a scatter of tiny undetected holes about the size of the eraser at the end of
so small so apparently harmless
sequence omitted from original script
as woody enters stripped from the mmu dripping with sweat mcconnell is waiting for him
for a moment the two men just look at each other then they surge forward into a fierce hug
whispers know what
youve got enough left
mcconnell looks at him understands
terri sits nearby where she has just finished stitching up phils hand
as woody goes to her she rises from her seat and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes
piece of cake
easier than the cha cha
he scoops her into his arms they kiss passionately
phil is blinking something seems to be getting into his own eyes
his voice catches for a moment
i dont know what youre getting so cocky about
we scored better times in the sim at least twice
grins hows his hand
terri separates from woody looks down at phil
couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile
try to close your fingers phil nice and slowly
phil starts curling up his fingers
the middle digit remains extended in the universal gesture
they all consider this for a moment
then phil looks up cheerfully
well at least ill still be able to drive
after a split second they get it and the whole crew roars with laughter which builds and builds theyre almost giddy with the relief of the tension
sails into view with small attitude thrusters firing as the great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital capture burn
mars looks very large blood red
the entire spectacle is majestic awe inspiring
ok were ready to light this candle
go no go for braking burn and moi
all four astronauts are strapped in fully suited and helmeted
mars looms through the cockpit windows
the atmosphere is electric with excitement
we are go for the burn
im fueling the engines
he flips three switches in rapid sequence and
as we move in on the damaged fuel line we see a tiny but steady spray of fuel venting from the hole caused by the meterorite
this freezes into eerie streamers and chunks which slowly drift away from the ship
theyre quite beautiful
optimum angle of entry minus seven degrees
woody looks at the others for moment everyone is set looking good then reaches for a last switch
woody hesitates then glances at mcconnell
mcconnell moved by this honor nods
he reaches out to throw the switch himself
lets go to mars
as the countdown indicator reaches
a final signal pings and he flips the switch
in total silence the engines ignite
the second they do the streamers of frozen fuel explode in a white flash
with alarms sounding the four astronauts are slammed violently forward against their restraints
what the shut down engines
he and woody both reach out straining against the incredible g forces and manage to grab a red emergency lever yanking it down hard
in slow motion we see a terrifyingly violent chain reaction
the fuel tanks themselves explode one after another
the supporting metal struts are vaporized
the solar panels are snapped off
two of the huge engine bells are smashed sideways out of alignment while the third trailing pieces of the cowling goes hurtling off past camera like a flaming cannon ball
the entire aft section of the ship including much of the lower hab instantly becomes a shredded charred tangle of metal and even worse the explosion causes whats left of
the ship mainly the eva chamber and cockpit to tumble end over end cartwheeling down towards mars
in the windows mars goes crazily in and out of view
the astronauts flung this way then that are all fighting against unconsciousness
ive got no attitude control
blow the bolts
the cm doesnt have enough thrust to correct this rotation
were too steep
falling into the atmosphere
from further away the charred remainder of the ship can be seen spinning down towards mars which now fills the screen looming as large as earth when seen from the
the ships motion is mercifully slowing as it hits the outer atmosphere but just as clearly this steep unplanned angle of entry dooms it
christ at this angle well burn up
their angle of entry is shown much too direct with an indicated swerve into blinking red disaster
warnings flash how much timeve we got
i dont know
i dont know
mcconnells mind is racing furiously desperately
wheres the remo
the resupply module
thats not where is it
phil punches buttons
on the screen a second ellipse appears a blinking orange dot labelled remo
it appears to be soon intersecting with their own trajectory
uh its close
damn it how close
shaken i i dont know
itll take time
we dont have time
figure it out
phil frantically types in commands on the computer
jim were dead stick theres no way to maneuver this ship into a link up
not the ship
we have to go they look at him stunned
leave the ship
you want us to transfer in suits
jesus jim if we dont make it if we miss the remo
theres no other choice
phil how close
one kilometer thats the best i can do
they stare at woody
we feel the full terrible weight of his responsibility
four lives hang on his call
prepare to abandon ship
sequence omitted from original script
the astronauts are outside the ship tethered to each other with long shock cords
other cords clipped to their suits trail gear bags
phil clutches a silver metallic case his precious computer repair kit
woody is in the mmu
theyre all rotating at the same speed as the ship behind them
on my mark seven percent left thruster
three two one fire
all four astronauts fire a brief simultaneous burst from the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits
this stops their rotation bringing their travel under control
the ship continues spinning in the background
woody takes a final look at the charred doomed mars recovery
the only home theyve known for six months
he exchanges a silent glance with the others
they all expect to be dead in the next few minutes
woody takes a breath nods
he pops the big thrusters on the mmu and starts heading away from the ship
the cord between woody and the others pulls taut and they start to follow
of woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship against the magnificent backdrop of the blood red planet below
four tiny figures all alone in space
as phil looks back his eyes searching the stars
whatre you looking for
softly sadly earth
when we get back
we really will have to try this in the sim
he tries to smile
so does she
how we doin on fuel woody
woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm
im at fifty percent
looking down but i dont see the remo
everyone is looking back at the curve of mars against black space expecting to see the remo coming up behind them
happens to glance directly below
there she is
the black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of mars
shes not where i thought shed be
were going to miss her
looks again at his display screen frustrated
what do you think
we cant catch it
not like this
thinking quickly use the tether
from a compartment on the side of the mmu woody pulls out
about the size of a large flare gun
theres a carabiner like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun
well only have one maybe two shots before shes out of reach
itll be better if i leave you the gun while i run out to the remo
ive got enough fuel left for that
youll be going too fast
ill aim to overshoot then brake like hell arc it in
mcconnell looks at him
they both know how risky this is and they also know its their only chance
woody flips a switch on the gun and pulls on the hook
off it comes trailing wire
woody clips the hook to the mmu then hands mcconnell the gun
seeya in a few
woody and terri exchange a look tender loving then woody turns around and fires the mmu jets at full throttle
as woody pulls away line unspools from the tether gun
woody is chasing the remo from above
its as if he were in an airplane trying to land on a car racing along a freeway
woody is picking up speed quickly
maybe too quickly
he checks his armpad display screen
im on path to overshoot
im gonna take the edge off
woody starts braking with the mmu thrusters as hard as he can
glowing with orange flame
they suddenly cut off
he checks his display
coming in hot
beat abandoning the unit
ill brake with suit jets
woody hits some buttons and the mmus latches snap open
he grabs the hook connected to the tether line then pushes himself free of the mmu starts firing his small suit jets
hes still going very quickly
floating close together
the tether line is still unspooling from the gun
they watch woody below and ahead of them as he races towards the remo
terris heart is in her throat
mcconnell reaches a glove out touching her arm
still speeding towards the remo
his suit jets cut out
suit jets gone
but im gonna make contact
stare at woodys distant figure
at what velocity
impacts gonna be a little rough
at what velocity
beat thirty two
a look between mcconnell and terri her face is stricken
im gonna use the gun to slow you
you slow me and ill fall short
its too fast woody
ill be okay
here we go
woodys coming down on the module at over thirty kilometers an hour
he holds the hook out in front of him with one hand while grabbing the tether line with the other and wham
he crashes into the remo
slams the hook against a receiver on the hull of the remo
tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is too much
are ripped from the line
slides over the hull of the remo
grasp in vain for something to grab onto
they drag and bump and then finally his fingers close on
is past the remo freefalling toward mars
as terri screams
mcconnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel them quickly in towards the remo
tries his suit jets again theyre empty
falling away from the remo
are being reeled towards the remo by the tether line
another couple hundred meters to go
woody whats your status
after a beat uh well no suit jets and im still carrying a good deal of velocity
as soon as we get hooked up ill come get you
after a beat uh id have to say negative on that jim
negative on the transmission
no i heard you
negative on the maneuver
i am not retrievable
mcconnell and terri share a quick anguished look
woody thats not possible
youre not going that fast
it comes down to the amount of fuel honey
the suit jets were designed for attitude control not travel
retrieval just wont work
it has to work
hey believe me i dont like it any more than you do
woody run the numbers jim
mcconnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display pad
terri is staring at him
when mcconnells eyes meet hers they are red rimmed
woody you hang tight
well get into the remo fire her up drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you up
sounds good jim
its gonna take half an hour to get the remo reoriented
hell be in the atmosphere by then
then well have to get her moving faster
we dont have time
you listen to jim honey
its a good plan
we are going to oh jesus look
mcconnell and terri look
is now several kilometers below and behind them
its glowing red
then it erupts into a giant fireball devoured by friction with mars atmosphere
are all staring at this awed when mcconnell happens to look up again
he sees something alarming
they are drifting quickly into the remo
fire their suit jets slowing themselves down
they bang into the remo at about one tenth the speed woody did
they find handholds and grab on
mcconnell hits a button on the tether gun
releases from the remos hull
mcconnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun
phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the remos outer airlock door
okay lets get inside
phil start dumping the cargo or there wont be room for us
but we need those supplies for dump the cargo
hang on woody
is looking back at the remo
smiles with relief to see that terri has reached it safely
will do jim
he turns to look at
right below him filling his field of view
a long beat
softly hey beautiful
terri makes a snap decision
she grabs the tether gun from mcconnells surprised hands then pushes off from the remo
mcconnell lunges after her his gloved hand straining
but its too late
shes already out of reach and now fires her suit jets pulling quickly away from the remo
is reaching to activate his own jets when grabs at his wrist restraining this suicidal courage
they stare at each other
mcconnell wrenches his hand free half maddened agonized staring after terri
goddammit terri it wont work
but terri keeps on going
looks back at the remo as he continues to fall towards mars
sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him
terri what are you doing
ill tell you what im not doing woody
im not going to watch you die
terri youd do the same for me
phil is watching as terri drops towards the distant twinkle of woodys suit lights
the airlock door hangs open
phil looks at mcconnell anguished
dump the cargo then start the systems
phil hesitates now
as woody keys his mike
tries to steady his voice
i wouldnt come for you
not if it just wasnt possible
i can do it
no terri you cant
you dont have enough fuel to get me stop us both and get us back
hell you come any farther and you wont have enough to get back yourself
no response from terri
listen to me goddammit
you have to stop
you have to stop now
hes right terri
its no use
terri looks at her armpad display
as her fuel indicator drops from percent to to
releases her thumb from the toggle control
drifts staring towards woody
are on the same trajectory going the same speed and only about a hundred meters apart
but it might as well be infinity
you gotta go back now
the hell i do
terri raises up the tether gun and pulls the trigger
comes shooting out of the gun wire spooling out behind it
watches as it comes shooting down toward him
woody gets larger and larger the hook gets closer and closer and then snap
the hook stops
angle on the tether gun the wire has run all the way out
looks at the drifting hook ten agonizing meters away from him
his only life preserver
hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into the gun
what are you doing
im gonna jet a little closer and try again
terri you spend any fuel getting closer you wont get back and if anyone tries to get you theyll die too
no response from terri
is whipping back toward terri and the gun
woodys voice cracks hes very close to tears
honey please go back
go back and help everyone get down to the surface
the hook slams back against the muzzle of the gun
terri resets the gun quickly in an anguished fury
i am not losing you
i cant let you do it
looks at woody two hundred meters away sensing something different in his voice now a terrible resolve
raises his hands to his helmet ring
his eyes shining
i love you terri
god how i love you
he unscrews the ring pops the seal
the outrush of air pushes his helmet all the way off
woody shuts his eyes and opens his mouth
ice crystals bloom with woodys last breath
theres nothing to suck in
he doesnt fight it
he lets death come
tears streaming chest heaving frantic
woody oh woody please god no
hovers over her suit jet toggle control
mcconnells voice from the distance sounds very tired
like hes aged fifty years in the blink of an eye
come back terri
terris thumb is still poised
death would be better
outside the remo
the hatch is still open
we see phil inside staring out anxiously towards terri
quietly simply hes gone
he sees no movement from the distant small figure of terri
long beat we need you
pushes the toggle control
to one side not forward
inside her helmet is streaming with tears
she turns herself around reluctantly
heads slowly back towards the remo
on the big screen at mmcr a glowing green icon labelled mars recovery is shown in orbit as a stream of computer figures crawls beside it
beck stands by the new capcom as the latter repeats headset data
okay theyre go for the burn and moi
should be initiating the burn just about
suddenly the data stream goes crazy
it shivers streaks breaks up
the blinking green icon representing mars recovery glows brighter
a moment of stunned silence in the big room
then a rising babble of scared confused voices
takes a step forward staring helplessly at the screen
his face goes pale stricken
his worst nightmare is taking place right before his eyes and for the second mission in a row
the remo is now on the night side of mars
cargo boxes packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside
the hatch is sealed
mcconnell hovers by a bulkhead
hes anguished haunted by the image of woodys death
we see him struggling to overcome his grief and shock trying to force himself to concentrate on the critical tasks at hand
in front of him a panel has been opened hes facing already glowing surrounded by coded switches indicator lights com ports
stares at these thinking hard remembering
hes holding a palm sized computer already wired into this panel
he begins tapping the keys but then stops himself
he turns looking back at hunched on what would be the floor if the remo were on land
they grip stowage straps to keep from drifting
clearly this tiny rude cargo craft was never designed for manned operation
its claustrophobic bitterly cold
is a map of torment
he is shivering both from cold and fear barely holding himself together
he hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear
a thousand yard stare
shes in shock
knows he has to occupy them
no response hey phil
phil looks up at him dully
were going in blind
well deploy the chutes by laptop
i need to get on the data bus put in a software patch and try to soften this tin cans landing
i could use your help with the patch
after a moment phil releases his strap pushes towards mcconnell
he stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats then takes the little computer from mcconnell
he begins to tap the keys slowly at first but then with more confidence
turning to terri hey terri i was wondering
think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps
terri hesitates a moment then looks at the strap in her hand as if shes never seen it before
dully she reaches for another one begins looping them together
studies both of their faces intently
knows that he cant push them too hard too fast
theyre moving like robots but at least theyre moving
small thrusters are firing getting the remo into position for entry into the atmosphere
then all the jets fire in unison braking the remo as it falls away from us towards mars at night
the astronauts restrained on the floor by terris jury rigged strap system hold on for dear life
the buffeting through the atmosphere is shaking them violently
we see the effect of the incredible g forces faces distorted unable to focus their eyes
each of them thinking once again now im going to die
sequence omitted from original script
the mars one base camp looms in the foreground like some desolate otherwordly ghost town
and then in the night sky beyond it we see an eerie and beautiful sight a bright streak of red as the remo slashes down into the martian atmosphere like
a shooting star finally disappearing behind distant mountains
then all is stillness again deathly stillness and silence
beck stands by a viewport staring out into space
hes just lost four good friends and also knows he is seeing in this disaster the probable end of the mars program and the certain end of his own career
he doesnt at first even hear the nearby voice
weve got some new data just coming in
beck looks up his eyes red rimmed
the capcom shifts uneasily
hes holding a computer printout
we just it doesnt make any sense
were not sure how to read this
telemetry reports the remo has left its orbit and reached the martian surface
beck snatches the paper staring at it
for the first time we see some life coming back into him
sixty three minutes after mars recovery went off line
sir the graph reads like a controlled descent
but that doesnt make any beck suddenly understands
and its a joy to see his face the tears of happiness that spring into his eyes
they used the remo as a lander
the capcom stares back at him feeling the same surge of hope
its mcconnell its got to be
nobody else could have pulled this off
son of a bitch
sequence omitted from original script
as we see the mars one base camp silent very still
in the distance the massive erv still looms perched for takeoff the bottom rungs of its ladder buried
we see that sand has drifted high against the hab as well as the sides of the partially deflated tunnel and greenhouse and the four man rover
the oxygen still and propellant plant are almost buried
solar panels some of them punctured by micrometeors flap and creak eerily in the slight breeze
and finally we see the camps american flag still on its toppled pole but nearly obliterated by sand
who are spooked by this desolation
theyve paused at the edge of the camp
they have dragged along with them from their landing site a crude sledge improvised from the remos hatch cover and some cargo straps
on this their meager supplies
mcconnell glancing at the others knows hes got to keep their spirits up
he kneels digs out the flag pole
brushing off the sand he rights this and re plants it firmly in the ground packing the sand down with his boot
he stands for a moment looking at the flag his eyes moist
despite the cost they have made it to mars
when he turns terri and phil are looking at him moved
pause damn right
terri lets see if that oxygen still is operational
phil you better check out the erv
ill take the hab
if you find lukes he catches himself
phil and terri look at him
just keep in touch
phil steps from the umber sand onto the ervs ladder begins to climb
the four man rover is nearby sand drifted high against its tires
terri kneels by the oxygen still begins to scoop away sand with her gloved hands
she still looks numb
on radio im at the main airlock door
he unlatches a panel grips the emergency lever inside tugs it
after a seeming eternity the door groans and creaks open
little puffs of dust and sand swirl about settle
perched atop the ervs ladder phil using a battery powered drill is just removing the final screw from the hatch cover
he lifts off the heavy cover lets it tumble to the sand
ive got erv access
im going in
terri you okay
terri is still scooping sand
shes just cleared the first row of gauges
this is gonna take awhile to get back to capacity
mcconnell walks through the kitchen which we recognize
he pauses to look at the table from which luke and his crew taped their final fateful message
still sits there eerily with its stub of burned out candle
half finished frozen cups of coffee
suddenly out of the corner of his eye he catches a flash of white
he spins startled and sees in his white pressure suit staring back at him from the screen of a video monitor
above this is perched the camera the mars one astronauts used for their comm packets
this place is filled with ghosts
phil in the pilots seat of the erv pushes a computers power button
the screen flickers weakly to life startling him a bit but all he sees on it are white streaks crazy static
erv appears structurally intact
computers are fried just as we thought
terri has cleared more gauges valves
she sits back on her heels studying the tangle of pipes
ive got busted filters here clogged intakes
helluva cleanup job but so far no major damage
on a fantastic almost jungle like atmosphere
the plants have been allowed encouraged
to grow wildly
some are even pushing against the inflated roof
water condenses on the leaves and the roof then is captured and routed through pipes of every shape and size dripping into a clever assortment of collection jars
reaches into a bucket touches the water
his glove comes up before his wondering eyes dripping
grasping the implication he looks down at his forearm instrument pad
blinking red letters read deg
and something else the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate revealing his arms shape
theres air pressure in here
punches in more numbers and gets the readout nitr
c trace gasses
slowly reaches up unsealing the neck ring of his helmet
he hesitates then lifts it off
takes a deep quenching lungful of pure air
holds it in
lets it slowly out
for a moment he doesnt trust his own voice
then speaks softly towards his helmet
im in the greenhouse
you better come see this for yourselves
phil still sitting at the cockpit controls turns
through a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse
what is it
theres no answer
terri rises concerned and turns
through the distant translucent wall of the greenhouse mcconnells shadowy figure can be seen moving slowly
mcconnell sets down his helmet starts exploring pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle
the dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path
everywhere he looks he has the sense of a scrounged together recycled jury rigged environment where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play
he pauses looking up
overhead a bellows stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp slowly inhales and exhales pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the hab
its power comes from a crude water wheel a buckets and strut assemblage tidily sutured with duct tape like some giant erector set
as mcconnell turns away from this still marvelling a ragged figure leaps through the foliage
it smashes into him with a harsh screech knocking him to the ground
mcconnell on his back straddled by his attacker fights back as best he can
a blur of flailing arms and fists as he tries to push the creature away
staring up he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks
his skin is creased weathered above a scraggly beard
his clothes are tattered patched together
in one fist he grips a rock hammer which he swings high overhead about to drive the claw through mcconnells skull
mcconnell grabs his arm desperately trying to fend him off
luke its me
we see a flash of uncertainty in lukes eyes
then he yanks his arm free and his hammer arcs up even higher trembles in the air
youre not here
luke its jim
no no youre not
you cant be here
your wife is debra
your son is bobby
you were reading treasure island with him
as he stares down at mcconnell lukes eyes finally light up with recognition
but before he can move he is seized from behind and flung backwards to the ground the hammer ripped from his grasp as terri and phil pinion his arms
mcconnell scrambles to his feet
dont hurt him
mcconnell kneels beside luke signalling to terri and phil that its okay to let him go
they stand back pulling off their helmets
everyone is panting out of breath
luke sits up slowly studying their features one after another as if still not quite certain whether they might vanish
his voice is hoarse rusty from disuse
luke looks with incomprehension at mcconnell
i dont understand
youre not supposed to be here
why are you here
he didnt make it luke
luke stares at mcconnell trying to absorb everything
he looks to terri who looks down
luke shakes his head in dismay
he seems to shrink in on himself
its all too much for him to take in
mcconnell kneels and puts his arm around luke comforting him
sequence omitted from original script
luke sits on the side of his cot in the little tented sleeping area hes created in one corner of the greenhouse
nearby his hotplate pots and some freshly harvested vegetables and greens
the others crouch around him
luke what happened here
a flash of fear in lukes eyes
whispers we fired the radar
they all died
they all died but i was spared
had to be for a reason
then all of a sudden i knew why i was spared
his voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper
so somebody would be left to figure out the secret
he taps his forehead significantly then nods once or twice
the others exchange an uneasy glance
luke we still dont understand
he rises quickly and scuttles off waving an impatient hand without waiting to see if theyll follow
mcconnell terri and phil stare after him for a long moment
phil breaks the silence
is it just me
or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic
long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain
he could be suffering from a form of asphyxia
or maybe his whole crew died and hes been marooned alone on mars
lets give him time to adjust
mcconnell and terri follow in the direction luke went
phil trailing mutters to himself
luke now in a patched up pressure suit and grubby looking helmet stands peering down unhappily at the improvised sledge with its meager supplies
mcconnell terri and phil walk up behind him wearing their helmets again
they hear luke over his radio
let me be sure i understand this
your ship blew up with all its supplies
then you emptied the cargo out of the remo and it was totalled on landing
youve got no food no water no spare oxygen nothing but what i see here
mcconnell and the others are silent embarrassed
then mcconnell nods
luke looks at him a cracked grin
what kinda rescue mission is this
he points to the computer repair case as phil lifts it off a sledge
luke turns looks at the case then phil
check it out
new nav boards for the erv
i got four round trip tickets baby right in here
in some mysterious way this reminder of woodys death seems to bring him fully back into himself
he takes terri by the shoulders deeply saddened
she meets his gaze
im so sorry
he was a good man
when theres time well talk
she nods grateful
he looks at the others
he starts off across the sand and they follow
they stand looking down at the three long mounds of dirt as luke completes his account of the disaster
when i came to and dug myself out of the sand my faceplate was cracked
i barely made it back to base
it was weeks before i could work up the nerve to go back out there and look for their
he has to pause collect himself
renee was the only one i could find
but it didnt seem right somehow to dig just one grave
there is an emotional silence
luke turns takes a few steps
he stares into the distance observing the swirling dust around them
mcconnell hesitates notices lukes gaze
has it been blowing like this for a while
luke nods we saw a big storm from space
but micker said it was turning south
luke looks off into the distance studies something only he seems to see
if it holds course
mcconnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon looks at luke
this whatever it was this force
you say it came directly out of the top of the mountain
you dont believe me
but im not crazy jim
mcconnell isnt quite sure how to reply to this
what did you mean by its secret
pause you better see for yourselves
sequence omitted from original script
mcconnell terri and phil follow luke into the science lab area of the hab then stop in their tracks
their helmets are off
its very cold in here their breath is frosty
the lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations all tagged and labelled
there are drawings and diagrams covering the walls martian landscapes annotated maps and over and over obsessively repeated drawings of the vortex that destroyed the mars one crew
see where they made their mistake was they mustve planned for it to be visible from earth
the others turn looking at him
luke is aiming an electric space heater at his computer
as the coils glow red he rubs his hands together poised over the keyboard
luke reacts to their blank stares
he has a kind of jittery feverish intensity a secret excitement
dont you understand
hundreds of millions of years have gone by
youve got erosion sand storms lava flows meteor impacts hell in that much time the whole surface wouldve changed
so no wonder we never saw it before
well i mean we saw it but not like they meant us too
too much dirt on it
the others exchange worried glances
is he totally nuts
on the computer screen theyre looking at
pictures of the face after the disaster seen from ground level in telephoto views
rising out of a ring of rock and dirt rubble is the shiny white profile of a gigantic face
the white is smooth impenetrable
it has the scale of a mountain but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural
they are stunned
can hardly believe their eyes
what is that
i dont know
but whatever it is somebody built it
and not us
a few moments of silence while they try to absorb this
what about the sound
that signal you heard before the explosion
good jim good
thats the key
a click of the mouse and they all hear over speakers the hear the pauses
thats what made me realize its a pattern a repeating pattern
luke is trembling with excitement
his words tumble out very quickly
hes been waiting so long to share this
thats what i thought
there are distinct blocks in the pattern and within each block the tones come in groups of three
for months i struggled to analyze it trying different constructs
then i thought about dimensions
x y z coordinates
three groups equals three dimensions
so i tried assigning different graphic values to each block group and tone
and finally i got
he types another command
they all look at the monitor the glow reflecting on their faces
they are amazed again
where we see the beautiful interlocking chain the universally familiar double helix of a dna molecule the elegant blueprint of life
is that what i think it is
thats a model of dna
you see it too
i was afraid i was just suffering from a form of asphyxia
she glances at him surprised that he overheard her earlier diagnosis
but he smiles not offended
so okay so somebody left this thing here somebody other than human
but what the hell is it
my guess is its a signature
a self portrait of whatever species created the face
but that dna looks human
its missing the last pair of chromosomes
yeah but its close
the difference between a man and an ape is less than three percent of genetic material
but that three percent gives you mozart
or jack the ripper
they look at him
then all four turn stare again at the slowly rotating dna pondering its awesome mystery
when he finally speaks never takes his eyes off the screen
we can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery has on his imagination
its been a long day
lets get a couple hours sleep then tackle this thing when were fresher
phil your first priority will be to get the motherboards over to the erv
concentrate on getting communications up first
phil nods soon as weve got the juice well send a packet to micker tell them lukes ok and that
everything else thats happened
the rest of us will take an inventory of supplies see where we stand
the others nod in weary agreement
as they start out towards the relative warmth of the greenhouse terri looks at luke at his scraggly beard and his long lank hair
she smiles brushing some locks off his forehead
theres a pair of scissors in my medkit
sequence omitted from original script
as in the science area this space has enough thin oxygen for the astronauts to remain unhelmeted
mcconnell and luke are still going through what few supplies were salvaged from the remo
luke pauses rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek
his beard is gone his hair neatly trimmed
mcconnell enjoys lukes own wonder at his transformation
how do you feel
like i just got back my other three percent
terri enters through the hatch removing her helmet
the backup generator is salvageable and two of the solar panels
im pretty sure i can get the oxygen still back into production too
so were not in such bad shape considering
good work terri
mcconnell rummaging through phils backpack drops an already opened bag of m ms
the candies scatter and bounce all over the floor
look at that
phils idea of absolute essentials
luke and terri smile
mcconnell scoops up the fallen m ms
he slows down as he does it looking at the scatter of little round candies
something tugging at the back of his mind
sequence omitted from original script
phils intricately designed m m model of his ideal woman floating weightlessly as mcconnell drifts past it plucking away a couple pieces of the candy
phil reacting in good natured annoyance
the gap in the design left by mcconnells theft
as he trembles with excitement
with sudden comprehension
its not a signature
that noise from the face
its not a signature
its a test
luke and terri stare at him
mcconnell sits in front of the computer back in the science lab area staring once again at the mysterious dna model
luke and terri stand behind him
mcconnells energy his new certainty is almost electrifying
its asking us for the right answer
it wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes
to prove that were human
terri and luke look at each other starting to understand
we fired radar into that thing
concentrated sound waves
which it interpreted as a wrong answer
its like a a security alarm
when it gets an incorrect response it defends itself
phil is listening in on radio
hes got panels open wires dangling as he works his ongoing repair
he keys his mike uneasily
so what happens when it gets the right answer
as mcconnell looks at luke and terri
hesitates i dont know
but weve got to find out
to luke pointing can you work this the other way
figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes
then dub them into your recording of the signal
i think so yes
what about the radar gun
will it accept that input
can we transmit a completed signal back to the face
luke stares at him startled by what hes implying
phil is also growing increasingly nervous
whoa whoa hold on jim
what if youre wrong
whoever goes out there
i mean what if youre wrong
three people have already died over that thing
as luke and terri look tensely at mcconnell
mcconnell looks at her
terri if we leave here without getting some answers they all died in vain
terri shakes her head
we just dont know enough about that that thing out there to take any more chances
what are we here for if not to take chances
his passion startles them theyve never seen him so emotional
he points at the computer screen
this means were not alone
it means were on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankinds history
but weve still got to prove it
who knows when someone else will get back here
or if they ever will
you know what congress is like
theyll say its too dangerous too much loss of life lets go back to unmanned flights
we could be the last explorers to come here for decades
were it guys
pause were it
quietly we dont have to go out there
theres a better way
they look at him surprised
sequence omitted from original script
the familiar plucky little figure of ares wheels across ocher sand with the radar gun jury rigged onto its back
ares video snout whirrs out extending
the familiar bass rumble of the face is very loud from here
checking video feed
mcconnell terri and phil have gathered around luke as he pushes buttons and a monitor crackles to life
white streaks then a blurry image which he tries to enhance
finally the image starts to sharpen
they see the familiar stark white profile of the face shot from ground level in a slowly approaching angle
stare at the ominous sight
theyre all more nervous than they want to show
lukes fingers delicately work a joystick as he maneuvers the remote surveyor
how close do we need to get
im not sure
maybe we better stop by that boulder
ares whines to a stop by a large boulder which partially shields it from the face looming beyond
the radar gun swivels locating its target
then stops ready to fire
luke looks at terri phil and mcconnell
phil shuts the lid of the box holding the new nav boards snaps it protectively down
terri takes a deep breath then she nods
lukes hand hovers over the red firing button a moment of awesome uncertainty and danger
he looks at mcconnell who finally gives a nod of command
then luke hits the button
from the radar gun on ares s back a sharp high pitched electronic burst is emitted pulsating like a tuning fork as its fired towards the face
after a few seconds it stops
for a moment nothing happens
then the deep bass rumbling stops as well
the only remaining sound is of wind stirring up dust on the martian plains
as suddenly a huge curved segment of the white surface begins to rise from the earth like a gigantic hangar door sliding out of sight into an upper sheath of
the movement is measured stately utterly silent
as the segment rises it reveals a blinding white light the interior of the face
no inside details can be seen
mcconnell luke terri and phil stare at this phenomenon awed
theyre barely breathing
oh my god
check for radiation
luke punches buttons waits anxiously for a readout
no sign of the vortex
i dont know what we did but guys does that look to you like a hostile gesture
more like an invitation
or another test
mcconnell is staring at the mysterious opening
on his face a growing look of determination
luke the four man rover
does it still work
the others look at him their expressions changing as they realize what hes implying
sequence omitted from original script
mcconnell once again helmeted emerges from the hab airlock
luke terri and phil are coming out behind him
the wind has picked up and fine dust is blowing
they stop staring off in astonishment towards the entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into purplish black at the horizon with bloody streaks above
the dust storm has turned their way its now sixty kilometers away and closing
the main body of it reaches two thousand meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand kilometer front
stare at this unholy juggernaut alarmed
mcconnell turns to luke whose expression is grim
how long before it hits
a storm like that
it could go planetary
and last a year
mcconnell stares at him
itll sock us in jim
we wont be able to take off
if that happens with what few supplies weve got left
well starve to death
mcconnell turns staring off towards the killer storm
the others look at him with questioning gazes
he turns again
theres the four man rover ready to go
phil how much longer to prep the maybe forty five minutes
itll be tight but we can make it
then theres still time for us to get out there and back
he looks a question at luke and terri one after the other
their eyes tense but excited signal agreement
continue the repair
if something goes wrong you get out of here before that storm hits
if were not back in forty five minutes i want you to prep and launch
looks at his armpad display thats hours
jim its not a suggestion its an order
reluctantly i understand
but you understand what
if youre not back by i prep and launch
mcconnell nods satisfied
looks at terri and luke
they start towards the four man rover
dust is swirling more thickly through the air and the wind is louder now
phil stands watching them go a lone rather forlorn figure
in a wide shot we see the rover approaching the face across the plains
the sky beyond the face is almost black as the storm approaches from that direction
its marching relentlessly across the planet with flashes of lightning now rippling up and down its face and even small tornadoes spinning off near its purple black base
phil has panels off
hes reaching into the guts of the main computer working feverishly
his repair kit is beside him
in a high shot we look down across the side of the face and its vast open doorway out of which the bright white light is streaming
into this corridor of light we see the rover arrive slewing to a stop throwing sand from its wheels
looking at the cavernous vertical gap in the side of the face
the opening towers to a dizzying height above us the white light strains our eyes
the three astronauts enter frame as we see them from behind staring up
as they are stunned by the immensity of the scene the cosmic mystery before them
luke and terri look at mcconnell
another moment of critical decision
he keys his mike
phil do you read me
phil keys his own mike
your signals breaking up a little in the storm but i read you
mcconnell stares into the bright opening
bathed in its light
were at the face
were gonna need a few minutes here
same deadline launch at
with or without us
do you copy
pause copy that
terri and luke exchange a tense glance
jim are you sure you want to do this
im not sure of anything anymore
but i didnt come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet
the three of them stare into the portal
mcconnell between the others reaches out and grips each of them by a gloved hand
they take a sort of collective breath
then they walk forward together into the light
the astronauts continue forward each of them extending a free hand
the light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances textures colors anything at all
they cant see walls ceiling even a floor
surface seems firm and level
texture is smooth
ive got good footing and no obstructions
lets check our behind them there is an abrupt whooosh like a giant airlock sealing shut
they turn startled and nervous
letting go of each others hands luke and terri run back the way they came but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some sort
the vast hangar type door has closed behind them
its solid again
keep this orientation
the three scared helmeted faces seem to float in the brightness some twenty feet apart
keys his mike phil
phil can you still hear me
phil saying a silent prayer reaches over and turns on the main computer
hes immensely relieved
computers are online
ready to load software
but guys were losing visibility here
he glances out the cockpit window at the blowing dust
then realizes that hes hearing only silence over his radio
is anyone there
phil stares at his radio in dread
dont leave me
mcconnell is staring at his spacesuits sleeve
he can see that the suit material is starting to deflate revealing the shape of his arm just as it did in lukes greenhouse
he hesitates then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his right glove
terri and luke see this
alarmed jim whatre you doing
i dont think so
mcconnell makes the final twist on his glove and theres the hiss of rushing air
jim seal it
that was air going into my suit not out
look at your own suits theyre not rigid anymore
weve got pressure in here
luke looks at his sleeve
above mars atmospheric
were millions of miles from earth and were inside a gigantic white face
terri types on her arm keypad
theres six psi in here
taps more keys nitrogen and oxygen
otherwise known as air
mcconnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring
luke follows suit
hey there may be some lethal trace gasses i havent picked up yet or
oh the hell with it
terri starts taking off her helmet
in a few moments all three helmets are off
they hold them glowing softly against their chests as they breathe deeply and gratefully
and then at this very moment as if they have just passed another kind of test
appears through the glare soaring up before their startled eyes
white metallic composed of complexly linked bands plates ramps
its part of a structure whose overall height and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose
but the hatch opening slowly in its side at the top of an approach ramp is unmistakable
radiant white light streams out from within forming a glowing tunnel down towards the astronauts
raising their gloves against the dazzling glow
at the end of this tunnel of light inside the hatch frame and slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form which we somehow sense is female
she appears benign wondrous
this glowing martian a holograph regards the astronauts for a few moments then beckons to them as if to say enter
all her motions are both calm and calming precise unhurried gracious
look at each other
theyre awed into silence and still tense but now more out of excitement and anticipation than fear
their eyes agree lets go
they walk forward slowly carrying their helmets up the ramp and into the tunnel of light following the martian who retreats before them
they go through the hatch and disappear inside
following the martian they find themselves in a round open space defined by light with a smooth matte metallic floor but without apparent walls
the martian stops turns facing them
the astronauts stop too uncertain what theyre meant to do
then the martian gestures again
a cylindrical holographic column appears rising from the floor in front of the astronauts
inside it a swirl of eerie lights millions of them like cosmic fireflies
set down their helmets then cautiously converge around this column forming a loose triangle
as they stare into it the myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their spacesuits
the whirling lights resolve into images which relate to them the story of ancient mars we do not recognize
all is peaceful beautiful
softly is that what i think it is
tumbles through space towards the planet
oh my god
as thousands of small rocketships lift away from the surface heading in a stream out of the solar system
and a wall of fire and debris scours the planet
oceans boil and vaporize
two gigantic hunks are blasted out of the planet spinning in flames
involuntarily flinch bathed in the fiery images
as dust storms roil across its cold lifeless surface
the flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons
stare at this devastation deeply moved
the stream of martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system
then we zero in on as it peels off and goes in another direction
graphics show a model of what the ship contains the familiar double helix of dna
the ship heads towards another blue planet in our solar system
as it was then
more clouds than now more ocean and the landforms all wedged together
her voice is soft
earth when it was still pangaea
before the continents separated
makes a fiery streak through earths atmosphere and plunges into the ocean
instantly the image of the dna double helix grows filling the entire holographic column then it begins to spin and pulse disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new images
cry out stunned by the strobelike power of the display as flash into the holographic column swimming growing crawling leaping flying one celled microscopic organisms plankton plants of all kinds
insects then fish dinosaurs birds small mammals larger mammals the entire stunning panorama of evolution distilled into a single explosive sequence as the images wash over the dazzled awestruck until finally the images whirl away the holographic column dissolves leaving only a circle of glowing concentric colored rings on the floor
the astronauts are left staring at each other across the open space where the column had been
now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their circle taking the fourth position
mcconnell is opposite her glowing form and terri and luke are at either side
the martian reaches her arms out inviting them to link hands
as they do so the martian seems to be staring directly into mcconnells eyes
is in wondrous awe his whole face radiant with joy
its the first time weve ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve
staring at the martian he understands
thats what she means
oh my god
the cambrian explosion
mcconnell and luke look at her
almost six hundred million years ago there was a sudden expansion of life on earth
the first multi celled plants and animals appeared
no one has ever understood why
they seeded earth
we hear a bell like tone a single lingering high note and simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor begins to glow brightly
it is an intense chromium yellow
step back startled unlinking their hands and look at the circle of colored rings
these shade from yellow on the outer rim to a deeper yellow then orange then finally reds
inside the final deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue about a meter across
small points of light glitter here like stars against a midnight sky
steps closer to mcconnell
she has picked him out in particular
now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings to stand on the indigo core
looks back at her nods his understanding
for the first time she seems to smile
then as abruptly as she first appeared she fades away
luke and terri look at mcconnell confused
there is a sudden static filled crackle from their helmets nearby on the floor
over radio in please
terri picks up her helmet leans into its mike
phil were here
we read you
even through the scratchy interference they can hear the relief in phils voice
and then the desperation
listen this storm is really loud static few more minutes i cant more static youve gotta get back to the ship
and then they hear only static
his signal is lost
suddenly the bell like tone repeats at a lower register with a more sustained note and simultaneously the last of the yellow circles of light begins to fade as begins
to glow brighter
mcconnell turns looking at this new color then looks back at luke and terri
we are in a ship
this is a ship
and the countdown has already started
terri looks at luke alarmed
then lets get the hell out of here
she scoops up lukes helmet tosses it to him
as he catches it shes already starting back out in the direction they came from and luke follows her
until they both become aware that mcconnell isnt with them
they turn back
hes still rooted to the spot his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings
mcconnell doesnt turn
jim we gotta go
im not coming with you
coming back she sees how calm he is
what are you talking about
weve got to get home
thats where im going
dont you see
thats what all this is for
mcconnell gestures at the ship around them you were right terri
this is an invitation
to follow them
to follow them home
he looks into their faces
terri is trying to grasp this idea still incredulous
luke has the beginning of a half smile
i have to go
this is the mission now
to find out who we are
isnt that why we came here
like maggie said to stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one
luke nods at the memory of maggies words
terri remembers too
mcconnells passionate conviction is affecting them both
you know when you think about it i wasnt even supposed to be here all the accidents everything that got us to this point its just
i just know its right
terri looks at luke
luke is smiling
i know what im doing
but youre running out of time
youve gotta get back to the erv and get off this planet
now please go
luke steps closer looking at his old friend
i once felt like i was taking your turn
but now i think maybe youre taking mine
guess im a little jealous
they clasp hands for a moment
but in this moment is a lifetime of camaraderie an eternity of farewell
thanks for saving my life
luke nods deeply moved
he turns away picking up his helmet as terri comes closer looking at mcconnell a long unspoken beat
her eyes are glistening
i wish woody were here to see this
he wouldve wanted to go too jim
she is starting on the road to recovery
shes going to be okay
hes here terri
we wouldnt have made it without him
she digs into one of her suits pockets pulls something out
she hands it to mcconnell and his fist closes around it
take care jim
terri smiles back at him
then she turns picks up her helmet and crosses to where luke has paused looking back
have a great ride
luke and terri exchange a final silent farewell with him then hurry away into the darkness
looks down at what terri gave him
with the little flash gordon rocketship
grips this tightly as he looks up
sequence omitted from original script
the hanger like hatch has reopened and luke and terri helmeted again emerge from the face
the leading edge of the dust storm is upon them
they cant see much more than a few meters
as they reach the rover they hear even in this chaos that the deep pulsing tone of the face has started again
they look at each other uncertain what this means
but mcconnell is now beyond their help
luke keys his mike
phil do you read
to terri hes not reading
i can barely read you
lets get the hell out of here
is anyone there
can anyone read me
phil gets no response
he is shaking almost crying
he hesitates then starts hitting some keys
which reads pre launch checklist
mcconnell has shed his backpack with its unneeded oxygen tank
he steps cautiously onto the colored rings
nothing seems to happen
moving further he takes his place on the indigo circle at their core
he looks at as it dips from orange into red the bell tones are continuous now very deep and rapid
the rover with luke and terri inside races away towards the safety of the erv as the maelstrom boils over the face behind them
the sky is purplish black thick with flying debris and eerie lightning flashes
towering billows of dust chase them over the plain nearly enveloping them as they speed towards us passing out of frame
mcconnell reacts surprised as suddenly begins to rise around him swiftly and smoothly coming up from the circumference of the indigo circle
then a second identical cylinder the top half drops down from somewhere overhead
the two sections meet and fuse in a flash of light containing mcconnell inside them as neatly as if he were in a giant transparent mailing tube
fights against a stab of claustrophobia
is he being imprisoned
or somehow protected
either way hes virtually immobilized
in this tight space in his bulky suit he cant even move his arms
only his head and neck can still shift
phil is going over his final pre launch checklist flipping switches and pressing buttons
he looks at his which reads
his finger hovers over a fire button
he licks his lips nervously squeezes his eyes shut and hits the button
and the words ignition sequence initiated mcconnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds him when something catches his attention
he arches his neck looking down
is beginning to fill the cylinder
it swirls in from some unknown source rising rapidly already his lower boots are covered
widen in alarm
he strains against the sides of the cylinder but slide helplessly across the smooth surface
looks down again
is up to his knees
now his thighs
cranes his neck staring up
can he wedge himself higher can he somehow climb to safety
the entire ceiling of the face is becoming translucent
he can see the dust storm boiling overhead
and now rising into this are fiery coils of energy from the face itself
these swirl and twist in every direction like angry water snakes battered by the fierce winds
two vast forces on a collision course
luke drives the rover through the blinding storm as terri stares at a dashboard computer screen
they have to shout to be heard over the roaring wind
ive lost the base camp beacon
luke looks over alarmed
as the needle spins freely giving no direction whatsoever
were driving blind
ill try to keep on a straight line
its our only chance
ive worked with phil for four years
i know jim gave him a direct order but he wont leave without us
the rover races towards us the front of the storm chasing it from behind then completely overtaking the rover
it disappears from view
phil sits in the pilots seat
he is looking at a computer graphic that shows the engines readying to launch
with resignation he keys his mike
this is erv do you read
erv to rover do you read
phil waits a second then reaches slowly for a blinking red switch that reads launch
he hesitates then actually has his fingers on it about to flip it when he hears a crackle of static on the radio
phil keys his mike
this is erv do you read
very faint save the fuel phil
were coming in
and phil chokes back a sob
blinking back the tears he tries to compose himself then keys his mike
uh phils not here right now
he left for earth five minutes ago
please leave your message at the beep
from ground level we see that the coils of energy are rising from the forehead of the face from its third eye spinning and looping faster and faster starting to
form a vortex
but unlike the wind vortex that killed the mars one crew this is a vortex of fire
as we watch more fiery streaks begin to emerge from the sides of the face from the chin cheeks and temples
these all rush upwards like lava flowing uphill gathering in intensity as they leap free of the face itself and spiral into the atmosphere
the peak of the forming vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds causing a dark counter swirl
phil stands at the bottom of the ervs ladder gripping it to steady himself staring into the swirling dust
the rover appears out of the dust and sand the immense storm seeming to chase it from behind
luke and terri climb out struggle towards him through the wind
phil grips their hands helping them over to the ladder
he looks back confused
he got another ride
phil stares at her bewildered
tell you on the way
sequence omitted from original script
looking down into the cylinder we see that the cobalt blue fluid has risen to mcconnells upper chest
now its at his shoulders
it pours into his suit through his neck ring
he strains on tiptoes craning his head back trying to keep his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid
he sucks in deep desperate gulps of air his head thrashing from side to side
then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth his nose his forehead
his whole body is submerged
the level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top of the cylinder
squeezes his eyes shut holding his breath
not so much fighting this anymore as simply floating in place waiting for his inevitable death
wideview from above as the energy vortex bends from side to side pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the face
as the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical shape we see through its center to a rising form the martian ship
it is a flattened convex circle whose matte metallic angles replicate the face imagery
as the face burns away around us the martian ship begins to rise and spin
sequence omitted from original script
the vortex is now a tight rapidly spinning cylinder
as it draws more and more power from the disintegrating face the martian ship in its center spins faster and faster
is spinning and shaking too more and more violently as the huge buildup of g forces tears at his body
were reminded of nick willis just before the vortex exploded him is the same thing about to happen to mcconnell
his eyes remain tightly shut bubbles are streaming from his lips
his last breath is nearly exhausted its being shaken from his lungs
sequence omitted from original script
as we move in closer on his face we suddenly see with him a series of rapid fire almost subliminal images from the past
we recognize each one
previously though we saw them as still photos now they have movement life and we view them from new and slightly different angles
these images intercut with glimpses of mcconnells pale shaking near death face in the present
sequence omitted from original script
under the christmas tree lifts his new model rocket from its box
he turns to us smiling joyfully
a blinding white flash and he disappears
sequence omitted from original script
is on her porch under a night sky bending down to the eyepiece of a telescope
she looks up at us with a shy proud smile
a blinding white flash and shes gone
sequence omitted from original script
in flight suits holding their helmets stand on the wing of a fighter jet
the radiant young couple turn to each other kissing
a blinding white flash and they vanish
in an astronauts pressure suit drifts rapidly towards us reeling in along a tether
a mans gloved hand is outstretched reaching for her
as she grips the hand we see her triumphant expression through her faceplate
a blinding flash shes gone
is shaking savagely he is very near death
and then all at once the shaking stops
time itself seems to stop
mcconnell opens his eyes staring straight at us
and then fully accepting his fate he throws his head back opens his mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid
he can breathe it
his eyes widen in surprise and understanding
he can breathe it
this fluid will keep him alive
his whole body relaxes the tension draining from his head and shoulders as he fully trusts this launch for the first time
and then with his eyes wide open he sees from memory one final image
and reveals in closeup the beautiful face the shining eyes of maggie mcconnell
she gazes directly into camera then smiles
wide view from above as the energy vortex changes from red orange to blue white
it roars with terrifying power as its top starts to bend angling like a telescope towards a specific point in the stars
then the martian ship a rounded darker form little more than a blip within the vast blue white column of energy shoots away from the surface leaving only a blacked
crater where the face had been
angle from deep space looking down as the martian ship riding its blue white column of energy streaks up into the vast blackness like a narrowly focused spotlight piercing the
down below we can see the dust storm in all its vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planets surface which it now completely covers
as the martian ship flashes by us it passes another ship much smaller and slower rising through the storm clouds on a different trajectory
we recognize the familiar comfortable sight of the erv
we see three figures in the cockpit
sequence omitted from original script
luke terri and phil are strapped in with their acceleration just starting to level off when suddenly their cockpit interior is starkly bathed in white light
they wince at the unearthly radiance shielding their faceplates with gloved hands
look at that
through their cockpit window they watch the martian ship hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed
is that him
their eyes are glistening
lukes voice is a whisper both of prayer and farewell
godspeed jim mcconnell
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
looking through the cockpit window we see the martian ship receding into the infinite distance of space a long blue white scratch that in moments begins to fade
finally it is a tiny point of light taking its place amongst the limitless expanse of the star filled heavens
