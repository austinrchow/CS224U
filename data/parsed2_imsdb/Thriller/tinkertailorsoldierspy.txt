written by bridget oconnor peter straughan budapest skyline looking towards the parliament building
from here the world looks serene peaceful
then as we begin to pull back we hear a faint whine increasing in volume until its the roar of two mig jet fighters cutting across the skyline
the pull back reveals a young boy watching the jets exclaiming excitedly in hungarian
laterally tracking down a bustling street as the jets scream by overhead
pedestrians look up
all except one man who continues walking
this is jim prideaux
across the street more pedestrians
were not sure who were supposed to be looking at the short stocky man
the girl in the mini skirt
the man in the checked jacket
a car driving beside prideaux accelerates out of the frame
across the street the girl in the mini skirt peels off into a shop
the stocky man turns and waves to us
but it isnt prideaux hes greeting but another passerby who walks over shakes hands
now were left with prideaux and the magyar in the checked shirt neither paying any attention to each other
just as we are wondering if there is any connection the two reach a corner and the magyar pausing to cross the road collides with another passerby
he looks over and sees prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles
a tiny moment of contact between the two
then both men walk on around the corner just two strangers headed in the same direction
shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing galeria building on the corner ahead
prideaux and the magyar walk up the steps still paying no attention to each other and head towards
a formerly grand arcade
many of the shops are now closed the ones that are open dont have much to sell
a cafe occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling
a jazz rock band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops incongruous in the window music muffled by the glass
customers sit around tables playing chess drinking coffee a mother breast feeding the hum of chatter
the ordinary world
we find prideaux and the magyar sitting at one of the tables
hungarian subtitled and porkolts
you know porkolts
hungarian subtitled yes ive had it
its very good
better than goulash
but you wont get it in budapest now
all the pigs have gone to moscow
he gives a sly laugh
prideaux smiles draws on his cigarette nonchalantly examining the people at the tables around them
a waiter arrives belly bulging out of his grubby shirt hair plastered to his head
he puts two wizened looking sandwiches in front of them
a drop of sweat trickles from the waiters face drips onto the table top
the magyar catches jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile nice service
jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him
when do i get to meet your friend
the magyar chews on his sandwich notices prideaux is ignoring his
ill take you to him
prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table his manner still easy but his eyes flick after the waiter who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop arguing with another
he looks around the galeria again looking low checking the feet of the other customers
then raising his gaze he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade
an old woman stands in the shadows by a window above
she is watching him
catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears
prideauxs expression doesnt change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands
the magyar looks up in surprise
would you excuse me a moment
he starts to walk towards the exit of the galeria
behind him his chair teeters for a moment then slowly falls back and lands with a crash sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling
the waiter starts turns sees prideaux leaving
panic flashes across his face he draws a gun from the back of his belt aims after prideaux and fires the shot echoing in the cavernous space
the shot misses ricocheting off the tiled wall and prideaux keeps walking fighting down the impulse to run as behind him out of focus an image from a surreal nightmare
the other customers stop what they are doing like actors at the end of a scene and begin to rise some drawing guns
we hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in russian
ahead of prideaux more figures appear blocking the exit
he looks over his shoulder just as another shot rings out this one catching him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of frame
from around a corner a tall over coated man kgb strides towards the scene still bellowing in russian
who told you to fire
who told you to fucking fire
the jazz band have stopped playing and are staring at the ground arms at their sides anxious not to see anything
in the top window the old woman slips back into sight
prideaux lies face down in the arcade below
as we watch one of his arms slides out leaving a slick of blood
then hes still
below the kgb man has grabbed the waiter and started to beat him
fucking hungarian amateur
we wanted him alive
behind him we can see the breast feeding mother
shes dead a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet
the baby continues to suckle on undisturbed
through the cafe window we can see a man partly obscured by the crowd in front of us the only man still seated
he lights a cigarette
close on the lighter as he replaces it
we can make out an inscription to george from ann
all my love
in the galeria the kgb man continues to bellow at the waiter
the baby begins to wail
a birds eye view of the circus
a woman connie sachs a face thats seen it all leans against a wall smoking
a middle aged woman one of the secretaries or mothers walks past pushing a trolley of documents
she nods at connie mournfully
connie looks stricken
the mother walks on into
a long conference table
we are looking at an elderly man at the head of the table
hes sitting on a rather ornate carving chair a little like a throne and he looks ill
he is signing documents his signature a simple c scrawled in green ink aware all eyes are on him
a cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray
this is the head of the circus known as control
around him are four lieutenants the inner circle of the intelligence service percy alleline toby esterhase roy bland and bill haydon
beside him his right hand man george smiley
from the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we are at the end of a coup the final ousting of a king
all we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of the pen
smiley looks up to find allelines gaze fixed on him
alleline quickly looks down at his hands
close on smiley as he examines the others gauging the shift of power occurring in the room
bill haydon handsome urbane frowning with tension pulls on his cigarette
roy bland heavy set and moustached flicking a guilty look up at smiley and away
toby esterhase immaculate hair and suit eyes on alleline watching for a cue like a dog told to stay
no one will look at him
on smiley realising there is no hope
control finishes puts the pen back in his pocket
he hands the file to the mother who red eyed walks with it out of the room
scottish accent i wish i could have done more control
coolly you did all you could percy
beat well a man should know when to leave the party
the clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it sounds the hour
a hint of bitter amusement on controls face as though hes been waiting for this wrong little note to make his move
he grinds his cigarette out
toby cant wait any longer
what about smiley
control looks at smiley
his gaze impersonal
on smiley the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to prepare himself for the shock of dismissal
smiley is leaving with me
pushing control and smiley as they walk down the corridor
alleline and the lieutenants are waiting for them
a horribly awkward moment
toby pulls open the cage lift doors for them as if to hasten the eviction
haydon looks at him with contempt
you little prick esterhase
control sweeps past them and the lift determined to walk every step of the way
control and smiley begin their descent through the rigid hierarchy of the circus
as we track with them we see that each floor is its own world
the two men walk past the fourth floor registry the vast archive of intelligence staffed by researchers
smiley and control pass down another flight and along the third floor intelligence officers heads poking out of offices amongst them jerry westerby
down to the second floor scalphunters the muscle of the circus
the boredom of an air port lounge a sunken sofa and pool table
the scalphunters watching them go in respectful silence
on down to the first floor typing pool staffed by pretty young society girls the debs who watch open mouthed as their chief passes them for the last time
and finally down to
an ancient doorman bryant feeling the moment must be marked in some way leaves his sentry box and opens the main door for control
control acknowledges the salute with a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors
alleline and bland stand smoking watching control and smiley emerge onto the pavement
control and smiley stand on the street
they stare at each other for a moment
this is goodbye
they shake hands
perhaps theres a little reserve in controls manner a lack of warmth
from the expression on smileys face we see that he is pained by this
control puts his collar up and walks away
smiley stands forlornly as control disappears into the crowd
the water of the pond still glassy
a mans head breaks the surface smiley swimming through his retirement
he takes a breath and submerges again
beyond him we see a straggled diagonal line of elderly heads bobbing through the water
smiley dries himself under the trees pink and raw in the cold fresh air
he smooths his hair down feeling a little less ridiculous
he looks over to where a very elderly swimmer is being helped into the water little more than trembling bones
is this his world now
a mother unloads a stack of files from a lift shaft and places them into her wheeled safe
a piece of christmas tinsel is wound along the trolley
we track with her through the hive like atmosphere of the fifth floor behind her the conference room a glimpse of alleline in controls chair surrounded by his lieutenants smoke
and whiskey engaged in the business of the world
she pushes on into allelines office loads the new files into the large safe there locks and spins the combination
smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen
smiley sits eating his solitary lunch reading a volume of grimmelshausen
he turns a page examines the illustration of a knight and a dragon holds it at arms length trying to focus on it
smiley lies in the double bed a conspicuous empty space next to him
he leans over and turns the light out
a hand removes files from the large safe
on a briefcase as the files marked top secret are slipped inside
tracking through the near empty offices
all the drawers of the desks are open
bins on the tables
a few mothers working late illuminated by their desk lamps
one of them is applying lipstick prior to leaving
she doesnt react as we track by
we are looking at large blurred letters
a lens is slotted into our frame and the letters leap into bold
smiley is in a chair being fitted for spectacles
smiley is selecting frames from a display
he tries on a pair watched by a bored shop assistant used to the pedantic ways of the retired
tracking with the briefcase as the mystery man walks towards the main entrance
the elderly porter bryant nods respectfully
a packed train businessmen in bowler hats long haired seventies youth the old and the new bumping underneath the city
we track low level until we find our mystery man the briefcase clutched in his hand
tracking with the briefcase as it is carried towards the house
an elderly lady mrs mccraig stands at the sink
through the window she catches a glimpse of the mystery mans legs passing the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps towards the front door
calmly she dries her hands as the doorbell rings and her dog begins to bark furiously
mrs mccraig opens the door and the figure passes her and the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the stairs
smiley adds a letter to a pile on the mantelpiece
we see the letters are all addressed to ann smiley
he straightens up finds himself staring at a painting on the wall a muddy abstract
the room is almost bare two chairs at a small table on which stands two desk lamps and a camera
the mystery man has crossed to the wall by the window and opens the grill on an air duct
from across the street a tall good looking man polyakov watches as the opened duct spills a star pattern of light out into the night air
he walks towards the house
the mystery man settles at the table sorting through the contents of the briefcase as from down below we hear the sound of the door bell the dog barking and
footsteps on the stairs
polyakov walks into the room and joins the mystery man at the small table
he picks up the camera with a smile
in russian shall we begin
lights glowing in the early morning gloom an ultra modern cube of a building sits in rather traditional grounds
this is the unlikely home of oliver lacon permanent under secretary
as we watch a young girl jackie lacon appears at the living room window in her night dress playing with a toy
as we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach
then a man steps into frame his back to us watching the girl through the window
he taps on the glass with one hand
jackie looks up surprised
as we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand behind his back
and in it is a long bone handled knife
behind jackie we see a string bean of a man oliver lacon tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the window
on the other side the intruder stands smoking
through glass this is private property
who are you
he takes in the man before him filthy and bearded you could mistake him for a tramp
but beneath the grime hes tanned and his eyes have a dangerous feral edge
this is minister lacon
what do you want
i want to talk to control
and i want breakfast
peter guillam walks down a corridor
handsome boyish bored
he hears a tring behind him
its haydon one foot up on his pedal scootering along the corridor
guillam waits for him
he likes this man
of the bike has that been cleared
im not bloody chaining it outside
mind you probably no safer in here with you bunch of cut throats
they arrive at a half paned office cubicle
inside is a very pretty girl a new deb being shown the ropes by an older woman
thought id get a glimpse of the new girl
before bland gets to her
he seen her yet
down first thing
as haydon and guillam pass staring in at her cropped above the waist
haydon appears to be gliding supernaturally by
he gives a little wave
you may fuck me belinda but you still have to call me sir in the morning
haydon glides off hand raised in farewell as guillam turns into the scalphunters arena
guillam sits at his desk over a pile of paper work slowly falling asleep
a pool ball thwacks the window cracking it
at the same moment the phone begins to ring
guillam jerks upright looks over at the pool players too bored to be angry
guillam answers the phone
he listens to the voice on the other end
after a moment he turns away from his colleagues his former drowsiness abruptly gone
smiley in his new glasses towel rolled under his arm walking down the street
he stops for a moment feeling himself watched
smiley on the steps to his home stops examines the door removing a wedge from the top of the door frame
smiley walks into the hallway stopping to pick up post
smiley places the wedge and the letters on the mantelpiece where a bundle of letters already sits addressed to ann smiley
smiley frying an egg
theres a knock at the door
smiley opens the door to peter guillam
surprised hello peter
they stare at each other
smiley takes in his expression this is not a social call
have i time to change
guillam nods following smiley into the house
he glances at a painting on the wall a muddy abstract
he crosses to examine it and then notices the bundle of anns unopened letters
guillam enters the kitchen notes the single place set for dinner
it dawns on him that he really has invaded smileys privacy
smiley appears in a coat behind him taking in guillams awkwardness
he gives a thin smile
are we going far
smiley and guillam sit in silence as guillam drives through london
its a citroen ds all sleek leather and mahogany interior
a half eaten bacon sandwich sitting on a table
we pan up and through the open window see an anxious lacon is leading guillam towards the house
smiley follows talking to lacons daughter
hows your mother
referring to the window is this where he got out
mmm i came back in and it was wide open
beat do send her my love
apologies for singling you out but
very sensitive matter
he gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter
if one cant trust ones own nephew
you know who he was
ricki tarr sir
one of my scalp hunters
hes been on the wanted list for a year
last job was istanbul bit of coat trailing for a russian convention
why is he on the wanted list
beat he killed our man in istanbul
cut his throat
been on the run since then
if possible lacon looks even more shaken
in my own home
the bloody animals you people employ
pulling oliver lacon as he leads smiley and guillam down the hall gesturing for his wife to take jackie away
he attempts some social niceties but his tone is strained
and how are you george
missing ones work ones buddies
oh i think i manage pretty well thank you
they reach a large room minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows
a tall well built young man fawn stands on guard
lacon gestures to him and fawn opens the french windows and he and guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond
behind them unnoticed young jackie creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa
your wife the lovely ann
shes in the pink and so on
beat very bonny
fawn closes the french doors behind him and lacon is suddenly all business
do you know this man tarr
mildly i recruited him actually
good with women
likes to talk
what did he say to you
he said he had some intelligence for control
had no idea he was dead
the news obviously hadnt reached wonga wonga land
then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the circus
if he couldnt have a minister he would settle for the under secretary
lacon lights a cigarette smokes a moment building up to something
smiley waits him out
the room has become very still
he said theres a mole
right at the top of the circus
and that hes been there for years
smiley absorbs this
the moment is suddenly broken by a few stray notes from the piano
the two jump slightly and turn to where jackie sits at the keyboard smiling triumphantly
smiley and lacon stand on the terrace alone
lacon glances anxiously at smiley trying to read him
i was sad to see you go george
i thought it was shabby very shabby
but the minister agreed with sir percy
new broom clean sweep wheat from the chaff and all that
and to be fair percy has had some marvellous results since you and control left
realizing how this sounds he glances at smiley to see how much damage hes caused
anyway it does mean youre rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now doesnt it
outside the family
smiley looks blandly back at him
i am retired oliver
lacon looks uncomfortable something he hasnt yet said
thing is some time back when control was still alive he came to me with a similar suggestion
smiley looks at him surprised
he never mentioned his suspicions to you
i just thought
with you being his man so to speak
what did you say to him
beat im afraid i thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down
that does happen in your business
and that bloody mess in budapest
smiley stares out over the rolling countryside inscrutable
damn it george this is your generation your legacy
if theres any truth in this youd think youd want to
he controls himself
beat ill keep peter guillam
and theres a retired special branch man
id like to have him
lacon exhales his relief palpable
do your own housekeeping
he glances back at guillam and lacons daughter picking out a melody on the grand piano
damn thing cost a fortune
three years of lessons and all i hear is edelweiss
you and ann never had children did you
no we never did
we hear the piano playing on as we
driving through suburban dagenham
we pull up in front of a neat tudor semi
gloved hands loading a colony of bees into a new hive
an apiarist in protective hat and gloves turns to examine the man who has appeared in his back yard george smiley
smiley raises a hand
the apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat to reveal a long thin face keen eyes inspector mendel
mendel now in an overcoat and carrying a battered briefcase climbs into the back of the car with a nod to smiley and guillam in the front
he begins to roll a cigarette as guillam drives away
a stow away bee appears from somewhere and begins to buzz around the car
guillam and mendel swat at it clumsily
smiley stares ahead in silence
he winds down the window and the bee flies to safety
a shabby rooming house near paddington station
a large faded floral monstrosity of a room
two single beds a large leather chair a wireless
smileys new landlady mrs pope graham is supervising a gormless teenager norman who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table
mendel and guillam take it from him and set it into the room
from the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex
re the table its georgian i shouldnt lend it to you but since mister mendel recommends you
she gives the table a sentimental tap raising her voice a little to drown out the excesses from the room next door
you will love it for me wont you
it belonged to mister pope graham
she glances at smiley who has his back to her looking out into the london street
looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads the wide world
my friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work mrs pope graham no disturbances
and thats what he shall have
you want anything you can ask norman cant he norman
and they leave
a small silence
her real name is plain graham
added the pope for a touch of class
guillam gives a grunt of amusement
best informant i ever had
smiley has turned his attention to the bed
he examines the stained sheets with distaste
as he speaks he strips off the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his bag
control lived with his sister didnt he
he straightens up from the bed smooths the pristine sheet
mendel flips his notebook back
hes already there
not much of a paper trail as you can imagine
his pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in west london
mendel flicks another page
webb and bryson are the letting agents
properties in half of the west end judging by this list
guillam is lying on the bed
smiley stands at the window mendel slumped in an armchair
were only looking for short term rentals
within the last year
reading from the list a miss hilliard
d weaver m crowley m cushing
a mrs hawcombe
close on smiley as his eyes flickers at the name
how long was h
staunton a tenant
consulting the list still is
been renting for a few years now
musing howard staunton
control used to say he was englands greatest chess master
died in eighteen seventy four
guillam and smiley approach outside a red brick mansion block of flats in west london
smiley and guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the building
smiley studies the door
he runs his fingers over the door frame and there it is a little wedge at the top
guillam followed by smiley pushes in against a mound of dead mail
they advance cautiously into the dirty flat the windows fogged out with windowlene
guillam has reached the door and disappears into the room beyond
a green velvet armchair sits at the centre of a room
beside it an ashtray over loaded with stubs
the rest of the room is mounded with piles and piles of papers files document boxes maps and charts something insane in the sprawl of it all
guillam stands with his back to us staring at a chess set laid out before the chair as if in mid game
four of the chess pieces have had photographs of faces added to them all wearing paper party hats
the effect is ridiculous and a little disturbing like some surrealist objet dart
guillam hears smiley and turns almost guiltily and as he moves we see there is a fifth photograph on a piece and it is of smiley himself
smiley stares at his image
toby esterhase is on the telephone speaking softly in hungarian
a look crosses his face
he suddenly notices haydon in the doorway cup of tea in hand
esterhase asks the caller to hold and places the handset on the desk
help you with something bill
looking for his majesty
sullenly hes walking the battlements
tobys eyes flicker toward the handset
in hungarian subtitled much obliged
bill leaves and toby resumes the call
alleline stands on the rooftop staring out over the london skyline his expression ambiguous perhaps obscurely troubled to have found himself at the top
he becomes aware of roy bland standing behind him
without turning roy
its the yanks
they want to come in and talk
alleline continues to stare out over the world but allows himself a small smile of triumph and relief
of course they do
we have witchcraft
and they dont
mendel and guillam carry in boxes each overflowing with files and bundles of yellowing papers
anywhere will do
they dump the files and smiley turns to survey his room
in his hand he is toying with a black chess piece labelled the far wall is now stacked to the ceiling with the contents of controls room thousands of files
and documents piled in no logical order
the three survey the mountain of information in silence
wryly that enough for you to be getting on with
peter i need you to do something for me
the scalphunters floor
guillam is in his office painted out panels below the waist glass above
he sits hands on the desk steeling himself for what he has to do
abruptly he stands and walks out
we track with him as he walks through the scalphunters quad area a worn out sofa the old pool table
one of the scalphunters kaspar stands flirting with a pretty secretary belinda the deb we saw earlier
guillam acknowledges them casually as he passes
the girl gives a little wave
she likes him
kaspar stares after guillam
we continue tracking with guillam as he leaves the scalphunters area walks down the corridor turns left into
he stands at the basins checking the room is clear
examines his watch then crosses to the door and opens it a crack peering out
were looking though a glass panelled door at the personnel office
a dapper little man in a club tie fawley sits behind his desk idly tapping a desk toy a newtons cradle
he too checks his watch
gets up and walks out of his office
guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly walks out of the mens room across the corridor and into
the cradle is still swinging steel balls clacking softly
guillam is opening a safe pulling out documents photographing them with a subminiature camera
close on the documents as guillam silently photographs them
i want to see the records of staff recently retired
while youre there get the handbook on staff duties
and the diagram of the circuss reorganization under alleline
guillam hears a voice outside
he draws a small knife from his pocket
kaspar opens the door and walks in finding
the office empty
then a faint noise
he works his way around the desk finds guillam crouched down his back to him
suspicious sorry peter didnt know you were doing
whatever you were doing
guillam straightens up to reveal his hand oozing blood from a cut
trying not to bleed to death
fawleys got a first aid kit in one of his drawers
get me a plaster will you
kaspar busies himself with the first aid
guillam has just stepped into the lift
roy bland appears suddenly and steps in beside him
silence for a moment as they descend
without looking at him heard you had an accident
guillam makes a mental note against kaspar
cut it on a drawer handle
beat when are we going to get some new furniture round here
ill have a word with esterhase peter
well make it a priority on the top floor
they arrive on the ground floor
bland walks out ahead
guillam exhales with relief
as he walks away where are you off to
want some company
the two men sit drinking at a table in a nearly deserted local bar
tell you the truth im in no hurry to get back up there
smothered by the mothers
something like that
those old birds all pining for control
percy still cant get a decent cup of tea out of them
still i imagine it takes time
he takes a pull of his pint
if it was up to me id replace them all with those naice girls from registry
like to hear a few high heels about the place
he reaches suddenly for guillams coat lying on the seat his hand heading for the pocket that holds the subminiature scrounge a fag
he pushes his cigarettes into blands hand before he can fish in the coat
bland smokes for a moment
suddenly what do you think of datsuns
just got one
wife made me
caught sight of myself in it driving past a shop window and i thought to myself whos that old fucker
he stares at guillam with faint smile but his eyes are cold and watchful
what are you driving
ooh la la
he continues to stare at guillam with the faint smile and guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia
drink up and ill drop you back
youve probably got some girl waiting
guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper
after a moment a man his lover richard a decade or so older walks behind him stroking his hair tenderly and joins him at the table
guillam automatically checks the window the flat opposite a lit window could someone see them
he gets up and closes the curtains settles back at the table passing richard a section of the paper
the two sit in domestic contentment reading
a ministerial car pulls up and lacon climbs out
the music a charlie rich track plays on a transistor radio
smiley sits at the window listening to the music
guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took at the circus
smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him
he turns away tunes the radio into a different station cutting the charlie rich tune
jerry westerby dismissed december th
connie sachs retired november th
thats just two weeks after you and control were forced out
smiley considers this turns back to the chess set
he writes connies name on a slip of paper pastes it to a chess piece
there is a knock at the door
mendel lets lacon into the room excluding a very excited mrs
lacons wearing a tux looking extremely uncomfortable almost offended at the role he finds himself playing
i know that car
on our way to la boheme
the minister wondered if there was anything to report
not much im afraid
we were just discussing the departure of connie sachs
i wonder how research manages without her
she always struck me as unhinged
that was one of her talents
lacon looks around him dripping disdain
indicating the chess set looking a little unhinged yourself george
he turns to him
yes i suppose i am
perhaps thats what we have to become
a little paranoid
he turns back to the chess board
to lacon your clean sweep
what if the mole was actually behind that sweep
what if each of us whether we knew it or not represented a threat to the mole
lacon looks at a pile of files distractedly picks one up
he starts to leaf through one
unconvinced control lost his position because of that fiasco in budapest
that poor chap
he looks to guillam for the name
smiley nods thoughtfully
yes he did
he writes prideaux on a slip of paper pastes it to a chess piece
lacon picks up another file something catches his eye a letter head of flames
he looks up shocked
how did you get this
this is witchcraft material
he grabs the piece of paper stuffing it in his pocket
smiley looks at him
lacon reads something implacable in smileys gaze
smiley turns back to the chess set
control was out
and alleline was in
he writes the name witchcraft and places it on a chess piece
lacon stalks out of the hotel
allelines special source
there is no connection
he climbs into the waiting car
we catch a glimpse of the minister in the back
everything is connected
the car drives away
a third rate english preparatory school
the string orchestra practice rows of twelve year old boys sawing away at their instruments
a teacher winces as he hacks at the air above their heads with a ruler
near the back of the class we find bill roach
hes plump asthmatic the last to be chosen for everything
he looks out of the window
roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the window pane
as we watch an old blue alvis towing a battered second hand caravan appears reflected in the window driving past
roach watches thrilled to realise he is the sole witness of this mysterious new arrival
were looking down into the dip at the driver of the blue alvis setting up his caravan on bricks in the gloom and rain
hes wearing a waterproof cape and hood obscuring his face giving him something of an air of mystery and menace
theres something odd about the way he moves something about his back as if its been knocked out of true
the driver rocks the caravan from side to side loading bricks underneath trying to get the thing level
he senses something and turns to find roach behind him
roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded figure
then gathering his courage he holds out his hand
in his palm a marble
roach stands in the caravan watching the marble as it rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill an improvised spirit level
the marble comes to rest at the centre of the sill a temporary equilibrium
roach turns excitedly to the camera about to call to the driver but sees something that stops him in his tracks
the driver has stopped his back to us breathing hard perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some pain
the wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one side revealing the sweat soaked shirt beneath
as we watch a dark stain appears at his shoulder blade and begins to spread
through the window we see smiley buying a bottle
smiley stands at a ticket kiosk
return to oxford please
a large dilapidated victorian house
we hear the faint sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden
smiley pushes open the gate walks down the path past over grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked glancing sideways he is caught entranced by the
sight of a young couple kissing in the window
they turn suddenly aware of his presence and smiley embarrassed continues walking round the house
a group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version of lysistrata
a young woman holding her script is miming to the song dont by doris
an older woman wearing rather too much make up is carrying a prop
this is connie sachs former queen of intelligence at the circus
she examines smiley for a moment and then breaks into a charming smile
this is not a social call
connie cant keep the disappointment from her face
smiley sits in the cluttered drawing room a plate of scones in front of him
connie appears carrying a tray of tea
of the tea oh i brought
he takes the bottle of scotch from his briefcase
eyeing it hungrily not supposed to
smiley feigns surprise
connie gives a little girl laugh
wicked wicked george
she takes the teacup he pours with crooked arthritic fingers and drinks
they sit both staring at the students in the garden caught up in memories of their youth
i miss it all so much
all my lovely boys
i dont know about you george but i feel seriously under fucked
they look at each other a moment
connies smile fades
she looks at him almost sorrowfully
she doesnt deserve you george
not one hair on your head never did
smiley and connie sit in a dirty disordered room connie on her way to being drunk
as she finishes her glass smiley fills it
you left the circus shortly after i retired
i didnt leave
i was dismissed
chucked out on the rubbish heap
beat like you
ignoring this why
she shrugs petulant takes a drink
lost my sense of proportion
thats what that personnel cow said
wouldnt let go of a bone
smiley nods a look of boredom settling on his face a polyakov
cultural attache polyakov
turned up in sixty five
and i had a feeling as soon as i laid eyes on him
but that little swine toby esterhase told me i was seeing spies under the bed
esterhase said that
he had him graded persil
whiter than white
and that was that
but you disagreed
very military bearing for someone whos never supposed to have been in the army
but he was good
went to embassy functions lectures
i love a man who lives his cover
never put a foot wrong
she cant help but smile
as if summoning him pretty polly
connie is working late
she sits in front of a steenbeck flatbed editing table shes chain smoking unkempt but completely focused on the moving images on the screen
the busiest culture vulture that embassy ever had
on the walls around her are framed stills from the footage she is watching russian officials at ceremonies each picture gridded each official labelled as connie manages to identify them
for years wed been hearing rumours that karla was building a private army of his own outside moscow centre
we knew he had agents scattered round the globe
i started spending time with the moscow gazers combing soviet bulletins and any material i could get
on screen ancient soviet veterans stand in rows displaying the medals on their chests
late one night in research i was trawling through some footage of may day in berlin
i saw something george
connie slows the images down concentrating
officials in suits are walking into their designated places
we see polyakov amongst them
one of the old soviet veterans in dress uniform a chest full of medals possibly a touch senile looks at him
just before he is obscured by another official we see what the old veteran does
he salutes polyakov
connies smile of triumph is reflected on the screen
she lights a cigarette
i saw it george
connie rewinds the tape and we see the salute backwards
and again forwards
why would a distinguished soldier four medals for gallantry salute our cultural attache polly
unless polly was a war veteran himself
and if he was why hide the fact
from doorway connie sits smoking her celebratory cigarette at the centre of her obsession
connie is showing the footage to alleline and esterhase
what did you do
i went straight to esterhase and alleline
i said polyakov is a karla trained hood if ever i saw one
and if hes here its because hes running a mole
what did they say
alleline switches off the image
hard youre to leave polyakov alone
youre becoming obsessed with him
he glances at esterhase and then back to connie eyes cold
youre losing your sense of proportion connie
perhaps its time you went out into the real world
connie sits on her bed with smiley drunk now eyes wet
hate the real world
beat what does it matter
old circus is gone anyway apart from bill haydon
better off out of it
beat i know you never liked him
sharply what nonsense
what on earth makes you say that
surprised i dont know
she turns to the shoe box beside her takes out a here we are
the nursery in our day
she shows him the photograph a young connie in wren uniform young men in cricket whites on a mown lawn
more senior figures stand behind
theres control himself you behind him as usual
a younger bespectacled smiley lost amongst his more glamorous colleagues
she traces other faces with a crooked finger
fondly jim prideaux
and bill haydon
together of course
all my boys
that was a good time george
chiding it was the war connie
a real war
englishmen could be proud then
she stares at the photograph with a sad smile
i was right then
theres a mole
smiley doesnt answer stands up to go
if its bad dont come back
i want to remember you all as you were
the house we saw in the title sequence
the air duct opens on the front of the house spilling out its star shape of light
after a moment polyakov walks up to the door and knocks
we hear the dog barking
mrs mccraig opens the door for him and he passes her with a smile heading upstairs
we track with mrs mccraig as she walks back to her pantry opens a cupboard to reveal a huge reel to reel tape recorder
with ancient fingers she presses down the clunky record button and the spools begin to revolve
in russian the priest is surprised to see general secretary krushchev
as we saw it in the titles
the mystery man sits at the table holding up pages of a document for polyakov who is photographing them as he talks the camera giving a satisfying click and whir
with each shot
he says father father ive just had sex with two year old girls
the priest says thats quite a sin but youre an atheist general secretary
high angle the dusty candelabra above their heads and the tint microphone nestled beside one of the bulbs
why are you telling me
spools churning silently
krushchev says im seventy seven im telling everyone
we hear his chuckle and the continued click whir of the camera
smiley sits at his desk staring at the chess set laid out before him
one of the pieces has had the photograph of polyakov added to it
he begins to register the faint noises around him
pigeons on the ledge outside the window the television mast creaking on the roof above him
he hears footsteps approaching down the corridor and stop outside his room
he crosses to the door and opens it and finds control waiting for him
step into my lair
and in an instant we are in
control is at the head of the table
ranged against him are percy alleline roy bland and toby esterhase all a little nervous
bill haydon sits to the side feet up
smiley joins them without his spectacles
control throws him a to smiley sit down and take a look at this nonsense
smiley sits down and begins to read
report by soviet high command on their recent naval exercises in the black sea
just what the admiralty have been begging us for some information on
engrossed where did you get it
percy and his little cabal walked in with it
protesting cabal control
shut up esterhase
control waves him down
smiley considers the report dispassionately
if its genuine its gold dust
beat but its topicality makes it suspect
control turns to alleline with a mocking smile
smiley is suspicious percy
smells a fake
where does it come from
whats the access
percy doesnt feel like telling
percy packs his pipe enjoys the moment the young lion challenging the old
a new secret source of mine
but how could he possibly have access to
he has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making
smiley stares at him staggered
if its true this is the jackpot
alleline enjoys his amazement he leans over points with bureaucratic pride to the flames on the letter we have named the operation witchcraft
percy and his pals have bypassed us smiley
gone straight to the minister
everyones very excited
percys to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret
the minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here
too much failure too many scandals too little solid intelligence
control is still smiling but only now do we realise he is almost shaking with fury
luckily percys cabal has come to save us
bulldozing on its all office politics here
percy does have a point control
we should be fighting communism not each other
meanwhile were losing our reputation our partners
your bloody yanks
shouting and weve had enough
theres going to be changes smiley
toby esterhase finds his moment
we need to decide if were part of the past or part of the future
contemptuous i should have left you where i found you
control if we could all just
alleline bland and esterhase leave
for a moment it looks as if haydon will stay but then he stands up shaking his head and saunters out
cautiously if witchcraft is genuine
now the others have left control seems to sag under the weight of some unnamed fear
he turns a haggard face to smiley
i dont trust miracles
we hear a knocking and find ourselves back in
mendel holds two mugs of tea in one hand gives the agreed knock at smileys door again
after a moment a bleary smiley opens the door and lets him in
mendel passes him the tea takes in the desk piled high with papers
of the tea courtesy of mrs p
you been up all night
smiley sits down wearily sips his tea
mendel notices one slip of paper sitting alone on the opposite side of the desk
request for a thousand pounds in cash from the reptile fund
for a mister ellis
smiley leans back rubs his tired eyes
it was one of jim prideauxs work names
whats so strange about that then
prideaux was killed in hungary a year ago
october twenty first
so why was
someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later
he takes another sip of tea gazes at mendel thoughtfully
prideaux is running around the track pounding along with his odd loping stride
a group of boys watch him pass
one spikeley mimics the run to the amusement of the others
a fire burns in the little grate
roach sits near the back of the class
the boy behind slaps the back of his neck with a ruler
roach flinches but doesnt say anything
the boy does it again
prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy hand those out
he crosses to the board begins to write on it je behind him spikely hands out the books continuing to walk like a hunchback
the class snigger
prideaux hears but doesnt turn continues writing
then from the chimney comes an unnerving scrabbling sound
a little soot falls
the sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the fire
what is that noise
then with a terrifying screech an owl drops down into the grate thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the class its wings now on fire shrieking hideously headed
straight for spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird swoops towards his face
somehow prideaux is there and grabs the burning bird from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself neck snapped and strides out of the room
the boys stare after their new teacher in shocked silence
roach is hiding spying down on the caravan below where prideaux sits in the doorway massaging his raised shoulder and drinking something from a green beaker
after a moment come down here
frightened roach obeys sliding down the dip to him
prideaux examines him fiercely
finally his face relaxes a little
identifying him boy with the marble
gave me a turn up there parked on the horizon
thought you were a juju man
whats your name
sir roach sir
im a new boy
new arrival eh
middle of year
whats the story
blushing my mother and father
my fathers left so
he doesnt know how to explain his misery any further
prideaux pretends not to notice
the unpaid bill
anyone ever call you that
known a lot of bills
theyve all been good uns
what you good at
roach tries desperately to think of something
the boys eyes start to mist up
prideaux looks down busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt
youre a good watcher though eh
us loners always are
no one else spotted me when i turned up here
best watcher in the unit bill roach is ill bet
long as hes got his specs on
gratefully yes sir
prideaux finishes his drink nods to roach
free period isnt it
dont waste it down here
roach sets off up the dip
he looks back and sees prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him rubbing his aching shoulder
smiley walks up to the steps of his home stops examining the door his absent minded air hardening into something more alert
he scans the step and stoops to pick something up
smiley walks into the hallway senses alert
he pads towards the drawing room wipes sweat from his hands on his trousers steels himself
is it finally them come for him
he walks in and finds
ricki tarr sits smoking in the darkness the knife on his lap
hello mister smiley
you remember me
he tosses the wedge onto the table
you missed a wedge
losing my touch
smiley watches him closely very aware of the knife
tarr rubs his beard
i know what i must look like
rip van winkle
feel like him
i could sleep for a year
whereve you been ricki
run out of places now
theyre gonna kill me
or their lot
whoever gets me first
im innocent by the way
beat you going to find him then
smiley crosses to another chair
as he does so hes scanning the room automatically noting the changes the remains of a meal on a table
im going to try
how long have you been here
needed somewhere to hide
smiley notices the pile of letters for his wife ann theyve been disturbed
following his gaze old habits
smiley fights down his anger
i wouldnt use my home as a safe house
theres every chance theyre watching it
calculated risk mister smiley
i wanted to see you figured youd turn up here sooner or later
what do you want ricki
theres a woman
i want you to trade for her
get her back from karla
tarr finishes his cigarette lights another
her names irina
ricki tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine
groomed smart that same restless energy
a car pulls up across the road tufty thesinger a boiled looking british spy not over bright signals to him
tarr pulls his shades down and saunters over to his ride
i met her in istanbul
theyd found some russian trade delegate name of boris
he was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him
tarr opens the back seat and gets in
tuftys slightly foolish smile slips a little
tarr enters followed by tufty carrying one of his bags
nineteenth century european grandeur
but the apartment were in is deserted and in a state of disrepair
tarr stands at tripod mounted binoculars set back from the window idly playing with a knife with a distinctive white bone handle
the hotel opposite a brutalist concrete slab the rooms have floor to ceiling windows
in the bedroom a heavy set man boris is having sex with a i took one look and saw that he was a hood moscow trained
we track to one side and see the drawing room of the hotel suite where boris two minders sergei and ivan wait smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom
probably coat trailing trying to draw one of our men out into the open
we track further along again and see the corridor outside the hotel room where a young woman has just arrived
this is irina
he had a wife with him
irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room where the minders stare fixedly at the floor trying not to laugh
she walks on past and into the bedroom
the maid jumps out of the bed grabs her clothes and flees
boris lies unconcerned reaches for his cigarettes
irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a bathroom
the glass window here is two thirds frosted and we lose her as she bends over a basin
something about her has caught tarrs attention and he leaves the binoculars walking closer to the window
suddenly irina straightens up her head above the frosted glass and stares straight at us
ricki tarr standing at the window opposite knowing he should turn away but somehow snagged by that look
a moment between the two
then a car sweeps past on the road below and theres a flash of light behind rickis head the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible binoculars
irina absorbs this
above everything else anger at her humiliation being observed
as irina walks back out of the bathroom picks up a vase and hurls it at boris just missing him
he stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed
as we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room obscuring our view
seconds later the curtains billow as irina is thrown against them
we watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of boris blows
finally the billowing fabric settles
moments later boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress
irina lies on the bed
ricki watches the street below as boris sergei and ivan exit the hotel head for a night out
tarr pulls on his own jacket grabs his knife
her husband and the minders are heading for a row of gaudy nightclubs
and someway behind him ricki tarr trailing
she exhales a breath on the glass
tarr approaches the night club glancing around quickly before slipping inside
ricki tarr enters
he scans the room for boris spotting tufty thesinger at a table
he crosses towards him watching as boris and the two minders are entertained by the clubs hostesses
boris calls for more drinks clutching a bundle of currency
grinning this is going to be a long night
you baby sit this one
ricki walks towards us
irina answers the door and finds ricki tarr outside
your blokes a bit of a bastard
beat just wanted to check you were alright
she stares at him
there was something about her
tarr exhales smoke
smiley studies him
you were due to fly home the next day
what did you tell london
didnt have anything to tell yet
i could sense it in her
ricki tarr is talking to a man
a sports car lies under a sheet
the deal concluded the man pulls back the sheet to reveal the car
irina is driving exhilarated free
ricki tarr is on the back seat sleeping
a workers canteen on the bosphorus
tarr and irina sit drinking wine talking
i played the businessman michael trench
a holiday romance
thought id take my time with it
tarr gently traces a bruise on irinas arm
but second date she made this open play
we see a growing attraction between them
irina and tarr laughing flirting
they move closer to one another
tarr feels he is the master of this situation
suddenly irina withdraws
she stares at him
i know what you are
a long beat
tarr waits her out
i would like to talk to your boss control
i have something to trade
i want a new life in the west
tarr desperately tries to stay looking calm
that is the deal
you tell them
smiley sits with his hooded bored look examining everything carefully
what made you so sure she wasnt coat trailing
weve all got our strengths
he flicks a look at the pile of anns letter an insolent smile
me i know women
she said she had a secret
the mother of all secrets
said shed only tell control
she wanted to trade
new life for her and her kids
she had children in russia
thats why they let her and boris out
so i said id tell the circus
beat but you didnt
tarrs smile fades
irina prowls the room
wanted to find out more first
so i waited her out
tarr lounges by a window smoking
shrugging you cant expect them to jump at every offer of service
carefully if they had more information
irina doesnt answer paces
tarr lets his face harden
well if you wont tell me more theres nothing i can do
she stares at him
if i tell you im putting my life in your hands
the lives of my children
do you understand
she walks slowly towards him bends over begins to whisper in his ear
the two make love passionate irina trying to bind him to her
tarr responds excited by her now that she needs him
we intercut their intense love making with
a drunk boris groping a very young hostess on a dance floor his shirt undone
he starts to strip the girl of her uniform amused by her efforts to keep her clothes on
the two minders clap in time to the music encouraging him
boris grabs the girl by the hair biting her neck laughing eyes glazed with drink barely able to stand
the inane music blares on
tarr and irina stare at each other
a long beat
tenderly promise me youll be careful
no details to the circus
not until were safe
genuine i promise
tarr threads his way through the crowds of evening shoppers and tourists holding in his head the biggest secret of his career
theres something new on his face ambition
were gliding above the respectable front of a business office through the reception which maintains the cover story of an import export outfit
over a back room and through a steel door to the cypher room beyond where we find a drunk tufty thesinger watching tarr send a coded message
you were supposed to have gone
london stationss been on to me
they want to know what the hell youre doing
without turning fuck off
smiley takes off his glasses and wipes them
and what did your message say ricki
just that i had a moscow centre trained hood wanting to defect
tarr looks at him
for the first time theres something else behind his smile
i understand how you felt
you wanted to do something
i know what i am to the circus
one of the scalp hunters
someone to give the dirty jobs to
i wanted to bring this one in myself
i quite see that
i said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well being of the circus
and what else
that she had information concerning a double agent
i was just trying to
to get the proper attention
beat and i told them to tell mister guillam that this was the reason i hadnt come home not because id defected or anything
what happened next ricki
i waited for a reply
a tense tarr sits waiting for a reply
its dark outside
thesinger is asleep at his desk
the ticker machine begins to rattle into life
tarr jumps to it
tarr begins to decode the in coming message on a one time pad
insert we read you i waited hours but that was all they sent
it didnt make sense
like they were stalling
tarr stands staring across at irinas hotel balcony with binoculars
boris stands looking straight at him
the hint of a mocking smile
behind him we can just see sergei and ivan sitting in the room
boris turns from the balcony exhaling smoke from a cigarette the faint smile still on his lips
he looks up his expression changing
tarr bolts down an alleyway
the door is ajar
a radio is playing loud pop music
tarr pauses on the threshold senses alert
he takes out his
a fan stirs the dusty air
tarr walks in and stops
tufty lies on the floor in a pool of blood
hes been tortured one eye gouged out
the other manages to convey a rather touching amazement at the violence worked on him
his throat has been slit wide open
tarr absorbs this looks at the knife in his own hand turns and runs
a desperate tarr hurries towards a phone
irina enters the hotel room
she stops a moment afraid
then she looks towards us
irina is backing out of the room
we catch a glimpse of the butchered remains of boris hanging from the shower rail a garroting wire around his neck
hes been tortured the shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood
she backs away across the room to the door leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the pale carpet
she turns to the door looks out of the spy hole
two men tiny distorted figures walking down the corridor towards her
the phone starts to ring
irina glances at it knowing its too late for her
spy hole the two figures loom closer
crowds of people throng the busy port
a paranoid ricki watches from the back of the hall
he notices a child react to something follows his gaze
behind glass panels a glimpse of three men wheeling a gurney a bandaged figure upon it
just before the figure disappears a hand moves a little
tarr watches irinas departure sick with guilt
tarr picks at a loose thread on his cuff mind still back there
they put her on a ship
thats all i know
ive done a lot of things mister smiley but
i dont know why
i keep thinking about her
beat he smiles almost bewildered by his own feelings
she wasnt even my type
beat i want to get her out
i owe her that
he stands up abruptly heading for the door
where are you going ricki
you said yourself karla will be looking for you
i can take you somewhere
keep you safe
tarrs face twists with mirth
whos going to keep you safe
we are peering down the lift shaft as new secrets are winched towards us
alleline sits in his baronial chair alone in the room
he looks what he is
a man who knows hes out of his depth
across from him the safe stands an almost malignant presence
alleline stares at it a light film of sweat on his forehead
a dark warren of corridors and glassed squash courts somewhere under ground
alleline walks along the courts new racquet in hand uncomfortable in his too tight white shorts
he reaches a court
inside lacon and the minister are playing a furious game of squash
the three men stand talking within the transparent cube of the court
lacon and the minister are still sweating from their game
the minister is smoking
percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of witchcrafts intelligence
drop the bloody jargon lacon
ive refused to share witchcraft with our allies so far minister
my goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt
i think the time has come to approach our american brothers in arms
the minister considers this with some excitement takes a drag on his cigarette
you think theyll take us back into bed
im not interested in a one off trade
i want on going access to american intelligence
this stops the minister
he turns to face alleline
do you think we can get it
alleline senses he has just risen several rungs
he slashes inexpertly with his racquet
with witchcraft on our side i think we can get anything we bloody well want
smiley swims in the placid water
we hear music
the tinkle of glasses from a happy christmas party
mock out rage percy
and we are back in the circus
we find control arm outstretched finger pointing
did you do this
a christmas party of the past
control at the height of his powers a punch glass in hand
noise and music the normally earnest atmosphere of the circus released in an unexpectedly boisterous gathering
you penny pinching scot
can you not take a bloody order
no one is to tamper with the recipe
its going to take us five hours to get drunk on this piss water
alleline tries to smile
i followed the recipe
he glances nervously at his wife a vivacious alcoholic just beginning to make a show of herself
she puts a crown shaped party hat from the cracker onto allelines head
he brushes it off anxious not to appear the fool
muttering for gods sake mary
bill haydon wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish angle appears in the nick of time leads allelines wife out for a dance teasing the sullenness from her
theyre good dancers
alleline relieved crisis averted
we find smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly drunk deb
control raises his arm above the melee
hes still at the punch bowl
get me a lady of taste
ann will sort it out
grateful to get away from the deb ill go find her
smiley threads his way through the party walking amongst his colleagues enjoying himself
jerry westerby and connie sachs are arm in arm singing along to a song the second worst spy in the world
they link smiley to them for a verse others joining in around them
the song segues into the russian national anthem
the crowd sing lustily many of them russian speaking enjoying the chance to sing with vigour
smiley walks on
behind him the song ends to be replaced by the charlie rich song we heard earlier
one of the larger mothers doubled up with laughter pulling a cracker with a flushed toby esterhase hopelessly outweighed but competitive to the finish
roy bland with his plain wife eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by
a mother takes smiley by the hand and leads him briefly into the dance
smiley takes a turn with her and extricates himself
he walks down a dark corridor the noise of the party fading away behind him
he stops seeing something in the shadows of an office
for a moment he doesnt understand what hes seen
two shapes locked in an embrace
smiley stands nakedly absorbing the body blow
then he turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party
smiley and guillam sit on a bench
smiley has his towel hair wet from his swim
you look tired
smiley considers telling guillam about tarrs visit but an instinct for secrecy wins out
i didnt sleep well
beat i want you to get something for me peter
i need the duty officers log book for last november
im sorry but im going to have to send you up a floor into the lions den
beat if you have the slightest reservation
is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation
if youre caught peter you cant mention me
im sorry but youre alone
he gets up and walks quickly away
after a moment a man rises from a nearby bench and saunters over
nothing on your back
nothing on your conscience
a lorry roars past wiping frame and revealing guillam arriving at the circus carrying his briefcase
he springs up the four steps
guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby
the security guard bryant steps from his box
beyond him is the row of lifts
hows the family
up to registry today
yellow one for the bag sir
bryant stamps a pink chit and hands it to guillam pulling open the lift cage
he gives him a yellow slip for the bag
guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend rattlingly slowly
as bryants head disappears
time you oiled this thing isnt it
we keep asking
guillam examines the chit
he wipes his hands
for the first time we realize how nervous he is
polished shoes appear as they reach the floor then the uniform trousers of a short man
a self important janitor
guillam steps out and the janitor checks guillams pink and yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile
then he stops him short
he gestures for guillam to raise his arms
guillam is briskly frisked
mind the jewels
pen and watch sir
he holds up a box and guillam hands him his fountain pen and watch
the search over guillam sets off down the corridor unnerved by the task ahead betraying his own kind
what the hell are you doing up here
then he turns
its bill haydon standing in a doorway frowning at him over his spectacles
you dont look pleased to see me bill
why would i be
you bloody pariah
then bill grins the grin transforming his face
guillam smiles back relief mixing with real warmth
we like the scalp hunters to know their place
on the second floor
doing some research
makes a change from sitting on my arse
heard it was quiet down there
as the grave
whenre you going to give us something to do
havent you heard
technologys the future
no need for you apes anymore
i can get you a posting to northern ireland if that helps get the blood racing
stick to sitting on my arse
theyve reached the end of the corridor
haydon peels away a hand raised in farewell
guillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to the vast archive of files beyond
a janitor appears in the entrance
he pushes a book towards guillam to sign
re guillams bag want me to look after that for you mister guillam
gotta give you a chit
the dolphinll kill me if i dont
so chit me
the janitor grins slaps a chit on the bag raises the counter and guillam enters
a few researchers sit amongst stacks of files
guillam is filling out requisition slips
behind the desk a woman sal watches him
what you up to this weekend
rakish visiting aunts
she takes the flimsys from the back of the slips and posts them into her desk
she hands him back the top copies
the two eights are halfway on your right the three ones are next alcove down
mendel sits in his car watching the garage fore court
he looks at his watch
the lift cage we saw earlier is being raised from the floor by a janitor at the winch
another janitor is removing files from it
radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files that make up the reading room
we find guillam moving along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards
he takes a file out leaving his green slip in the brackets provided by each file
guillam looks across at his real objective
a row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle the archived duty officers log books spines bearing the year and month they cover
and in his way a girl perched on a ladder a man mending a radiator
the man turns round and stares straight at guillam
suddenly he points straight at him
for a moment guillam freezes unnerved
then he glances over his shoulder and realises the man is communicating with another workman behind him
abruptly guillam walks over to the file and swaps it keeping the title close to his chest
he goes back to his desk a light film of sweat on his forehead
he sits a pencil clamped between his teeth waiting
from somewhere nearby comes the sound of a phone ringing then being answered
to guillam telephone sir
as though distracted oh to hell who is it
outside line sir
the garage i think regarding your car
guillam walks over to the counter the stolen file hugged to his chest
a locked box on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is opened to reveal the outside line telephone
into the phone hello
beat well damn
cant you do the bloody repair
mendel is using the office phone an elderly german mechanic stands outside guarding the office door
in the background a pop tune is playing on the radio
cant be done sir youre going to need a new gear box
at least get on to the main dealers first
one of the mothers is listening routinely in on the call tape spools revolving recording the conversation
the pop tune plays insidiously working its way into her head
she idly taps her pen along to the tune
have you got the number
well hold on
he cups his hand over the mouthpiece
chuck me the bag a minute will you
alwyn gets guillams bag and brings it over to him
alwyn goes back to his post
guillam still hugging the phone takes out a beige file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest
he takes an address book from the bag and finds a number
he hangs up hands the bag back to alwyn and steps back into
guillam retraces his steps placing his dummy file in the pink stack replacing the one he placed there in its original shelf remembering to take the green slip from the
guillam takes the green slip and hands it to sal who signs it and puts it on its spike
toby esterhase is standing in front of him
could we see you peter
for a second guillam cant speak
percy would like quite an urgent word with you
can you come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind
esterhase turns and guillam mind whirring follows him back out through the counter
to alwyn inspired you might just throw that into the lift for me mark it for the second floor save me filling out more bloody chits
will do sir
the mothers sit over their typewriters as guillam and esterhase walk through into the anteroom
shouting from the other room esterhase ill have no phone calls tell them
the chief will take no calls please ladies
muttering we can hear
toby holds the door open for guillam
we are having a conference
alleline sits in the baronial chair bland at his left
haydon on his right
esterhase trots over to his seat
guillam takes in the report they all seem to have spread out in front of them
reading well now young peter guillam are you ready for me finally
guillam affecting ease leans against the wall
what are you getting up to down there these days apart from chasing our virgins
guillam catches a smirk from esterhase mocking him
couple of arab ploys look quite promising
other than that getting quite good at ping pong
you can rent one but you cant buy one
he looks up from the report
here it comes
hows ricki tarr these days
not missing a beat fine
we have tea at fortnums every afternoon
i require the matter of your discussion with tarr
ill tell him
hell be thrilled
alleline lets the silence build rather like a bad actor
everyone is staring at guillam
quietly whats that shrug for
he slams a hand on the desk tea cups rattling a sudden roar
im talking to you about a murderer
im talking to you about a defector from your own damn section
im accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back
dont damn well shrug at me
howd you like a term in prison
guillams own temper comes to his rescue
but i havent been seeing him
so get your facts straight and get a moment while the room digests this
a relaxation of the tension as if hes passed some kind of test
so if i told you that tarr had recently arrived in paris would you be surprised
nothing would surprise me about tarr
and if i told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month would that surprise you
this does shock guillam but he manages to hold on to his sullen expression
your mans a defector guillam
got turned by the opposition months ago and now theyve sent him back to us
never mind what for
to muddy the water thats what for
spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails
the point is this hes heading for home
the first peep from him you come to the grown ups understood
anyone you see at this table
but not another damn soul
guillam is walking to the lifts we note he is now carrying his bag
behind him roy bland is walking down the corridor
he peels off turning left humming a tune to himself the same pop song that was playing at the garage in the background of guillams call
guillam reacts as he keeps on walking trying to work out if this means something
we track with him as his anger and paranoia grow
guillam drives down an alleyway full speed screeches to a halt as he reaches a group of children playing edges past them and on into the car body repair shop
he gets and strides past the elderly german mechanic we saw earlier
german subtitled hes waiting for you
guillam strides on nerves at snapping point to the other end of the workshop where a vauxhall waits
behind him the mechanic and his son are already beginning to strip the plates off guillams car
mendel appears by guillams side as they walk towards another waiting car guillam simmering with rage
a faint smile all go smoothly did it
beat where we off to
i have to see george
mister smiley isnt at the hotel sir
change of venue
tarr sits in controls green velvet armchair watching tv
theres a large tape recorder on the table behind him
we hear the door to the flat opening
guillam hurries into the room stops seeing tarr
tarr gives his sunny grin but hes sweating his eyes full of tension
hello mister guillam sorry i took so long to come back
guillam punches him in the face drags him from the chair the two struggling
behind them smiley and fawn appear
smiley watches coolly for a moment then signals fawn who drags guillam off tarr expertly pinning his arm
excuse me sir
guillam pulls free angrily
rickis been helping us peter
indicating tape deck hes been telling us all about his adventures
to smiley hes a double george
there is no mole
the whole things a pack of lies thought up by moscow
karlas bought him for thirty thousand pounds
he pulls the log book out of his file
to tarr i stole that because of you
i spied on my own
do you know how that makes me feel
smiley holds out his hand for the log book
as you did take the trouble to steal it
guillam hands him the book and smiley leafs through the pages
ricki you said you sent the circus a telegram concerning irinas information
tarr sits up wiping blood from his mouth
what was the date
tarr hesitates considering
he doesnt know because there was no telegram
the whole thing
it would have been november th
smiley has found the right month
he flicks through the dated pages th november th november
he holds up the book the next page has been cut out
november th is missing
beat someone is covering their tracks peter
unless you think thats just a coincidence
guillam looks thrown
what about the money
thirty thousand isnt so much for karla to pay if it protects his mole
im afraid someone in the circus knows all about mister tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him
guillam takes the log book from smiley runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page
he notices some writing on the next page
reading enquiries to the fifth floor
smiley takes the book again examines the note
you recognize that handwriting
beat thats toby esterhase
smiley and guillam pull up in front of the hotel
they sit in weary silence staring up at the unprepossessing building
why didnt you tell me
that you had tarr
smiley looks at him
guillam reads the look correctly
in case i didnt make it out of the circus
secrecy is a habit
guillam rubs his eyes
i should get some rest
and i suppose you should get your reading done
the two men are finishing off a bottle of scotch
unusually smiley is drunk a result of the alcohol and the lack of sleep
guillam lies on one of the single beds staring at the photographs of the four suspects smiley has pinned on his chessmen
i wanted to believe tarr was lying
beat all this time thinking im fighting a war
its a sham
karla won years ago and we didnt even know it
smiley watches guillam estimating how badly all of this is affecting him
beat i met him once
in fifty five
moscow centre was in pieces
purge after purge
half their agents were jumping ship and i travelled around signing them up
hundreds of them
guillam raises himself up on an elbow listening
one of them was calling himself gerstmann
he was on his way back to russia and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed
plane had a twenty four lay over at delhi and thats how long i had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die
smiley stares at the room around projecting his memory of the delhi cell onto their present surroundings
im sitting here
hes sitting there
he points to an empty chair in front of him
the americans have had him tortured
he holds up his right hand
its incredibly hot
im very tired and all i want to do is get this over with and get back home
things werent going well with ann
guillam flinches a little but smiley doesnt notice lost now in the past
i give him the usual pitch
come to the west and we can give you a comfortable life
or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot like bykov shur muranov
he stares at the chair as if expecting an answer and slightly drunkenly guillam finds himself turning to the chair for a response
beat what did he say
smiley doesnt answer stares at the chair the silence stretching its all becoming a little surreal
to the chair think of your wife
you have a wife dont you
i brought you some cigarettes by the way
he mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table between him and the chair
use my lighter
he mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes
we could arrange for her to join you we have a lot of stock to trade
if you go back shell be ostracised
think of her
think about how much she
he breaks off in sudden impatience with himself
kept harping on about the damn wife
telling him more about me than
should have walked out of course but for some reason
it seemed important to save this one
beat so i go on
know youre a chain smoker help yourself were not so very different you and i
he makes a vague etcetera gesture stares at
something unsettling about it as if somehow it is acquiring the ghostly presence of karla
to the chair look weve both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one anothers systems
dont you think its time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine
smiley sits back dropping the game
never said a word
not one word
next morning he got back on his plane gave the pack of cigarettes back to me untouched this was a chain smoker mind and flew off to what he presumed
would be his death
he kept my lighter
it was a gift to george from ann
all my love
guillam is still staring at the chair a little awe struck
that was karla
and he flew back to die rather than give in
beat and thats how i know he can be beaten
because hes a fanatic
and the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt
what did he look like
thats the thing
beat i cant remember
he stands up crosses to the window embarrassed by what he has to say next
after today peter you have to assume theyre watching you
if theres anything you need tidied up
nows the time
guillam stares at him realising what hes talking about
guillam and his boyfriend richard sit at the table richard working his way through a stack of essays
guillam stares at him
without looking up nearly done
he scores a red line down a piece of work
to himself for godsakes
i think theyre all sharing the same moronic brain
he notices the way guillam is staring at him and his smile fades
richard bewildered and upset is packing his belongings
he walks past guillam stops
with dignity if theres someone else you can tell me
im a grown up
guillam doesnt say anything
richard puts the flat keys on the side table and leaves
guillam stares after his one time lover heart broken
prideauxs blue alvis bumps and jolts towards us across the playing fields an exhilarated roach at the wheel
braking time sir
prideaux and the rest of the class stand at the finishing line but prideaux is staring down to a line of beech trees where a man is walking
quietly got your specs on jumbo
whos the fellow down there
roach stares at the stranger eagerly
disappointed dont know sir
who is he
why doesnt he look this way
wouldnt you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field
doesnt he like boys
anyone sees him again let me know
dont hold with odd bods hanging about
might steal the alvis which is
by rote best car in england
they dissolve into laughter but roach is still anxiously watching prideaux noting how his expression has darkened
belinda the deb we met earlier is doing up her blouse
shes teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her
kaspar has guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him
guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin
something of the school yard fight about it as the other scalphunters gather around ostensibly to break it up but clearly enjoying the distraction
one of them is trying to pull kaspar off and caught by a blow joins in the fight escalating as others join in the struggle
keep your bloody hands off her
he kicks at guillam who falls
belinda gives a shriek of alarm
christs sake dont fight over a bit of skirt
guillam lies on the floor taking another kick but his face turned to us registers only relief
bright morning sunshine
smiley and guillam walk up concrete steps of a casino building very modern imposing
havent seen many of the boys and girls for a while matter of fact
smiley guillam and the genial jerry westerby are sat at a blackjack table
the casino is empty a cleaner vacuums in the background
but thats the way it is george isnt it
when youre out youre out
too much of this stuff
he points to a drink on the table before him
an old joke between them too much wampum not good for braves
beat i need to talk to you about the night jim prideaux was killed jerry
you were duty officer werent you
westerby looks at them both
control asked me to man the phones that night
said someone was doing a special job for the service
he wanted someone from outside he could trust
if anything came in i was to tell him and only him
westerby walks down the corridor
we pass offices drawers pulled open waste paper bins standing on desks the end of day ritual
westerby is following a horse race on the radio
a dirty plate in front of him
he drinks from a can of beer
westerby is asleep
the circus is deathly quiet nothing stirring
control sits surrounded by files
a dim green lamp on his desk the only illumination
he looks ill tense with waiting
cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray
he listens to the solitary phone below him in the building
then it is joined by a second
then a third
control listens nerves stretched to their limit
from just outside the sound of someone running up the wooden staircase
entering been a bit of a panic sir
control raises his head
from the fo resident clerk
a hungarian news bulletin sir
reading british spy work name ellis travelling with false hungarian papers has attempted to kidnap an unnamed hungarian general in budapest
hes been shot other arrests imminent
control stares at him stands unsteadily begins to put on his coat
can i have a brief please
do you want me to deny it
controls stares at him lost
i have to have a brief sir
westerby is on the phone
im sorry to bother you
is george back yet
westerby and smiley sit opposite each other
you rang my house
just on the off chance you were back from berlin
what did you say
just that thered been a bit of a crisis
she said you werent back yet
that was it
all hell broke loose military yelling about hungarian tank movements on the border lacon and the minister baying at the door
thank christ bill haydon turned up when he did
pushing bill haydon as he walks up the corridor towards the duty room cutting a swathe through the people gathered outside
the room clears
bill sits down
he pulls out all the phone lines decisive taking charge
kicks the door shut
i tried to get hold of you
i just picked up half a story on the ticker tape at my club
jim prideauxs been shot
haydon goes white
get me the hungarian embassy
with relief yes sir
haydon is on the phones
you go and tell your masters what will happen if one hair on jim prideauxs head is damaged
he covers the receiver turns to westerby
get esterhase on the phone
tell him to pull in the hungarian agents anyone were onto
tell him to get down to the london school of economics sandbag some bloody students and put them on ice at sarratt
westerby watches haydon on the phone from the door
haydon listens to a voice for a moment then hangs up
he stands his back to westerby
any more news on him
haydon doesnt turn around head bowed
beat oh god is he
for a moment it looks like haydon wont answer but then he seems to master his emotions
we need to go to his flat
clear out anything linked
haydon walks around the neat rooms
a bike up on the wall a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper waiting to be cleaned
haydon walks past a shelf photographs and books
he stops picks up an unframed black and white snap from the shelf
its a picture of himself
haydon stands with his back to us possibly crying
westerby turns thoughtfully away
smiley and guillam sit eating side by side at a bar smiley examining the hamburger his first doubtfully
guillam is thinking about what hes just been told
haydon heard the news at his club
smiley is distant
at one thirty
the ticker tape wouldnt be running
guillam sits mind racing
so how did he know
oh jesus george
how could he have known
its not him peter
then how did he know
gently because he was at my house that night
guillam doesnt know what to say
they sit in a hideously awkward silence
of the hamburger i quite like this
the phone on the nightstand starts to ring
a womans hand reaches into frame and picks it up
beat oh hello jerry
no im afraid george isnt back yet
in the bed beside her we see bill haydon
a black cab pulls up at the lights
another black cab pulls alongside it
the two drivers acknowledge each other chatting as the lights change to red but in no hurry to move
an impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger in the opposite cab wanting to share this moment of passenger outrage
we see allelines profile staring stonily ahead
we follow his cab as it peels off into a familiar street driving towards the house where we met polyakov
smiley slips into the water
its late afternoon
very still and calm
very few swimmers
smileys head breaks the surface dips in breaks the surface
smiley sits on a platform with his back to us drying off from his swim looking out over the water
a mans head appears swimming up to the platform through the reeds
an old queen his face almost purple with the cold
he clings to the edge of the platform for a moment
just in case its of interest dear
we are observed
old filth in the bushes
not very subtle but there you are
he swims away
the wind lifts up a little rustling the trees and bushes around the pond
we stay on smiley watched and alone
smiley walks into his hallway picks up the mail piled on the floor
he crosses to the drawing room still looking at the mail
the door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch a flash of movement in the room beyond a couple in a passionate embrace glimpsed for a moment
before they disappear out of sight
we can hear what may be their love making
and a record is playing
the same charlie rich track smiley reacted to in the islay hotel
smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to look up
he pushes open the door and moves into
which is empty
he sits in an armchair starts opening some letters
a figure walks past smiley abruptly
smiley doesnt look up
smiley looks up
bill haydon sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and trousers socks no shoes
he sips a cup of tea
no sense of having been caught in an act of adultery
who is now wearing a raincoat and we realise we are in fractured memories of
i was just passing thought id call in
ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up
she said shell be down in a minute
smiley glances at a half wrapped oil painting lying against a chair
thats what im dropping off
smiley stands in front of the muddy looking abstract painting we saw earlier
its now on the wall
awful daub really but ann expressed a liking
whats keeping her
we hold on smiley but hear haydon leave the room a whispered conference in the hall between haydon and ann
from the door george with his back to us staring fixedly at the picture listening to the whispers behind his back
prideaux lies on his bed
there is a tap at the door
come in roach
roach walks in
thought you were in sick bay
what are you
he stops seeing the anxiety on the boys face
what is it jumbo
sir theres a stranger parked down on the road
hes just sitting there
he dissolves into tears
prideaux crouches beside him
gently its alright old fella
nobody ever watched like you did they
off you go now
are you going to have to leave
prideaux stares at him
ill be fine
you get back to bed
roach wipes his eyes and leaves
as soon as the door is closed prideaux crawls under the little chest of drawers grimacing with pain working an arm further in
there is a faint sound someone on the steps outside
with a final effort prideaux rips his rifle free from its hiding place still trailing tape and rolls to face the door gun in hand
a knock at the door
prideaux aims the gun
the door opens
to reveal control peering out at us
he steps aside and allows a pre injury prideaux to enter
the flat smiley visited
control leads prideaux into the same room the green armchair surrounded by mounds of files and papers over flowing ashtrays the detritus of an obsession
the five photographs of faces fixed to the chess pieces before him
control a walking corpse lowers himself into the armchair motions prideaux to take another seat
you werent followed
prideaux sits presuming the question is rhetorical
trust no one jim
especially not in the main stream
what hungarian identities do you still have running
andras benedek hungarian journalist based in paris
control nods thoughtfully
if youre caught you keep me out of it
you were acting alone bit of private enterprise
prideaux watches him very still
ive had an offer of service
a hungarian general
wants to come over
i want you to meet him
he has information i need jim
bit of politics
something in his manner alerts prideaux
he has treasure
the name of the mole moscow centre has planted at the top of the circus
prideauxs face doesnt change but hes wondering if the rumours could be true and control really has gone mad
theres a rotten apple jim and we have to find it
laboriously he leans forward to the chess set
im so close i can almost feel his heart beating
i know its one of five men
all i want from you is one word
he points to the photograph of percy alleline
points at the next photo haydon tailor
we drop sailor its too close to tailor
pointing at next photo esterhase poorman
prideaux sits with his visitor smiley recalling the meeting
hes drinking vodka
which means i was
you were beggarman
just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this is painful for him to hear
what did you make of it jim
stiff i thought it was madness
to think any one of you could have been a traitor
smiley is watching him intently sure hes hiding something
but still you went
risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd
prideaux doesnt answer
perhaps some part of you wanted to know if control was right
wanted to know if there was a mole who it might be
prideaux shoots him a dangerous look
hard i went because control asked me to go
its called doing ones duty
prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform towards us
he pauses for a moment drawing a hungarian newspaper from his pocket
as he does so he glances at the other passengers walking past him
two women and a man all apparently travelling alone the shoes theyre wearing brown suede boots fur lined black plastic boots and the man a pair of black galoshes
prideaux walks on tapping the paper against his leg
the scene from the opening of the film
the waiter puts down prideauxs plate a drop of sweat from his forehead hitting the table
he looks at the droplet fakes a smile for the magyar looks after the waiter scans the floor around him
there it is one of the women is wearing the black plastic boots
her coat is different and shes wearing a fur hat now but the shoes are the one thing the surveillance agents dont have time to change
prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above sees the old woman starts to rise
as we cut to the shot punching into his back prideaux falling forward
as we cut to those shoes again stepping in the water and blood on the floor passing us at eye level
grouping and regrouping as the operation comes to an end
the noise in the background comes to us muted and very faint
faintly a baby is crying an ambulance siren is wailing
hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted up to chest level where we seem to float past the faces of the magyar and the other officers
smoking cigarettes by the doors and out towards the open doors of a waiting ambulance
we are slid into the back of the ambulance as though into the drawers of a morgue
and snap to black
we are looking at the back of prideauxs head hair damp with sweat shoulders trembling
we pull out and find prideaux a filthy dressing covering the wound on his back
the cell he is in has filthy heavily padded walls like a straitjacket
from a speaker in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone
lights blaze down
what did you tell them
prideaux in too much pain to walk is being dragged down a brightly lit corridor towards an interrogation room at the far end
he is taken inside the door closed behind him
smiley stands staring at the owl prideaux killed which is now stuffed keeping guard from the top of a bookshelf
prideaux sits at a desk drinking the vodka
i held on as long as i could to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there
beat did they
smiley seems to have been thinking about something else looks at him puzzled
my networks in hungary
did they get out
they were blown
the story is you blew them to save your own skin
prideaux nods makes an odd gesture as if hes about to rise but doesnt move
his expression hasnt changed but inside him something has just been decided
what was your last line of defence
controls crazy theory
i was going to bury that so deep theyd never get it out of me
which was a joke
because they already knew
they wanted to know how far control had got in his investigation
was percys wife still drinking who was bland screwing in the office
that sort of thing
did they ask about me at all
one of them did
smiley becomes very still
what did he say about me
he had a cigarette lighter
kept flashing it round for me to see
showed me the inscription
to george from ann
all my love
he reckoned after bills fling with her she might want to change the inscription
smiley doesnt flicker
still looking to the side i told him to go to hell
if they had one man like bill haydon they could call it set and match
beat quietly that was well said
they sit in silence for a moment
smiley buttons his coat finished here
try and put it all behind you jim
he makes to leave
he gave me a cigarette
prideaux looks down at his hands
prideaux still doesnt look up
i thought it was my last one
a concrete bunker of a room
prideaux is standing in a slab of watery sunshine that falls from a sky light above
hes smoking trying to control the tremble in his hand
the patch of sunshine only extends a few yards in front of him
the rest of the room is in granite shadow
the sense of other people watching from the shadows
the sound of a door opening and someone being led in
a woman walks across the dark room and into the slab of light blinking as she does so
her hair is loose and dishevelled about her face
a mans voice comes from further back in the darkness
russian accent do you know this woman
prideaux looks at her
another voice murmurs in russian
irina pins her hair up in the way we saw before
i dont know her
she looks at prideaux and gives a small polite smile as though good manners are going to save her
a guard steps out of the shadows and shoots her in the head the shot thunderous in the room
its horribly unexpected and prideaux jerks backward bewildered and appalled
tell percy alleline what we did
rain lashes down obscuring our view
do you know who she was
cold nobody you need concern yourself with
reverse we see guillam and smiley are sitting in the parked car in the rain
he said when he got out when he was being debriefed at the nursery he had a visitor
prideaux stands watching a small dapper figure crossing the grounds towards him toby esterhase
a man whos come up in the world
he gave him a thousand pounds
told him he was dead now and couldnt come back
had to become a lotus eater forget everything that happened controls theory tinker tailor
all of it
guillam stares at him alert
yes thats what i thought
how on earth did esterhase hear about tinker tailor
smiley gets out of the car into the rain
looks around him uneasy
will you watch my back peter
look out for a solo
just a feeling ive had
guillam watches as smiley heads off into the gloom
smiley stares at the chess board a complex pattern of related figures
he turns back to the tape deck puts the headphones on presses play over headphones what exactly did irina say
over headphones she said there was a general work name polyakov who was stationed in london
and that polyakovs real job was to service the mole
he meets him regularly and takes back information the mole gives him for karla
smiley presses stop
he presses re wind watches the tape spool backwards
he goes too far presses fast forward watches the tape reverse direction
and at this moment we can tell from his expression a piece of the jig saw falls into place
lacon and smiley are meeting with the minister
this meeting is not taking place
is that clear
beat there is a house somewhere in this city where alleline and the others meet witchcrafts london representative
i need the address of that house
i dont know what youre talking about
smiley stares at him
i dont know the address
and i fail to see the
i thought lacon had made it clear to you keep your nose bloody well out of witchcrafts business
calmly its lacons advice im following
to lacon you told me to follow in controls footsteps
snapping well i wouldnt consider that sound advice after the bloody mess control left us with
its taken alleline and if i may say so myself this long to get us back into the race
im glad you take some of the credit
lacon glances sharply at smiley theres something different about him his tone
the man alleline and the others meet is called polyakov
you believe his role is to bring information from witchcraft to you
his real role is to receive information from the mole to take back to karla
he has the ministers full attention now
a long silence
thats not possible
when he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the circus in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for
im sure youll be able to take full credit for that
appalled witchcrafts intelligence is genuine
its been gold
just enough glitter amongst the chicken feed
control didnt believe in miracles and he didnt believe in witchcraft
but you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the circus and you let karla in
his voice is still calm but its clear whats different now
theres a quiet fury in him
the minister is ashen
we cant be made to look like fucking fools again
forget europe if we have the black men getting to hear about this on walla wallah news
what if we find the mole and we move him sideways some department where he cant do any harm
is the kremlin likely to boast about this
not in their interests sir
they need the enemy to look like a threat
well tell them to play the game
we dont go crowing about their fuck ups
in their panic both men are addressing each other momentarily forgetting smiley
suddenly we are not the prize
were the bait
they turn to him
youve opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the americans
what they tell the circus theyll be telling the kremlin
witchcrafts information the gold karla let you have
it wasnt to lure you
it was to lure the americans
now do you want to take credit for that
lacon and the minister stare at smiley
what can we do
we have one thing the mole wants
close on a belligerent tarr confidence regained
if i go
i want your word youll get irina back
dont care who you have to trade
i want a family
dont wanna end up like you lot
he looks at smiley then he gives guillam a knowing look as though deliberately provoking him
guillam absorbs the slur but his eyes are hard
were gonna live in paris out of your hair
youll get her back
again a flash of the coldness in smiley
beat ill do my utmost ricki
the doors open to reveal toby esterhase chatting to a guillam standing by his car holding the door open
guillam is driving
the radio is on
the car pulls up on the roadside and two people climb in the back
its smiley and fawn
guillam speeds off
esterhase sits stiff mind whirring uncomfortably aware of fawns unsettling presence behind him
as he stumbles through the muddy airfield
a vast empty space all around
toby starts to turn but
keep walking please
toby stumbles on
i want to talk about loyalty toby
control recruited you when you were trying to escape from hungary didnt he
a wanted man
saved you from a kgb bullet didnt he
and yet when the time came when it came to picking sides between him and alleline you didnt hesitate
understandable perhaps with your war experience
youve survived this long i suppose because of your ability to change sides serve any master
faintly we hear the low drone of an approaching engine
esterhase scans the horizon locks on the black speck in the sky an aircraft flying towards them
esterhase watches the approach with mounting anxiety
whats this about george
its about which master youve been serving toby
a file is placed in a briefcase we can see now that the hands in the frame belong to esterhase
he checks the corridor is clear
as he and guillam drive esterhase on
intelligence has been leaked toby
someones been taking files from the circus
esterhase leaving the circus bryant politely wishing him good night
eyes fixed on the plane as it roars down towards them
this is a mistake george this is all
the files were delivered to a russian attache werent they
esterhase holding up the documents for polyakov to photograph
and yes i delivered them
alleline getting out of the cab by the railings
the dog barking from inside the house
but so did percy
haydon walking past mrs mccraig and heading up the stairs to the empty room
roy bland sits in front of polyakov holding up the documents for polyakov to photograph whir
esterhase cant tear his eyes away from the propeller plane descending onto the runway ahead of them
things arent always what they seem
you know that george
moscow thinks polyakovs working for them so every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them just chicken feed keep his bosses happy
but polyakovs our joe part of a big operation
yes i know
esterhase stops turns to look at smiley
why are we here
why are we
guillam gives him a sudden violent shove in the back
esterhase straightens himself runs a palm through his hair real fear on his face now
i dont deserve this
i dont deserve this george
who gave you the message for jim to forget about tinker tailor
to get rid of connie sachs
bland or haydon
i dont remember
one of them
i dont know who
youre just the messenger
running between them all
anything to serve witchcraft
esterhase flinches again
i know all about your secret source
and i know something you dont
i know who he is
beat hes karla
esterhase turns to look at them in horror
guillam pushes him again
the plane has taxied to a halt ahead of them
something sinister about it
in the london house spools turning
we hear the familiar click
whir of polyakovs camera
polyakov is photographing
the table in front of him is empty the shooting just a pantomime for the microphone above
as he continues to shoot we see the mystery man sitting across the table from him
he takes out a canister of developed film and passes it to polyakov
one of you has been giving polyakov the crown jewels
standing on the airfield
i didnt know
i swear i
are you still a wanted man toby
toby looks back at the plane almost hysterical
you picked the wrong side toby
crying george youve got to believe me
i would never
im loyal george
smiley watches him cry for a moment his face impassive
give me the address
where do you meet polyakov
a terrace of flat fronted nineteenth century houses one of them the house we have already visited
a car draws up before one of them and smiley fawn and guillam get out and head for the front door
the men are fanning out fawn and guillam heading into the kitchen
smiley walks upstairs dogged by the housekeeper mrs mccraig not at all happy with the invasion
what are the safety signals
theres an air duct
open and alls well
closed and youre not to enter
they enter the empty room
where is the mike mrs mccraig
she points at the candelabra
and whats the procedure
whenever the gentlemen are meeting i record the session
the tapes are sent back to the circus
from downstairs come the crash of furniture being moved rooms searched
what are they doing
they shouldnt be moving things
the authority in smileys voice stops her
if youre at all worried you can call lacon from the basement phone
lets try the tape recorder shall we
over the recorder we can hear guillams voice reciting something from childhood from the room above
the boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled
the flame that lit the battles wreck shone round him oer the dead
smiley is listening
yet beautiful and bright he stood
establishing shot of a street in paris
a squat yorkshireman mackelvore walks out of a nearby restaurant and gets into a car
out of nowhere tarr suddenly appears climbing into the passenger side ramming a gun into his side
mackelvore leads tarr into a grand but dilapidated apartment
an elderly frenchman ex resistance looks up from his evening meal as the two pass
in french guest from london station monsieur fourcade
the frenchman grunts a greeting turns back to his supper
as they walk on the whole service is looking for you ricki
theyll skin you alive if they find you
mildly maybe i want them to find me
they reach a door which he opens to reveal a steel door beyond
he presses a bell and a hatch in the door slides open and a young mans face appears
this is ben
he slides open a bolt a double lock and lets them into a
you can go home now ben
leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines
ill be talking to london presently under my own steam
tarr takes out his gun
flat ben stays here
tarr stands over mackelvore who is sending a message to the circus
dictating ricki tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the circus
a dark workroom
we track through a crowd of tailors some of the dummies are draped in clothes some just shapes in the darkness
as though we are moving through a room by a great domed window occasionally washed with yellow from the traffic outside we find mendel his back to us staring out
a taxi pulls up a few yards away from the circus doors
we see a man clamber out
its percy alleline
into phone tinker
smiley sits on an armchair lit by a harsh over head light
into phone hows he look
smiley puts the receiver on the arm of the chair takes off his shoes and in his stocking feet crosses the room
as he does so he spools out a washing line tying it to the far door knob
guillam waits on the tow path looking back at the house
someone presumably smiley is moving through the house turning the lights off until it is in complete darkness
a torch light flashes once from a downstairs window
here comes soldier
smiley sits in the darkness holding the phone to his ear
the three men stand over the silent cypher machine
tarrs gun rammed into his belt
tarr is almost glittering with nerves
then the machine clatters into life
read it aloud
ben starts to read his high rather imperious schoolboy voice carries over the next few shots
personal for tarr from alleline
a shot of the archive room of the lift full of secrets slowly being lowered into the ground
require clarification before meeting your request
on the door of the war room resolutely closed a slither of light burning beneath it
the tailors dummies standing to attention as alert as mendel watching from the window phone to mouth
quote information vital to safeguarding of the circus unquote does not qualify
tarr has begun to laugh gripped by a weird hilarity
ben reads even faster
send further information
thats the way percy boy
you keep stalling
i better warn you ben theres some lousy people in this outfit
dont trust a fucking one of them
smiley sits in the blackness
the washing line extends ahead of him glowing faintly white in the darkness
the tinny sound of mendels voice comes from the receiver beside him
smiley picks up the receiver
im here mendel
smiley puts the receiver back on the armchair
he goes to the window in his stockinged feet
guillam nerves taut sees three long flashes
the mole is coming
a long silent look at the dark house
then the star of light spilling into the darkness from the air vent
smiley calm and contained hears the sound of a cab drawing up outside
a pair of footsteps on the path
scrape of a key in the door
a pale rim of light appears around the kitchen door
and outside the sound of a second cab drawing up
someone else enters the house
movement in the kitchen
two mens voices start to speak in russian
smiley gets up gun in one hand and guided by the line makes his way through the darkness to the door of the kitchen groping rather like a blind man
walking towards the light
in russian what is your cover story in case we are disturbed
the sound of another voice answering in russian from further back in the room
on smiley inching across the room
the tape recorder working
on tape in russian this can be salvaged
tarr can be found and liquidated
he turns his nerves taut searching the shadows for movement
for a moment hes certain hes being then from the house the signal hes been waiting for
three long flashes
guillam starts to run
a nervous lacon is waiting on a corner guillam runs past
i wont have bloodshed
i want absolute calm
a cab appears and mendel jumps out
mendel and lacon hurry towards the house guillam sprinting ahead
churning the silence
the sounds of the house amplified
no one talking
perhaps the faintest of coughs
racing towards the front door and bursting through into the hallway and on up the stairs taking them three at a time bursting through into
an oddly formal scene
polyakov stands pipe in hand
smiley sits in a chair gun in hand
absurdly still in his and opposite him sits bill haydon
they all turn to look at guillam who stands panting in the doorway
as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have had of a sense of victory drains away leaving him with just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame
nissan huts surround a cricket field
two cadets run laps
smiley walks towards one of the huts stops as alleline walks out
alleline a broken man can barely look at him
with a nod he walks on
an unshaven exhausted haydon stands outside the sarratt building in a small fenced enclosure
we see smiley walking towards him
hes brought a box of cigarettes
haydon is weeping quietly but without emotion
smiley offers haydon the box of cigarettes
i was assured there would be no coercion
haydon waves it away
smiley hands him a clean handkerchief
its almost funny george
i know the inquisitors little bag of tricks
i taught most of them
dont mind the tears
just a reaction
an over reaction if you like
craddox says ill be off in a few days
i keep thinking how im going to miss the cricket in moscow
he weeps again
i rather hoped you would do a little light house keeping for me
if i can
theres a girl
would you give her some money for me
give her a good cover story
if it helps tell her i love her
its all here
theres a boy too
bung him a few quid to shut him up
take it out of the reptile fund
i did have one or two questions
i got him back didnt yes yes you did
that was good of you
beat im surprised karla didnt shoot him
or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you
smiley looks carefully at haydons profile
did prideaux come and see you before he left on his hungarian mission
yes as a matter of fact he did
to say what
haydon stares at him
for the first time the tears seem real
guilt and grief
he looks down
a long pause
almost to himself to warn you
because he knew deep down it was you all along
so did you
haydon stares out lost in thought
i had to pick a side george
it was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one
the west has grown so very ugly dont you think
smiley doesnt answer
a moment of silence
did karla ever consider having you take over the circus
for a moment haydon looks rattled
im not his bloody office boy
what are you then
haydon turns to smiley a flash of hauteur
im someone who made his mark
smiley watches him feeling him shrink in stature before his eyes
haydon lights a cigarette
quietly is there anything you want me to pass on to ann
for a moment haydon looks genuinely puzzled
oh that was nothing personal george i hope you understand that
karla said you were good the one we had to worry about
but you do have a blind spot
he reckoned if i was known to be anns lover you wouldnt be able to see me straight
and he was right up to a point
up to a point
the flat is now empty cleared of controls possessions
smiley looks around places a chess piece on the piano
we see the piece bears the name haydon
he walks away
george comes up his path looking old and tired
he stops still inside his doorway
the little figure on the console table is in the wrong position
smiley puts his hand on it but doesnt right it listening to something from somewhere inside the house
a faint movement
through the half open kitchen door we catch a glimpse of a woman beyond
ann is back
smiley stands with his back to us still in his coat staring through the door at his wife beyond
something of a vermeer in the image
hes absorbing the different atmosphere home
deciding whether to go in
suddenly we hear music julio iglesias singing a disco version of la mer very seventies
the same lively christmas party at the circus we saw earlier
bill haydon a little drunk and happy works his way through the packed room dancing to the iglesias track a drink in each hand a little tongue in cheek singing
other members of the circus glimpsed as we pass them connie sachs westerby bland drunk grinning at us
toby esterhase talking to one of the secretaries
the music continues as we find
control and smiley sitting a little apart talking
haydon is still working his way through the party
we pass percy alleline and his drunk wife
alleline looking fretful and hoping no one is noticing the scene she is making
haydon grins at all his comrades feeling fond of everyone but heads on to his destination
prideaux sits watching him come with a drink towards him shakes his head but cant help but smile fondly at the idiot haydon is prepared to make of himself
the music continues as we see two cadets are running on the circuit their white t shirts only just visible in the dark
haydon sits on his bench smoking watching them flit by
he smiles to himself remembering
he senses something turns and looks back
prideaux stands in the shadows behind him some fifteen foot away
the two men stare at each other then haydon turns back to watch the runners
we hold close on his face as prideaux approaches the only sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser
of the runners just like us jim
beat best days
a rifle is placed on the side of his head the same execution shot that we saw used on irina the force blowing him sideways out of the frame
as the music continues we
frost on the grass
we find a cadet staring down at the corpse of haydon leaning against the back of the bench outlined in silver frost
the music ends
prideaux sits on his bed
from outside the sound of a football game
someone taps on the door
prideaux coiled with grief and anger suddenly gets up
roach stands in the doorway carrying a gift a boot scrape made in woodwork
i made you something
prideaux stares at the boot scrape
i dont want you hanging around here
keep away from me from now on
go and join the others
roach stands frozen
just bloody join in
go and play damn you
he watches roach walk to the edge of the field and stand mutely at the side
a ball rolls towards him
roach goes to kick it
he tries again running out of shot
paris department store evening aa tarr is walking through a busy street
he stops to light a cigarette
a woman in a yellow dress appears reflected in the glass
shes holding the hands of two children
for a moment it looks like irina
tarr spins round but the woman has disappeared
he stares after her hoping to catch a glimpse of her again
smiley walks back into the lobby hesitates for a moment then pushes on through the turnstile
george takes his place at the baronial chair
he examines the chess piece in his hand
we see it is labelled karla
he toys with it for a moment then places it on the table in front of him clears his throat
shall we begin
through the open door smileys new inner circle begin to enter and take their place at the table around him
