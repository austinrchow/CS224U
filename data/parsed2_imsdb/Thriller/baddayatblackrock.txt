written by don mcguire and millard kaufman based on the story bad day at hondo by howard breslin abandoned in an extreme state of dilapidation
the structure is blistered by the resolute sun the roof is weather warped
dry rot and mildew wage a relentless battle against the foundation
between the building and the tracks is a long somewhat narrow platform its floorboards twisted by time termites and the elements
the match board overhang of the building throwing some little shade to a portion of the platform sags and bellies
from the overhang is appended a rectangular panel on which in flaky paint the town is identified one of the broken wires holding the panel is longer than the other
cocking the sign irregularly
the railroad tracks reach endlessly into the horizon
past the town on each side stretches the ocean like prairie with sand dunes rising and falling monotonously shouldering each other toward infinity
the morning sun lays over this wasteland of the american southwest a gigantic yellow bruise from which heat waves like bloodshot arteries spread themselves over the poisoned sky
a small shack stands next to the station separated from it by a narrow alleyway and leaning toward the larger building as if for support
the words postal telegraph are arced across its dusty vitrine
an old straight backed chair reinforced with twisted wire is tilted against the north west corner of the shack
in it is mr
hastings the postal telegraph agent a man of middle years and exorbitant mediocrity
he sits there spinelessly fingering a wart on his receding chin and once in a while for variety rubbing a knuckle under his watery nose
the town is minute dismal and forgotten crouching in isolation where the single line of railroad track intersects a secondary dirt road
the twin strips of steel glisten in the fierce sunlight fencing the dreary plain from the false fronts of the town
is the bluff of a black stony mountain
against this ancient mass the houses of black rocks single street see map p
a are scanty in number and insignificant in architecture a conglomerate paint peeled modern trussed together with rusty nails and battered tin strips torn from signs
the town and the terrain surrounding it have if nothing else the quality of inertia and immutibility nothing moves not even an insect nothing breathes not even the wind
town and terrain seem to be trapped caught and held forever in the sullen abrasive earth
sequence omitted from original script
jarring in its power as it ramrods across the desert its diesel engines pounding
its horn wonks twice blasting the shatterable air
nothing is changed nothing is altered
but look close and you will see a small shallow current of wind sweeping lazily across the dirt and dust of the single street
hold for a beat then main title appears
between the ensuing credits intercut a series of sharp long shots
the composition of each shot has that hard sun beaten texture of american primitive painting pressurized in its simplicity best exemplified perhaps by the work of grant wood
assayer and notary public mortician to the citizens of black rock who have departed to a better place and veterinarian to its lesser animals
an elderly somewhat untidy gentleman he sits nonchalantly on a chair outside the bar grill
idling with him are three or four other loafers among them sam the middle aged proprietor of the restaurant
doc glances casually at his watch no one else moves
the hot wind continues listlessly down the empty street
sequence omitted from original script
a tall attractive girl of twenty in dungarees and cotton shirt
she stands just outside the open barn like door of the garage staring from the compulsive force of habit at the endlessly receding tracks
the sultry wind its gustiness slightly increased blows through her fine dark hair
sequence omitted from original script
two enormous men
hector is tall and there is about him a nasty raw boned tautness coley is more the anthropoid type long thick arms and a round iron casing of a belly
they glance down the street watching incuriously a dust devil swirling in the wind
now the camera has completed its probe of the town and its denizens
main title and credits are completed
still spineless in his chair the chair still tilted against the shack
and far away we hear the horn of the streamliner two long wonks a short and a long engine whistle signal for approach to bridge crossing
hastings straightens up ever so slightly as he reacts to the oncoming train
moving at tremendous speed
with train barrelling toward it
the horn blasts three short wonks engine whistle signal for stopping at next station
getting jerkily to his feet as though charged by a galvanic current
the uncharacteristic speed of his movements throws the tilted chair to the station platform
he raises an arm to shield his watery eyes from the sun
almost inaudible as if to himself stopping
heading toward camera churning across the desert like a juggernaut
it pans past camera in a blur of speed
camera swings up on a level with the great iron wheels as the brakes are applied
the wheels shriek agonizingly against the rails kicking up cinders and a wild flurry of dust
she cuts speed brakes hissing and starts to slow down
shooting from rear of town toward the railroad tracks
the townspeople step out frowning cautious disturbed
the secure ritual of the train passing through never stopping has somehow for some unknown reason been violated
as his mouth tightens
his air of placidity vanishes leaving his features disturbed
her fine young face stiffens almost imperceptibly
her eyes are coated with a vague emptiness
she seems confused as she halfturns toward the hotel
coley trimble and hector david standing on the porch of the hotel
they seem tense responding variously to what might be fear
coleys nostrils flare his flat ugly mouth compresses
he looks profoundly serious
hector wipes a glob of dusty sweat from the socket of an eye and blinks rapidly
as he stands in surprise nervously alert watching the train as it comes to a complete stop
his jaw droops with the slackness of fear
sequence omitted from original script
with the train stationary before it
a sleek steel door of a pullman clangs open
a colored porter carrying a suitcase walks down the wrought iron steps
he is stately gray haired and lean with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate with trainmen
the man behind him is big shouldered a granite like wedge of a man with calm piercing eyes
there is about him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor but his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber familiarity with pain
his left arm hangs from his shoulder with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis while the hand is hidden in his pocket
the porter puts the suitcase on the platform
in the distance the town and its people are seen staring silently motionlessly
the big man glances toward them
he smiles a sad distasteful greeting to the town its wretched dust
its mean modest buildings
the porter disappears into the train as the conductor enters scene
he turns slowly following macreedys gaze
softly staring at the towns people man
they look woebegone and far away
looking around ill only be here twenty four hours
in a place like this it could be a lifetime
turning to face macreedy good luck mr
macreedy nods his thanks
the conductor signals the engineer o
and steps on the train
the diesels claxon blasts the torrid air ominously
the train slowly smoothly begins to move picking up speed
the cars slip past until quite suddenly the streamliner is gone
for a moment macreedy watches it
then quite unconsciously he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket taps the last one free of the pack sticks it between his lips and crumpling the
empty pack drops it beside the tracks
he takes a cardboard book of matches flicks it open bends a match in half with agile fingers and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper
the match flares the cigarette is lit
macreedy inhales exhales deeply and turns to pick up his suitcase
then he sees hastings who walks slowly almost painfully to him
his adams apple grapples protestingly with his collar
after a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk
you for black rock
easily thats right
uneasily there must be some mistake
im hastings the telegraph agent
nobody told me the train was stopping
with a ghost of a grin they didnt
upset i just said they didnt and they ought to
what i want to know why didnt they
shrugging probably didnt think it was important
its the first time the streamliner stopped here in four years
swallowing nervously you being met
you visiting folks or something
i mean whatdya want
i want to go to adobe flat
any cabs available
as if he hadnt heard right as if he wanted everyone in town to know adobe flat
he gulps recovers slightly no cabs
wheres the hotel
hastings looks at him blankly
the thousand yard stare of a hypnotic glazes his features
patiently i asked wheres the hotel
with his suitcase he cuts across a weedy path running into black rocks single street
for a moment hastings stares after him then he breaks hurriedly entering telegraph agents shack
as hastings fumbling picks up the phone
into mouthpiece hello pete
shooting down the street as macreedy slowly walks toward the hotel
not a person has moved each eye is glued on the stranger
the hollow rasp of macreedys tread on the wooden platform of the pavement seems shatteringly loud in the enveloping silence
as she follows the mans movement
sequence omitted from original script
as he walks along
he feels the eyes of everyone following him glaring at him
he halts looks around
the townspeople continue to eye him brazenly yet with an almost animal incuriosity
he grins and walks on past a cluster of five or six rfd mail boxes and a road sign its paint peeling its face punctured by three or four bullets
from a drunks pistol long ago
heading toward the hotel
is a relatively small farm equipment yard compressed between a general store which macreedy has just passed and the hotel just ahead
in the yard are a few tractors and among them huddles a tiny office
it is empty the front window is thick with dust
on it etched by an anonymous childish finger is a skull and crossbones
running diagonally across is the printed legend macreedy notes the inscription with a sort of wry bemusement
he walks on reaching the facade of the weather beaten hotel
a gust of wind swirls down the street momentarily engulfing macreedy and the entire area in a sudden eddying whirlpool
as it subsides
as he peers through the dust toward the dingy hotel
it has a narrow stoop and outsize bay windows on each side
macreedy mounts the hotel steps
at the top of the steps coley trimble and hector david watch him silently
hector is large and leanly muscular yet coley looms over him like a battleship
he is a gross behemoth of a man with sharp flinty eyes the size of glistening pinpoints and a slack oversized jaw
both men wear modern western work clothes but there is one incongruous accessory which hector affects
around his thick wrist is a watch with a large flat face and an elaborately tooled leather strap a cheap reproduction of one of those expensive swiss timepieces which among
many distinguished accomplishments tells the day of the week the month of the year the phase of the moon etc
slowing up afternoon
no reaction from hector
blocking doorway anything i can do for you
you run this hotel
pleasantly then theres nothing you can do for me
he brushes past coley and enters
turning to coley find smith
coley nods and heads down the street
hector enters the hotel
sequence omitted from original script
it is a typical small town hotel but crummier with a tiny lobby
macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as hector strolls in flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair
he picks up a newspaper but his eyes remain on macreedy
macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk
for a moment he studies the open registration ledger his eyes rove from the ink splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those world war ii banners the
imitation silk now stained and faded
it depicts a shrieking eagle rampant clutching the flag in a claw
under it the legend near it a tacky placard proclaims feeling the eyes of hector on him macreedy turns
hector meets his gaze with bland insolent interest
now a young man his name is pete comes out of a small room behind the registration desk and walks up to it
there is a softness about his regular features a certain indefinable sugariness about his mouth
he seems tight lipped for lorn and uneasy as he faces macreedy across the counter
pleasantly id like a room
all filled up
a beat got any idea where i might stiffly shaking his head this is mister
theres been a war on
macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance
without shifting his gaze he slowly lets fall his small suitcase
it thuds softly on the frayed carpet
i thought it ended a couple of months ago
yeah but the o
macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before him
the clerk reaches out to close it
gently yet firmly macreedy stops him reopening the big book
he studies it a finger straying unconsciously inside his collar
on it to relieve the starchy stiffness
pete begins to fidget
you dont know about the o
without looking up tell me
well for establishments with lessn fifty rooms hotel keepers got to report regularly about
his voice fades desperately
about tenants and
drawing himself up there are penalties imposed
again his voice trails off
eyes still on the ledger you seem to have lots of vacancies
as i said
macreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys
he runs his splayed fingers over the key rack as
lots of vacancies
theyre everyone of em locked up
some are show rooms
with touching sincerity for cattle buyers feed salesmen
the others theyre spoken for rented to cowboys ranch hands
macreedy listens respectfully they pay by the month
for when they come into town
we provide for their every wish and comfort
weakly you understand
but while im pondering it get a room ready
just for tonight
picking key from rack at random this one
pete opens his mouth but no sound comes out
glowering at pete
as macreedy signs the ledger
signing sure could use a bath
where is it
he picks up the key
head of the stairs
macreedy nods reaches for the bag at his feet
then he hesitates looks at hector
i dont know just why youre interested but the names macreedy
grins its all in the ledger
slowly his eyes glued to macreedys stiff arm you look like you need a hand
macreedy says nothing
the wales along his face harden
he picks up his bag and climbs the stairs
as he disappears hector lumbers to the desk and grabs the ledger
reading aloud john j
from los angeles
looking up i wanna know everything he does pete
check every call any mail
nodding and in the meantime
grinning harshly in the meantime ill crowd him a little
looking up the stairs see if hes got any iron in his blood
as pete bites his lower lip thoughtfully sequence omitted from original script
in a new bathrobe before a cracked discolored mirror
he draws a safety razor down his face completing his shave then he wipes a hand over the mirror which clouds with steam almost as fast as he can clear
the sound of bath water gurgling down the tub drain
he runs a tentative finger inside the collar of his robe pulling loose a price tag
he drops it carefully into a wastebasket
he turns on the faucet at the sink to rinse his shaving brush
the rusty pipes cough and rumble roaring as a trickle of water arrives while the drain sucks loudly at its departure
he dries the razor turns off the faucet and exits
as he walks down the dark narrow hall
he wears the bathrobe and slippers a large towel is draped over his head like a prize fighter
he stops outside a door pushes the towel from his head to his neck and puts his hand on the knob
he is about to insert the key when he tenses
slowly silently he turns the knob and throws open the door
next to the door in the corner of the small sparsely furnished room is macreedys suitcase open its contents askew and scattered over the dusty floor
on the bed sprawls hector david his gigantic body straining the springs
he lies on his back hands clasped easily under his head thick legs crossed his stetson tilted over his low forehead
he is completely unconcerned by macreedys entrance
for a moment macreedy stares at him
slightly amused i think you have the wrong room
not budging you think so
slowly his eyes still on macreedy hector takes off his elaborate wrist watch and slides it gently into his pants pocket
what else you got on your mind
macreedy pauses and takes in the situation
he refuses to be baited
nothing i guess
if you had a mind boy youd of heard what pete downstairs said
he said these here rooms are for us cowboys
for our every wish and comfort
and this i guess is yours
when im in town
and im in town as any fool can see
you see that dont you boy
i guess i do
would you mind very much if i sort of
he gestures toward his suitcase and clothing clean up this mess and get another room
not at all
but if you want this room real bad
he raises his enormous bulk to a sitting position rubbing the knuckles of one big fist with the palm of his other hand we could maybe settle your claim without
all this talk
no answer from macreedy if a man dont claim whats rightfully hisn hes nuthin
what do you think
i guess so
you guess so
but still you aint claimin this room
i guess not
youre all the time guessin boy
dont you ever know anything
one thing i know
since i got off the train ive been needled
after a beat slowly i guess i dont rightly know
for a moment their eyes lock
then macreedy goes to his suitcase and throws his clothes in it
as he goes out the door
sequence omitted from original script
they sit around each with his own thoughts
they are generally stolid only sam seems nervous
he looks up eagerly as doc velie enters the lobby
as he joins sam
sam walks light for a big man doc
irritated you know who
doc grins impishly sams anger subsides what do you think doc
why ask me
hes no salesman thats sure
again the impish grin unless hes peddling dynamite
squirming visibly maybe hes a cop or something
ever see a cop with a stiff arm
squinting thoughtfully maybe his arms all right
maybe hes just holding tight to something in his pocket
scoffing like what
a stick of t n gleefully to blow up this whole mangy miserable town
with sudden almost naive seriousness why are you so interested sam
i mean if i was that interested
his eyes look up toward the hotel stairs o
id ask him
sam follows docs gaze
macreedy walks down the stairs
pete looks up from the desk
he is about to dart behind the partition when
he walks to the desk smiling at pete
doc sam and the loafers watch
got any cigarettes
pete studies him then bends under the counter coming up with a pack
doc leaves sam and is slowly walking toward the stranger eyeing him curiously
this is all
macreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack dexterously using the fingers of his left hand
how long you staying
in my new room you mean
flatly im staying
i mean in the hotel
just about twenty four hours
i was just askin
you expecting a convention
doggedly i was just askin
macreedy looks at him inhales deeply on his cigarette then as he slowly lets the smoke out removes the cigarette and looks at it
now doc is at the desk not far from macreedy
macreedy starts out then turns to pete
where can i rent a car
i dont know
macreedy smiles and sighs tiredly
as to a child lets put it this way if i had a car and if i wanted to put gas in it where would i go
refusing to cooperate but you dont have a car
to macreedy you might try the garage at the end of the street
macreedy pauses looking at doc who blandly returns his stare
macreedy smiles and walks toward the door pete doc et al watching him
he goes out
as macreedy walks down hotel steps a station wagon pulls up just before him
tied with a rope to the right front fender is a magnificent eight point buck
a stain of dry blood weaves an uneven course down his glossy flank from an unmistakable bullet hole in his shoulder
two men get out of the car one of them is coley trimble
he sees macreedy coming toward him
he stands motionless in the center of the narrow pavement picking at his nose with the detachment of a child
the other man is broad and excessively masculine as he swings out from behind the wheel
he walks around the car joining coley at the curb
macreedy comes on
the man with coley looks at the stranger with colossal indifference as expressionless as the soil of black rock
his handsome face under a dusty hunting cap is taut and hard and wind shaven
next to coley he stands motionless except for the wisp of smoke from a black cuban cigarette between his thin lips
the loafers who had been ensconced in the hotel lobby move out the door and stand on the porch
they watch macreedy coley and reno smith the handsome taut faced man
silence soems to settle over everything
it is macreedy who breaks it
grinning wearily at coley here we go again
gently he walks around coley and reno smith and continues down the street
coleys eyes follow him
smith goes up the steps of the hotel and enters the lobby
coley quickly follows him
the loafers on the porch go back inside
the loafers resume their familiar places as smith walks briskly to the clerks desk
pete in anticipation opens the hotel register places it before smith deferentially gesturing toward the open register thats all i know about him mr
smith doesnt answer he looks up thoughtfully
his eyes harden almost imperceptibly as he sees coley across the narrow room looking out the window after macreedy
to coleys back sit down
spinning to face him i was only
interrupting sit down
coley sits in the nearest chair
beyond smith still resting easily against the high counter of petes desk the gigantic figure of hector appears at the top of the stairs
he comes down and joins smith
after a pause pretty cool guy
doesnt push easy
frowning thats it thats just it
he pushes too easy
maybe we oughtta
he hesitates as doc velie sidles amiably into earshot
what do you want doc
archly i was just wondering what all you people were worrying about
smith looks at him coldly not that i have the slightest idea
you wonder too much and you talk too much
pauses its a bad parlay doc
i hold no truck with silence
impishly i got nothing to hide
suddenly towering over doc whatre you tryin to say
its just you worry about the stranger only if you look at him
slowly from a certain aspect
how do you look at him doc
firmly with the innocence of a fresh laid egg
after a pause keep it up doc
make bad jokes
he starts to walk toward the window doc and hector following him and some day ill have coley wash out your mouth with lye
smith looks thoughtfully out the window
macreedy down the end of the block saunters easily up to lizs garage
the garage without a door opens on the street
against the front of the building is parked a battered bicycle
on one of the barnlike walls a boy of nine is drawing laboriously with a piece of chalk
he puts the last flourish to a skull and crossbones identical with that seen earlier on the window of the equipment yard office
macreedy stops a few feet from him waiting until the boy prints t
as he steps back to admire his handiwork
he approaches the wall raising his chalk
this your garage
a beat wheres the man it belongs to
aint a man
as macreedy opens his mouth to interrogate further
lady runs this garage
again a pause
has just completed the final letter of the word hates
and again as macreedy opens his mouth
shes not here
whered she go
shrugging i dunno
when will she be back
again the pause
steps back having completed his work which of course broadcasts the fact that t
and again as macreedy begins to speak
in about ten minutes
with a grin thanks
turns pulls the bike away from the building completes a fastidious pony express and peddles furiously out of scene
as macreedy after a moments hesitation starts down it
from the far end at the telegraph agents shack a figure starts running toward macreedy
it is hastings
intercut between the two men
hastings in his concentration doesnt see the stranger until he is almost upon him
he slows down suddenly awkwardly to a self conscious walk
macreedy grins at him passes on shaking his head speculatively
hastings with a parting glance gallops up the hotel steps
smith coley hector pete doc sam et al are still in evidence
smith is in a tight little group at the desk with coley hector and pete
doc has taken a position at the window looking out
hastings bursts in and half runs to smith
as the excited telegraph agent speaks
i called the circle t
he aint got business there not if they dont know him
smith ignores him thinking
hastings breathes heavily
to hastings send a wire to nick gandi in los angeles
tell him to find out all he can about john j
tell him i want to know fast
sign my name
hastings nods scribbling on a pad
what was that
g a n d i
care of the blake hotel
hastings nods and hurriedly exits
after a beat whos gandi
smith looks at coley trying to decide if the question in any way challenges his authority
he concludes not
hes a private detective
beat i drive to l
now and then
slightly worried hell get us the dope
hell get us anything for twenty bucks a day and expenses
hector frowns hector you worry too fast and too easy
its just i dont like it
maybe hes just passing through
dont bet on it
he can only mean trouble
smiles faintly hector youre jumpy as a stall horse
doggedly we oughtta see him
talk to him
quietly about what
hector doesnt answer whatll we talk to him about
the birds the bees
pauses you tried whered it get you
uncomfortably i only thought
you only thought
after a beat what do we do
what do you do
like pete here
pete nods his brow furrowed uncomfortably in a frown
thats all you do
but while you wait
i talk to him
at this point the brittle silence is cracked by
smith and those around him look off in the direction of doc
he turns in the direction of smith and the others
now what do you know
macreedy seems to be heading for the jail
impishly now what do you suppose hed want to see the sheriff about
smith goes to the window edging doc to one side with a shoulder
he looks out grimly
macreedy down the street cuts up the steps of the jail
smith staring out the window with a frown
doc watching him out of the corner of his eye a bemused expression crossing his puckish features
sequence omitted from original script
angle on macreedy as he enters the jail
it is small and dirty with only a tired desk two chairs and the usual police posters on the wall
one side leads to the cell block and macreedy heads for it
angle from interior of cell block comprising two cells both of which are open
a man is asleep in the lower bunk of the front cell
the keys are in the lock
macreedy shakes his head and starts to close the creaking cell door
sheriff tim horn the man in the bunk lifts his head blinking his bleary eyes
he is in terrible shape
hold it friend
he manages to crawl off the bunk and out toward macreedy
grinning i aint hankerin to get locked in my own jail
i thought you were a guest
as it happens im the host
he walks out of the cell macreedy following him into the office
tim breaks out a bottle of booze starts to take a snort then stops offers it to macreedy
dont blame you
he takes a belt that would incapacitate half the county
he finishes smacks his lips lays the bottle down and falls into a chair
he looks up at macreedy
suddenly mean whatre you lookin at
easy you tell me
after a beat relaxing i aint always this bad just that last night me and my pal doc velie we did a little celebratin
at least i did
what were you celebrating
shrugs you name it
studies macreedy what do you want
my names macreedy
i came in on the streamliner
tim studies him trying to focus
i said i came in
interrupting you aint from around here
up tucson way phoenix
you aint sellin cattle nor seed nor nothin like that
sighs then distinctly as to a child all i want from you is a little information
ive got to get to a place called adobe flat
reacts then tight lipped this aint no information bureau
macreedy starts to say something then stops
one thing about black rock everybodys polite
makes for gracious living
nobody asked you here
how do you know
he moves toward the door with a rueful grin starting after him what about adobe flat
im looking for a man named komako
the sheriff reaches for his bottle
in his haste he drops it
macreedys hand moves quickly catching the bottle before it hits the floor
almost a disaster
sinking back in his chair a fate worsen death
he takes the bottle from macreedy you move fast for a crip
for a big man
for a moment heavy silence
what about komako
slowly if theres no further questions
macreedy grins harshly and exits
tim watches him go then slowly reaches for the bottle
he pauses looks at his shaking hand
then he withdraws it and just sits in the chair staring blindly ahead seeing nothing
frowning deep in thought macreedy walks down the dusty street
as he reaches the hotel
macreedy stops looks toward smith as he walks out to meet him
thats the friendliest word ive heard since i got here
as smith joins him he walks on
smith falls in step beside him
go with them
grins boyishly my name is smith
i own the triple bar ranch
holds out his hand macreedy shakes it i want to apologize for some of the folks in town
they act like theyre sitting on a keg
i dont know
nothing like that
were a little suspicious of strangers is all
hangover from the old days
the old west
i thought the tradition of the old west was hospitality
with a sincere smile im trying to be hospitable mr
boyishly pushes his dusty cap back on his head going to be around for a while
how would you like to go hunting tomorrow
id be proud to have you as my guest
thanks but im afraid not
with admirable candor you mean because of your arm
slaps macreedys shoulder in a friendly understanding gesture i knew a man once lost an arm in a threshing accident
used to hunt all the time
almost too blandly but he was quite a man
pauses then with discreet and charming gravity im sorry
what i mean is if theres anything i can do while youre around
im looking for
sighs never mind
quietly youre looking for what mr
eyeing him a man named komako
no hesitation komako sure i remember him japanese farmer
never had a chance
he got here in just before pearl harbor
three months later he was shipped to one of those relocation centers
shaking his head tough
which one did he go to
you think maybe if i wrote him the letter would be forwarded
im sure it would
write your letter
ill see it gets out tonight
it wouldnt be too much trouble
no trouble at all
because i think it would be a great deal of trouble for you
its been a great deal of trouble for me
at this point they are in front of
macreedy stops as does smith
he looks keenly at smith as he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half dozen letters
i wrote these letters to komako
they werent forwarded
they were returned address unknown
he smiles grimly at smith so i guess theres nothing you can do for me after all
smith opens his mouth to reply when the noise of a jeep o
the jeep comes into shot
liz brooks at the wheel cuts the engine and jumps out
smith ambles silently to a wall and leans against it
liz reaches behind the drivers seat and hoists with both hands and some effort a five gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep
as she rests it on the rear fender
going to her need a little help
the girl looks at smith who has made no attempt to help her
i can manage
she lifts the drum to the ground
well i need a little help
she looks at him questioningly id like to rent your jeep
itll be two dollars an hour gas extra and ten dollars for my time
to liz arent you going to ask him where he wants to go
liz looks from smith to macreedy puzzled
he wants to go to adobe flat
macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek smiths for instructions
quickly he moves in
the roads marked
its about six seven miles down
then i wont need your time
macreedy hands her a bill
she fumbles with it not knowing what else to do
her eyes drift to macreedys stiff arm
uneasily i thought you might
need a little help
i can manage
he steps toward the jeep as
do you have a license to rent cars
you could get into trouble
its all right
i wont mention it to the sheriff
he steps into jeep and with one hand expertly manipulating the controls drives off
smith turns his attention to the girl
slowly you shouldnt have done that
i thought it would be better if he went out there and got done with it
smith looks at her sharply i mean what could he find out
for a moment smith doesnt answer
instead with a half frown he lifts the bill macreedy had given her from lizs hand
as he studies it this is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life
he crumples it pokes the wad in her hand and walks off down the street as
sequence omitted from original script
tim sits in his chair still staring sightlessly at the whiskey bottle
he looks from tim to the bottle on the table then back to tim
after a beat disinterestedly what did he want the stranger
abstractedly he asked about komako
looking up at smith you think hell kick up a storm
easily a storm
i dont know
all i know i dont want trouble around here
pauses awkwardly then never again
you dont know anything about komako now do you tim
i do not
thats the point
the point is what you dont know cant hurt you
maybe theres something i ought to know
maybe i ought to ask you
before the stranger comes back and starts breathing down my neck
a faint smile tim youre a lost ball in the high weeds
i told you a long time ago nothing happened for you to worry about
stands up facing smith thing is i do worry
maybe i aint much else but im sure a worrier
beat then with soft emphasis and im still the law
then do your job tim
what is my job mr
maybe id better find out before macreedy does it for me
evenly macreedyll do nothing tim
and neither will you
suppose i decide to try
that would be dangerous
you got the body of a hippo tim but the brain of a rabbit
dont overtax it
he stares harshly at the sheriff
tim tries unsuccessfully to meet his gaze
then slowly he sits down
lowering his eyes mumbling yes mr
smith slowly walks behind tims chair and silently patronizingly pats the sheriffs slack shoulder
hastings is sitting at his desk
the telegraph ticker starts to splutter
hastings rushes to it
he listens and starts to scribble
then he gulps nervously a confused expression on his face
as the telegraph key stops as suddenly as it had begun hastings jumps up frantically and holding the sheet of paper runs out of the shack
as he runs toward hotel
with doc sam coley hector and pete on the porch
hastings runs up the steps pausing momentarily
his jaws move but camera is too far away to pick up his obvious question
coley gestures toward the jail then hastings turns and runs down the steps followed by doc et al
hastings runs down the street toward the jail followed by doc et al
as hastings runs up the steps with a hobnailed clatter
smith comes out to investigate followed by tim
doc et al are congregated at the foot of the steps
hastings slaps the sheet of paper in front of smith
everyone stares at smith waiting for a reaction everyone except tim who stares straight ahead seeing nothing and doc whose eyes are locked sympathetically on tim
smith finishes reading the wire
his face is expressionless
after a moment
to smith from l
smith doesnt answer but
from that private detective
to smith what does he say
who is this guy
never heard of him thats what he says
he checked and theres no john j
no listing no record no information
quietly after a beat to smith where does that leave us
ill tell you where
he folds the message carefully puts it in his pocket
abruptly tim turns and disappears inside his office
smith with some restraint walks down the steps to the street
as he takes coleys arm and petes
the trio moves away taking a position perhaps feet from doc
hector sam and hastings move toward them
sequence omitted from original script
at a respectful distance are hector sam and hastings
shoot parallel to tracks which disappear far into the horizon
the following dialogue is delivered in an undertone
turning to coley now coley
takes a breath then i think macreedys a nothing
so theres nothing to worry about
a beat you got brains you have
squirming but what can he find out
that komako was
smith glares at him suppose he finds out
a nobody like macreedy can raise a pretty big stink
the point is
who would miss a nobody like macreedy if he just say disappeared
coley is terribly preoccupied balances himself like a child on a steel rail
galvanized from the rail huh
why dont we wait
wait for what
i mean maybe he wont find anything
maybe hell just go away
i know those maimed guys
their minds get twisted
they put on hair shirts and act like martyrs
theyre all of em do gooders trouble makers freaks
but theres no danger yet
lets wait and see
interrupting appealing to coley as an equal no danger he says
this guys like a carrier of small pox
since he arrives theres been a fever in this town an infection
and its spreading
he glances from coley to pete hastings has been in a sick sweat running around shooting off his face
doc for the first time in four years gets snotty with me
to pete your own sister acts like a fool
hotly shes just a kid
she must have strained every muscle in her head to get so stupid
renting him a jeep
and tim tim the rum dum
tim suddenly decides hes gotta act like a sheriff
to coley gesturing at pete and he says whats the danger
brittle silence for a moment
easily of course if you want to take the chance
pete doesnt answer
grimly not me
all right then
its not all right
youre so mighty quick to kill hes not an animal
to coley with mock surprise well listen to little spitfire
turning slowly on pete you sniveling toad
im saving your neck
if i dont who will
squirming all i said
your sister with the rocks in her head
pete is silent
one thing about your sister shes got twice the guts you have
youre only fit for running away
its too late for that
belligerently slowly at pete hes in this and he aint running no place
there is a long electric silence
pete is defeated
finally all right then
he pauses for emphasis
then as he starts to talk again
tim stands facing the wall shoulders hunched suffering
doc comes in and watches him silently tim turns facing doc turns again to concentrate on a faded newspaper photograph framed and hanging on the wall
shooting over his shoulder
focal point the photograph
it shows a widly grinning moderately alert and healthy tim of perhaps five years ago
he is wearing proudly his badge of office and behind him mildly interested in the proceedings is reno smith his erstwhile sponsor
the heading on the photo reads deputy sheriff named for black rock
tim takes the photo off the wall and holding it turns to face doc
let smith find himself a new boy
i cant take it another day
pauses looks at doc if youre a sheriff they gotta respect you otherwise you cant do your job
shakes his head they just laugh
i dont laugh tim
why dont you
cut it out tim
in the name of well adjusted manhood snap out of it
youre going to get a complex or something
four years ago if id of done my job
if id of checked up and found out what happened
but i didnt
just like smith figured
what could you have found out
they told you a story
you had to believe it
do you believe it
doc squirms but doesnt answer
do you know what happened
i dont know
ironically i lead a quiet contemplative life
me i didnt even try to find out
a beat dont you understand
he taps the badge on his chest when you wear that badge youre the law
and when something happens against the law youre supposed to do something about it
its your job
i did nothin
and thats whats eatin me
what kind of prescription you got for that
i dont know
ive never been able to find one for myself
tim takes off his badge and throws it on the desk
only one thing dont quit tim
maybe this feller macreedy has the prescription
they look at each other
slowly tim picks up his badge and pins it back on
sequence omitted from original script
an old marker jutting on an angle at the side of the road reads adobe flat
beneath it an arrow points ahead
macreedy steers the jeep up the narrow rutted trail between a serious of enormous boulders
as he drives to the far end of the boulders reaching a flat piece of land completely surrounded by rocks
beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned out ranch house and an abandoned well
sequence omitted from original script
in the wreckage
the remains of an iron bed
the burned out shell of a pick up truck
part of a stove
a morass of bottles all sizes and shapes some of them broken
macreedy halts momentarily beside the well
reaching out he touches the warped sun beaten boards that cover the mouth
he removes one and picking up a pebble drops it through the opening
there is a long beat and then from far far below we hear a faint plunk o
he replaces the board and walks to a broken wall
he touches the burned out frame of a picture
the frame falls to the ground leaving an un scorched square on the surface of the wall
he goes past a solitary standing stone chimney
suddenly he halts arrested by something among the rubble the rottenness and the ashes
surrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular patch of lovely wild flowers
studying the brightly colored flowers
his face is lined in thought
he stoops gathers a few buds in his hand
he examines them his brow furrowed
as he slowly twirls a flower between thumb and forefinger camera pans from macreedy in a long slow arc taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland
camera rises tilting upward to a cliff far away and shielded from macreedys view by the intervening rocks and ridges
and on it the outline of an automobile
it is parked on a narrow dirt road
on one side of the road the cliff falls abruptly to the valley far below on the other the steep shaly outcropping continues to rise
for a moment camera holds on the car
then it pans slowly upward about fifty feet holding this time on
where a man is looking off toward adobe flat through a pair of high powered glasses
the man is coley trimble
grimly he walks toward the jeep still holding the wild flowers
now he pockets them jumps into the vehicle and drives off
continues to train his glasses on macreedy far below in the moving jeep
driving steadily over rough rocky terrain
climbs down from the pinnacle of the cliff and enters a big powerful packard sedan
shifts to low gear as the jeep presses into hilly country
turns on the ignition
as it winds along a road with the cliff rising on one side and falling off steeply on the other
he rounds a curve passes an insignificant side road drives on
the car with coley at the wheel pulls out follows macreedy
intercut between the two cars with the distance between them constantly diminishing
sequence omitted from original script
a straightaway cutting through rocky outcroppings on both sides
macreedys jeep roars by pursued by the gaining packard
for the first time he is aware that he is being followed and that the man at the wheel of the big packard is coley
picking up tremendous speed
proceeding over a series of turns inclines declivities according to location terrain
engines roar brakes whinny tires scream skidding on the turns
as coley overtakes macreedy
he steers the big car within a foot or two of the jeep
the terrain has steepened on the right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor far below but a few inches of soft shoulder
as macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn coley tries to come inside him
macreedy fighting for control of the veering jeep succeeds in cutting him off
in the approach coley cuts sharp into the jeep
the jeep seems to roll with the blow then leaps ahead maneuvering the turn
coley is flustered his face blood shot with fury
he seems to generate an atmosphere of vicious cruel craziness the wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual obscene
he floorboards the packard
like some monstrous battering ram the heavy car smashes into the jeeps rear bumper kicking the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead
coley floorboards the gas pedal again
each time he slams into the jeep with sickening force with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal
with one arm he works frantically to keep his under sized car on the twisty road
he sees ahead a precipitous cliff falling off on an impossibly sharp curve
he makes a decision
just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual however steep by normal standards
he swings the jeep off the road onto the declivity
the car plunges downward miraculously upright
macreedy jockeys it to a whirring shuddering halt in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw
macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain side with the road at its summit
standing at the edge of the road peering down at him
coley turns emphatically gets into car drives off
his face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust kicked up by the grinding wheels
he exhales heavily and runs a shaky hand across the side of his head
he becomes aware suddenly of a noise a trickling an unmistakable tinkle as of running water
he frowns opens the jeep door
as macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open
the noise continues
macreedy examines the engine and finds the difficulty
focal point the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken
with his hand macreedy screws it tight
as macreedy lowers the hood re enters jeep
he turns on ignition
the engine fires
as he drives slowly out of the ravine
his long face even more horsey than usual with half an apple in his mouth
he stands in front of the grocery store with the baskets of fruit on the sidewalk
he looks up stops crunching
at the window of the bar grill cleaning an ear with a toothpick
he looks out
the toothpick is motionless
fidgeting outside his shack
he looks up
his adams apple turns completely over
sequence omitted from original script
macreedy slowly driving the jeep toward lizs garage
he looks neither to the right nor left
standing on the porch of the hotel watching
smiths face compresses and his eyes swivel to rest on coleys with cold contemptuous anger
coley licks his lips uneasily
smith turns and enters the hotel
coley meekly follows
he brakes the jeep before the garage
no one is there
he parks the vehicle gets out and heads down the street
macreedy is about to go up the steps when he sees coleys car at the curb
both right fenders are creased
an ugly jagged break has split the front bumper almost in half one part angling crazily toward the sky the other drooping in the dust of the road
smith and coley come out of the hotel
they stand on the porch watching macreedy as he in turn watches the car
they exchange a glance
smith nods so
well if its not macreedy the worlds champion road hog
he walks down the steps to the street joining macreedy
smith remains on the porch
its a small world
but such an unfriendly one
now why did you want to crowd me off the road
with a slow grin im kind of sorry if ive incurred your displeasure
look what you did to my car
if theres anything i can do to make up for it
you ought to be careful man all that one arm driving
id be glad to pay the damages
its a threat to life and limb
fortunately no one was hurt
you could get yourself killed that way nosin all over the countryside
thats the real danger i can see that
why thats pretty smart of you
how long you intend to keep it up
im getting out of here right now
he walks up the steps past smith and into the hotel
coley glances up at smith grinning with self satisfaction like a small boy who has carried out perfectly the instructions of his teacher
the lobby empty except for pete behind the desk
macreedy goes to him
pete seems elaborately occupied arranging and re arranging a few file cards
smith enters the lobby
he stands in b
watching macreedy and the desk clerk
to pete still expecting that convention
looking up what
if youre expecting any extra cowboys my room is available
youre checking out
nodding is there a train through here tonight
nothing till tomorrow morning
i know that
how about freights
pete shakes his head milk train
after the streamliner
closest stop is sand city thirty two miles away
a beat youre in such a hurry you should have never got off here
im inclined to agree with you
he turns walks toward porch
pete looks at smith
smiths eyes follow macreedy
sequence omitted from original script
in the gloom of the lube pit lizs mechanic a dirty old man is draining the oil out of the crankcase of the car on the rack
the girl stands beside the pit silently watching the old man
now she pauses looks o
toward the open garage doors
entering the scene stopping to look at lizs jeep parked in front of the wide doors
he turns his eyes vaguely in the direction of liz but he doesnt see her in the shadows behind the car on the rack he advances a step pausing
sequence omitted from original script
she does not answer
instead she silently twists the crankcase petcock stopping the flow of oil
she watches macreedy closely
macreedy again shifts his eyes to the jeep then with decision he goes to a work bench opening the drawers and rummaging among the contents
if youre looking for the jeep key
macreedy turns as liz comes toward him
she gestures toward the open drawers
its not there
macreedy waits for her to go on
she stands there staring at him
after a beat in that case where do you suggest i look
she turns walks back toward the lube pit
over her shoulders the jeeps not for rent
it was just a few hours ago
flatly things change
with grim amusement sure
and smith is the kid who changes em
she doesnt answer
macreedy goes to her
softly whats the matter with this town of yours
its none of your concern
then why are they all so concerned about me
am i concerned
no youre not
easily but it strikes me youre a little too unconcerned
so unconcerned you wont even rent me a jeep
flaring i dont run a taxi service
i dont have a license
i wish others in this town were as scrupulously devoted to law and order as you are
hotly why dont you lay off
if you dont like it here go back where you came from
they try to kill me and you feel persecuted
i dont want to get involved
involved in what
retreating whatever youre up to
whatever happens ive got to go on living here
these people are my neighbors my friends
all of them
slowly this is my town mr
macreedy like it or not
whatever happened here it was long ago now its
evenly dead and buried
a beat whatever did happen you dont seem to like it
why do you stick around
after a beat because of my brother
hed never leave
didnt you ever think of going without him
youre sort of independent and hes
thats why i couldnt leave him
softly what did your brother do
flaring again what do you care
what do you care about black rock
only therere not many places like this in america but even one is too many
because i think something sort of bad happened here
frowning something i cant find the handle to
you just think so
you dont know
this much i know the rule of law has been suspended in this town
the gorillas have taken over
youre a fine one to talk
you come in here sneaking around trying to steal the key to my jeep
i kind of had a notion that was the only way i could get it
she opens her mouth to answer but she doesnt know what to say
simply was i wrong miss brooks
he waits as she tries to answer and again she cant
for a moment he watches her struggle in anguished silence with herself
then he turns and goes out
walks thoughtfully down street
he comes abreast of hotel
where smith is still sitting
for a moment he watches macreedy speculatively then
reasonably as macreedy turns toward him id like to ask you a few questions
as long as youre around
walking up steps im around all right
he stands facing smith on the porch then
with just a touch of wryness you probably know that miss brooks is no longer in the car rental business
i wouldnt want to see that girl get into trouble
what with rental permits gas rationing
you know what i mean
i admire your sturdy sense of responsibility
dismissively its just a girl like that has a future
lets talk about my future
almost slyly do you have the time
i dont seem to be going any place
he takes the other chair
after a pause i hear you handle a jeep real well
i have a way with jeeps
a certain familiarity
i think i understand
youre an army man
looking at macreedys stiff arm whered you get it
i tried to get in myself the day after those rats bombed pearl harbor
what stopped you
they wouldnt take me
the morning after pearl i was the first man in line at marine recruiting in sand city
and they wouldnt take me
what do you do in los angeles mr
youre a pretty young man
you might say i was forced into retirement
what were you looking for in adobe flat
komako like i told you
like you told me he wasnt there
smith laughs quietly
whats so funny
its just i dont believe you
i believe a man is as big as what he seeks
i believe youre a big man mr
flattery will get you nowhere
why would a man like you be looking for a lousy jap farmer
maybe im not so big
yes you are
a beat looking hard at macreedy i believe that a man is as big as the things that make him mad
nobody around here has been big enough to make you mad
what makes you mad mr
nothing in particular
bemused i see
youre a big man too
calmly the japanese make you mad
after the sneak attack on pearl harbor
and komako made you mad
its the same thing
scoffing loyal japanese americans thats a laugh
theyre mad dogs
look at corregidor the death march
what did komako have to do with corregidor
wasnt he a jap
look macreedy theres a law in this county against shooting dogs
but if i see a mad dog loose i dont wait for him to bite me
exhales sharply shaking his head with irritation i swear youre beginning to make me mad
calmly all strangers do
some of em
when they come here snooping
snooping for what
i mean outsiders coming around looking for something
pressing for what
i dont know
people are always looking for something in this part of the west
to the historian its the old west
to the book writers its the wild west
to the businessmen its the undeveloped west
they all say were backward and poor and i guess we are
snorts we dont even have enough water
a beat but this place to us is our west
heatedly i just wish theyd leave us alone
leave you alone to do what
coldly i dont know what you mean
what happened to komako
he went away i told you
shortly after he left a bunch of kids got fooling around out his place
they burned it down
it was one of those things you know how kids are
macreedy laughs quietly
only i dont believe you
any more than i believed you about the letters
smiling you dont seem to believe anything i say
vaguely yes i do about businessmen for instance
i think a businessman would be interested in adobe flat
all that land lying fallow
could be put to some use
like a graveyard
smith opens his mouth to speak but macreedy goes on a historian might be interested too
because of the strange customs around here such as burying cattle
calmly somethings buried out there
he takes the wild flowers from his pocket holding them in front of smith
see these wild flowers
that means a grave
ive seen it overseas
i figure it isnt a mans grave or someone would have marked it
sort of a mystery isnt it
maybe you can figure it out
macreedy gets up half turns to smith
he starts down the steps
why not give it a whirl
macreedy turns itll help you pass the time
continued meaningfully for a while
i got other things to do
he turns and walks down the street
headed towards docs establishment
the building which serves doc as home office and laboratory has centered on a pane of glass and in the lower right hand corner a few of the peeled gold
and black letters are completely missing
the building is separated from the structure next to it by an alleyway
filling the narrow passage is hector david his long massive body wedged against the wall like an unkempt monument
his little pig eyes meet macreedys
hector spits in the dust with bland insolence
walks up the steps and enters
dark and shadowy
at the far end of a hallway an insipid light bulb burns
macreedy goes toward it entering
devoted to the care and preservation of the dear departed
in the center of the room is a long rectangular slab stained with the juices of those unfortunates who have had occasion to rest thereon
the walls are lined with rickety bookcases jammed not with volumes but with the jugs and jars the chemicals and unguents of docs multiple callings
in a corner three or four neat pine boxes are stacked one on the other
doc sits at a cluttered desk feeding a large bowl of goldfish and sipping a glass of milk
he looks up as macreedy enters
pull up a chair
nodding can i use your phone
chuckles you know youre one of the few people whos ever been back here i can say that to
macreedy reaches for the phone book
if ive got you pegged and i think i have youre calling the state police
but if i was you and im purely glad im not id look it up myself
emphatically i wouldnt trust anybody around here including me
macreedy thinks it over and comes to a swift decision
he checks the phone book
then picking up phone
to doc thanks
a cubbyhole behind the hotel clerks desk in the lobby
at the switchboard is pete and above him tacked on the wall is the sign into phone
he looks up camera pulls back revealing smith standing beside him
the two men exchange a nod
into phone lines re busy
he clicks off the instrument macreedy slowly puts down the phone
doc sips his milk all the while staring queasily over the glass at macreedy
he puts it down his gaze still fixed on the stranger
sing song i know dont tell me lines all busy
theyll be busy all day
after a beat grimacing dont look at me like that
like im a potential customer
everybody is and i get em coming and going
he goes to a topographic map hanging on the wall a large impressive map faded fly blown and divided into sections
gesturing toward it first i sell em a piece of land
think they farm it
they dig for gold
he moves to photograph beside the map on the wall a large impressive photograph of a placer mine in operation
they rip off the top soil of ten winding hills
they sprint in here fog heaved with excitement lugging nuggets big and bright and shiny
he moves to his desk picks up a glistening blob of stone resting next to an assayers scales and examines it
rhetorically is it gold
he bangs the rock down next to the scales
it is not
do they quit
they do not
he moves to a third illustration a colored reproduction large and impressive of acres upon green acres of produce in bloom the kind of picture southern pacific places above its
with theatrical gesture toward reproduction then they decide to farm
in country so dry you have to prime a man before he can spit and before you can say fat sam theyre stalled stranded and starving
they get weevil brained and buttsprung
he moves to the coffins piled in a corner and runs his hand down the smooth pine sides with loving tenderness
simply so i bury em
a beat as he rejoins macreedy in the center of the room but why should i bore you with my triumphs
ive got a problem of my own
doc nods he points vaguely toward the street
like an old testament prophet theyre going to kill you with no hard feelings
nastily and youll just sit on your hands and let them
dont get waspish with me young feller
i feel for you but im consumed with apathy
why should i mix in
to save a life
i got enough trouble saving my own
he refills his glass from a milk bottle on the desk i try to live right and drink my orange juice every day
but mostly i try to mind my own business
which is something id advise you to do
its a little late for that
you can still get out of town
and youd better get out like a whisper
how can i
taking a key ring from his pocket i got sort of a limousine at your disposal
where is it
tossing him the key out back
macreedy snares the key and walks out
doc gets up to follow him
an old fashioned hearse with plate glass sides and elaborate lead candelabra docs limousine is parked a few steps from the door
macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as doc comes out and stands on the small back porch
macreedy turns on the ignition switch
his foot kicks over the starter but the spark doesnt catch
he tries again then again
he pauses frowns as doc comes down from the porch and joins him
concentrating on the dashboard wont start
nervously to macreedy something wrong
just wont start
again he presses the ignition switch
and suddenly in b
the great bulk of hector david looms up leaning against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway
his expression is almost dreamy
for a moment he stands there while macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine wheezes and grinds
then he ambles up to the hearse
gratuitously could be the wirin
why dont you look under the hood
for that i thank you
pause how much time you think ive got before
theyll wait at least till dark
angrily theyd be afraid to see each others faces
slapping docs shoulder lightly well so long doc
i cant say its been charming but
where are you going
i dont know
but im going on foot
thats no good
you stray ten yards off main street and youll be stone cold dead
offers macreedy a cigarette thats the situation in a nut
macreedy takes the cigarette lighting a match with one hand
he puts the fire to docs smoke and then lights his own
he inhales exhales thinking
macreedy gets out of the car
hector has already opened the hood
doc peers nervously over his shoulder
as they study the engine hectors horsey face appears behind them
he gestures toward the engine
focal point a hopeless snarl of ignition wires
its the wirin like i said
now wasnt that a good guess
slowly he takes off his wrist watch and puts it in his pants pocket
quietly it can be fixed
ignoring hector he bends over the engine controlling his obvious awareness that hector has fouled up the ignition
unless of course this here wire
reaching inside the hood pointing got broke or something
suddenly heatedly turning on hector do the nice little things like keep your big fat nose out of my business
hectors eyes go hard
he reaches out suddenly one great hand closing over the distributor cap
he yanks ripping the feed wires out of their sockets
triumphantly holding up the wires yep
its the wirin
still gripping the wires he walks off
doc simmers down
he turns to face macreedy who hasnt moved
now macreedy slowly lowers the hood of the car
softly after a beat im sorry son
you got to admit i tried
as if to himself maybe
if i cant get out of town maybe i can get the state cops in
irritably you tried the phone didnt you
you know what happened dont you
theres another way
ill be seeing you doc
he walks off
doc looks after him grimly
calling i hope youll be seeing me
macreedy stands at the high counter writing on a postal telegraph blank
behind the counter watching him nervously is hastings
at the agents elbow is a big pitcher with dew on the glass
it holds a pale liquid and a chunk of ice
his eyes on macreedy hastings refills a glass tumbler
he takes a gulp as macreedy puts down the pencil and pushes the message toward him
now hastings puts down his glass picks up the form and scans it hurriedly
he looks at macreedy eyes glazed with anxiety
you notifyin the state po lice
putting a bill on the counter thats what it says
hastings again refills his glass slopping the liquid over on the counter
he picks up the glass hesitates offers it awkwardly to macreedy
macreedy shakes his head
mopping his forehead its hot as billy be durned
he drinks puts down the glass
macreedy pushes the bill across the counter toward him
hastings picks it up gingerly then pauses
dont you like lemonade
i never thought much about it
it dont have the muzzle velocity of some other drinks drunk around here but its good for what ails you
after a beat what ails you mr
why are you so upset about
points this wire
are you afraid mr
a beat then softly i guess i am
awkwardly he puts macreedys bill back on the counter but whats the use talkin
with grudging respect you dont know what its like being scared
not unsympathetically you want me to describe the symptoms
right this minute im scared half to death
simply you should be
but not of the state police
stonily neither am i
then what are you afraid of
the grave at adobe flat
a grave nobody marked nobody knows anything about
that aint it either
is it smith
no answer is it
squirming look mr
im just a good neighbor
to smith you are
how about to komako
meeting macreedys eyes i never seen komako in my life
again pushes the bill toward hastings then send that wire and bring me the answer
youll do that wont you
pauses then worriedly picking up the bill yes sir
macreedy turns and walks out
hastings stands sweating staring hard at the message in his hand as
sequence omitted from original script
a few loafers are at the bar draped bonelessly on high stools
there is the usual array of bottles and glasses aligned before a cracked discolored mirror
in the corner is a jukebox
along the opposite wall is a line of low stools facing a counter covered with oil cloth thumb tacked in place
behind it is a greasy hot plate and a couple of soiled displays breakfast food soft drinks etc
at the grill counter is sam cleaning his finger nails with a toothpick
at the bar engaged in a worrisome conversation are four loafers franklin krool walt murtry ron bentham and sterling i tell you i wont have anything to do with it
nodding emphatically live and let live thats what i say
frowning i dont know
i just dont know
to bentham you gonna brood about it
or you want another beer
a beer i guess
he looks up and something makes him hesitate
stopping in front of the restaurant
on the window large rough capital letters in water paint proclaim macreedy pauses shrugs and then enters
sam is still working on his finger nails
he evidences little interest in the stranger but at the bar in b
the loafers stiffen
macreedy takes a stool in front of sam
whatll you have
what have you got
chili wit beans
chili witout beans
you dont like the taste thats what they make ketchup for
in that case ill have it
and a cup of coffee
the door of the bar grill opens
smith and coley enter
they walk to macreedy stopping just a few feet behind him
to macreedy with menacing friendliness you still around
i thought you didnt like this place
pleasantly going to or coming from
he turns again as sam plops an unseasonable mess of chili in front of him
to smith gesturing a thumb toward macreedy no comment he says
no comment and all the time hes got my chair
macreedy smiles tiredly
he half turns toward coley
i always seem to be taking somebodys place around here
he gets up with his chili and sits down three stools away
coley straddles the stool macreedy has vacated
he squirms on it his movements exaggerated
now he spins to face smith
this seat aint comfortable
i was afraid of that
i think id like the seat youre on
to macreedy mildly hes as changeable as a prairie fire
to coley suppose you tell me where to sit
coley opens his mouth but realizing he has been outmaneuvered closes it again
the loafers in b
are silent watching
sam seemingly oblivious to coleys pressure on macreedy places a bottle of ketchup in front of the stranger
coley gets up slowly and walks stiff legged to macreedy
he takes the bottle of ketchup and without removing the cap upends it over macreedys plate
the cap is drowned in a deluge of ketchup which overflows the plate and runs onto the counter
to macreedy i hope that aint too much
to smith gesturing toward coley your friends a very
nodding sort of unpredictable too
got a temper like a rattlesnake
thats me all over
im half hoss half alligator
mess with me ill kick a lung outta you
what do you think of that
talking to you is like pulling teeth
you wear me out
loudly after a beat youre a yellow bellied jap lover
am i right or wrong
youre not only wrong youre wrong at the top of your voice
you dont like my voice
again turning to smith i think your friends trying to start something
now why ever would he want to do that
i dont know
maybe he figures needle me enough and ill crack
maybe ill even fight back
then he or hector your other ape would beat me to death and cop a plea of self defense
i dont think thatll be necessary
youre so scared now youll probably drown in your own sweat
before that happens couldnt i pick a fight with you if i tied one hand behind me
macreedy rises to go out
as he passes coley coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around
the two men face each other
if i tied both hands
macreedy shakes free of coleys grasp
his big right fist streaks toward macreedys face
macreedy ducks weaving with the punch
he grabs coleys belt twisting coleys body
the momentum of the swing throws coley off balance
as he goes past macreedy the stranger tugs at his belt twisting him to one side
he plants his left foot firmly on the toes of coleys left boot for a split second anchoring coley in place
he chops the under side of his open hand in a short vicious arc that lands solidly under coleys ear
with the same motion he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of coleys nose
the cartilage shatters
blood spills down his face
following through macreedys elbow smashes beneath coleys cheekbone
macreedys arm goes past the astonished wind burned face finding coleys right wrist
he jerks the wrist out and backward
coley whimpers his face twisted in pain and perplexity
his body lolls forward
macreedy steps back
he raises his right shoulder a few inches
his bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulders lift
fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion
the fist strikes coleys face covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone
coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious
smith a puzzled expression on his face watches coley fall
he takes half a step toward him
macreedy looks at smith
macreedys face is wooden with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth
working methodically macreedy frisks coley
he takes from a pocket a long ugly knife
he snaps the spring and the four inch blade leaps into place
he looks at the knife in his hand and then at smith
he smiles gently even dreamily
to smith wouldnt it be easier if you just waited till i turned my back
looking toward the loafers at the bar then back at smith or are there too many witnesses present
macreedy walks slowly toward him holding the knife
the are only three feet apart
smiths hand goes to a pocket closes inside over the outline of a pistol
sam glances from macreedy to smith to the unconscious coley
he sidles toward the door and runs out fast
note from this point to end of scene intercut from macreedy and smith to exploit the reactions of the loafers at the bar
with effortless ferocity youre still in trouble
so are you
smith snorts whatever happens youre lost
you got things a bit twisted
you killed komako
sooner or later youll go up for it
not because you killed him in this town you probably could have gotten away with it but because you didnt even have the guts to do it alone
you put your trust in guys like him
gesturing toward the unconscious coley and hector theyre not the most dependable of gods creatures
sooner or later theyll get the idea youre playing them for saps
whatll you do then peel them off one by one
and in the meantime if any one of them breaks youll go down hard
because they got something on you
something to use when things get tough
with a quick motion he tosses the knife to smith
smith catches it
and theyre getting tougher every minute
he walks past smith and goes out the door
self consciously holding the knife smith turns to face the loafers at the bar
they say nothing they stare at him through him like a panel of ghouls
the door opens admitting sam and doc who carries his little black medical bag
doc looks at coley
softly full of awe man
man oh man
he goes to coley bending down over him
smith has remained motionless as a monument
now he doubles shut the knife in his hand
he pockets it and without even glancing at coley turns quickly and goes out
doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the chairs
he stares fiercely across the room at smith who is on the couch reading a neatly folded newspaper
behind him at the clerks desk pete is fitfully involved in a game of solitaire
at the foot of the stairs hector is pouring change into a slot machine
it whines grinds and clicks with rhythmic monotony but it never seems to pay off
in the chair nearest doc is tim with one of his boots off
he works hard and with some concentration removing the other
then he places them neatly at the foot of his chair
he wiggles his toes watching them with some interest
the wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops
the sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward hector and the one arm bandit
they follow his gaze up the steps
walks down carrying his suitcase
he goes to pete at the clerks desk
anything for me
any message a telegram
returning to his cards nothing
as macreedy turns from the desk doc joins him
to macreedy shrilly gruffly in case youre interested coleyll live
glaring at smith and hector im truly sorry to say
smith coolly continues to read his paper
it is hector who turns toward doc
to doc jerking a fat hand toward macreedy your friends pretty tough
he defends himself when hes attacked
macreedy ignores the exchange of words
he walks across the frayed carpet to the nearest chair and drops into it
doc who has followed him stands looking down at macreedy for a long moment
with some irritation well
you going to just sit here and let time run out
im waiting for a wire
from the state cops
you sent it through hastings
an audible sigh just dont expect an answer if thats the way you sent it
looking toward the door no
he rises doc follows his gaze as hastings enters the lobby and looks around
he sees macreedy coming toward him
he walks rigidly in an arc past macreedy to smith
he holds out a postal telegraph form
smith puts down his paper and takes it
macreedy followed by doc goes over to smith
tim in his stockinged feet joins them
smith scans the message
he looks up to meet macreedys gaze
hector swaggers over from the slot machine
hastings slips around the back of the couch protected by the barricade of hectors great body
evenly to smith i think thats for me
he takes the message from smiths hand and quickly glances at it
looking up at hastings wheres the answer
hastings is silent
a brittle expression of bemusement crosses smiths features
you expect an answer to a wire thats never sent
macreedys mouth compresses in a harsh grin
whats so funny
just a thought his eyes turn to hastings
hastings wilts a thought dazzling in its purity
macreedy takes a step toward hastings
the telegraph agent bounces away
slowly youre in a jam hastings
you gave my telegram to smith
excitedly you warty wretch
thats a federal offense
to smith youre in deep too
grins hard like i said its getting tougher and tougher
to tim sheriff youd better do something about this
tim hesitates blinking his eyes worriedly shifting from one stockinged foot to the other
smith watches him insolently as he takes the message from macreedy and gestures with it vaguely
to smith i reckon thats right mr
dont be a jerk tim
to smith seriously divulging information theres a law
tim youre pathetic
doggedly could be
but im still sheriff
thats the point
youre not sheriff any more
you just lost a job youre so pathetic
he reaches out clawing the badge from tims chest
he jabs it on hectors vest
to hector all right sheriff
you cant do that
i put him in office
now i take him out
hector moves his elephantine bulk within inches of macreedy
you want to register a complaint
macreedy doesnt answer
hector takes the message from tims limp hand and tears it into little pieces
to register a complaint boy youve got to have evidence
you got evidence
macreedy doesnt answer
you got a big mouth boy makin accusations disturbin the peace
theres laws in this county protectin innocent folks from big mouths
why id just hate to
wearily come on hector
he walks out the new sheriff strutting beside him with hastings in their wake
for a moment macreedy doc and tim stand in the center of the lobby
pete eyes them non committally and goes back to his solitaire
he glances up now and then moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in
macreedy is deep in thought
abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette
tims shoulders are slumped
humiliation has corroded him flesh and soul
even doc is momentarily subdued he too feels degraded unclean
macreedy looks from one to the other of the good ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way
he takes a few steps to his suitcase doc and tim trailing him doc for want of something better to do tim out of his deep inexpressible need for support
macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag
he thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to tim
tim takes a drink
the light on the clerks desk goes on and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling
the pressing fierce light has drained from the lobby leaving a shadowy silvery dreariness
the shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness
hopefully its all right tim
were not licked yet
numbly aint we
there comes a time tim when a mans just got to do something
im useless and i know it
imploring no man is useless if hes got a friend
pete comes out from behind the desk walking from one lamp in the lobby to another turning them on
im your friend tim
then let me alone
he hands doc the whiskey bottle
jabbing at macreedy with a thumb hes going to need you before the night is over
he downs a snort then looks at pete who approaches them
contemptuously and all the useful men are on the other side
as pete turns on the lamp behind doc he reacts ever so slightly to docs words
his almost imperceptible grimace is not lost on macreedy
macreedy watches the young man as he continues to light the lamps
angrily lemme alone i tell ya
doc slams the whiskey bottle down on a nearby table
i cant let you alone
i cant let myself alone
dont you understand that
he turns from tim to pete who is unable to shake his gaze
then sadly fiercely four years ago something terrible happened here
we did nothing about it
the whole town fell into a sort of settled melancholy and the people in it closed their eyes and held their tongues and failed the test with a whimper
self consciously pete has backed off until now he leans against the outside of the clerks desk
but he still cant shut his ears to what doc is saying
now something terrible is going to happen again and in a way were lucky because weve been given a second chance
and this time i wont close my eyes i wont hold my tongue and if im needed i wont fail
almost harshly again facing tim and neither will you
tim sighs running a thick hand over his forehead
i got such a headache im bewildered
i hurt all over
i know unconsciously his right arm strays to massage the paralyzed left pain is bewildering
i came here bewildered full of self pity afraid to fight back
gesturing with his hand to pete and then your friend smith tried to kill me
the muscles around petes mouth tighten funny how a man clings to the earth when he feels theres a chance he may never see it again
theres a difference between clinging to the earth
eyeing tim almost contemptuously and crawling on it
you going to stand by and watch forever
flatly i aint gonna watch and i aint gonna get into it either
there is a moment of crashing silence
im gettin out
im sorry mr
slowly he lumbers out of the lobby
doc watches him go
again the benumbing silence cut finally unexpectedly by
to doc youd be smart to get out too
angrily turning to pete theres too many smart guys around here
im glad im a dummy
youre a troublesome dummy
youre liable to end up on your own slab
heatedly i expect to be in a lot more trouble before i die
go home doc
he jerks his head toward macreedy and with mock bravado
hes all washed up
grinning harshly at him you think so
his right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey bottle on the end table
abstractedly fingering it he walks with tense deliberate steps toward pete at the desk
i was washed up when i got off that train
he continues to advance inexorably toward pete
flatly you shouldn of got off
i had one last duty to perform before i resigned from the human race
quizzically i thought you were going to los angeles that hot bed of pomp and vanity
is that resigning from the human race
s a good jumping off place for the islands for mexico central america
again shrugs i dont know
i was looking for a place to get lost i guess
slapping his paralyzed arm with the whisky bottle because of this
i thought id never be able to function again
turning to pete thanks to your friend smith i found i was wrong
he is now within a couple of yards of pete
youre a man of action
slowly i know your problem
with mounting vigor youd like me to die quickly without wasting too much of your time
pete opens his mouth to say something but macreedy presses on or silently without making you feel too uncomfortable
or thankfully without making your memories of the occasion too unpleasant
for a moment pete stares at macreedy terribly disturbed by the incisiveness of macreedys analysis
bitterly my memories are so pleasant as it is
in sudden frustration pete grabs the deck of cards on the clerks desk and slams them down hard
he turns stares blankly
between doc and macreedy
quietly pressing his advantage what happened pete
pete doesnt answer
are you going to tell him or you want me to
beat smith owns adobe flat
he leased it to komako thought he had cheated him thought komako could never even run stock without water
there was never any water on adobe flat
komako dug a well by hand
he must have went down one hundred and fifty feet
he got water plenty
smith was pretty sore
he didnt like japs anyway
thats an understatement
the day after pearl harbor smith went to sand city
interrupting i know
he was turned down
he was sore when he got back
about ten oclock he started drinking
ten oclock in the morning
hector joined him and coley
then sam and about nine p
we were all drunk patriotic drunk
we went out to komakos for a little fun i guess scare him a little
did you know him
wed seen him around some but none of us knew him
when he heard us coming he locked the door
smith started a fire
the jap came running out
his clothes were burning
smith shot him
i didnt even know smith had a gun
then you all got scared buried him kept quiet
pete nods helplessly bowing his head
macreedy sighs looks down at the bottle in his hand slowly puts it on the table
softly did komako have any family besides his son joe
puzzled his son
nobody around here knew he had a son
he had one
but hes dead too
hes buried in italy
what are you doing here mr
joe komako died in italy saving my life
they gave him a medal
i came here to give it to his father
doc realizing the enormity of macreedys admission frowns rubs a hand across his tired eyes
pete looks at macreedy for a long shocked moment
awfully god forgive me
he takes the bottle from the table and shakily pours a shot glass of liquor
as he raises it to his mouth
to pete harshly guttural itll take a lot of whiskey to wash out your guts
pete is motionless holding the glass inches from his lips hypnotized by macreedys voice as hard and as cold as his eyes
and it will never help not even a barrel full washes away murder
macreedys hand shoots out in a short inexorable arc smashing his palm across the shot glass
the whiskey bursts in a spray the glass flies halfway across the room shattering as it lands against something solid
pete is stunned doc perplexed at macreedys violence
they stare at him
macreedys eyes are murky
the creases between the brows over his nose are deep
his nostrils move in and out with his breathing
pete and doc regard him with growing uneasiness
rage comes into macreedys face turning it a painful red
but maybe im wrong
go on drink
scornfully what else is left for you
mounting anger youre as dead as komako only you dont know it
roaring you also dont know that its not enough to feel guilty
its not enough to confess
its not enough to say forgive me ive done wrong
take it easy macreedy
turning on him sit down
or would you rather have me kneel to beg his pardon for raising a touchy subject
pete squirms under macreedys relentless attack
shaking his head you dont have to remind me
ive never forgotten
well thats mighty noble of you
you feel ashamed thats noble too
in mounting crescendo and four years from now youll probably be sitting here telling somebody else you havent forgotten me
thats progress youll still be ashamed but ill be dead
macreedy grabs the bottle shoving it across the table toward pete
go on have your drink
with exorbitant scorn you need it
pete pushes the bottle aside too ravaged by macreedys words and his own thoughts to drink
he shakes his head grimly and then with sudden decision goes to the switchboard and plugs in a line
leaning over counter staring at him what are you doing
into phone ignoring doc hello liz
m getting macreedy out of town
as they exchange a glance
doc takes a long deep breath of relief
macreedy frowns thoughtfully
he strains to listen to liz but all he and we can hear is the staccato jumble of her words over the wire
he cuts liz short
into phone i dont care about smith
let him try to kill me i might as well be dead as
again lizs voice incoherent over the phone and again
into phone interrupting liz liz
theres not much of me left any more but however little it is i wont waste it
again lizs voice briefly then
im telling you because we need your help
again lizs voice no matter about the past youve got to do this
youd be saving two lives liz
macreedys and mine
again liz answers and
ive told him everything
slowly he replaces the phone on the switch board
he comes around from behind the desk joining macreedy and doc
flatly shell be here in five minutes
thanks very much
pete and doc are nervously alert drained of energy waiting
hector is downright bored
he toys with his pistol squinting at it twirling the barrel
finding neither interest nor pleasure in the piece he jams it back in his holster and strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch
the congregation of loafers look up as hector emerges
imbued with his own bullying importance he draws the pistol maneuvers an extravagant pinwheel and a few other gaudy tricks
then he sighs as boredom again takes over
he walks down the steps to catch a bit of air
the disappearance of hector o
down the street galvanizes them into action
they hurry out of the lobby toward the back of the hotel
vague in the pallid light escaping through a few back windows
the hotels rear door is tightly shut
around the far corner of the street extreme b
comes the gangling body of hector david
he walks toward camera
perhaps twenty five yards away he stops to rest against a fence like a leaning tower
his hand goes to a pocket and comes out with a crumpled half pack of cigarettes
suddenly the movement is arrested something at the other end of the street captures his bleak attention
a jeep headlights off slowly turns the corner pulls up to the curb and parks
pockets his cigarettes and starts slowly for the jeep a quizzical frown on his horsy face
he approaches the back door of the hotel oblivious to it as he continues toward the jeep
at the far end b
toward the lobby a single unshaded light bulb burns dully
a slight figure stands in f
to one side is a narrow u shaped alcove blanketed in heavy shadows
the features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness
with enormous care he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the alley behind the hotel
light thrown by the back windows reveals that the figure is pete
the same pallid light from the alley glancing across the alcove momentarily illuminates it
glued as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is doc
he is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheels around which an old fire hose is wound
the heavy brass nozzle of the hose hangs from the end
doc grips a twelve inch length of lead pipe
pete swallows nervously and peers outside first to the right then to the left
his eyes glaze with fear and his jaw tightens with tension
as he stares at hector walking toward the jeep
controlling his jangled nerves hector
hector stops turns to face pete
he hesitates then
then with a final glance at the jeep hector lumbers to pete who disappears inside the hallway
as hector enters and stops
pete quickly closes the door behind him and walks toward the lobby attempting to draw hector toward the black alcove center screen b
but hector is not to be sucked in
he glares at pete waiting
note the following dialogue is delivered sotto voce
what you want
hes still in his room
macreedy i mean
you want me to tuck him in
i thought maybe you wanted to tell smith
explaining something he feels pete already knows smith said hed be here at midnight
he dont want to be disturbed
he jams a cigarette in his mouth
pete watches him frantically as he searches his pockets for a match
he cant find one
you got a match
i got some in the lobby
he starts to turn
hectors pig eyes are slits of suspicion
before pete can move hector reaches out hooking two heavy fingers inside a pocket of petes shirt
slowly hectors expression changes to one of insidious cunning
his fingers come out of petes pocket and between them is a paper book of matches
i thought you didnt have a match
pete is unable to answer
he is scared to death
sweating with frustration
hector is six feet away and armed too far away for doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe
doc looks around vaguely wildly for another weapon
a fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel
for a split second he hesitates
then slowly with infinite care he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the hose
now hector is alert
he studies petes twitching face
elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches it
it takes fire cupped in the rampart of his big hands
it lights up the hall and as hector looks around he sees something through a mirror over his shoulder and six feet away doc materializes out of the shadows of
as hector whirls going for his gun doc swings the hose with sudden deadly aim
it uncoils like a snake and the brass nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across hectors skull
he sinks unconscious to the floor
doc stands there paralyzed by his action
pete tears toward the lobby
as pete rushes in
he moves directly to the desk leans over and presses the buzzer behind the desk three times
he turns and runs back toward the rear of the building
as macreedy barrels down
he pauses briefly in the hall as he sees doc still standing with the hose and the nozzle dangling like a pendulum from his hand
their eyes lock briefly in understanding
with a half smile ill never forgive you doc
he gestures toward hector out cold for depriving me of that pleasure
he heads toward the alley
as macreedy rushes out
he pauses looking quickly right then left
he sees a jeep parked at the curb far down the street
he runs toward it
the jeep its headlights off starts for him
he swings onto the moving vehicle falling heavily into the seat beside liz brooks
he slumps there breathing heavily as the jeep with a grinding of gears cuts through the night picking up speed
as pete joins doc
silently motionlessly the two men stare for a long moment at hector particularly at the pistol lying beside him
then they look at each other and the same thought seems to flash in their minds
as they speed down the long empty ribbon of road
liz drives hard
macreedy turns in the bucket seat looking back toward black rock
sorry i cant get more out of this heap
macreedy does not answer
with a burst of irritation we could make better time with a dog team
calmly youre doing the best you can
a beat arent you liz
dont expect too much from me
dryly dont worry i wont
quickly i mean people have always expected things from me
you know why
because im pretty
well thats not enough
with liz and macreedy as she cuts sharply into a crossroad
she drives skillfully over the knotty road which is little more than a trail
her lovely features are distorted with her discontent and the ache for attention
after a moment she gives voice to her fantasy
softly maybe i could have been something a model or something
glancing at him you dont believe that
yes i do
well i dont really
im a dime a dozen
that i dont believe
im too little and too late
its never too late
i lack the muscle
frowning why is muscle so important
cynically oh youre the brainy type
harshly did it take brains to rough up coley
whatever you did to hector you didnt do it with brains
howd you get pete to change his mind
not with muscle
and not with brains either
hes a pushover for a muscle man
im beginning to think it runs in the family
looking at her hard you think strength is in the width of a mans shoulders
he does not catch the glance she darts him his extreme awareness is anchored not to the girl at his side but to the terrain ahead
id sure have liked to see you tangle with reno smith
he wasnt around when i left
maybe i will yet
his eyes strain to sweep the country each boulder each outcropping each stunted tree
but substance and shadow are blurred and fuzzy in the dark night black on black
sequence omitted from original script
with macreedy and liz as it winds to the far end of the boulders on a trail that drops off into a flat basin
solid forms loom up in the darkness they are unrecognizable yet macreedy senses some tense familiarity with the terrain
suddenly liz brakes the jeep so sharply macreedy lurches forward in the seat
alert expectant whats this
vamping nervously we need water
she turns off engine pulling ignition key from its lock radiators overheating
she moves away from macreedy to get out of the jeep
he reaches across quickly gripping her arm
she turns to face him disturbed by his hardness of jaw and eye
leggo of me
suddenly they are hit by a blinding pair of headlights like
the beams cut jaggedly through the night throwing into sharp immediate relief the lava rocks the broken windmill the gutted house the litter strewn unmarked grave at adobe flat
liz throws away the ignition key
macreedy bails out of the jeep still holding the girl
as they fall to the earth
macreedy pins her down
then in quick succession four emphatically loud shots from a rifle squirt into the shale around them
harshly through his teeth youre stupid liz
youre a fool
if he finishes me hes got to finish you
he looks up blindly into the headlights glaring from the granitic high ground some yards away
his grip on the girls shoulder is like a steel trap
he pushes her down beside komakos grave hugging the side of the jeep as a shot rips the gravel at their feet
pulling the girl with him he takes cover in the slight concavity of the grave
the jeep is between them and the headlights between them and the source of the gunfire
liz struggles to break away
suddenly bullets kick up a storm around him
a bullet smashes into the flowers exploding tiny cruel fragments of dirt into macreedys face
he gasps in pain releasing liz
he rubs his eyes as if to convince himself that he is not blind
liz breaks from the grave
now five yards from macreedy
calling toward the headlights smitty
im here honey
just head for the car
liz half turns facing macreedy with a vicious smile
an almost bantering voice so long macreedy
she starts toward the headlights
she reaches the foot of the rocky ridge with the two enormous eyes on top
she begins to climb up
just a few more steps honey
she is almost at the top a vertically sheer rock about five feet high separates her from it
she looks up at smith towering over her at the edge of the precipice
he holds his rifle almost languorously
breathlessly get him
get him now
easily first things first honey
the girl is frightened by the menace in smiths voice
unsure reaching out her hand help me up smitty
you were going to help me liz
she looks at him quizzically i still need your help
confused i did what you said
you two started out in a car
thats the way youll end up
over a cliff burning
she tries to interrupt him but he goes on
you can blame that on macreedy too
he said i had too many witnesses
dry whisper but why me
why start with me
i got to start with somebody
he brings the rifle down aiming almost casually at liz
her eyes go wide
she steps back spins around running crazily down the steep incline
yelling wildly macreedy
a shot rings out
she falls forward rolling slowly down the embankment
she lies there
blood trickles from the corner of her pretty mouth
a rattling noise rises from deep in her throat and then subsides
in the silence the outline of reno smith emerges
holding his rifle at the ready his silhouette illuminated sharply in the twin beams of light he climbs down the side of the cliff
he looks toward the jeep and macreedy not once at the girl at his feet
sadly almost reproachfully you shouldnt have done that
smith pays no attention to her
he advances inexorably with rifle held at his hip
he fires at macreedy
macreedy wipes the last of the fragments from his eyes
his face is still streaked with dirt and shale
he turns searching for something anything to fight back with
then he remembers
stiffening his body set his eyes narrow he moves purposefully toward the front of the jeep and crawls under it
again smith opens up on him
bullet after bullet pours into the confined space nicking the wall ricocheting off the jeep with a frightening fluttery wheezing sound
the firing stops again and in the silence we hear a familiar trickle as in running water
re loads his rifle
stiffly he starts slowly down over the rocks toward his unarmed victim
he has unscrewed the nut and unconnected the gas line with the carburator
a spurt of gasoline is running out
with a quick motion he picks up an empty whisky bottle from the litter strewn earth
he fills it with gasoline quickly screws the nut back on
now he sweeps his necktie free of his collar
holding it with his teeth he tears the felt lining free from its silk face
he twists half the lining inside the bottle knotting the other end securely around the bottles neck leaving a long strand dangling
moving rigidly toward the hole
he stops levels his rifle fires
pinned down in the direct line of fire
the burst of the rifle stops
not more than twenty five yards away advancing carefully rifle at the ready
lights a match placing the flame to the dangling end of the tie
he flings himself to his feet and with the same motion whips the fiery bottle like a football hard and straight toward smith
smith fires once fast and wild
the bottle crashes against the rocks at his feet and bursts with a shattering explosion
smith screams as the razor sharp slivers rip his flesh
in a puff of flame his clothes ignite
he drops the rifle and goes down squirming frantically on the black ashy ground
favoring macreedy as he tears out of the hole
he hurls himself at smith
wooden faced almost dreamy eyed he shovels the ashy dirt over smiths prone chest putting out the fire
smith struggles halfway to his feet
macreedy grabs his shoulder helping him up
smith looks at macreedy through eyes bleary with fear and pain and shock
through his teeth go ahead kill me
id like to kill you now but you caused too much pain to die quickly
a beat youll be tried in a court of law
youll be convicted by a jury
then youll die
he drives his right fist against smiths chin
smiths head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest
macreedy blows out his breath hard
he staggers to liz
as he bends over her
lizs jeep driven by macreedy rolls slowly down the empty main street of the sleeping town
behind him under a tarp the body of the girl lies lifeless across the seat
on the seat beside him is smiths rifle the balance a few inches from macreedys elbow
on the right front fender of the jeep smith sits precariously his shirt scorched and ragged
he wears a sullen expression of pained indifference
as the jeep passes isolated lights go on first in docs house then in two or three others
macreedy is oblivious to them
almost completely hidden looks out grimly from a corner of the jail window
protruding through the bars swiveling to follow the progress of the jeep down the street is the long ugly muzzle of a rifle
as macreedy pulls up to the curb in front of the jail and cuts the ignition
he grabs the rifle and steps around to smith
tonelessly prodding smith off the fender with his rifle hands behind your head
as macreedy marches smith up the steps
the jail door opens
a man emerges wearing a mackinaw over his vest and carrying a rifle
it is tim
for a moment macreedy eyes him in silence
his gun finger tightens on the rifle in his hand
tims rifle too is at the ready
after a beat am i going to have trouble with you
but i sure thought the situation was going to be like reversed
i thought i was going to have trouble
nodding sharply in smiths direction with him
ill take care of him
still hesitating just as you took care of his buddies
just as i took care of his buddies
me an doc and pete
the sound of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on sound track
macreedy turns slightly to see doc huffing toward him
the older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand off
to macreedy its all right macreedy
he pulls tims mackinaw to one side revealing the silver plated star pinned at the breast
old tim heres got his badge back
macreedy swings his rifle from tim to smith
tim lowers his stepping to one side allowing smith covered by macreedy to enter the jail
he goes in doc following
pete sits silently at tims desk
in one of the two cells are coley and hector
in the other sam and hastings
looking around well
the gang is all here
i thought id take one last whack at my job
even if smith killed me for it
jerking his head toward smith put him in with hastings
tim turns his key in the cell door
macreedy tiredly goes to pete at the desk
your sisters outside pete
macreedy halts him momentarily gripping his arm
flatly shes dead
pete walks dazedly out the door
tim grabs smiths shoulder and propels him roughly through the cell door
he slams it hard
as the clatter of the iron door reverberates harshly
the townspeople with doc f
are gathered silently in the street staring sadly dumbly at the hotel before them
doc wears a dark business suit neat and conservative
the door opens o
and the people look up their eyes lighting with expectancy
macreedy comes out of the door carrying his suitcase
for a moment he pauses looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street
in the distance we hear the horn of a stream liner
macreedy goes down the steps skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station
almost immediately doc falls in step with him
the townspeople still silent trail after them in f
the townspeople behind them
as we pass we see the main street just as we saw it when macreedy entered town a few short hours ago
walking after a beat to doc tim knows where to find me if im needed
he blinks and frowns
whats on your mind doc
about that medal
can we have it
can who have it
indicating the townspeople with a vague wave of his hand us
well we need it i guess
its something we can maybe build on
this town is wrecked just as bad as if it was bombed out
maybe it can come back
some towns come back
it depends on the people
a noise o
attracts macreedys attention
he turns as do doc and the townsmen
in front of the jail each of them handcuffed are smith coley hector sam and hastings
tim and four cops escort them to two state police cars which are parked beside tims old sedan and another car presumably belonging to a member of the press
the newspaperman without a press card in his hat stands to one side with pete
pete as well as tim have changed clothes they look clean and trim
coley has his arm in a sling
hectors hat hides the bandage on his head
macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station with doc at his side and the people behind him
the train pulls in
still pressing that medal would help
macreedy is silent
he walks on to the platform
he pauses looking at the people silently in his wake and then at doc
he takes a black velvet covered box from his pocket the box containing the medal looks at it and slowly hands it to doc
thanks for everything
macreedy turns and exits from shot
the people look after him
as macreedy boards the train
the cars in front of the jail u turn and start off with the prisoners
the people move silently toward the train
macreedy is at the passageway
slowly the train moves out
macreedy and a conductor stand at the doorway
the town is seen behind them and the people standing there
in the distance tims car recedes
curiously whats the excitement
i knew it was something
first time a streamliner stopped here in four years
he walks into the train
gathering speed diminishing far far into the horizon
note from page the sign should be of whatever type is feasible and compatible to terrain emphasizing the remoteness of black rock
