written by jonathan nolan christopher nolan story by christopher nolan david s
goyer harvey dent was needed
he was everything gotham has been crying out for
not the hero we deserved the hero we needed
nothing less than a knight shining
the sound of cracking
a shape appears in ice
the shape of a bat
the ice disintegrates
gordon stands before a massive picture of harvey dent
but i knew harvey dent
and it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did
gordon choked with emotion gathers the papers of his eulogy
i believed in harvey dent
and we fade to black
racing along a cratered dirt road and we are three hooded men guarded by east european militia
a third militia drives
next to him is a nervous bespectacled man
an airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire
a bland cia operative flanked by special forces men stands in front of a commuter plane
cia man watches the land cruiser pull up hard
the militia men jump out of the vehicle
the driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the cia man
pavel im cia
pavel nods nervous
cia man hands the driver a briefcase
he wasnt alone
cia man confused spots the hooded men
he turns to dr
you dont get to bring friends
they are not my friends
dont worry no charge for them
why would i want them
they were trying to grab your prize
they work for the mercenary
the masked man
the driver nods
cia man turns to his special forces men
get em on board ill call it in
the commuter plane struggles over snow capped mountains
the three hooded men kneel by the cargo door handcuffed
cia man grabs hooded man
what are you doing in the middle of my operation
hooded man says nothing
cia man pulls out a handgun
the flight plan i just filed with the agency lists me my men and dr
but only one of you
cia man opens the cargo door
special forces hang hooded man out into the howling wind cia man shouts above the wind
cia man fires out the open door and the special forces yank hooded man back in clubbing him quiet
the soldiers grab hooded man hang him out the door
the prisoner says nothing
cia man presses the gun to the mans hood he cocks the gun
or hes wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane
cia man turns to the third prisoner
shuts the cargo door
at least you can talk
who are you
we are nothing
we are the dirt beneath your feet
and no one cared who i was until i put on the mask
cia man wary approaches the third prisoner pulls off his hood revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus
the eyes behind it are cold
this is bane
who we are does not matter
what matters is our plan
if i pull this off will you die
it would be extremely painful
youre a big guy for you
was being caught part of your plan
pavel refused our offer in favor of yours
we had to know what he told you about us
i said nothing
why not just ask him
he would not have told us
you have methods
him i need healthy
you present no such problem
cia man laughs for the special forces benefit
a heavy bass tone is rising
the sergeant looks out the window
the commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane looming over it dangerously close
the plane lurches
the noise is building
well congratulations you got yourselves caught
whats the next step of your master plan
crashing this plane
the ramp of the transport opens
four men leap out on tethers dropping towards the commuter plane two each side
the spacial forces react to the turbulence from the plane above
cia man looks at bane
with no survivors
a special forces soldier spins around an armed man is outside the window
bang two men shoot through the windows the other two attach grapples to the fuselage give the thumbs up hoists start to pull and the tail of the commuter plane
is lifted unnaturally
the pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward
like lightning bane has the cia man is his handcuffed arms legs wrapped around a seat back the entire cabin upends
tumbling chaos soldiers falling bane cracks cia mans neck and drops him onto the sergeant they tumble down the plane smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud
pavel strapped in pushes against the seat in front of him the plane vibrates trying to tear itself apart
the men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles helplessly above the mountains
its wings shear off
bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic then opens his legs and drops down the cabin somersaulting gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down by
the men attach explosives to the tail then jump away swinging out as the tail explodes
an explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin the armed men drop through the smoke on cables
a body bag is lowered into the cabin
bane lies it on the seat backs next to dr
pavel and unzips it to reveal a body the same age and build as dr
bane rips dr
pavels sleeve pulls out a length of surgical tubing pushes a needle into dr
pavels arm runs the tube to the bodys arm
pavel watches horrified as bane starts compressions on the bodys chest drawing dr
pavels blood across the tube and into the body
an armed man pulls hooded man up through the cabin and out
bane stops hooded man
they expect one of us in the wreckage
the man nods unhooks himself takes banes arm
have we started the fire
the fire rises
hooded man hands bane his line
bane clips it around dr
pavel takes out a knife and cuts dr
pavels seat belt
pavel panics flails
bane takes his arms
now is not time for fear
bane slides dr
pavel out of his seat
they hang in the vertical windblown cabin
bane takes out a detonator
that comes later
bane presses the detonator the cabin drops from around them revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below
pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport and we drifting over the vast city
harvey dent day may not be our oldest public holiday
moving past the enormous gotham bridge
but were here tonight because its one of the most important
over the gotham river to the palisades on the far side
harvey dents uncompromising stand against organized crime and yes ultimately his sacrifice have made gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death eight years ago
finding a party in the grounds of wayne manor
the mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of gotham
this city has seen a historic turnaround
no city is without crime
but this city is without organized crime because the dent act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob
now people are talking about repealing the dent act
and to them i say
not on my watch
enthusiastic applause as the mayor wraps up
i want to thank the wayne foundation for hosting this event
im told mr
wayne couldnt be here tonight but im sure hes with us in spirit
high above on a darkened balcony a lone figure
now im going to give way to an important voice
down below at the bar commissioner gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper
a congressman muscles in
ever lay eyes on wayne at one of these things
gordon shakes his head
gordons deputy commissioner foley cuts in
no one has
not in years
he can tell you about the bad old days when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous
thug in a mask and a cape
a thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man turns to picture of dent
and murdered him in cold blood
the congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them
sweetheart not so fast with the chow
turns tight smile shrimp balls
the congressman grabs two
the maid moves off
the congressman glances down at gordons papers
jim gordon can tell you the truth about harvey dent
jesus gordon is that your speech
were gonna be here all night
maybe the truth about harvey isnt so simple congressman
but ill let him tell you himself commissioner gordon
gordon approaches the mike
looks down at his long speech
insert cut harvey dent face half destroyed threatens gordons son with a handgun
gordon surveys the audience
i have written a speech telling the truth about harvey dent
gordon folds up his speech
maybe the time isnt right
gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket
the congressman mutters under his breath
thank christ for that
maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in blackgate prison as a direct result of the dent act
these are violent criminals essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized gotham for so long
maybe for now all i should say about harvey dents death is this
it has not been for nothing
the figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion
people clap as gordon leaves the mike
gordon approaches foley
the second shift reports in
on your desk
but you should put in some more time with the mayor thats your department
gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive
anyone shown him the crime stats
he goes by his gut and it continues to bother him whatever the numbers
must be popular with the wife
she took the kids and moved to cleveland
hell have plenty of time for visits
mayors dumping him in the spring
hes a hero
this is peacetime
stay smart the jobs yours
our maid dives into the bustle of wayne manor below stairs caterers and maids wait staff
she overhears another maid
they say he never leaves the east wing
i heard he had an accident that hes disfigured
the other maids signal her to be quiet
all the chatter has died
alfred has entered the kitchen
till why are your people using the main stairs
alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate
picks up the tray looks around the chaotic kitchen
shes up at the bar sir
can i help
alfred looks at the maid
hands her a key and the tray
the east drawing room
unlock the door place the tray on the table lock the door again
the maid nods
takes the tray
following the maid through the empty house
she comes to the large oak door to the east wing
the room is dark quiet
the maid places the tray on the table
she looks at the inner door opposite
it is ajar
alfred talks to an elegant woman thirties miranda tate
im sorry miss tate but ive tried
he wont see you
its important mr
her accent is european
hard to place
wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones
dont take it personally miranda
they turn to see a man in his fifties
everyone knows waynes holed up in there with eight inch nails peeing into mason jars
good of you to let me on the grounds
the dent act is about all gotham
even you mr
miss tate always a pleasure
alfred turns and walks off
daggett smiles glib
why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save the world vanity project
he cant help you get your money back
but i can
i could try explaining that a save the world project vain or not is worth investing in whatever the return
i could try mr
daggett but you understand only money and the power you think it buys so why waste my time indeed
she walks away
daggett watches her go
close on the dinner tray
we hear a labored step approach
bruce wayne appears leaning on a cane
he lifts the lid of his dinner then freezes hearing something
he slowly limps into the next room
the maid looks at framed photographs of rachel thomas and martha wayne
some are half burned
she notices an archery target arrows stuck in it
she reaches out
an arrow sticks into the target the maid spins around flustered
wayne at the other end of the long room lowers a composite bow
picks up his cane
im im terribly sorry mr
it is mr
wayne isnt it
wayne nods gently
limps towards her
although you dont have the long nails
or facial scars
she trails off embarrassed
she seems very young
is that what they say about me
its just that
nobody sees you
wayne approaches slowly
he nods at her pearl necklace
thats a beautiful necklace
reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother
it cant be the same one her pearls are in this safe he reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau revealing a safe door
which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable
which swings open with an awkward creak
no one told me it was uncrackable
the maid suddenly seems more confident
im afraid i cant let you take those
she smiles at him
moves towards him
look you wouldnt hit a woman any more than i would beat up a cripple
she kicks his cane from under him smashes him down
of course sometimes exceptions have to be made
the maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window
she flips backwards through the window
wayne smiles then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace
he looks at the safe notices something
moving toward the line of town cars the maid pulls off her white apron cuffs and collar leaving a black dress and pearls
a valet hurries to open a car door for her she slips into a town car
beside the congressman
can i have a ride
the congressman a little tipsy looks at her hungrily
you read my mind
alfred enters to find wayne kneeling at the safe
miss tate was asking to see you again
shes very persistent
and quite lovely in case you were wondering
what are you doing
examining print dust
weve been robbed
and this is your idea of raising the alarm
she took the pearls
tracking device and all
one of the maids perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house
perhaps you should learn to make your own bed then
why are you dusting for prints
gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct settles to read
next to him is a rusty broken searchlight
a young cop is standing there
this is blake
i didnt want to bother you up here but theyre looking for you
whats the problem son
congressman gillys wifes been calling
he hasnt made it home from the wayne foundation event
thats a job for the police
sir ive been a cop for a year and ive only logged half a dozen arrests
when you and dent cleaned the streets you cleaned em good
pretty soon well be chasing overdue library books
gordon smiles at this
blake looks at his stack of files
but here you are
like were still at war
whats your name son
you have something you want to ask me officer blake
its that night
this night eight years ago
the night dent died
what about it
the last confirmed sighting of the batman
he murders those people takes out two swat teams breaks dents neck
then just vanishes
im not hearing a question son
blake shifts uneasily
then looks at gordon
dont you want to know who we was
gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight
he brushes his fingers across its rusted shell
i know exactly who he was
turns to blake
he was batman
gordon walks past blake heading for the stairs
lets go see about the congressmans wife
alfred takes his tray into the bedroom
the bed is empty
alfreds voice echoes through the vast mansion
alfred hits three notes on the piano
the bookcase opens
alfred descends into the caverns beneath wayne manor
alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower becoming a ramp
at the bottom alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks a bridge over the water to where wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube
you havent been down here in a long time
just trying to find out more about our jewel thief
i ran her prints from the photos she handled wayne pulls up a mug shot a fat male armed robbery suspect
but she was wearing someone elses fingerprints
she may be
but we have the trace on the necklace
we do so i cross referenced the address she went back to with police data on high end b and es
wayne hits a key
a photograph of the maid appears
the databases are full of close calls tips from fences
newspaper headlines appear shes good but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet
we should send the police before she fences the pearls
she likes them too much
and they werent what she was after
what was she after
there was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe
gives you a good pull and its untraceable
maybe you should exchange notes over coffee
now youre trying to set me up with a jewel thief
at this point sir i would set you up with a chimpanzee if i thought it would bring you back into the world
theres nothing out there for me
and thats the problem
you hung up the cape and cowl but never moved on
you wont get out there and find a life
find someone i did find someone alfred
and then you lost them
thats part of living sir
but youre not living youre waiting
hoping for things to go bad again
wayne says nothing
remember when you left gotham
before all this
seven years you were gone
seven years i waited
hoping that you wouldnt come back
wayne looks at alfred
every year i took my holiday
id go to florence
theres a cafe by the arno
any fine evening i would sit there and order a fernet branca
insert cut alfred seated in a cafe sipping his drink
i had a fantasy
i liked to imagine that one day id look across the tables and see you
sitting there with your wife
perhaps some kids
you wouldnt say anything to me or me to you but wed both know
that youd made it
that you were happy
insert cut alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer hopeful
but they are strangers
i never wanted you to come back to gotham
i knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy and i wanted more for you than that
i still do
alfred leaves wayne to his cave
blake and his partner ross get out of their patrol car
a dwp man leads them down a long concrete trough
they wash up a couple times a month
more when in gets colder homeless sheltering in the tunnels
we had to pull him to clear the basin but other than that we didnt touch him
they come out by the catchment basin
above the grille lies a body a teenage boy
blake looks down at him
hes at st
the boys home where i
i coach some ball
blake looks up at the shabby building
blake is talking to father reilly
jimmy hadnt been here for months
you know why blake he aged out
we dont have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen the wayne foundation gives money for that not for two years now
he has a brother here right
ill tell him
id like to if thats okay
father reilly watches as blake sits with mark ten
mark nods slowly
staring straight ahead
what was he doing in the tunnels
lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out
say you can live down there
say theres work down there
what kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers
more than you can find up here i guess
blake considers this
selina kyle in a little black dress walks in with a drunk in a hawaiian shirt
she sits him on a bar stool walks over to a table where a neatly dressed man stryver sits
you brought a date
i like having someone around to open doors for me
selina glances around
things scattered throughout the bar
selina hands an envelope to stryver
stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope
holds it up to the light
four perfect fingerprint transfers
he pockets the envelope
not so fast handsome
you got something for me
stryver signals a thug who locks the door
another thug joins them at the table
i dont know what youre going to do with mr
but im guessing youll need his thumb
as stryver checks the envelope again you dont count so good huh
i count fine
the second thug puts a gun to selinas head
in fact im counting to ten right now
selina looks in his eyes
the thug cocks his gun
okay okay she reaches for her purse
the thug stops her reaches in himself pulls out a cellphone
slides it across the table
my friend is waiting outside
just hit send
stryver looks at the phone
selina sizes up her options
a knock on the door
second thug hides his gun
the door opens a young woman jen
she enters cheerful spots selina
pulls out an envelope looks around
place is a little dead
takes envelope tense itll liven up in a minute trust me
catch you later
stryver checks the envelope
it wouldve been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed
we cant have loose ends
and even in that dress no ones going to miss you
but my friend over there
stryver looks at selinas date drooling into a bowl of nuts at the bar he looks familiar
every cop in the citys missing him
across the bar the tv on mute stryver looks at selina
but theyre not gonna be looking in a place like this
i dont know
you did just use his cell phone
stryver glances down at the cell phone as screech the thugs look out the window at cop cars and swat units descending on the bar
stryver glances at the window and smash selina cracks his head against the table grabs
second thugs gun hand flips over the table firing at the other thugs who drop
the swats batter down the door
selina crouches cowering screaming
its alright miss
just stay down the swats barrel past chasing the remaining thugs back through the bar and out into the back alley
the thugs turn and open up on the swats with automatic weapons
selina moves to the door
spots the congressman under the bar clutching his bleeding leg
keep some pressure on that sweetheart
she adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar
moves for the door
selina waltzes out right into blake
she feigns panic
theres a man in there hes bleeding
its okay miss
blake helps selina down onto the tailgate of a swat truck
he heads into the bar weapon drawn
selina slips behind the truck and into the night
blake enters gun drawn
spots the congressman
ive got the congressman bullet to the leg but hes okay
the swats return fire
the thugs lay down cover fire then race around a corner into a smaller passage
a cop car pulls up blocking the mouth of the alley gordon jumps out gun drawn
the swats approach the passage massing on both corners tactically
the two corner swats exchange hand signals counting down
they round the corner aiming low and high
the passage is empty
the swats cover a fire escape but gordon spots at once manhole
he races to the manhole cover swats wrench off the cover gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest swat
you three down with me
you two head down to cover the next exit where
get the dwp down here now
gordon starts climbing down the ladder
gordon moves down the tunnel flashlight low
three swats fall in behind
blake comes into the alley
cops surround the manhole
wheres the dwp guy
they went down there
shaking his head and gordon took swat in after them
gordon hears a noise up ahead pushes forward rounds the corner
swats return fire shots sparking off the concrete walls then boom behind him the tunnel erupts in fire blasting the swats
gordon races forward tearing through the tunnels
blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole
gordon races around a corner gun drawn
a noise makes him turn whack he is clobbered from behind by a thug
blake pushes forward
come on we gotta get down there that was a gas explosion kid gas
this is a sewer
no one goes in there till we know whats down there
we know whats down there sir
the police commissioner
somebody get the hothead out of here
and get me a dwp guy
blake backs off
gets an idea goes for his patrol car
thug flips gordon onto his back
this ones alive
its the police commissioner
what do we do
take him to bane
the two thugs drag gordon down through the maze of tunnels
as they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels
some of the men are armed mercenaries overseeing gangs of homeless street kids
they stare as gordon is dragged past
the thugs drag gordon between two waterfalls into they approach a figure turned away crouched in the firelight
bare chested muscular masked
a crooked line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine
why are you here
the thugs drop gordon at banes feet
bane slowly turns to the thugs
im asking you
its the police commissioner
and you brought him down here
we didnt know what to do
we you panicked
and your weakness costs three lives
no hes alone bane flips the thugs chin up and to the side with a crack
bane turns to thug
then i will kill you
the thug terrified pulls out gordons badge wallet gun
and the folded papers of the speech he did not read
bane takes these one by one with quick glances
he stops at the papers
as he reads gordon rolls off the steps dropping into the rushing flow of water gunshots ring out
thug trails off as bane looks up from the papers
then show me his body
that water runs to any one of the outflows wed never find him
bane turns to the lead mercenary
give me your gps
lead mercenary hands him a gps bane tucks it into thug s jacket zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school
bane shoots thug kicks him into the water
turns to lead mercenary
make sure both bodies will not be found
then brick up the south tunnel
blake comes out to the catchment basin
he spots something stuck up against the grille thrusts his hand into the raging waters gordon is there alive
blake pulls him up onto the concrete hoists him up hurrying
alfred opens the door to reveal blake in his dirty uniform
i need to see bruce wayne
im sorry mr
wayne doesnt take unscheduled calls
even from police officers
and if i go get a warrant in the investigation of harvey dents murder
would that still count as unscheduled
blake is sitting drumming his leg nervous
what can i do for you officer
commissioner gordons been shot
im sorry to hear that he chased a gunman down into the sewers
when i pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army
a masked man called bane
shouldnt you be telling this to your superior officers
one of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there
he needs you
he needs the batman
if commissioner gordon thinks im the batman he must be in a bad way he doesnt know or care who you are
but weve met before
when i was a kid
at the orphanage
see my mom died when i was small
car accident i dont really remember it
but a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt
i remember that just fine
looks at wayne
not a lot of people who know what it feels like do they
to be angry
in your bones
people understand foster parents understand
for a while
then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do
to move on
wayne stares at blake
so they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys home st
used to be funded by the wayne foundation
see i figured it out too late
you have to hide the anger
practice smiling in the mirror
like putting on a mask
you showed up one day in a cool car pretty girl on your arm
we were so excited bruce wayne billionaire orphan
we made up stories about you
the other boys stories were just that
but when i saw you i knew who you really were
id seen that look on your face
same one i taught myself
blake gets up to leave
wayne is lost in thought
i dont know why you took the fall for dents murder but im still a believer in the batman
even if youre not
why did you say your boys home used to be funded by the wayne foundation
because the money stopped
might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details
some of those details might need your help
wayne and alfred watch blake drive away
you checked that name
bane ran it through some databases
hes a mercenary
no other known name
never been seen or photographed without a mask
he and his men were behind a coup in west africa that secured mining operations for our friend john daggett
now daggetts brought them here
it would seem so
ill keep digging
alfred turns to leave
why did the wayne foundation stop funding boys homes in the city
the foundation is funded from the profits of wayne enterprises
there have to be some
time to talk to mr
fox i think
ill get him on the phone no
do we still have any cars around the place
one or two
and i need an appointment at the hospital
about my leg
which hospital sir
whichever one jim gordons in
alfred is less excited by this part of the request
moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown
fox i believe in what mr
wayne was trying to do
miranda is talking to lucius fox at the table
im only asking for explanations because i think i can help
ill pass along your request
next time i see him
miranda catches something in this
he doesnt talk to you either
lets just say that bruce wayne has his
fox are you aware that john daggett is trying to acquire shares in wayne enterprises
i was not
but it wouldnt do him any good mr
wayne still retains a clear majority
fox moves into his office stops
as i live and breathe
wayne rises pushing hard on his cane
what brings you out of cryo sleep mr
i see you havent lost your sense of humor
even if you have lost most of my money
actually you did that yourself
see if you funnel the entire r and d budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball your company is unlikely to thrive
even with a wildly sophisticated ceo yes
wayne enterprises is running out of time
and daggett is moving in
whatre my options
if youre not willing to turn your machine on i cant lucius
then sit tight
your majority keeps daggett at arms length while we figure out a future for the energy program with miranda tate shes supported your project all the way
shes smart and quite lovely
you too lucius
we all just want whats best for you bruce
show her the machine
ill think it over
these conversations always used to end with some
let me show you some stuff anyway
fox hits a button the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator
fox leads wayne into the vast gadget filled space
they pass tumblers with different weapons configurations
i figured youd have shut this place down
it was always shut down officially
but all this new stuff
after your father died wayne enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries
ive spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof
stop them falling into the wrong hands
besides i thought someone might get some use out of them
wayne shakes his head
sure i cant tempt you to something
least let me get you something for that leg
its fine the use it gets these days
well then i have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesnt like to walk
fox opens a door we glimpse a sleek vehicle
waynes eyes light up
now youre just showing off
defense department project for tight geometry urban pacification
rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation
whats it called
it has a long and uninteresting wayne enterprises designation
so i took to calling it the bat
and yes mr
wayne it does come in black
wayne touches its sleek side
works great except for the autopilot
whats wrong with that
software based instability
take a better mind than mine to fix it
i was trying to be modest
a less busy mind
wayne looks wistfully at the machine
i told you
i retired lucius
wayne listens distracted while a doctor examines an x ray
ive seen worse cartilage in knees
thats good no thats because there is no cartilage in your knee
and not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders
between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred over quality of your body
takes a deep breath
i cannot recommend that you go heli skiing
about the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver so if youre bored i recommend you take up drinking mr
the doctor leaves
wayne pulls on a ski mask steps to the window hops up pulls a wire from his cane which he clips to his belt
he props his cane behind the frame jumps out
the wire unspools from the cane as wayne drops three floors
gordon lies in his bed hooked up to machines
wayne in ski mask stands over him
gordons eyes flutter open
he tries to speak with a weak hoarse voice
we were in this together
then you were gone
the batman wasnt needed anymore
built on a lie
now theres evil rising from where we tried to bury it
nobody will listen
the batman has to come back
what if he doesnt exist anymore
wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town houses
checks a tracking device
jon provocatively dressed leads a yuppie banker type in through a front door
selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out
she picks up the pearls hears a disturbance in the hall
i told you money first goddammit you took my wallet
the yuppie has jen against the wall he reaches back to hit her with an expensive wristwatch clad arm
but selina has grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip
she took my wallet
selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move
she releases the yuppie who moves off down the stairs
selina turns to jen
who is examining a wallet
i told you not to try it with the assholes jen
theyre all assholes
okay the assholes who hit
i dont know what hes so upset about he only had sixty bucks in here
probably the watch
selina opens her hand and gives jen the yuppies rolex
selina exits and hails a cab
wayne watches her go
then pulls out
checking his tracker
town cars dispense gotham society in tasteful masquerade
wayne pulls up to the valet
paparazzi line the entrance
wayne uses his cane to get out of his lamborghini
another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car
no thats bruce wayne
hey wayne where you been hiding
lenses swing onto wayne who pushes a button on his key fob a pulse
the cameras die
wayne heads to the door
im not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list right through here mr
a lavish ball the expressively attired dance under falling confetti
even bruce wayne is struck by the ostentation
he spots selina dancing with a deeply smitten rich twit
she wears a small velvet pair of cat ears
and the pearls
bruce wayne at a charity ball
wayne turns to find miranda tate amazed a small mask her only concession to fancy dress
miss tate isnt it
even before you became a recluse you never came to these things
proceeds go to the big fat spread not the cause
its not about charity its about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on
actually this is my party mr
and the proceeds will go where they should because i paid for the big fat spread myself
thats very generous of you
you have to invest to restore balance to the world
take our clean energy project
sometimes the investment doesnt pay off
you have a practiced apathy mr
but a man who doesnt care about the world doesnt spend half his fortune on a plan to save it
and isnt so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding
wayne looks at miranda
have a good evening mr
wayne watches miranda glide away
then turns to selina
mind if i cut in
rich twit turns annoyed wayne hands him his cane
takes selina by the waist
she glares at him
you dont seem very happy to see me
you were supposed to be a shut in
felt like some fresh air
why didnt you call the police
i have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing
admires her cat ears
brazen costume for a cat burglar
who are you pretending to be
bruce wayne eccentric billionaire
whos your date
his wifes in ibiza
she left her diamonds behind though
worried theyd get stolen
its pronounced ibeetha
you wouldnt want these folks realizing youre a crook not a social climber
flash of anger you think i care what anyone in this room thinks about me
i doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you
dont condescend mr
you dont know a thing about me
well selina kyle i know you came here from your walk up in old town modest place for a master jewel thief
which means either youre saving for your retirement or youre in deep with the wrong people
you dont get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of wayne manor
actually i was born in the regency room
i started off doing what i had to
once youve done what you had to theyll never let you do what you want to
theres no fresh start in todays world
any twelve year old with a cell phone could find out what you did
everything we do is collated and quantified
we are the sum of our mistakes
or our achievements
the mistakes stick better
you think that justifies stealing
i take what i need to from those who have more than enough
i dont stand on the shoulders of people with less
id do more to help someone than most of the people in this room
maybe youre assuming too much
or maybe youre being unrealistic about whats really in your pants other than your wallet
you think all this can last
wayne glances around at the sumptuous party
theres a storm coming mr
you and your friends better batten down the hatches because when it hits youre all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little
to the rest of us
sounds like youre looking forward to it
these pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe
wayne rolls her into his shoulder reaches up to the back of her neck unclasps the necklace
but i still cant let you keep them
the pearls slide off her neck into his other hand
selina looks at him
then kisses him hard and disappears into the crowd
waynes cane reappears
you scared her off
wayne approaches the valet
pats down his pockets
i must have lost my ticket your wife said you were taking a cab home sir
selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the engine
alfred watches in the mirror as wayne climbs into the back
just you sir
wayne gives him a withering glare
dont worry master wayne
takes a little time to get back into the swing of things
wayne dials his phone
this is fox
remember those unusual requests i used to make
i knew it
up front alfred listens
wayne pushes a button on a hi tech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee the brace tones
as wayne starts moving his knee bending stretching alfred puts down a thermos
youve got the wrong leg sir
you start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns
wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee
puts his weight on it the knee bends kicks
he sits again
now we tighten it up
wayne gingerly pushes a button the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg digging in
wayne grits his teeth
it is terribly painful
youre welcome to try it alfred
happy watching thank you sir
wayne shouts as the brace clicks home
he gets to his feet
not bad wayne executes a perfect roundhouse knocking out a brick
not bad at all
alfred picks up the brick
he follows wayne across the bridge to the cube
master wayne if youre considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding bane
im all ears
there is a prison
in a more ancient part of the world
where men are thrown to suffer and die
but sometimes a man rises from the darkness
the pit sends something back
born and raised in a hell on earth
born in a prison
no one knows why
or how he escaped
but they know who trained him one he did
r s al gh l
wayne takes this in
he plucked bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat deception and endurance
just like you
bane was a member of the league of shadows
until he was excommunicated
and a man considered too extreme for r s al gh l is not to be trifled with
i didnt realize i was known for trifling with criminals
that was then
and you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on
but it wont make you what you were
someone whose anger at death made him value all life
even his own
if this man is all the things you say he is then this city needs me
the batsuit emerges from the cube
yes this city needs bruce wayne
your resources your knowledge
not your body
not your life
that time has passed
i tried helping as bruce wayne alfred
and i failed
you can fail as bruce wayne
as batman you cant afford to
thats what youre afraid of that if i go back out there ill fail
im afraid that you want to
wayne looks at alfred
then turns to examine the batsuit
a frenzy of trading on the packed floor
two traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby
you cant short the stock because bruce wayne goes to a party wayne coming back is change
change is either good or bad
on what basis
i flipped a coin
near the front entrance a food delivery guy is standing there negotiating with a trader
i told em rye
trader spots bad news on a screen
alright ill take it
he thrusts food guy a tip and grabs the bag distracted
at the rear secure entrance a motorcycle courier enters wearing his helmet a female security guard gets in his face
lose the helmet
points at a camera
we need faces for cameras
in the rest room a janitor mops the floor shifting out of the way of two traders who rush in to pee
at the shoeshine stand trader waves a bill down at the man shining his shoes without a glance
shoeshine man takes the bill then as the traders step off he reaches into a gym bag and checks an automatic weapon
he clicks the slide home then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading floor
at the secure entrance the courier pulls off his helmet
the female security guards eyes go wide
in the rest room the janitor reaches into his bucket and pulls out a machine pistol in a ziploc bag
near the front entrance food guy pulls an automatic pistol clubs trader with it pastrami flying
shoeshine man moves onto the floor pulls out his weapon
under the couriers helmet a mask
he grabs the female security guard and throws her into her colleagues lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality
shoeshine man fires into the large trading screens
the floor erupts into a different frenzy traders hit the deck screaming
bane moves onto the floor
this is a stock exchange theres no money you can steal he dries up as bane stops
turns to him
why else would you people be here
bane grabs trader by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal
he puts the mans thumb onto the print reader the screen lights up
enter your password
or i send these men to your home
trader terrified types in his password
shoeshine man pulls out a usb drive with an antenna plugs it into the computer figures race across the screen
police vehicles screech into the narrow street construction vehicles are blocking
blake argues with a burly construction worker
move it now
weve got a situation
where can i move it
blake points but swat vehicles pile in blocking
get in your vehicle and stay there
foley and the swat commander allen approach the entrance
the market security chief walks up frantic
youve gotta get in there
this is a hostage situation its a robbery
theyve got direct access to the online trading desk
im not risking my men for your its not our money its everyones
mines in my mattress
if you dont shut these guys down the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less pal
cut the fiber line shut down the cell tower
thatll slow them down
shoeshine man looks up from the laptop
they cut the fiber
how much longer does the program need
time to go mobile
shoeshine man picks up the laptop slips it into his pack
allen shouts at his men
get the barriers up no more in and out on this street
steel wedge shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street
a sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope
six large heat signatures bloom too big for people
ive got something the door explodes
swats duck six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp like barricades sending swats scattering
cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase
the bikes weave through traffic traders strapped to the back facing backwards screaming ties flying in the wind
a cruiser falls in behind
shoot the tires
a veteran cop sights a shot but the traders are in the way
foley is barking into his radio
back off back off
theyve got hostages
the cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel
a rookie cop looks up into his rear view
whats going on with the lights
the veteran cop looks back streetlights and headlights are dying one after another
the darkness is chasing them the darkness hits them
their lights sirens and engine die
and out of the silence a dark shape roars past it cant be
the hell was that
youre in for a show tonight son
food guy drives the rear bike
he looks back sees streetlights explode behind him darkness catching him up
the engine chokes and dies
the trader jumps off shouting for the cops
food guy turns pulling his gun
food guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as batman races by on the bat pod
foley rushes to blakes cruiser
lets roll theyve spotted the batman
the remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass
batman pulls up overlooking the intersection pulls a rifle shaped device
a tone builds he aims it at the bike and fires
janitors bike sparks and dies
sirens as cops move in another bike splutters and dies the hostage breaks for cover
batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an overpass
he holsters his emp rifle and guns the bat pod
foley in the back is using the cruiser as a mobile command station
call everyone in every car patrol beat cop off duty too
pull em in close every street
foley looks out at gotham rushing by
im gonna do what gordon never could
im gonna take down the batman
sir what about the armed robbers
foley ignores him
all around the city cops mobilize cars vans choppers
bane pulls up at speed alongside shoeshine man
shoeshine man glances inside his pack signals
bane turns sees darkness approaching reaches back and grabs his hostage lifting him onto the back of shoeshine mans bike
bane peels off batman stays on shoeshine man
a spotter watches bane peel off hits the radio
one bikes pulled off no hostage foley listens to the radio hungry should we pursue
stay on the batman
but hes getting away
who do you want to catch
some robber or the son of a bitch who killed harvey dent
coverage of the pursuit blares from all the tvs as daggett and stryver watch
people arent saying much frankly theyre too busy but all signs suggest that what were
tv announcer contd seeing is in fact the return of the batman
moving in on a shadow crouched in front of daggetts safe working the dial
the shadow slides up a pair of goggles onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat ears
it is catwoman
she turns to the tv watching the pursuit
well what do you know
catwoman opens the safe
bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the batman
he jumps up onto a concrete barrier then down to the mouth of an outflow pipe
he glances at the entire gotham police department descending on one man
disappears into the pipe
shoeshine man glances into his pack the program beeps finished
he looks back to see the bat pod racing at him ducks as it comes alongside
shoeshine man looks up confused
his hostage is ripped off the bike by a low flying dark shape
shoeshine man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks rolls off dazed
batman grabs him
shoeshine man stares
batman rips the computer from his pack
the screen reads blinding light and noise as police choppers descend sirens everywhere
batman grabs the usb drive from the laptop
he jumps on the bat pod pauses taking in the sight of thousands of police cars choppers dogs closing in
batman looks at the line of stopped traffic
an empty car transporter is below the on ramp
batman fires the cannons at the transporter the near ramp crashes down and batman roars towards it mounts it and jumps onto the on ramp
daggett angrily grabs some ice cubes for his drink
after eight years he has to pick tonight
hes drawing the cops off bane
daggett watches intrigued
foley shouts down the phone
how did you let him go
hes got a lot of firepower and you dont
were not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down you hear me
hes heading back downtown
then hes as dumb as he dresses close it down gentlemen
thousands of police jockey to pursue the batman as he races back into the downtown area
the bat pod tears along pursued by a phalanx of cruisers choppers overhead
more cops appear at the far end of the boulevard
the bat pod executes a ninety degree turn flipping over as it goes then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley
cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley
blake arrives last his cruiser sealing the bottleneck
foley swaggers out
like a rat in a trap gentlemen
foley reaches for a loudhailer
a noise from the alley that none of the cops have heard before
you might have the wrong animal there sir spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of the alley spinning the choppers sideways dual rotor downdraft forcing all
the cops to the ground
the bat now black thunders up and over the entire gotham pd
blake slides up to foley
are you sure that was him
foley looks at blake
thrusts the loudhailer at him
gordon still hooked up to machines watches tv
police are keeping quiet about the prospect of a return by the batman but eyewitness accounts seem the clearly suggests the type of
daggett watches the tv coverage concerned
bane says the batman interfered but the task was accomplished
what about the men they arrested
he says and i quote they would die before talking
where does he find these guys
daggett gets to his feet relieved moves to his inner office
open the champagne
daggett comes through the door calling back
and can we get some girls in here
careful what you wish for
catwoman grabs him throws him across the room
his back slams against the wall he draws a gun but whack
catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot
he whimpers as she leans in
cat got your tongue
she plucks the gun from his trembling hand
you dumb bitch
nobody ever accused me of being dumb
dumb to show up here tonight
i want what you owe me click stryver has a gun to her head
i want never gets
stryver looks appreciatively at catwoman as she lowers her leg
those heels make it tough to walk
catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf hard
i dont know do they
catwoman spins disarms stryver grabs daggett
so where is it
the clean slate
oh yeah the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record
i dont have it
the bodyguard bursts in gun drawn
catwoman holding daggett spins kicking the window with the point of her heel
the glass shatters
she pulls daggett through the window
he screams they drop
ten feet onto the window cleaning platform
catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope the platform plunges down the side of the building
catwoman dumps daggett onto the roof towering over him
where is it
the clean slate
type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database
little too good to be true
rykin data took it to prototype stage thats why i bought them
but they had nothing
it was a gangland myth
catwoman leans back from daggett taking this in
shapes drop onto the rooftop
emerge from fire exits
theyre not daggetts bodyguards these are banes men
catwoman holds daggett by the throat threatening him
they continue to approach
one of them screws a silencer onto his gun
im not bluffing
all eyes search for the source of the voice
catwoman spots it a dark shape crouched on the roof above batman
they just dont care
as the mercenary with the silencer looks up catwoman leaps forward grabs his gun
batman drops into the middle of the fray fighting back mercenaries at catwomans back she fires at one clipping him he drops
she spins aiming at anothers head batman yanks her arm down forcing her to miss the mercenary
batman takes him out with a kick
youve got to be kidding
wheres the fun in that
as more mercenaries come out onto the roof batman runs for the far edge
catwoman follows confused as batman leaps off the roof
she gets to the edge pauses to look down into the alley sees the black angular roof of the bat cockpit open
shots impact around her she leaps landing hard but gracefully on the back of the vehicle slides into the cockpit
as the engines thunder into life and the canopy hisses shut taking bullets from above
my mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men this isnt a car
catwoman flinches as the bat thunders into the sky downdraft forcing the mercenaries down onto the roof all but one who walks slowly across the roof strong against the wind
he watches the bat roar off into the night
the bat lands the canopy opens
catwoman jumps out
see you around batman steps down after her
i had it under control
those werent street thugs they were trained killers
i saved your life
in return i need to know what you did with bruce waynes fingerprints
catwoman looks at him
wayne wasnt kidding about a powerful friend
i sold his prints to daggett
for something that doesnt even exist
i doubt many people get the better of you
hey when a girls desperate
what were they going to do with them
i dont know
but daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market
batman considers this
a police chopper sweeps past searching
batman turns to it
then turns back
but she is gone
so thats what that feels like
alfred is studying security camera footage of bane killing at the stock exchange
a roar builds the waterfall glows brighter until
the bat breaches downdraft spraying water
two cubes rise the bat lands batman jumps out
alfred brushes water off his suit
shall i tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf blower
we bought all the neighbors
alfred takes the cowl from him then the cape as they walk
from the look of the television coverage you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back
pulls out usb drive i retrieved this
shouldnt the police be gathering the evidence
they dont have the tools to analyze it
they would if you gave them to them one mans tool is another mans weapon
in your mind perhaps
but there arent many things you couldnt turn into a weapon
the police werent getting it done perhaps they wouldve if you havent made a sideshow of yourself
perhaps youre upset you were wrong
you thought i didnt have it in me
alfred looks at him
puts down the cape and cowl
you lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from fox
what about when you come up against him
alfred points to the monitor wayne sees bane killing
ill fight harder i always have
when you had something to fight for
what are you fighting for now
not your life
wayne moves to switch off the monitor
alfred grabs his hand
take a good look
at his speed his ferocity his training
i see the power of belief
of the fanatic
i see the league of shadows resurgent
you said he was excommunicated
by r s al gh l
who leads them now
r s al gh l was the league of shadows
and i beat him
banes just a mercenary and we have to find out what hes up to
wayne plugs the usb in hits keys
trades of some kind
the screen blanks a thumb print appears
courtesy of selina kyle
wayne pulls out the usb rises
get this to fox he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing
alfred looks at wayne
takes the usb
as wayne hits the bottom of the stairs alfred calls
ill get this to fox
but no more
wayne hears his tone of voice
turns to him
ive sewn you up and set your bones
but i wont bury you
ive buried enough members of the wayne family
youd abandon me
you see only one end to your story
leaving is all i have to make you understand you arent batman anymore you have to find another way
you used to talk about finishing
about life beyond that awful cave rachel died knowing wed decided to be together
that was my life beyond this cave and i cant just move on
alfred considers this
what if he had
what if she wasnt intending to make a life with you
she was i cant change that what if before she died shed written a letter
explaining that shed chosen harvey dent over you
wayne watches confused as the old man prepares to say and what if to spare you pain
id burned that letter
wayne stares at alfred shocked
why would you say such a thing
because i have to make you understand
because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and i swore to them that i would protect you and i havent
ive never lied to you
except when i burned rachels letter
wayne turns on the old man furious
how dare you use rachel to stop me
im using the truth master wayne
maybe its time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day
you expect to destroy my world then shake hands
i know what this means what does it mean alfred
it means your hatred
it means losing the person ive cared for ever since i heard his first cries echo through this house
but it might also mean saving your life
and that is more important
wayne looks at alfred
summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly
wayne mounts the stairs
alfred watches him go
wayne is woken by the doorbell
as wayne moves through the empty house tying his dressing gown he cant resist one tentative
but alfred is gone
wayne opens the front door the find fox
fox is surprised
answering your own door
could you decode the trades on that drive
fox hands wayne a newspaper the main headline i didnt need to
wayne turns the page it seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange
verified by thumb print
the options expired at midnight last night
wayne looks up from the newspaper reeling
long term we may be able to prove fraud but for now
youre completely broke
and wayne enterprises is about to fall into the hands of john daggett
the weapons we cant let daggett get his hands on applied sciences applied sciences is shut up tight and off the books
the energy project is a different story
we need to convince the board to get behind her
lets show her the reactor were meeting her there in thirty five minutes
you better get dressed
a scrapyard on the gotham river
across the water the towers of gotham
lucius leads miranda from her car
you brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump mr
bear with me miss tate
they arrive at a portakabin and enter
miranda looks around the derelict office
fox smiles at her
keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times
he hits a button and the floor descends miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into they descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel
this is it isnt it
the reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach
is bruce wayne really that paranoid
im gonna plead the fifth on that one
miranda marvels as they step off the elevator
she spots a figure deep within bruce wayne
i thought you might like to see what your investment built
no radiation no fossil fuels
free clean energy for an entire city
if it worked
wayne leads miranda to the core
two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling ball sized mass of metal
wayne hits buttons the ball glows then dies to cold
but no chain reaction
youve built a lot of security around a damp squib
about three years ago a russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions
one week later your reactor started developing problems
looks at wayne
i think this machine works
miranda if it were operational the danger to gotham would be too great
would it make you feel better to know that the russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago
someone else will work out what dr
someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon
i need you to take control of wayne enterprises and this reactor
and to do what with it
until we can find a way to guarantee its safety
and if we cant
destroy the worlds best chance for a sustainable future
if the worlds not ready
bruce if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it
im trusting you
you have no choice
i couldve flooded this chamber any time in the last three years
im choosing to trust you miranda and thats not the easiest thing for me
his eyes are genuine
we have a board meeting to get to
the board members including daggett and miranda take their seats
fox at one end of the table wayne at the other
id like to point out that we have a non board member here
highly irregular even if it is his family name above the door
all eyes go to wayne
an older member of the board pipes up
bruce waynes family built this
and he himself has run it into the ground sir
check the value of your shares this morning
gambling on crazy futures didnt just lose mr
wayne his seat its lost us all a lot of money
he needs to leave
im afraid he has a point mr
ladies and gentlemen
wayne glances at miranda who nods at him
lets get down to business
wayne exits the building
there is an angry mob of shareholders and a pack of hungry reporters
wayne hows it feel to be one of the people
im sorry sir they had paperwork wayne looks over to see his lamborghini being towed
looks like you need a lift
wayne turns to see blake standing by his patrol car
daggett bursts in furious
stryver tries to placate him
how the hell did miranda tate get the inside track on the wayne board
was she meeting with wayne
was she sleeping with wayne
not that we know of clearly you dont know of anything do you
we told him it was urgent then where is the masked speak of the devil
bane is already there
and he shall appear
what the hells going on
the plan is proceeding as expected
you see me running wayne enterprises
moves towards bane
your stock exchange hit didnt work friend
and now youve got my construction crews working all hours around the city
hows that supposed to help my company absorb waynes
you stay right there
im in charge
bane places a gentle hand on daggetts shoulder
do you feel in charge
daggett is taken aback
ive paid you a small fortune and that gives you power over me
daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder
what is this
your money and infrastructure have been important
what are you
come to end the borrowed time youve all been living on
bane gently takes the terrified daggetts head in his hands
you are true evil
i am necessary evil
stryver on the steps outside the living room flinches
wayne stares out the window
blake glances across
when you began
why the mask
to protect the people closest to me
youre a loner with no family
there are always people you care about
you just dont realize how much until theyre gone
the idea was to be a symbol
batman could be anybody that was the point
it was damn good to see him back
not everybody agrees
theyll figure it out in the end
got anything on banes whereabouts
yeah ive got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight
i could use some help
you know what
drop me in old town
blake drops wayne off
ill get a cab
you got money
smiles sheepish actually no
blake hands him some bills watches him cross the street
the radio squawks
blake reacts drives off
selina is packing a bag
she hears voices in the stairwell
i told you money first
i dont think so
selina finds wayne standing there with jen
hes not a mark
jen looks at selina
and he doesnt have a cent to his name anyway
wayne looks at the cramped space
selina shifts embarrassed
yeah its not much
but its more that youve got right now
actually theyre letting me keep the house
the rich dont even go broke same as the rest of us huh
spots her bag vacation
lets just say that ive incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you
my powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving
and how would he do that
by giving you what you want
it doesnt exist
he says it does
he wants to meet
he needs to find bane
he thinks youd know how
tell him ill think about it
wayne nods starts to leave
im sorry they took all your money
no youre not
blake moves through the hospital corridor looking for
gordon is sitting up in bed talking to foley
can we help you officer
john daggetts body was found in a dumpster an hour ago
i thought you might like to know
because daggetts name is all over the permits i pulled to map the tunnels under gotham
blake hands gordon a stack of files
foley glares at blake
mta maintenance sewer construction
where did you get to with the tunnel searches
remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out
weve had teams down there but its a huge network get more men work a grid
i want him found
yeah yeah the masked man
were on it
gordon eyes the files hungrily glances up at blake
this is good work
lose the uniform youre working for me now
we could use some hotter heads around here
this could just be a coincidence
youre a detective now son youre not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore
blake tries to conceal his excitement from foley
wayne covering his head with a newspaper hurries up the driveway in the rain
steps into the alcove
hits the bell
wayne turns to find miranda there
im on my own now
do you have keys
wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden
never needed them
she takes his hand
lets find a window
they force the french windows enter brushing off the rain
fox worked the board like youve never seen im in daggetts out and hes not happy
wayne sets down the newspaper
hope you dont like me for your money
miranda kicks off her shoes
glances at the paper
suffering builds character
then at a photo of waynes parents
ill take care of your parents legacy bruce
miranda picks up a photo of rachel
wayne looks at her
cant find words
miranda puts the photo down
he kisses back
suddenly the lights go out
i think my powers been shut off
wayne watches as miranda tends to a roaring fire
youre pretty good at that
when i was a child we had almost nothing
but on the nights we had a fire we felt very rich indeed
she returns to him pulling a blanket around both of them
i assumed your family was wealthy
not when i was young
he traces a scar on her shoulder
an old mistake
ive made a few myself
she turns to him tracing the scars across his chest
more than a few
we could leave
take my plane
go anywhere we wanted
she pulls him close
he kisses her
they fold into each other the warm heart at the center of a vast cold room
miranda is sleeping wrapped in the blanket
wayne studies her for a moment then slips out
wayne moves to the batsuit
picks up the cowl
the bat roars towards downtown
batman kills the lights and main engines the bat quietly autorotates into the canyons
catwoman on a wall watching trains go by
dont be shy
batman is there
wayne says you can get me the clean slate
on what you want it for
i acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands
still dont trust me huh
how can we change that
start by taking me to bane
catwoman jumps down
catwoman leads him down into a service tunnel
catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks
from here banes men patrol the tunnels
and they are not your average brawlers
neither am i
catwoman swings into a a mercenary patrols
catwoman comes up behind
hes behind you
batman hangs upside down behind him
darkness smashes onto the mercenary
gunfire in the tunnel
catwoman races along pursued by a mercenary
he is yanked off his feet by darkness he screams
batman picks off more and more mercenaries
batman follows catwoman through the dark tunnel
just a little further
a grate slams down separating them the lights come on
he is deep inside
mercenaries look down on him from above
i had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me
youve made a serious mistake
not as serious as yours i fear
bane emerges from behind the waterfalls
lets not stand on ceremony here mr
catwoman hears the name
less sure of what shes done
batman moves at bane strikes powerful blows bane catches his fist
peace has cost you strength
victory has defeated you
bane smashes batman back kicks him off the catwalk batman drops uses his cape to land
bane climbs down on a chain his men watch in disciplined silence batman hurls flashbangs at bane who doesnt flinch
theatricality and deception are powerful agents
to the uninitiated
batman lashes out at bane bane counters they separate
but we are initiated arent we bruce
the league of shadows
and you betrayed us
you were excommunicated
from a gang of psychopaths
now i am the league of shadows here to fulfill r s al gh ls destiny
batman hurls himself at bane throwing him into the waterfall where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into banes mask again and again water cascading over them
bane is not moving
just taking the blows
banes arms shoot out smashing batman aside bane rises
you fight like a younger man
nothing held back
batman hits a switch on his belt the lights go out bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once
you think darkness is your ally
but you merely adopted the dark
i was born in it
formed by it
in the shadows batman circles looking to strike
i didnt see the light until i was already a man
and by then it was nothing to me but blinding
bane lunges backwards into the darkness batmans throat in his grasp
the shadows betray you because they belong to me
bane smashes him into the ground pounding pounding pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it cracks
bane rises from batman gestures to the ceiling of the chamber explosive charges have been drilled into holes
i will show you where ive made my home while preparing to bring justice
i will break you
a mercenary tosses bane a detonator batman watches through cracked cowl bane hits the detonator explosions burst over his head as the ceiling crumbles revealing applied sciences bane has dropped
the bottom out of foxs weapons store
a camouflage tumbler rests in the rubble
your precious armory
we will need it
mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment
batman climbs to his feet swaying
i wondered which would break first your spirit
batman swings at him misses bane grabs him lifts him or your body
bane brings batman down onto his knee breaking his back with a horrific crack
in the shadows catwoman looks on
bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken wayne
mercenaries lift waynes body and carry him off
bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy
catwoman slinks back into the shadows and we blakes cruiser pulls up
he noses up to the windows
blake sits in his cruiser
selina exits wide brimmed hat bags
blake recognizes her
she hails a cab
get commissioner gordon
tell him ive got a line on the congressmans kidnapping
blake pulls out to follow
selina moves through the terminal
she clocks a uniform cop staring at her ducks down a service hallway
the uniform rounds the corner to find selina applying make up
excuse me miss
i need to see your ticket and identification please
selina surprised fumbles with her purse
would you mind
she hands the uniform her hat punches him through the brim stuffs him in a closet plants her mangled hat on his head
selina makes her way down the jetway spots security at the far end turns blake smiles at her
badge in hand
selina now in cuffs looks up as blake walks in
i showed your picture to the congressman and guess what
dont tell me still in love
head over heels
pressing charges though
blake lays a police file down with a thump
youve made some mistakes ms
girls gonna eat
you have an appetite
you cant hide from us with this record
maybe its not you im running from
what do you know about him
that you should be as afraid of him as i am
we can offer you protection
selina looks at him with contempt
blake shrugs switches off the tape moves to the door
when i spotted you i was looking for a friend
selina turns to look at blake
his eyes plead with her
did they kill him
im not sure
and we black screen
sounds screaming laughing crying
sights light bodies falling a dark skull
and we are wayne opens his eyes
someone else is in the cell wayne cannot move to look even the attempt is painful
the skull drifts into his sight
squatting at waynes bedside muscled shoulders curving into his mask
why didnt you just kill me
you dont fear death
you welcome it
your punishment is to be more severe
youre a torturer
but not of your body
of your soul
eyes losing focus from sheer pain
where am i
waynes eyes dart about filthy stone walls distant sunlight from above iron bars an underground prison
where i learned the truth about despair
as will you
there is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth
bane steps to the bars looks up at a bright opening five hundred feet above
like being at the bottom of a gigantic well
every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom
and like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst many have died trying
i learned that there can be no true despair without hope
turns to wayne
so as i terrorize gotham i will feed its people hope to poison their souls
i will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun
bane points to an old tv just outside the bars
you will watch as i torture an entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again
then when you have truly understood the depths of your failure we will fulfill r s al gh ls destiny
we will destroy gotham
and when it is done
when gotham is ashes
then you have my permission to die
wayne drifts back to unconsciousness
a van pulls through the gate
selina inside the van looks up at the formidable grey building
guards lead selina down the cells
whistles and catcalls
were locking her up in here
the dent act allows non segregation based on extraordinary need
first time she broke out of womens correctional she was sixteen
selina passes a huge inmate who strains through the bars
little closer baby
why honey you wanna hold my hand
without breaking step she slips his outstretched hands between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels snapping his arms he screams in agony she keeps walking
shell be just fine
fox comes out of the elevator with miranda
i dont see the need for a board meeting on the energy project bruce got a lot of things right
keeping the board in the dark wasnt one of them
fox swings the doors to the boardroom open
the board is there
at the head of the table bane
this meeting is called to order
fox and miranda freeze
staring at the mask
chair and president
i also need one ordinary member mr
fox would you care to nominate
the dignified older board member gets to his feet
mercernaries round the three up
where are you taking us
where you buried your resources
the bowels of gotham
gordon with a nurses help pulls himself to a seated position as blake watches
so you think our friend is gone again
he might not be coming back
gordon takes this in
foley bursts in agitated
okay commissioner you were right
your masked man kidnapped the wayne enterprises board
he let most of them go but took three down into the sewers
no more patrols no more hide and seek
send every available cop down there to smoke him out
the mayor wont want panic so its a training exercise
foley looks at gordon
im sorry for not taking you dont apologize for believing the worlds in better shape then it is
just fight to make it true
blake gets up
youre telling me the batmans gone
so you chase up the daggett leads any way you can
wayne lies weak feverish
a prisoner drips water onto his parched lips
an elderly blind prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue
he asks if you would pay us to let you die
i told him you have nothing
do it for the pleasure
the prisoner puts bread to waynes lips
they pay me more than that to keep you alive
a chant gets waynes attention
he rolls his head painfully to watch a tattooed prisoner hand a thick rope to a strong man who ties it around his chest watched by other prisoners
he will try the climb
strong man starts scaling the wall
the prisoners chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light
above strong man stops perched on a ledge a twelve foot leap from the rest of the climb
the chanting peaks as strong man leaps
the rope catches he swings into the rock face
prisoners fall silent as strong man is lowered broken bloody to the prison floor
has anyone made it
of course not
the blind prisoner barks at him
what does he say
he says there is one who did
insert cut a child of about ten looks up towards the light
a child who had been born in this hell
an old legend
the prisoner leaves waynes cell switches on the tv
whatever they want you to see
its happening soon
banes men lead fox miranda and fredericks through the debris
fox stares at mercenaries working on his old inventions
swats and cops mass around entrances to sewers tunnels
bane leads fox and the others to where mercenaries plant charges on a hewn wall
pavel is here
bane nods at his men
the wall blows
a swat team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing boom
they look at each other then head in
thousands of police head into manholes tunnel entrances checking weapons using flashlights
bane leads the way over rubble into the reactor
bane approaches the machine
turns to fox
turn it on
fox shakes his head
bane holds his gun to fredericks head
i only need one other board member
there are eight more waiting upstairs
i wont do it
bane cocks the weapon
she walks up to the scanner
places her hand on it
she turns to fox
lucius youll kill this man and yourself and barely slow them down
fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner
the core glows brighter and brighter
pavel is transfixed
do your work
bane turns to his men
gestures at the hostages
take them to the surface
people of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization
fox miranda and fredericks are led back into the rubble
the mayor flanked by security talks to a crowd of reporters
were seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers a training exercise thats all
if youll excuse me ive got tickets to watch our boys thrash rapid city
the mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds
hundreds of swats wade flashlights swinging heading towards the center
teams are converging from different entry points
blake is on the phone
ive been to half daggetts cement plants logged locations theyve poured for underground construction
anything strange about the pourings
blake glances at a large map dots mark pouring locations
honestly commissioner i dont know anything about civil engineering
but you know about patterns
blake pulls up in front of a cement plant
pavel finishes his work
turns to bane
this is now a four megaton nuclear bomb
to his men pull the core out of the reactor
this is the only power source capable of sustaning it if you move it the core will decay in a matter of months
five by my calculations
and then it will go off
for the sake of your family dr
pavel i hope so
pavel stares as mercenaries start to disconnect the core
blake is led through a fence by a worker
boss is about to leave
blake walks past cement mixers
the driver turns
that was you outside the stock exchange right
when half the citys cops were trying to pull onto castle street and your truck shut them out
youre that cop detective now
behind blake the worker puts his hand is his pocket
and as a detective
im not allowed to believe in coincidences blake spins drawing his weapon
the worker lunges with a knife blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him
the driver grabs him from behind
blake wrestles but the driver is strong trained
blake cant aim his gun he fires behind into a steel mixer the bullets ricochet one catches the driver in the back and he goes down
blake gasping kneels beside the driver
what were you doing
the man dies
blake looks down at his gun
tosses is down
pulls out his phone
commissioner im at the fourteenth street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions
call me blake freezes stooped to pick up his gun
looking at some empty barrels
commissioner theyve got polyisobutylene here
and motor oil
they werent making cement they were making explosives blake grabs his carts scanning the pattern of the dots realizes
blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out hard
blake is driving furiously shouting into the radio patch me into foley
foleys overseeing the operation theyre heading into a trap
foley concerned takes the radio from a colleague
its a trap
pull everyone out
banes been pouring concrete laced with explosives
theres a ring around the tunnels theyre gonna blow it and trap the cops underground
foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel
pull em out
mercenaries rise from a hole in the floor bane emerges
the mayor in a corporate box mouths the national anthem
the mercenaries pull out detonators
bane listens to the kickoff like a hunting dog sensing the wind
let the games begin
the mercenaries hit the detonators
swats react the tunnel roof behind collapses
chunks of concrete structure drop thousands of police throughout different tunnels are trapped
the crowd goes wild as a receiver catches starts a run the mayor looks on suddenly confused
as the receiver sprints for the end zone the field behind him drops away in smoking ruins swallowing players
the crowd is not cheering but screaming
the mayors box
the receiver nearing the touchdown glances back sees armageddon the entire field is now a smoking mass of rubble but for one strip of turf
mercenaries pour out of the tunnel creating a gauntlet
blakes cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt
an eruption tosses blakes cruiser onto its roof
all bridges except the gotham bridge suffer controlled demolitions
bane steps into the smoking stadium a gladiator walking into the arena
tv cameras swing onto him
passing a dead umpire he takes the mens headset surveys the screaming crowd lifts an arm for silence raises the mike to his mask
gotham take control of your city
blake squeezes out of his cruiser reaches in for the radio
every cop in the citys down in those tunnels
not every cop
blake pulls the shotgun from his cruiser flags down a car
gordons heart rate monitor alarms
gordon wakes groggy
patients and doctors crowd the entrance
mercenaries with automatic weapons force their way in hit the stairwell
blake drives swerving around dazed and terrified people
flames and smoke billow from the sewers
blake races up to the hospital entrance
two mercenaries move room to room searching
gordon pulls himself out of his bed wheeling his iv
blake jumps into the corridor gun raised
shots echo down the hall blake sprints
blake leaps into the room gun high freezes as warm metal touches the base of his skull
clear the corners rookie
gordon holds his service weapon
the mercenaries are on the ground dead
get my coat son
mercenaries pull the glowing core onto the field
this is the instrument of your liberation
analysts and military personnel assess the situation
satellite shows a radiation spike
whatever it is
the mercenaries thrust dr
pavel to his knees before bane
identify yourself to the world
leonid pavel nuclear physicist
bane turns dr
pavels head for the cameras
armed forces and intelligence staff scramble to verify
pavel was confirmed dead plane crash on an agency pull out of uzbekistan
but it certainly looks like him he points to a monitor with a photo of dr
an air force general rubs his chin thinking nervous
f s streak over the river sizing up the island
bane rests his powerful hand on dr
tell the world what this is
a fully primed neutron bomb
with a blast radius of six miles
and who can disarm this device
thank you doctor
bane snaps dr
pavels neck in front of the world
the bomb is armed the bomb is mobile the identity of the triggerman is a mystery
one of you holds the detonator we come not as conquerors but as liberators to return control of this city to the people
at the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee this anonymous gothamite this unsung hero will trigger the bomb
for now martial law is in effect
return to your homes hold your families close and wait
tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours
bane turns leaves the field followed by his men
the general breaks the silence
pull back the fighters start high level reconnaissance flights
and get the president on the line
mercenaries hold the bridge
a tank rolls across from the mainland soldiers behind
the lead mercenary uses a bullhorn
tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device
send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication
a captain steps forward walks to the apex of the bridge
how many of you are there son
you dont have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island
but you do
why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages
if people start crossing this bridge gotham gets blown to hell
the captain considers this
as night falls the f s peel away from the fire ringed city
the voice of the president echoes across the airwaves
the people of our greatest city are resilient
they have proven this before they will prove this again
wayne stares at the old tv
at his burning city
we do not negotiate with terrorists but we do recognize realities
wayne starts to cry
blake drives the deserted streets
gordon is slumped in the passenger seat listening
as the situation develops one thing must be understood above all others
people of gotham we have not abandoned you
what does that mean
it means were on our own
i have to get in front of a camera sir theyll kill you the second you show your face the mayors dead
im the symbol of law and order
bane says hes giving gotham back to the people they need to know that i could lead
banes not gonna let that happen then hell show his true colors
and youll be dead
gordon says nothing
three camouflage tumblers roll down the deserted street
a crowd of news crews has gathered
guards in the towers look down apprehensive
the tumblers roll up stopping in front of the gates
bane emerges from the lead tumbler
behind you stands a symbol of oppression
prisoners strain to hear banes words
selina is there
where a thousand men have languished for years
under the dent act
under the name of this bane holds up a photo of harvey dent
held up to you and over you as a shining example of justice and good
gordon sits watching banes speech
blake gathers supplies
were gonna keep moving you till we can get you in front of a camera bane sets fire to the picture of dent
but they supplied you a false idol
a straw man
to stop you tearing down this corrupt city
the prisoners start cheering shouting
and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago
bane drops the burning picture
let me tell you the truth about harvey dent
in the words of gothams police commissioner james gordon
this gets blakes attention
gordon watches uneasy
bane unfolds the pages of gordons undelivered speech
the truth about harvey dent is simple in only one regard it has been hidden for too long
after his devastating injuries harveys mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face
he was a broken dangerous man not the crusader for justice that i james gordon have portrayed him to be for the last eight years
harveys rage was indiscriminate
he held my family at gunpoint then fell to his death in the struggle over my sons life
the batman did not murder harvey dent he saved
then took the blame for harveys appalling crimes so that i could to my shame build a lie around this fallen idol
blake stares at the tv gordons face lowers into his hands
i praised the madman who tried to murder my own child
the crowd is silent stunned as bane continues to read
the things we did in harveys name brought desperately needed security to our streets
but i can no longer live with my lie
it is time to trust the people of gotham with the truth and it is time for me to resign
bane folds the papers
looks out to the stunned crowd
do you accept this mans resignation
individuals in the crows start shouting yes
prisoners cheer pounding against the bars
do you accept the resignation of all the liars
all the corrupt
more and more of the crowd is chanting yes
blake turns to gordon who stares at the tv
these men locked up in blackgate for eight years denied parole under the dent act
based on a lie
a lie to keep a city from burning to the ground
gotham needed a hero someone to believe in not as much as it does now
but you betrayed everything you stood for
looks at blake theres a point
far out there
when the structures fail you
when the rules arent weapons anymore theyre shackles letting the bad get ahead
maybe one day youll have such a moment of crisis
and in that moment i hope you have a friend like i did
to plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean
your hands look pretty filthy to me commissioner
gordon stares at him
blake goes back to packing
bane signals a tumbler its turret turns to the prison doors
we take gotham from the corrupt
the oppressors of generations whove kept you down with the myth of opportunity
and we give it to you the people
gotham is yours none shall interfere
do as you please
the tumbler fires blowing the doors to hell
but start by storming blackgate and freeing the oppressed
step forward those who would serve
banes men surge through the burning gates
selina watches as prisoners stream out of open cell doors
she makes her way quietly through the excited throng
for an army will be raised
mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping prisoners
as mercenaries shoot open locks people storm into expensive apartment buildings overlooking the park
the powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests
people ransack the apartment
and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured
wealthy people are herded onto the street by mercenaries
courts will be convened
a kangaroo court is in session presided over by a criminal we recognize from blackgate
bane watches from the gallery
the spoils will be enjoyed
tough looking revellers crack open champagne spraying it swigging it selina amongst them watching
blood will be shed
hundreds of police living underground
dividing up supplies lowered by ropes
ross opens a pack of supplies
but the police will live until they are ready to serve true justice
moving in on the bright glow of the core
this great city will endure
close enough to see the flickering digits of its countdown
gotham will survive
mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck
wayne rolls off his cot
the prisoner realizes wayne is trying to do a push up
from the next cell the blind prisoner says something
he says you must first straighten your back
the prisoner helps wayne roll over painfully
how would he know
he was the prison doctor
a morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people
including your masked friend
many years ago during a time of plague bane was attacked by other prisoners
the doctors fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony
the mask holds his pain at bay
is bane the child you spoke of
was he born here
the legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter
they married in secret
the prisoner takes a rope ties it under waynes arms
when the warlord found out he condemned the mercenary to this pit
but then exiled him instead
insert cut the mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren road
he starts to walk
the mercenary understood that the warlords daughter had secured his release but he couldnt know the true price of his freedom
she had taken his place in the pit
insert cut a woman is lowered into the prison
the prisoners below all have their faces covered with muslin masks
and she was with the child
the mercenarys child
insert cut the woman watches as the doctor the blind prisoner younger looking sighted examines her small child
the doctor exits locking the cell
one day the doctor forgot the lock the cell
insert cut prisoners move into the cell towards his mother
the child runs at them with a knife
innocence cannot flower underground
it was to be stamped out
but the child had a friend
insert cut the protector face covered pulls the child off the attackers
one grabs for the child the protector snaps his arm carries the child into a corner
who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption
the mother was not so lucky
the blind prisoner shouts at the prisoner
this is banes prison now
bane would not want this story told
the prisoner pulls wayne screams in pain as he is pulled upright
the prisoner ties him off
checks his spine
you have a protruding vertebra
im going to force it back
the prisoner punches wayne in the back hard
you stay like this
until you stand
wayne passes out from the pain and we fade to black
wayne is hanging in his cell delirious
did you not think id return bruce
r s al gh l in his ducard guise steps in front of wayne
i told you i was immortal
i watched you die
there are many forms of immortality
wayne looks inward remembering
insert cut r s at the campfire from batman begins
once i had a wife
my great love
she was taken from me
insert cut the woman is lowered into the prison
wayne looks at r s
you were the mercenary
bane is your child
insert cut the mercenary at the side of the road
an heir to ensure the league of shadows fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization
you yourself fought the decadence of gotham for years
with all your strength and resources all your moral authority
and the only victory you could achieve was a lie
finally you understand
gotham is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die
cut to white
and we are snow blankets the street
a tumbler carves tracks as it patrols the deserted street
blake peers from behind a parked car he is crouched feeding a kite string down a storm drain
ross strains to reach a note dangling on a string he grasps it
all around him are dozens of cops living underground
blake winds the string picks up a jerrycan hurries off
the home is packed
people not just kids huddle in every corner
blake spots father reilly
hands him the can
for the bus in case theres a chance to evacuate
keep it in here people are siphoning parked cars
how do you think i got it
is the less you know father
howre the boys
powers been on more so they get some tv
moves to the door
blake you be careful out there
theyre hunting down cops like dogs
following selina through rooms strewn with trash empty bottles and sleeping partygoers
she spots a family photograph glass smashed
a hand lands on her shoulder
this was someones home
now its everyones home
selina stares out at a tumbler rolling by
storms coming remember
this is what you wanted
its what i thought i wanted
the prisoner unties the rope from waynes chest
wayne does push ups
the prisoner watches
why build yourself
im not meant to die in here
the prisoner indicates the tv
whats the difference
wayne ignores this
focuses on his body
wayne moves to the wall takes the rope from the tattooed prisoner wraps it around his chest
curious prisoners gather the prisoner at their head
wayne looks up at the light hundreds of feet above
starts to climb
prisoners get excited as wayne rises money starts exchanging hands
reaching the precipice he checks his rope looks up at the next handhold far away
he takes a breath then leaps
his fingers brush the ledge
wayne drops a hundred feet the rope catches slamming him into the rock face
the prisoners disperse losing interest as the tattooed prisoner lowers wayne on the rope
the blind prisoner turns away
i told you it could not be done
you told me a child did it
no ordinary child
insert cut the protector fights off prisoners as the child older now moves to the climbing wall a child born in hell
insert cut the child makes the climb
pauses looking down making eye contact with the protector who fights off prisoners
they swarm over the protector knives drawn
a child forged by suffering hardened by pain
insert cut the child leaps across the abyss grabbing a handhold on the ledge and swinging up
not a man from privilege
waynes eyes close in despair
supply trucks await inspection
mercenaries open an wheeler check boxes of rations
wave it on
the wheeler pulls up
a line of gothamites waits patiently along the sidewalk
three plain clothes special forces men emerge from the boxes checking then concealing weapons
the doors open they exit
the special forces men carry boxes into the store as if delivering
the store manager leads them into the back and down into where they are met by four cops out of uniform
you have id
of course not
how can we trust you
we dont have any choice
gordon and blake emerge from the back of the room
captain jones special forces
captain glad to have you here
how many of you are there
id rather not say exactly
but the men trapped underground number almost three thousand
what kind of shape theyre in
theyve been getting water food
could we break them out
yes sir take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of ackerman park blow the rubble youve got a hole big enough for ten at a time
im in contact with my partner theyre waiting for the day
men who havent seen daylight for three months
men with automatic weapons who havent seen daylight in three months
what about the bomb
the satellites cant see any radiation hot spots
blake scouts with jones
a rumble makes them turn
they keep it on a truck it must have a lead lined roof
they move it constantly
but you know the truck
theyve got three of them
the routes dont vary much
two tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street
captain jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a geiger counter
shows blake the display
one of the tumblers stops turns back
blake leads them down a side street
what about the triggerman
its a bluff bane wouldnt give control of that bomb to someone else
we cant take that chance
until we have the triggerman we just track the device smuggle men over while gotham lives under a warlord like in some failed state
dial it back officer
this situation is unprecedented
we cant do anything to risk millions of lives
arent you gonna tell him
captain things are more complicated than you think
theres somebody you need to meet
blake nods leads jones and his men up the stairs
blake leads them to the door of an empty bank
they head across the empty lobby to an elevator
blake leads them into empty offices
cots and makeshift furnishings line the offices and corridors
i was up here looking for a vantage point
found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here
lucius fox is there with miranda tate
captain meet mr
fox id like you to brief the captain
captain jones indicates miranda
miss tate is fully aware of the situation
and as ceo of wayne enterprises i have to take responsibility for it
because captain we built it
you built the bomb
it was built as a fusion reactor
the first of its kind
bane turned the core into a bomb then disconnected it from the reactor
and heres the important part
as the devices fuel cells decay its becoming increasingly unstable
until the point of detonation
the bombs a time bomb
and it will go off
in twenty three days
captain jones reels at this news
banes revolution is a sham
hes watching gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ships going down
your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought
captain jones throws blake a look
could you disarm it
i dont know but i could reconnect it to the reactor
wed have to let the pentagon know
theyll be monitoring our we have no choice
lets move away from this location then call it in
captain jones exits the elevator followed by his men and blake
halfway across the floor hell breaks loose
mercenaries blast them with machine guns the lobby becomes a devastating ambush
blake dives back into the elevator
blake flies out of the elevator
fox somebody sold us out
fox and miranda burst into the corridor
take miranda blake grabs miranda heads for the back stairs
mercenaries jump out of the elevator firing high
lowers himself to the ground
captain jones goes down in a hail of bullets
the other special forces men are down
bane enters midges jones with his toe
he is alive
bane leans in close
jones looks up at him defiant
ill die before i talk
im on your schedule captain
bane places his hand over joness nose and mouth
there were people living upstairs
bane looks up disinterested
jones is dead
give them over for judgement
hang them where the world will see
wayne stares at the tv the special forces bodies hang in the cables of gotham bridge
wayne throws a stone into the screen
wayne does endless push ups squats stretches
the blind prisoner listens
he speaks in an ancient tongue
he says the leap to freedom is not about strength
my body makes the jump
survival is the spirit
my souls as ready to escape as my body
fear is why you fail
im not afraid
wayne throws punches
wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb
prisoners look up but none bother to gather round
wayne starts climbing determined
he fights the rock face
grabs at a rock it comes away in his hand
he drops smashes into the rock face
the blind prisoner shakes his head
a skinny prisoner playing cards with the prisoner looks up at wayne hanging upside down
shouldnt you get him down
the prisoner glances up at wayne disdainful
as wayne drifts into unconsciousness we insert cut young bruce lies at the bottom of the well looking up at his father lowering down to rescue him
and why do we fall
wayne wakes with a start the blind prisoner is there
you do not fear death
you think this makes you strong
this makes you weak
how can you move faster then possible
fight longer than possible
if not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit
the fear of death
the will to survive
wayne gets up onto his elbow
looks at the blind prisoner
i do fear death
i fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it
then make the climb
as the child did
without the rope
then fear will find you again
wayne considers this
wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack
supplies for your journey
prisoners nearby laugh
wayne moves to the cliff face
the prisoner follows intrigued by waynes new demeanor
the tattooed prisoner offers him the rope
starts to climb
prisoners gather around as word spreads
wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face
down below the prisoners start a low chant
as wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something explodes from the cliff face
wayne flinches bats
they circle up to the opening above
wayne closes his eyes
the chant rises
wayne takes a breath
opens his eyes
looks down at the drop
then he jumps
time skips a beat as the prisoners stop breathing
and wayne grabs the ledge above
the prisoners go wild as wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge
the blind prisoner nods
wayne climbs to freedom
wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation
he shoulders his pack spots a large coil of rope attached to the wall
he pushes it into the hole then walks away
a mass of huddled gothamites
professionals traders industrialists
in a corner fox
mercenaries come down into the chamber pull out a man who starts yelling
it is stryver daggetts functionary
i want to see bane
theres been a mistake
take me to bane
fox watches him dragged upstairs
a kangaroo court
stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd
theres been a mistake
theres been no mistake mr
stryver turns to look at the judge dr
you are philip stryver executive vice president of daggett industries
off nod from stryver
the same philip stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less powerful
im one of you
pull back to reveal a silent figure watching
bane has no authority here
this is merely a sentencing hearing
the choice is yours death or exile
stryver looks around terrified as the crowd shouts death
to the man in the cold sweat
mercenaries pull stryver from the dock
stryver with other wealthy gothamites is led down to the ice
a blackgate inmate undoes his handcuffs whispering
follow the tick ice
try to swim youre dead in minutes
has anyone made it
the blackgate inmate turns away
stryver is forced onto the ice
he shuffles forward listening to the creaking
stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him
gordon stands over a map of the city
a handful of cops sit around the room
gordon looks at his watch
where the hell are they
its not like we have a lot of time here
the bomb goes off tomorrow
weve got about eighteen hours to do something
to do what
we mark that truck
get a gps on it then we can start thinking about how to take it down
the door opens and blake enters followed by ten cops
gordon is counting them in
he moves to blake
blake just looks at him
gordon checks the faces
wheres foley dammit
gordon heads for the door
you shouldnt be out on the streets gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone
stabs the bell
hes not here gordon furious addresses the hallway behind her
youre sending your wife to the door when the citys under occupation
foley appears at the end of the corridor
wait in the kitchen honey
what did you do bury your uniform in the backyard
jim you saw what they did to those special forces
you forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned
this is different and you know it
these guys run the city the governments done a deal with them deal
banes got their balls in a vice
thats not a deal you move against bane the triggermans gonna hit the button
you think hes given control of that bomb to one of the people
you think this is part of some revolution
theres one man with his finger on the button bane
we have to keep our heads down until they can fix this
if you still had family here maybe youd this only gets fixed from inside the city foley
look im not asking you to walk down grand in your dress blues
but weve got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell
im sorry jim
i gotta keep your head down
whats that gonna do tomorrow when that thing blows
you dont know thats going to happen
foley closes the door on gordon
gordon stands there
i hear youre looking for men commissioner
gordon turns to see miranda blake behind her
how about me instead
miss tate i cant ask you my company built it
bruce wayne built it
and he wanted to destroy it
it was me who didnt listen
gordon looks at blake
a kid sprints down the deserted street chased by two gangbangers
the kid slips in the snow the men are on him
you steal from us you little bastard
they grab the kids backpack the gangbanger pulls out an apple moves to hit the kid when smack
his hand is grabbed and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks
selina catches the apple
you boys know you cant come into my neighborhood without asking politely
gangbanger lunges with a knife she spins him making him stab himself in the backside
the gangbangers run off howling
the kid eyes her wary
never steal anything from someone you cant outrun kid
now youre gonna take it
selina looks at the red apple
takes one perfect bite
she tosses him the apple
he takes it and runs
pretty generous for a thief
selina recognizes the voice
turns to find wayne strong but weathered
beard work clothes
you came back
i thought theyd killed you
if youre expecting an apology it wouldnt suit you
i need your help
and why would i help you
wayne pulls a usb drive out of his pocket
the clean slate
youre gonna trust me with that
after what i did to you
i admit i felt a little let down
but i still think theres more to you
in fact i think for you indicates usb this isnt a tool its an escape route
you want to disappear
she looks at him
takes the drive staring at it
i cant even get off this island
i can give you a way off
once youve gotten me to lucius fox
i need you to find out where theyre holding him
then take me in
why do you need fox
to save this city
who says it needs saving
maybe i like it this way
maybe you do
but tomorrow that bombs going off
get your powerful friend on the case
but i need fox
gordon and his men are in two man teams
gordon is walking down the street with miranda
he hands her a geiger counter
stay further up the block
points at men
theyre gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down
as it approaches hit this button
if the needle hits two hundred give me the signal and i mark the truck
blake is up on a rooftop
gordon moves down to the other end of the block
as the truck rumbles into view gordons men walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the road
the convoy barely slows
miranda gives gordon the signal
as the truck comes past he tosses a magnetic gps locator at the lower part of the truck
gordon regroups with his men on the corner
checks his gps
they keep moving turning down the next street
into an ambush
dozens of mercenaries weapons trained
commissioner gordon youre under arrest
on whose authority
the people of gotham
blake from his vantage point watches gordon miranda and the other cops being rounded up and led away
miranda comforts a crying woman in the corner
thugs come down the stairs laughing leading a hooded prisoner
they kick him down the last step and he stumbles
fox moves to his aid
find this one a spot hes got a big day tomorrow
they dump the hooded man with fox
we all do
its not every day you bag bruce wayne
fox hears this
pulls the bag from waynes head
wayne nods at him silent
fox nods back
the thugs leave
miranda comes over
you picked a hell of a time to go on vacation mr
how long until the core ignites
that bomb goes off in twelve hours
unless we can connect it to the reactor
if you can get it there
ill find a way to plug it back in
can you get miranda out
do whats necessary
tonight i need you
to get me back in the game
catwoman comes down the stairs with the thugs
sorry to spoil things boys but bane wants these guys himself
the thugs pull wayne and fox to their feet miranda looks up
i wont forget about you
the thugs lead wayne and fox along the colonnade
catwoman spins takes out one thug with a heel one with a punch to the throat
fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists
i like your girlfriend mr
he should be so lucky
and shes gone
fox turns to wayne
lights flicker on
wayne and fox are in the bat bunker
any move i make against bane or the bomb the triggerman sets it off
they cant be using radio or cell too much interference
infrared doesnt have the range
it could only be micro burst long wave
wayne opens a panel in the wall takes out equipment mini mines batarangs utility belt
could you block it
i need the emp cannon guidance mount from the bat
you remember where you parked
the batsuit rises from the floor
gordon and his men on trial
the charges are espionage and attempted sabotage
do you have anything to say in your defense
no lawyer no witnesses
what sort of due process is this
more than you give harveys prisoners commissioner
your guilt is determined this is merely a sentencing hearing
whats it to be death or exile
crane if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice youve got another think coming
looks that way
he smashes his gavel
bane leans in to one of his men indicates miranda
bring her to me
wayne bounds up the stairs
fox follows out of breath i think its time to talk about my year end bonus
fox emerges to see wayne uncovering the bat
as the sun sets fox starts pulling apart the gun mount
she fly pretty well
even without the autopilot
thats what youre there for
gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice
a mercenary fires his gun in the air
gordon takes a breath then leads his men onto the ice
which creaks and groans
further out gordon stops sniffs looks down a pool of liquid beside it a flare
gordon picks it up puzzled
light it up
gordon energized by the familiar voice lights the flare jams it into the liquid sending a trail of fire across the ice up into a building where it forms the
shape of a dad
check it out
honey take a look
foley moves to a back window
sees the flaming sign
a mercenary nervously approaches banes back
the mercenary points at the sign
you think its really him
foley yanks up the floorboards
pull his dress blues from their hiding place
mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign
one of them moves out to get a better look
he is taken out by a dark figure
the figure steps into the light it is blake
batman hands gordon a metal box
this blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb
get it onto the truck by sunrise
they might hit the button when it starts
when what starts
blake takes out a second mercenary moves over to the open manhole
ross emerges nots at blake who helps him climb out
bang ross goes down as blake dives for cover
blake is grabbed by mercenaries
they detonate the manhole sealing it prepare to execute blake
a dark shape drops onto the mercenaries
blake watches in awe as batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks then it is finished
one of the mercenaries moves slightly
you missed a spot
batman boots him in the head as he moves towards blake
if youre working alone wear a mask
no one cares who i am
the mask is not for you
its to protect the people you care about
and you always seem to know where those people are
how is that
i lost someone once
since then i break into their homes when theyre sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck
then feels the back of his neck
batman tosses blake a mini mine
on three one two three they throw the mini mines at the rubble of the entrance the blasts barely move any rubble
no offense but you got anything bigger in that belt
thats to warn the men on the other side
batman disappears into the shadows
but how do we
the bats cannons light up the night
cops climb out into the cold night skinny ragged but glad to be alive and carrying guns
all out assault on bane
but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge
in case we fail
lead an exodus across the bridge
save as many lives as you can
dont you need me here
youve given me an army
turns to leave
dont thank me yet
i might not get a chance later
blake disappears into the night
gordon checks the metal box
puts it under his coat
nods at his men hiding in the doorways
checks his gps
batman leads catwoman to a rusty old container
he opens it revealing the bat pod
catwomans eyes light up
oh you shouldnt have
she hops on feeling the controls
the mid town tunnels blocked by debris but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people
catwoman marvels at the controls
to start it you i got it
weve got forty five minutes to save this city no ive got forty five minutes to get clear of the blast radius because you dont stand a chance against these
with your help i might
she shakes her head
ill open that tunnel then im gone
he looks at her
theres more to you than that
she stares back at him
facade slipping a touch
sorry to keep letting you down
he says nothing
she looks at him imploring
come with me
you dont owe these people anymore youve given them everything
catwoman watches him go
then fires up the bike and takes off
catwoman tears along on the bat pod
she pulls up at the tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles
the army of cops stands at the low end of the street
at the op is banes stronghold city hall
men pour out of the building forming up into an opposing line
a cop wearing full dress blues steps forward
it is foley
the silence is eerie
the numbers look evenly matched until two tumblers arrive
the cops look shaky pale but determined
theres only one police in this city
he steps forward
the line follows
bane stands in the colonnade
the tumblers fire into the line of cops throwing men into the air screaming
the line of cops is about to scatter whoooshhh
the bat drops down in front of the cops and blasts both tumblers flipping them sideways
the bat rises and the cops run towards the mercenaries firing until they are close enough to fight hand to hand
the street is filled with thousands of men in pitched battle
catwoman hearing the distant battle blasts the tunnel blockage
the dust settles
her path is clear
gordon heard the fighting
checks the box
come on come on
bane strides through the battle taking out cops left and right
a space clears he is face the face with the batman
you came back
to die with your city
i came back to stop you
bane leaps at batman smashing powerful blows into his head
batman ducks weaves and smashes his fists into banes side
someone is watching from the window of city hall miranda
the black truck rounds the corner
gordon signals his man in a greyhound bus who pulls across the street
the truck smashes into the bus and stops
gordon and his men swarm in blasting at the guards
gordon opens the back empty
cut over to fifth
they sprint for the next parallel avenue
fox hurries into the reactor starts throwing switches
blake leads the boys out of the home points down the street
knock on doors spread the word the bombs going to blow
get out by the south street tunnel or over the bridge
do two blocks then get back to the bus
the boys race down the street
father reilly climbs into the bus
batman and bane fight batman pushing bane back a tumbler roars between them separating them
batman chases after
bane smashes backwards through the door batman on him
batman pounds bane against the marble floor
mercenaries guarding miranda move towards them stay back
he is mine bane smashes batmans head moves in for the kill but batman smashes bane to the ground rips sideways across the tubes of banes mask with the blades
of his forearm
bane bellows thrashing in agony
batman holds him down with a hand on his throat searches him with his free hand
give me the trigger
youd never give it to an ordinary citizen banes thrashing calms as he stares at batman through pain soaked eyes
gasping through his broken mask for relief
i broke you
how have you come back
you thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape
bane looks at batman curiosity behind his pain
i never escaped r s al gh l rescued me
that is why i must fulfill his plan
that is why i must avenge his murder
the child of r s al gh l made the but he is not the child of r s al gh l
batman flinches frozen as miranda leans into his ear
miranda has a knife through batmans suit into his ribs
and though i am not ordinary i am a citizen
she pulls out the trigger
gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street
his men pull in front slowing it
gordon jumps into the back
the truck accelerates gordon drops hanging on to the bumper struggling with the box trying to turn it on
batman cannot move to defend himself
he has bane by the throat but miranda has her knife in his side my mother named me talia before she was killed
the way i wouldve been killed if not for my protector
insert cut the child talia makes eye contact with the protector then leaps
down below prisoners swarm over the protector ripping the muslin from his face
bane looks up at talia says one quiet word goodbye
then is overrun
i climbed out of the pit
insert cut young talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape
i found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance but by that time
the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend
talia reaches up to touch banes mask
insert cut the league of shadows descend into the prison at their head r s al gh l
they slaughter prisoners
r s al gh l has found bane bandaged
the league took us in
bane in a prototype mask stands on logs blocking blows from men with sticks
but my father could not accept bane
r s al gh l watches bane training
talia looks into banes eyes as she holds the knife in batmans side
he saw only a monster who could never be tamed
whose very existence was a reminder of the hell hed left his wife to die in
he excommunicated bane from the league of shadows
his only crime was that he loved me
i could not truly forgive my father
talia looks at batman cold
until you murdered him
he was trying to kill millions of innocent people innocent is a strong word to throw around gotham bruce
i honor my father by finishing his work
vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience
talia twists the knife in batmans side
you see its the slow knife
the knife that takes its time the
knife that waits years without forgetting then slips quietly between bones
thats the knife talia arms the trigger
that cuts deepest
she hits the button nothing
a light on the metal box is blinking
gordon hangs on talia turns furious
your knife may have been too slow
a mercenary steps forward the trucks under attack talia looks around mind racing
you gave him a way to block my signal
no matter looks at watch
hes bought gotham eleven minutes
shouts at mercenary
prepare a convoy
we must secure the bomb until it detonates
talia jumps to her feet
bane grabs a shotgun from a mercenary points it at batman
i want him to feel the heat
feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed
talia reaches up to banes mask reconnects his tubes tenderly
goodbye my friend
bane nods at her slowly
talia moves out with the mercenaries
talia gets into a tumbler with a mercenary
three tumblers pull out in convoy blowing anything out of the way cars cops
foley stands in the road firing his sidearm
talias tumbler smashes him out of the way
bane grabs batman throws him into the floor checks the rounds in the barrels
youll have to imagine the fire he shuts the gun jams it into batmans face
we both know i need to kill you now
he squeezes the trigger
bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire
catwoman is there on the bat pod
the whole no guns thing
i dont feel as strongly about it as you do
blake pulls up to the barricade leads the kids off marching them up the bridge father reilly at the rear
a uniform shouts through the loudhailer stay there
what are you doing
blake mcu im getting these boys to safety safety
youre gonna get us all killed
anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city
its gonna blow anyway
we need this bridge open right now
no one leaves the island
orders whose orders
havent you heard the shooting
the batmans battling it out with bane the batmans dead
look officer its detective well detective you take one more step we have to shoot you
two more steps we have to blow the bridge
to the boys wait for me back at the bus
the boys walk back down the bridge
talias convoy surrounds the black truck
tumblers off each flank protecting the bomb as it counts down
batman looks at catwoman
i need you on the ground me in the air we have to force that convoy east to the entrance to the
catwoman roars down the steps on the bat pod
gordon climbs into the back of the truck the bomb is there heating up
he looks at the countdown nine minutes
blake turns back to the uniform
your orders are out of date
the situations changed
listen im a cop like you
and im walking out there
please dont shoot me
shots ring out at his feet
he keeps walking
the bat descends on the convoy catwoman approaches on the ground
a rolling battle ensues
catwoman targets the rear of the tumblers batman swings the bat in low at the junctions trying to force the convoy east
the tumblers gun turrets swing around onto catwoman
she swerves to avoid heavy fire
blake continues to walk ignoring the warning shots
son of a bitch
to his partner
before he reaches the line his partner arms the detonator
uniform shouts at blake get down
were blowing the bridge
as blake looks disbelieving the bridge in front of him blasts upwards in a massive fireball
blake dives backwards
the bat blasts away in front of the convoy making a huge crater in front of a tumbler and trapping it rear in the air
catwoman dodges around it uses the bat pod cannons to take out another tumbler
the countdown ticks away
as fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye something is wrong
the smoke clears blake sees the impossible gap
you sons of bitches
youre killing us
gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately strafed by gunfire from the tumblers
he dives back inside moves to the front of the trailer looks at the bulkhead gauging the drivers position
starts firing blind through the bulkhead bullets fly through the cab
the driver takes one falls forward dead
talia takes the wheel bullets keep coming
blake races back
father reilly has the boys in a huddle father
get the boys on the bus but theres nowhere to go son
the bat spins down in front of the black truck forcing it into a hard right turn
talia watches the navigation screen
theyre trying to force us onto pushing us to the entrance of the reactor
theyre going to try and reconnect the core
fox runs to a ladder
as he hits the ladder he turns
a massive rumble builds water smashes into the reactor flooding in from both directions
catwoman comes up behind the lead tumbler
she blasts it again and again it flips diagonally into the path of the black truck causing the truck to lurch onto its side
both vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel
fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as a wave smashes into him painfully
gordon jumps out of the truck opening the rear doors to expose the glowing core
catwoman pulls up on the bat pod
give me a hand
the bat lands at the tunnel mouth
gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot
lets get a cable on it and drag it out
come on were almost there laughter
talia lying half out the truck
fox showed me how to operate the reactor core
including the emergency flood fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater gordon looks down at talia
batman is at his side
there is no way to stop this bomb
looks up at batman
my fathers work is done
talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed
gordon turns batman is at the core plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the bat
whatre you doing
i can fly it out over the bay
catwoman is at his side as he works
rig it out to fly over the water then bail
she takes this in
he stands to face her
you couldve gone anywhere
but you came back here
so did you
i guess were both suckers
she puts her arms around his neck
batman moves to the bat gordon alongside
so this is the part where you vanish only this time you dont come back
batman opens the canopy
blake grabs at the smallest boys shoving them onto the bus
on the bus
whatre you doing
protection from the blast its an atom bomb
blake turns on father reilly furious
you think they need to hear that in their last seconds
you think im going to let them die without hope
gordon puts a hand on batmans arm
i never cared who you were and you were right
but shouldnt the people know the hero who saved them
a hero can be anyone
that was always the point
batman sits into the cockpit then looks again at gordon
a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boys shoulders to let him know that the world hadnt ended
the canopy closes and as the bat fires up gordon remembers insert cut gordon in his uniform wraps the overcoat around the young bruces shoulders his eyes reassuring loving
gordon looks up to the cockpit bruce wayne
but is dusted by downdraft as the bat rises
gordon leaps out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth
the bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core
a building is in the way batman fights the controls but theres no power to get over it
blake shouts into the bus heads down
heads down now
blake they need to make their peace
blake turns to him furious
they have no peace to make an explosion from downtown gotham
blake looks across startled turns to the children on the bus
this is it
the smallest of the boys stares through the window past blake
blake turns to see the bat thundering out of the heart of gotham trailing smoke the core hanging from it
it curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river
until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear blast wind and light and dust blowing violently but harmlessly over the bridge the tunnel mouth all of gotham
as the nuclear dawn fades over gotham and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads and helicopters and boats converge on the island we hear a voice
i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss
blake pulls out his badge
throws it into the river
i see the lives for which i lay down my life peaceful useful prosperous and happy
gordon is reading from a tale of two cities
opposite is fox arm in a sling and blake grim
another figure is there whose face we do not yet see
i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts and in the hearts of their descendants generations hence
it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done
gordon closes the book looking down at bruce waynes grave
it is a far far better rest that i go to than i have ever known
gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him
fox places a gentle hand on alfreds shoulder then leaves
gordon and blake follow
alfred alone with the wayne family turns to the grave beside bruces the grave of thomas and martha wayne
im so sorry
i failed you
you trusted me and i failed you
and the old mans shoulders begin to shake with sobs
gordon nods at lucius
blake is at gordons side
can i change your mind about quitting the force
what you said about structures
i cant take it
gestures at gardens
no ones ever going to know who saved an entire city
it was batman
gordon on a platform with dignitaries watches a statue being unveiled
the curtain parts batman immortalized in granite
we move in on the stone face
waynes will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate
the voice belongs to waynes lawyer addressing a small group
nonetheless there are considerable assets to dispose of
the contents of the house are to be he glances up to see someone slip into the room blake
movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the house watched by a solitary figure
to settle the estates accounts
the remainder is left in its entirety to alfred j
out of place
the lawyer continues
the house and grounds are left to the city of gotham on condition that they never be demolished altered or otherwise interfered
different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house
and that they shall be used for one purpose and one purpose only
a schoolbus pulls up
father reilly shepherds children towards the house
the children look up at the house wide eyed
the housing and care of the citys at risk and orphaned children
a sign reads people file out as the lawyer stands
my clerk will help anyone with the smaller correspondences and instructions
blake approaches the clerk
blake realizes offers her his driving license
try my legal name
the clerk glances at the license
yup here it is
she reaches down behind the desk sorting through various items and hands him a sports bag
blake takes it curious
you should use your full name
i like that name
blake smiles embarrassed
any word on the missing item
no not yet
well theyd better leave no stone unturned
we cant just put a string of pearls on the manifest as lost
fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor
two techs are examining the controls in the cockpit
why worry about the stabilization software
this whole autopilot systems obsolete please i just need to know what i couldve done to fix it
fox its already been fixed
typed on panel
six months ago
check the user ident on the patch
tech types some more keys
fox turns away from the rotor an idea starting to form
blake sits in his car looking at a gps device puzzled
beside him the sports bag open
in it is a piece of paper with coordinates on top of some climbing rope and shackles
blake gets out of the car with the bag
follows the gps into the trees
alfred paper under his arm heads to his usual table
lei e solo
si fernet branca per cortesia
blake finds a large waterfall
he checks his gps confused
stares at the waterfall
reaches for the climbing gear
gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest reports
as alfred sips his drink he glances up at a couple at the next table
alfred looks back down
moving in on the waterfall from inside
blake bursts through landing painfully on the shale inside
he gets to his feet moving cautiously into the cave
gordon bangs his files against the air duct straightening them
gordon runs his fingers across a brand new steel bat symbol
he looks up into the night
blake lights his torch
then ducks crouching as thousands of screeching creatures descend
alfred folds his paper
pulls out his money then stops seeing
across the tables a familiar couple
bruce smiles at alfred who nods
bruce turns back to the pretty brunette in pearls
alfred pays his bill content
blake lifts his head feeling the bats all around him
