written by troy duffy september the boulevard is empty eerie silence
no cars no people
a man walks down the middle of the street long trench dark shades
though he does not speak we hear
theres two kinds of people in this world when you boil it all down
you got your talkers and you got your doers
we recognize this man as rocco
he crosses copley square toward the looming dome of the trinity church
most people are just talkers
all they got is talk
but when alls said and done it is the doers who change the world
and when they do that they change us
thats why we never forget them
so which one are you
do you just talk about it
or do you stand up and do something about it
because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit
subtext ireland from behind we see two men perched atop a boulder
a flock of sheep encircles them
their army sacks and shotguns are nearby
they roll their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up
connor and murphy macmanus s now have long hair with heavy facial growth
looking to the horizon
looks like a storms comin
moody music the brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills
murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off
peace they say is the enemy of memory
so it had been for my boys
connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges
for some time now their past had felt like a dream to them
faded and worn
murphy touches the faded celtic cross tattoo on his forearm
the music takes us to a secluded pioneer esque ranch
close on poppa ms yrs face as he coughs and watches his sons approach from his rocking chair on the porch
and then suddenly as if not a day had passed
it was back
i could see it in their eyes
poppa m and his sons eat a rustic dinner
it storms outside
i could feel it heavy in their presence
something calling them back
poppa m looks to his boys who just keep eating
dip to black
very early dawn shadowy morning light
connor and murphy sip coffees and look out into the rain
lightening lights up the flock
through the open door behind them poppa m stokes a warm fire
connor touch the celtic cross tattoo on his forearm
the boys look at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the little sounds of morning cease
ominous music as
from behind we see a man with a crew cut staring at the dome of the trinity
slo mo close on crew cuts boots as he paces toward
the threatening music bleeds over to
just inside the trees a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock
slo mo close on a wolfs paws as it paces toward
we intercut between boston and ireland as chaos erupts
boston crew cut quickly enters the church
ireland the wolves burst from the tree line
boston a frantic priest in his s weeps and begs as crew cut slams him to his knees with a
mm to his head
ireland the wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep
boston muzzle flash blood splatters on the altar
connor and murphy blast shotguns at the wolves
one is hit the rest retreat
the boys perform mercy killings on the wolf and one sheep
everything calms as poppa m rushes up with a mag light and stops
he coughs roughly
moody choral music begins
and they cried out how long olord dost thou not judge and revenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth
the boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire
it rains again
and god said all will fear the wrath of the lamb
for the great day of their reckoning hath come
poppa m looks across the blaze to his sons
connor and murphy stare into the fire bathed in the light of angry flames
and they that holdest my name shall come with the shaking of the earth and the roiling of the oceans
a rugged old jeep tears through the mud
it stops at the farmhouse
poppa m and the boys come out onto the porch
a dark figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to the porch
meet uncle sibeal yrs
he wears a priests collar
reporter is live from outside a church
squads coroners vans csi etc
police hold back crowds
there is no new information on the victim found slain this morning inside trinity church
as you can see the size of the crowd here has increased substantially over the last couple of hours
people are demanding answers as to how a priest could be murdered in a church
but perhaps more shocking we have confirmed that the body was ritualized with pennies in the eyes
many remember this as the grisly calling card of the prolific vigilante killers known as the saints who went on a murder spree here in boston
news footage people scream as they run out of a courthouse
a rampage that ended six years ago when the saints brazenly walked into open court
news footage a body is wheeled out on a gurney
and executed mafia don poppa joe yakavetta before a courtroom of terrified witnesses then simply disappeared without a trace
grainy unclear security footage of three men walking the court halls two in heavy black jackets one in a trench
the now legendary security camera footage from that harrowing day our singular tiny glimpse of these infamous and controversial killers
we are back with reporter at the church
as police have yet to confirm the saints possible involvement the ominous question hangs heavy in the air
are they back
sibeal poppa m connor and murphy sit around the table
the boys have a look of controlled anger
did they release his name
but i made a few calls still got some friends in the diocese there
father douglas mckinney
the boys flash with recognition
you knew him
knew of him
a regular mother theresa
youth hostels soup kitchens
even made it into the newspapers sometimes
sibeal considers this
he genuflects and turns
i think its best that ya just stay put and well try ta figure out what
connor and murphy are out the door and headed for the barn
confused sibeal looks to poppa m who just sips his coffee
moody music the boys begin to look more like themselves as the they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers
the brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor
they load guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature rosaries around their necks clasping their hands in prayer
detective greenly yrs is alone on the alter
police line all around as greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a ghost
he turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule
detectives dolly and duffy are scared
in hushed tones
we need to keep our heads here
its probably not even them
of course it aint them but that doesnt really matter does it
our skeletons just came screaming out of the closet
were not fucked
greenly enters from the church proper
dolly and duffy turn
we are totally fucked
greenly disguised as a correctional officer lets connor murphy and poppa m out of a paddywagon
the saints enter the suffolk courthouse undetected
dolly dressed as a civilian pulls the fire alarm
the saints execute poppa joe yakavetta before many terrified witnesses the alarm blaring in the b
and not just fucked like elephant dick pounded in the ass no reach around jungle fucked
nows not the time to panic green beans
oh i disagree
nows the perfect time to panic
were all accessories to
dont you fucking say it
they all argue over one another
officer peaks his head in the front door
the detectives grind to a halt
is ten minutes
close on a gravestone
smecker we reveal a pair of sexy female legs expensive jimmy choo heels
from behind we see the woman rest a rose at smeckers grave
legs turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b
dolly duffy and greenly stand outside in the entry way of the church
though still on edge they have calmed
i didnt even know he had a protege
what is this bullshit
duffy whips out his trusty note pad
special agent eunice bloom years old
smecker plucked her right out of class at quantico
smecker hand picked her
this brawds gonna be a nightmare
she was assigned to ocd two years back
she can shoot a gun set three course records during her training
a bull dike annie oakley wanna be
we gotta get rid of her
she is also an authority on the saints case
which means smecker must have walked her through it
the cops suddenly flush with fear
and the hits just keep on comin
sibeal waits as poppa m thinks then shakes his head
im in no condition
id just slow em down
well are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this
poppa m shakes his head
we dont even know what this is yet
somebody could just be tryin ta get away with murder here
only theres about a thousand easier ways ta do that
someones callin them out sibeal
ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it
bring em back with a vengeance
dont know who
dont know why
but someone thinks hes real fuckin clever
only one problem with his little plan
fear and frustration burst from sibeal
ders too much we dont know and if youre wont at least try ta talk some sense into them i will
the door opens and in comes connor and murphy
sibeal notes the change in appearance
the boys stand at the kitchen tables opposing end hands in their pockets
their resolve fills the room
the brothers face off with poppa m and sibeal a bizarre board meeting
poppa m cocks a brow at sibeal who clears his throat
exactly what do you intend to do
connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down
he flips a penny on the table
it clatters to a stop
every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it
a squad pulls up
dolly duffy and greenly turn
how are we playing this
feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine
we hard line her
stick together on this
were a brick wall
they all nod and stiffen their resolve
lets rock this bitch
rockin music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door
slo mo eunice bloom yrs exits the squad and moves toward
she is simply delicious sexy blonde hair a womans business suit short skirt brass rimmed specs
each detectives face drops
soon she is before them
she smiles and speaks with a southern drawl a la doc holiday
you hafta be detectives dolly and duffy
am i right
extending hand eunice bloom
dolly and duffy shake and manage a nod
greenly is still enamored
and you must be greenly
smecker always said you were the funny one
i mean what
yeah well funny as in ha ha though not like funny as in gay cuz
played high school football
dolly and duffy fume
look with all due respect agent bloom
you see theres a special before my agent
if we are going to address each other formally id prefer if you popped it in there
makes me feel i dont know
of course id hoped we could be a little more personable
in fact id like you to call me eunice
the cops are dumbfounded
duffy snaps out of it
i dont see why the fuck the fed is
whoa whoa fuck
this isnt a fuck situation is it
i can see a god damn or two but why skip all the way to fuck right off the bat
lets start slow and work our way up to it
what is the feds interest in this
the detectives harden brick wall
eunice furrows her brow
their interest detective is capturing the men responsible for the murders of of bostons finest criminals
ysee public perception is that these boys stepped in did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them
the fbi tends to take exception to such things
they coulda sent anyone
they sent me
why do you think that is
well since weve broken the fuck barrier allow me to be blunt
it is because i am so fucking smart that i make smart people feel like retards
now we seem to be getting off on the wrong foot here
id appreciate a bit of cooperation
lets chalk it up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend
a man who taught me everything i know
after a moment of consideration the cops concede with nods
re crowd now whats with the circus
the victim was killed late last night
when people gathered for morning mass they found the front entrance chained and padlocked
a locksmith came out cut the chain and surprise surprise
half of them called the cops
half of them called the media
eunice turns and looks over the crowd
and it looks like thats just the way somebody wanted it
what say we scrape the shit off this cows ass fellas
escort a lady onto the crime scene
no yeah no
greenly escorts her as dolly and duffy walk behind mystified
do you want a cup of coffee or something
never touch the stuff
eunice stands looking down the aisle at the altar
behind her the detectives are curios as eunice slides on pink latex gloves
she puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases
she starts slowly down the aisle
total silence as
eunice inspects the smashed door of a confessional booth
she looks over the body closely then turns from the altar and walks to the detectives
she pulls her earplugs and all sound returns
it wasnt them
but im sure you boys already knew that
the detectives nod
the two vs
the victim and venue dont add up
lets go with the venue first
our perpetrators are devout
they would never commit such an act on sacred ground
and as for the victim
all their vics were criminals
clearly not the case here
so it wasnt them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction
no need for federal involvement so with all due respect
well see you later special agent bloom
eunice stands right in front of dolly
man i hate it when people say that
with all due respect
because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful remark
ill give you an example
with all due respect detective this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction i fuckin say it does
duffy and greenly share an oh shit look
what can you tell us about the shooters
and i can tell you that he is left handed and how shall i put this delicately
hes a short bastard
one guy lefty short
eunice furrows her brow
ill show you what im talking about
close up on greenlys enraptured face
we pull back and see he is on his knees before eunice and staring longingly between her legs
detective greenly youre the victim
you can call me david
very well david
duffy and dolly stand behind greenly chest to chest each mimicking guns to the back of the kneeling cops head
the saints signature stance
copley plaza hotel four years ago
two men of identical height put yuri petrova on his knees and each dropped iron to the back of his head
this is torture for greenly and he turns his head from eunices crotch
she immediately adjusts him back into place
eyes front david
the position of the victim and the angles produced by the killers stance created a unique scenario
the bullets criss crossed in the skull and exited the eye sockets
here this did not occur
the rounds moved on a straight trajectory through the back of the victims head and out the front
which happens when
eunice circles around positioning herself between dolly and duffy
she aims both hands to the back of greenlys head
one guys holding two guns to the back of your head
crew cut holds two guns to the back of the pleading priests head
he fires and mckinney falls
crew cut steps forward and we see his face in the light
piercing ice blue sociopathic eyes
now the victim falls forward
if you please david
greenly lays flat on his stomach
the killer approached the body from the left side
eunice approaches and flipped him to the right
crew cut flips the body showing little respect
he pulls out two pennies and looks at them
but you said he was wicked short
the saints were later determined to be five foot eleven inches tall
its just dumb luck that the russian and mckinney are the exact same height
eunice kneels putting her pointer fingers just below greenlys eyes
the rounds exited petrovas eye balls
here they came out the lower cheek
she slides her fingers to greenlys lower cheeks
three four inches below the eyes
that puts him at five seven ish
thats not uncommonly short
eunice stands and points the a broken down confessional booth door
the killer posed as a late night confessor
once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated
short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the priests chamber
crew cut exits his confessional and kicks in the priests door
he pulls the terrified cleric out
close on a gash in the door
leaving a crescent shaped indentation which indicates that this cowboy was wearing a boot with a pronounced heel
gave him a couple inches
were looking at about five foot five gentlemen
thats wicked short
we drift over open sea to a huge cargo freighter the killian farris plodding toward northeast
connor and murphy stack grain
a mexican seaman yrs appears
theyre brawling in the hold
better get your bets in now
seamen cheer as a large ruffian giant yrs and a latino fight
david and goliath
meet romeo yrs pony tail shorn sides and a perpetual smile
romeos hands are chained behind him
romeo bobs weaves and fakes avoiding many punches
the giant spews angry french all the while
the boys step up as money moves and men bet
connor to the same mexican seaman in spanish
why are his hands chained
romeos fast man
he says the frenchman cant lay a hand on him
but he cant hit him back
thats the bet
hes got to last five minutes
to connor english this guys fuckin crazy
the brothers whip out money and give it to the sailor
fifty on the mexican
we track with the fighting
tattooed across romeos back la raza
nearby french roughnecks and scream in their native tongue to the giant and he stops and rests
you should never fight a mexican frenchy
pound for pound the toughest mother fuckers on earth
we like pain
we like it pierre
i mean think about it tabasco sauce
what kinda fucked up people would even invent that shit
the giant swings but romeo slides under his legs
romeo jumps up swinging his hands under his feet still bound but in front of him now
dont be scared
remember i cant hit you
i aint gonna hit ya
avoiding blows aint gonna hit ya
romeo catches his opponents wrist and wraps his chain around
a kick in the stomach drops the giant to his knees
romeo locks the mans head between his legs scissor hold
found the loophole bitch
the giant falls
romeo keeps his wrist locked as he chokes him out
aughtta be a lawyer
got the fine print on yass
ill knock you out on contingency mother fucker
the giant passes out and romeo stands to cheers
roughnecks and fume as romeo takes a bow
the boys clap
romeo emerges from the head chains still on
roughnecks and move down the hatchway toward him wielding metal pipes
he looks at his chains
the brothers emerge from the shadows cutting them off
out of zee way
the boys speak french
at first the roughnecks are surprised but the argument escalates
the roughnecks swing their pipes and in a brutal display the boys dispatch them quickly leaving one unconscious and the other gasping for air
the boys turn
uh merci uh si vous plait
just protectin our investment
ya made us fifty bucks
oh thank god
finally some class
shaking hands connor
why were you yellin fire
i heard you were supposed to on t
thats if youre gettin raped
id be more inclined to go with something like that doesnt go there they laugh as they move to the semi conscious frenchman
low angle looking up at our trio romeo is in the middle
we saved your entire fucking country in world war two
thanks for the statue
romeos foot smashes to camera blacking us out
the boys slumber side by side in hammocks
we pull close on them
they whisper in unison
quis praesumis profanus apud dominus
who dares trespass in the house of god
their eyes pop open
murphy rigs a needle to an ink pen
connor clicks on a hot plate
the boys listen intently to a tiny hand radio nearby
people are still in shock as father mckinney was a beloved local cleric
his selfless contributions to the community too numerous to list
in related news second generation crime boss concezio yakavetta has not commented on whether he fears for his own safety
the boys flash with recognition
rich italian decor long table laden with food
capos sit in utter shock looking to their boss concezio yakavetta yrs who heads the table
so there it is
i want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts
he returns to eating
a moment of silence then the capos burst into anger
capo slams a fist down and stands silencing the lot
i cant believe none of us were consulted on this
wed have never okayd such a thing
its an infamita
are we not catholics for christ fucking sakes
and just for simple revenge
theres no business in it
youve put us all at risk here
the cops could be all over us
forget the cops
what about these saints fuckers
these guys were long gone
and now youre trying to bring the devil right back to our doorstep
concezio wipes his mouth stands and adjusts his cuffs
he slowly circles the table as he speaks
six years ago with the backing of an adoring public these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him
mi patrigno a blood relative and benefactor to all of you
poppa joe made you rich and his murder remains un revenged
a few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder
this too is infamita
these homicidal maniacs nearly wiped this family out
its taken a lot of time to build ourselves up again brick by brick
and now that weve re acquiesced our original power can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the woodwork someday and try to finish the job when
we least expect it
now for those of you who have forgotten lets recap
these fuckers walk into rooms full of gangsters
denotes surroundings outnumbered outgunned
they kill everyone
some look as if they are starting to get his point
you think i dont know that each one of yous been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years
these sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube wiped their dicks on our drapes and walked away
and we been living in silent fear ever since
oh we dont talk about it
rape victims often dont
but its there
knowing theyre still out there somewhere
fear and realization
concezio is right
pretending you dont got a problem dont solve nothing
heads nod in shameful agreement
thank you doctor phil
so lets take a moment to look at the serendiplious diperous serendip
type situation we find ourselves in here
theres a good chance theyll show
no catching us with our pants down this time
we can deal with them proactivitously
the cops were embarrassed by these guys too
with a second bite at the apple they got every reason in the world to crank up the heat
and as for their doting public
id imagine theyre gonna lose a few fans
heads nod all around
murphy sits bare chested on a crate
with the rigged pen he tattoos his brothers back
connor cooks something in a pot on the hot plate
the resin of anger is evident
tattoos murphys back has the crucified feet of christ and connors shows christs downcast head on the cross
the prodigal son huh
he wants us hes fuckin got us
but why would he do something so public
think about it
people figure we did it
makes it more likely someone will drop a dime
way easier to get to us in prison isnt it now
the berth door is slightly ajar
in pops a bottle of whiskey then romeos head
hes expecting a cheer but the brothers have their backs to him
hes instantly taken by their ink
but how would anyone recognize us
you dont remember those sketches on the news channel
yknow every time they show those composites on tv and then they catch the guy it looks nothin like him
just our luck
we get leonardo fuckin divinci as a sketch artist
romeo listens with suspicion
maybe we should dye our hair
these guys are always dyin their hair
you know like in the fugitive
its covert and shit
connor smirks privately
what color would you dye it
i dont know
lighter i guess
i didnt say that
california surfer boy gay gay blonde
im warnin ya
just keep your hands off my ass back there and stay gold pony boy
connor laughs heartily
murphy stabs the ink pen into his brothers shoulder
connor bolts up knocking over the pot
hot water and pennies spread across the floor
connor pulls the pen out
romeo steps inside and sees the pennies
serves ya right
the boys are just about to fight when
the brothers snap their heads toward
a stunned romeo points to them then the pennies
i know who you are
you guys are the fuckin
murphy moves behind romeo shuts the door and shoves him in
oh this is so fucking cool man
im from boston
i love you guys
shit everybody does
i mean holy fucking shit
maybe i could get in on this you know
bring some la raza ta this thing
spice it up a little
hey is it true you guys say a prayer before you grease somebody
connor pulls a gun
the boys jump on romeo and pin him to the floor
murphy clasps a hand over romeos mouth
connor puts the gun to romeos head
their faces glaze over religious ecstasy
and an awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven
romeos eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard
as the terrible hand of the lord struck upon the earth
and as almighty god created you
he now calleth you home
he pulls the trigger click
well hafta calleth back
lets have a shot while were waitin
the boys laugh snatch the bottle
romeo is in shock
that shit was not funny man
the brothers laugh harder
romeo rolls on his side and slides a hand down the back of his pants
he seems relieved
oh thank you jesus
thought i greased my drawers
the boys and romeo smoke and pass the bottle around
but i got conex all over bean town
romeoll hook you up like a tow truck
we dont hafta give you reasons
its because im mexican isnt it
how dare you sir insinuate such a thing
the fact that youre a greasy spics got nothin ta do with it
the boys laugh
im gonna let you have that one
i can do this
its not rocket science
you two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them right
its not that simple
yes it is
spose youre right
id sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that
well you aint
cant you guys see it
this shits fate man
like preordained type shit
mea fucking culpa
why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today
oh dont start gettin all super fuckin natural on us
we saw those guys goin in there
thats what you say
i say its because jeeeeesus wanted it that way
then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit u
well go after all yakavettas people and operations till we get to the man himself
yeah work our way up the food chain
the brothers seem pleased with themselves
so whats your first gig
whats the first thing you gonna do
the boys look to one another
well i dont suppose we have a succinct plan yknow per se
its not fully developed yet yknow as it were
a slow smile splits romeos face
you two need to chill in the green room sip on some pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details
and you better get my cub scout badge ready
cuz if you want to kick yakavetta in the nuts let him know youre in town
romeos got an ace in the hole for you
these guys have gone mad dog here
they need to be put down
i think its disgusting
i wish theyd have stayed gone
i dont believe it for a second
no bleep in way the saints did it
the chief s sits arms folded
the detectives are present
eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos reports concezio and his capos
and thats all she wrote
everything points in the same direction
she taps yakavettas picture on the wall
why would yakavetta want them back here
him of all people
to have them executed
oldest motive in the book
the saints killed his daddy six years ago right
he was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion
from inside he could only do so much
since he got out nine months ago the yakavettas have regained their original strength
looks like their clearing all their open accounts
the chief rubs his chin
its a theory
more than just a theory chief
she nods to duffy
s came back
cold hits all around
concezio yakavetta and his six capo regime all blood relatives have disappeared
so it fits
hes gone to the mattresses with his top brass
hes protecting them till this is over
and words been put to all his lieutenants that the saints are to be taken out on sight
that means his resources on the streets are battening down the hatches waiting for them to show
look i been stone walling the media on this thing but the mayors been riding me like a rented mule here
i got half of new england thinking the saints whacked a priest and the other half thinking their innocent
its a powder keg
im talking riot gear at celtics games here
i could clear them of this murder take the piss right out of this thing keep the peace in the commonwealth
gimme one good reason why i shouldnt go public right now
walk with me chief
he stands and she takes his arm as they exit
duffy quietly closes the door and turns
this is not good
shes gunning for the boys hard
this brawd trying to put a feather in her cap is gonna get us locked up
just calm down
and you know theyll send us to the hoag
we put half those deranged sex freaks in there
i hope you guys like cock sandwiches
cuz well be eating them for breakfast lunch and dinner
the chief and eunice walk down the hall
i understand you got a job to do chief
but if yakavetta even sniffs that were onto him he puts a bullet in napoleons head plants him at the bottom of the ocean and walks
this pint sized killer is the only thing that puts yakavetta right in the middle of this
it is imperative that we find this man
the chief looks as if he is sold
in hushed tones
we need to figure what were gonna do when the boys show and start doin what they do best
cuz thats when the shits really gonna hit the fan
thats another thing
everyones assuming that theyre going to come back
i mean we got no way of knowing that for sure
ray of hope yeah
that could totally happen
they could not come back
what dream world did you two just slip into
duffy snaps a photo of the dead priest from the wall
we know the boys
is there any part of you that thinks theyre are just going to let this slide
they are either on their way
or theyre already here
close on connor murphy and romeo peaking over a concrete wall
three sets of eyes
our trio is atop a dumpster peaking over at the loading dock
chinese gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed
its been all over the papers the last two years
yakavettas in bed with the chinese
theyre using international shipping routes to smuggle it in
this is little yakas shit
connor and murphy smile
lets follow em down the rabbit hole alice
murphy claps romeo on the shoulder
you just scored a few points rome
well dust off my members only jacket
pulls set of keys cuz the kid has also supplied the ride
murphy looks displeased
we hear a stressing motor
romeo drives murphy sits shotgun
connor is in back loading guns
pull back to reveal our trio rides in a vw bug
it is green with patches of bondo exposed engine low pro rims neon runner board lights a low riding work in progress
i thought you said your car was inconspicuous
i dont like words that got spic right in the middle
besides it is
where i live
i hail from a colorful people
besides you wouldnt know style if it pitched a tent in your ass
looks into rear view what do you think of the ride conman
the only way i could be more embarrassed right now is if i was ridin a moped
while fuckin a fat girl
rollin through the gym at my high school reunion
i get the fucking point
chinese gangsters shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of crates and pull kilos of white powder
machinery noise in b
close on three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums
our trio watches as a dock worker yrs drives a forklift unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the huge open bay doors
the boys and romeo huddle up
okay heres the plan
the queen classic another one bites the dust presides over this fantasy sequence
the boys looking more quaffed do a pointless slow motion walk toward the forklift throwing up their collars
romeo also looking polished executes a dan tana pistol whipping on the dock worker who perfectly out of frame
inside warehouse the lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters crate on the forks
romeo is behind the wheel
slo mo connor and murphy pop from the crate and fire on their asian foe hitting each squarely in the chest
slo mo the boys leap down and light cigs as romeo does the one arm action star hang off the side of the lift in b
we skin out go ta docs for a shot of irish
were home in time for tacos
murphy looks unsure
connor turns to his brother
you know its
i can even drive an f lift man
got my class d license and everything
now dats the spirit
i need a gun
what the fuck
im in on this shit man
im working here
the boys look to each other
relenting connor pulls a metallic object and shoves it in romeos hand
you can consider yourself a fuckin pledge until we say different
romeo holds up the gun in displeasure a tiny
caliber ladys purse pistol
can i consider myself your girlfriend too
thats what you get
is there a problem
beat fuming its fine
connor scopes the warehouse
murphy claps romeo on the shoulder
dont worry rome
shit like this builds character
yeah the character of a little bitch
now dats just unprofessional
he turns and joins his brother as romeo continues sulking
what do we think
i think yakavetta murdered a good man just to send us a message
lets send him one back
as they spirit themselves off
crime scene crime scene workers toil
we do not see specifics of the scene just enough to see the place is trashed and the bodies
greenly prowls the scene with his ipod playing
his musical choice is the s nightranger standby motoring
he riffs on air guitar while assessing
dolly and duffy look on
re greenly why
i dont know
eunice walks toward the crime scene with the chief s
your boss john kuntsler called
tells me you got a problem with authority
absolute horse pucky chief
unfortunately authoritys developed a problem with me
and whats that
they enter the
well ysee i am currently in possession of a vagina
oh jeez thats not
so you spoke to kuntsler
they reach the detectives
greenly still rockin doesnt notice
if its confirmed that the saints are back and too many bodies start showing up with pocket change
re his eyes hes gonna pull you and step in
message delivered chief
ill fend him off
just work fast
she smiles and nods
greenly removes his ear pieces
its not them
eunice as she kneels at a body
she stands and pulls her ear plugs
greenly looks emasculated
dolly and duffy smirk at him
eunice stands and prowls the scene intense intrigued in her own world
a wise man once told me
where a mans actions are firmly bound to an unshakable faith ones worst nightmares become sudden terrifying reality
pennies in eyes
hands crossed on bodies
ycan almost smell the brimstone cantcha
what do you think happened here
oh this was a plan that fell to pieces
a lot here doesnt make sense which is why it makes perfect sense
i believe things in our fair little city just got downright biblical
on the flatbed the brothers shovel coffee out of the final crate which rests on the forks of the lift
below them stands the dock worker holding his bleeding head
romeo covers him with his
you didnt have to bash me in the skull
we got a plan going here
technically i was supposed to knock you out
you got a gun
you could have just pointed it at me and said scram
connor points his gun at the dock worker
you got it
he runs off
romeo turns up to them
so lets not let this one small incident get in the way of
shut up and get behind the fuckin wheel
romeo hops into the drivers seat
well at least the plan is off to a winning start
go fuck yrself
they pull wrapped white kilos
connor dips in a finger and tastes
how the fuck would you know
i know shit
romeos winging it jerky moves grinding gears as the forklift staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the opposing end
the crate blocks romeo from view
hes driving blind as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks
inside crate connor and murphy are sardined back to back
what the fucks he doin
he cant see where hes goin
murphy peaks through a crack
tell him to go left now
connor puts his mouth to a knot hole
connor sticks his finger out the hole and points
romeo wrenches the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery
the crate rocks
i cant fuckin believe i let you talk me into this
this is a stupid plan
i didnt notice you throwin out any ideas ya creative asshole
the boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while hurling obscenities
whats goin on in there
inside crate murphy suddenly stops eyes wide as he looks through the crack
they are headed for a mechanics well
a long rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep
tell him to stop
connor slams his mouth to the knot hole
a few of the chinese turn as romeo slams on the brakes screeching to a halt just before the well
the crate slides right off and falls in disappears from sight
a large cloud of coffee dust plumes
a wide eyed romeo is exposed
the asian gangsters stare in shock
hard techno music
suddenly romeo whips it in reverse cranks the wheel guns it and navigates the well
speeds toward the gangsters
mechanics well slo mo the brothers burst from the debris covered in coffee grounds and white powder
they draw their weapons and walk toward the ramp at the wells opposing end
the chinese pull and start firing
romeo dives off and rolls behind some machines
the lift continues on target
the brothers emerge and tear right in firing at the gangsters
romeo fires his useless
in the ensuing fire fight the brothers kill all but chinese gangster
the forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin
slo mo the brothers slam the final gangster to his knees and level to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity
and shepherds we shall be for thee my lord for thee
power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
so we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be
in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti
they kill him
dip to black
black and white film as connor and murphy take great care in ritualizing the bodies
they place pennies in eyes and cross hands over chests
bodies are wheeled out in the b
as dolly and greenly talk privately with eunice
just got a call from my best snitch
never steered me wrong
he says its this guy
hands eunice mug gorgeous george tuffano
hes trusted bruglione to yakavetta but not blood
hes been left control of the streets
hes running all of it
eunice looks over the mug shot
they call him gorgeous cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry
hes even got the out of season fake bake going on a real peacock this guy
yeah i heard of this rodeo clown
duffy approaches hands eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy
ballistics just dug it out
they all look perplexed
a twenty two
you gotta be kidding me
thats like bringing a knife to a gunfight
yeah or like bringing a really small gun
to a gunfight
they all blank stare greenly for a moment
i dont know
ballistics is reading three shooters
this is one of them
well im having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot
maybe were reading it wrong
the priest was a frame job right
yeah maybe somebodys trying to eliminate some competition here
eunice considers this
the detectives seem hopeful
but we just might have ourselves a change in the line up here
the detectives all look at one another nervously
fine theyre back
whats the plan
hell weve just been called up to the big show
we are tracking multiple perpetrators gentlemen
we keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where yakavettas hiding
we find him and flip him
and as for the saints
im gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other
she walks off
the cops look terrified
we see the hands of an old man as he mists flowers in this lush environment
he ambles to a shop table wearing a metal leg brace circa s and a corrective shoe polio
we do not see his face
close on small black and white tv on table
live from the crime scene
law enforcement has confirmed the saints are back
this gives way to
the saints pencil composites are shown
from the studio
the five drug traffickers all involved in the heroin trade were victims of the saints
bodies are wheeled out
several having close ties to the yakavetta crime family confirming the long suspected merger of the chinese triad and the mafia
close on a metal door opens revealing doc s
the brothers and doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with romeo in tow
the bar is closed empty

a brisket boils on the hot plate
romeo and the boys drink and relate the evenings antics to doc
later they all enjoy an impromptu dinner on the pool table
the eating does not slow their banter and laughter
later music fades
silence as connor and doc stare each other down across the pool table
murphy and romeo watch with intrigue as doc stiffles his urge to pop off
not this time ya little shit
well see old man
a moment passes and doc is literally shaking
would somebody please come over here and

the boys and romeo burst into hysterics
eunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby
gorgeous george yrs is face down as a female masseuse works his back incense mood music
eunice silently slides in flashing her badge a finger to her pursed lips
uneasy the woman continues her work as eunice lotions her hands
she covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room
eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure
someones been eating their wheaties
yeah get after it girl
eunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers
she whips georges towel off winds up and smacks him on his bare ass hard
george involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table
he bolts to his feet
you fucking bitch
he rounds the massage table arms outstretched
eunice draws her side arm and sticks it in his face halting him dead
whoa whoa whoa
what did you just call me
who are you
why im a lady george
that fact alone demands a certain amount of
cocks hammer back cordiality
im im sorry i called you that
well how courteous of you to apologize
courtesy is so important
dont you agree
im with that
now sit your fat ass down
eunice reholsters wiggles her skirt straight and sits on the massage table
george looks at her legs as she slowly crosses them
trepidation as he covers his genitals
eunice smiles as she flashes her fbi credentials
with intent where is
i dont know
theres a lot of stuff you dont know hoss
for instance why arent you safely tucked away in some ivory tower with all the other big wigs sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail
why are you the one he left on the streets george
someones gotta run our legitimate businesses
someones gotta make sure that
someones gotta chum the waters
thats bullshit and i aint saying another fucking word to you
then you can just listen
the jig is up
we know concezio had that priest killed
george snaps his head to eunice in shock then recovers
oh surprise surprise
another thing you dont know i reckon
but why would he tell you
you and your guys on the streets youre his bait
yall just got thrown into a meat grinder
eunice goes to leave but stops and turns back
gorgeous george huh
expendable george is more like it
by the by you got a pretty nice ass for a fat man
a mexican joint tucked away down by the docks
you wanna find something in boston that dont wanna be found you go to the oracle ese
my uncle cesar is hooked up with the underground
the boys romeo and uncle cesar yrs sit in a booth
cesar is noble looking silver hair
silence as he looks them over
word is yakavettas gunning for you boys hard
the whole citys on edge
i even heard he posted a reward like jesse james style and shit
any of his guys that take you out gets his palm crossed two hundred and fifty grand
a quarter of a mill for us
what the fuck are you talking about us
they begin to argue in spanish

romeo swallows his anger
murphy speaks spanish
all the way in
cesar looks at murphy surprised
is my nephew pulling his weight
connor nods while tapping his chest
cesar looks to his nephew with a new found respect and touches his hand
romeo is very affected by this
back to business
gorgeous george is running the show for little yaka
drugs prostitution sharking the whole cha cha
if anybody knows where he is its that fat fucking pedico
ill put it out on the wire
romeo quietly weeps as he drives
the brothers are highly aware and give respectful silence
as romeo sniffles we show slow motion remembrances of cesar nodding and giving romeo a look of respect and then touching his nephews hand
back in the green machine an excruciating amount of time passes
murphy tries to break the ice
hey uh maybe we should
a moment of silence
then all three burst into laughter
you fucking assholes
a sprawling high rise apartment overlooking boston buffet table plasma screen etc
the capos are taking advantage of the amenities
concezios not here
capo fill their plates
that shipment of h was gonna square our books for six months
we always bounce back
besides look at the bright side
better the chinks than us right
like the boss said
concezio impression this is war
theres gonna be casuwalities
suddenly george enters with an overnight bag
the capos are confused
feigning a capitol mood
like the roman empire in here
wheres all the concubines and shit
nobody else does
he looks at the food table
we pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli
a look of dread
what gives here
i need to see the boss right away
jimmy the gofer
in hustles jimmy the gofer s skinny weak looking
to jimmy il cortina
jimmy draws back a large curtain exposing a steel panic room
next to the vault door is a video screen which displays the unamused face of concezio
his voice booms over loudspeakers
get over here
george hustles over
he stands before the screen confused
i just came by to
push the talk button numb nuts
he does can you here me

a terrified george hustles for the door
and dont come back here till i tell you to you fat fucking waste of space
george trips over his luggage
the capos giggle
cheap depressing room
crew cut in his underwear repairs a broken rosary chain with string and puts it on
he pulls a shoe box from a shopping bag
the brand is hushes
slogan measure up to your dreams
he puts on one shoe
crew cut stands before the mirror going up and down on the one shoed foot noting the height that has been added
the shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel
we are out back among scrap cars
george talks with jo jo rhama yrs
jo jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum
the sick fuck
and he leaves all of us on the streets holding the bag while him and his are living it up at the taj fuckin majal not a care in the
so until the saints get popped were all lambs to slaughter
and he dont care how many of us they wipe out in the meantime
what do you need me to do skipper
spread the word to all the brugliones
from your mouth to their ears
north and south
that could get a little dicey
fuck their old grudges
all of them are in this like it or not
tell them everything we discussed
even the panic room thing
thats a nice ice breaker
theyll get a kick outta that
i didnt even know those things were real
i thought they made that shit up for that movie
with that brawd and that kid
with those guys in that house
naw the other one
stop fuckin around
this is serious shit here
tell em we meet tomorrow night
ill call you with the location
pov of binoculars as we see george exit the front of the auto body
crew cut looks through his binoculars as he continues to bounce up and down on his special shoe
he smiles at the site of george
a table laden with clip boards bagged evidence reports etc
eunice finds a baggy with a tiny wooden bead in it
taps up and running on georges cell
holds up baggy whats this
they found it pushed into the carpet near the victim
father mckinney wasnt wearing a rosary so its probably been there a while
duffy comes in with a stack of papers
he heaves it down
the results on all prints found at the scene
all match churchgoers or clergy but one
the partial on the priests watch is still unidentified
eunice looks perplexed
dolly enters sipping coffee
thats horse shit
everyone gets printed nowadays
theyre inking up snotgobblers in kindergarten now
its a brick wall anyway
we know napoleon was wearing gloves
lab got zilch off the chain and lock
the pennies came up clean too
im gonna go powder my nose
greenly stares at her ass as she exits
daddy would knock that out like mike tyson
eunice suddenly re enters the room with emergency
i didnt say nothing
eunice is absorbed a photo on the wall of the priests hand
mckinney wore his watch on his left hand
she turns and holds up the baggy
where was this found exactly
duffy goes to a mock up of the victims body position on the wall
right here off his left elbow
where are you going with this
dolly get on the phone
find out which wrist he wore his rosary on and if he was wearing it that night
duffy run that partial through dmv
david put it through interpol
just get an i
they all dart out
with fire in her eyes she looks closely at a picture of the priests wrist watch on the wall
you took your glove off didntcha cowboy
now why would you go and do a damn fool thang like that
crew cut finishes ritualizing the priest and looks deeply at his victim
he removes a glove and places his tiny hand next to mckinneys large one
bare handed crew cut snatches the priests rosary from about his wrist breaking the bead chain
the brothers and romeo walk through the mausoleum
they approach a grave slate with respect
the name reads david della rocco
there is a picture of him
murphy narrows his eyes and leans in
did they use his mug shot
you remember how he told us he was embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up all his long hair behind his head
look at that
we see murphys finger denote a bad airbrush job
thats an arm
connor looks close
thats fuckin harsh
the boys look at one another then bust out laughing
yer one of a kind roc
so am i as good as this guy or what
you sir are no david della rocco
instantly the boys turn and level weapons
there stands roy yrs thick glasses geeky
he drops his flowers
beat recognition holy shit

im roy its an honor
the boys reholster and look to one another
were developin quite the cult following in the old neighborhood
the boys continue to chat with roy as romeo answers his cell
i got that info you wanted mijo
the salon manager approaches the back door with keys in hand
the place is tropical tan on bunker hill
its where the fat fucking juedo gets his fake bake at
hes got a secret appointment
once a week never misses
eight oclock tonight
the manager lets george slip in
he steels into a tanning room
a mexican towel boy has spied george
he picks up a phone
romeo snaps his phone shut and turns to the boys
we got him
re romeo whos this your new sidekick

the three walk for the door leaving roy behind
i i didnt mean to

well theres an i in fuck you
moody music as our trio walks through the gravestones
the brothers and romeo sneak up to the tanning bed
george sings a sinatra tune as his fat stomach props the cover up like a half open clamshell
suddenly murphy leaps up and sits on the cover
george is being crushed beneath his weight
wed like ya ta sing for us
what do ya say
george struggles and nods
murphy hops off
george spills out hot pink speedos
on all fours and breathing heavy
its getting hard to be a fucking gentleman of leisure here
the boys pull weapons and throw him against the wall in a jesus christ pose pinning his hands with their guns
we want the shooter you motherfuckers used on that priest
i dont know who it is
the boys cock back the hammers on their weapons
its the truth
concezio didnt tell no one what he was doing cuz he knew nobody would have okayed it
the shooters an independent contractor
thats all i know
wheres yakavetta hidin
a ringing phone is heard
romeo pulls georges blackberry from nearby
he tosses it to connor
text message where

her cell rings
she checks the i

greenly is at his desk
hey dmv came up dry on the partial

he sent it to his enforcer jo jo rhama

i think ill drop in on their supper see if i can shake them up a little
you need a body guard
no thank you mike tyson
she hangs up and we are left with greenly
close up three shot
george looking very uncomfortable is flanked by the brothers
he is positioned to covertly view the restaurant from the kitchen
we see northside brugliones and southside brugliones and are at the bar
just two more to go
you guys are gonna let me go right
well see wont we
looks as if hell cry
jesus this is some embarrassing shit
we see the three men from behind
george is still in his speedos which now have a pronounced shit stain in back
romeo frazzled and in a busboy uniform has got two blenders of margaritas going
the brugliones mow through appetizers
northside doesnt interact with southside and there is an empty bar stool between them
bruglione slides romeo a platter
more nachos and mas salsa capisce
hey and i need a refill there pepe
southside bruglione enters behind everyone
all suddenly turn going for their guns
bruglione gives a respectful nod to the northside guys but sits with his own
we do not see george just below frame as the boys are working on him in some way putting on finishing touches
romeo barrels in
these dagos are getting antsy and im getting spicarood and peped
the kids about to go poncho fucking villa out there
stick it out
waitin on one more
jo jo exits his cadillac and walks toward el cava
there is a closed for private function sign on the door
crew cut watches jo jo
he dials his cell
from behind we see the old man gardening
he answers a ringing phone nearby
we do not see his face
the following conversation is in italian
he is not with them
are you certain
it is only the sons
they have a spaniard with them
they will slaughter everyone
if you kill the sons
the father will come
crew cut develops a sinister smile
connor watches jo jo greet the others
he turns to romeo who is angrily cooking up a storm
the gangs all here
without missing a beat romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink
he stands fuming with his hands on his hips
gimme my fucking bee bee gun
youve earned your stripes rome
murphy throws him a
suddenly george comes rolling out of the kitchen unconscious and tied face down to a bus cart
there is writing on his back
everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward
what the fuck is going on here
wheres that spic barkeep
where you at
as the gangsters achieve the cart the brothers creep over the bar in the b
brugliones look down on george painted on his back
erin go brah
what the hell does that mean
connor and murphy are standing feet behind them
its irish for youre fucked
hard core music as the brugliones turn in horror
everyone begins firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music
several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into george on the cart knocking it over
george comes to
romeo appears and tears in sending several more crashing into the salad bar
murphy while firing dives back over the bar as bottles explode
connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth
the boys rise and lay out a second barrage blasting the rest into buffet tables and a soda fountain
the music cuts
viva la mejico bitches
george bolts up
the bus cart is still tied to his fat belly
uh ive seen the light
you guys have really turned me around on this
im like born again and shit
to connor what do ya think
let him go
connor slips one bullet in a revolver spins the barrel and snaps it shut
he points it to georges forehead
george weeps in earnest
well let god decide if you get a second chance
he slowly cocks the hammer back pulls trigger click
well praise the lord
the terrified ex gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling out of his bonds
just as he touches the door
george turns all good boys go to heaven
george nods and exits
romeo is confused as our trio gathers
connor tosses the bullet he palmed to romeo and he nods
now that was perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that i have ever had the good fortune ta witness
well thank you very much
slo mo suddenly eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels her weapon at the brothers and romeo
romeo levels back
eunice fires as the boys dive on romeo
crew cut is revealed behind our trio firing from the shadows
eunice and crew cut exchange fire as the boys reload
eunice hits crew cut in the side
the assassin has a moment of outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit
in the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is gone
presently romeo and the boys bolt up
romeo goes for the door and the boys level at eunice
drop the gun
she places her gun on a nearby table
the boys are before her as romeo returns
who are ya
my name is eunice bloom
and im your new guardian angel
a torch was passed to me by a mutual friend gone but not forgotten
the boys reholster
she drops her arms
we heard about smecker
he was a good man
you have our condolences
and you have mine
the boys nod
romeo points to the front door
who the fuck was that guy
that i suspect was the shooter you boys have been looking for
the boys look at each other
what the fuck
who the fuck is this brawd
and what the fucks going on here
lets speed this up before your new sidekicks got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary
the boys chuckle
oh no you didnt
i am an fbi agent who is controlling this investigation from within in order to ensure that you gentlemen never see the inside of a prison cell
i am conspiring to do this with three like minded individuals who have aided you in the past
though i have yet to inform them of my agenda because well girls gotta have her fun
dolly duffy and greenly
the very same
how are the lads
two of them are scared
ones just horny
betcha i can guess which one
betcha can but lets save it for group
right now we have a big problem
eunice denotes the bodies
simply wont do
we made a deal
the big fish step in if your body count gets too high and
re carnage you have been very naughty boys
rockin music overtakes as we dissolve to
with eunice directing them the boys and romeo restage the crime scene
with a squeegee they move pools of blood across the linoleum floor and re position bodies
the boys wrap jo jos body in a tarp and put it in the green machine
romeo creates blood splatter with a turkey baster
romeo and the brothers place the guns they used in the hands of dead gangsters as eunice drops bullet casings in carefully chosen spots
romeo and the brothers leave with the utensils used to rig the scene
the music fades leaving eunice in the center of
she removes her ear plugs and the sound returns
we are on a very different looking scene
csi forensics even dolly and duffy wait with baited breath
greenly is not present
heres how it all went down
dolly and duffy open their notepads
northside stands facing off with the southside
all brugliones are frozen in place
eunice saunters down the middle
a secret gathering of the brugliones
the topic of discussion
weak leadership and betrayal
yakavettas hiding from these jesus freaks and making us look like pussies
and hes hanging all of us out to dry to boot
a pause as they size each other up
ill be the first to say it
the enemy of my enemy is my friend
so even with all their old vendettas
i say fuck the yakavettas
and there it is
guess what comes next
eunice points to men as he moves down the line
were taking over
easier uttered than accomplished
the north end and the south end may as well be the hetfields and the mccoys
they just dont get on
all the brugliones yell over one another
the north end built that racket from the ground up
south ends been carrying your fucking asses for years
in your dreams asshole
just went up to twenty fuck stick
brulione flashes a gun in his waist band
you want some of this you mutt
bruglione pulls his weapon
lets see what you got
they all pull and level at one another
they freeze in place and all yelling ceases as eunice walks down the middle
oh the cliche
a mexican stand off in a mexican restaurant
eunice looks deeply at all the men as she turns a slow circle
they cut each other to pieces
and nobody walked away
who knows who fired first
could have been any one of them
but somebody let it loose
pointing to men and duck duck duck
eunice stands before s
they all start shooting as eunice stands in the crossfire unaffected
men fall dead and we see the relevance of each thing eunice did to doctor the scene
yakavettas lost control of the streets
theyre fighting over his throne
this was not the work of the saints
heads nod agreement
greenly enters and flashes a file to eunice
press clamors for the story in the b
eunice and the detectives are in a private spot
greenly excitedly hands her the file
interpol came through
eunice opens the file
picture of crew cut
dolly and duffy read over her shoulder
you were right
five foot five
gotta be the shooter
eunice smiles and speaks to crew cuts photo
are you ready for your fifteen minutes sweetheart
that aint all
short stuffs work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesnt exist and look at the date
two months after nine eleven
someone maneuvered it through the system using false information during the highest alert in u
yakavettas just a gangster
he aint got the juice to pull that off
youre darn tootin he dont
ins red flagged it like a motherfucker
its a shit storm
something stanks like manure
the cops nod
eunice turns and starts to move away
we got someplace to be
the detectives look nervous
what is this
where are we going
its time to revisit the scene of the crime
eunice pulls to a stop
at the sight of the place the cops turn white as a ghost
all exit the vehicle and walk toward
its after hours
i mean if you wanted a drink then
bodies later and were finally back where it all began
yever heard of the southern expression we have an elephant in the living room
she knocks on the door
the cops are mortified
hope you fellas brought some peanuts
doc opens it and lets them all into
connor and murphy are seated at the bar
the cops are dumbfounded
duffy turns to eunice mystified
you knew all along
ya dont call
ya dont write
dolly actually drops to his knees in abject relief
greenly laughs and plants a kiss on eunices cheek
doc pours shots
eunice smiles as all her guys hug and make merry
doc smiles from the bar as the group raises for a toast
im glad we got the band back together
re romeo even though our new bass players kind of a retard
they all laugh cheers and drink
conversations buzz all around
eunice chats with the boys as she sips a cosmo

he swings the vault open
romeo and the boys stand in angelic light at the gates of heaven
cheesy music as they enter
gleaming weapons everywhere
something catches romeos eye and he moves off
preferred customers select from my private reserve
he withdraws two mahogany boxes
if i may make a suggestion
he lifts the lids
in each box is a pair of desert eagle
cal black outs
the triangular barrels have been fitted with matching triangular silencers
the boys are mystified
i feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in willy wonka and the chocolate factory
picks up gun and i want an oompa loompa now daddy now
he pulls a few duffel bags
full accessory packages
im sure youll find them useful
romeo suddenly appears and slaps down a metal box

romeo snaps to him eyes wide in challenge
tears of joy

romeo withdraws two gold plated
s intricately engraved pearl handles with a mexican flag
the boys snicker

to dealer you dont know me

the dealer shrugs
you look like you might have seen one up close
this is a common home at the end of a cul de sac
the old man picks up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door
he opens the paper with shock
a big picture of crew cut on the front saints innocent new suspect in priests murder he reads frantically
new evidence discovered at the crime scene
he ambles into the house and to a
the old man moves to crew cuts bedside
he sees the rosary about the slumbering mans neck and rips it off
crew cut bolts awake
foolish arrogant boy
what have you done
he whips crew cut with the rosary until he cowers in the corner weeping profuse apologies in italian
monitors show angles of the apartment outside
this small space is equipped for single living
yakavetta is frazzled baggy eyed in a robe
jimmy the gofer sits quietly as concezio babbles to himself
that wiley old fox not as clever as we thought
or maybe he played me from the git
y you think he played me
maybe you aught not to be telling me this stuff
concezio smacks him across the face
a little sensitivity huh

i need to vindicate my feelings here
i cant tell those goombas outside
theyll serve up my balls over a plate of fucking spaghetti
the capos huddle up
we got a mutiny on our hands
every ten cent wanna be with a gun is moving on us all over town
yeah and our fearless leader aint even come out of his little pussy room yet
with this the panic room door slides open and concezio emerges holding a bag
he dumps a bunch of cell phones on the coffee table
i want each of you to call your top button man
the best you got
i want them all here tonight
we rip this city a new asshole
its time for us to reconnoiter our strength on the streets
we seize the day starting now
carpel tunnel gentlemen carpel tunnel
all are relieved and words of approval flow
glad to see you back among the living boss
nearby jimmy knocks over a bottle of wine crash
concezio dives back into the panic room
the door slides shut
dolly drives a laundry truck into the prus loading dock area
dolly backs it up to the dock and pulls to a stop
romeo in a laundry uniform emerges from the back pushing a loaded laundry cart
he enters a
at the halls opposing end two maintenance workers move toward
romeo sees and quickly puts his head down
soon romeo and the maintenance men converge
they turn entering opposing elevators
as the doors close romeo looks into the opposing elevator
the maintenance men are duffy and greenly ball caps duffel bags
as the elevator ascends romeo swipes off the laundry pulls the false top
the brothers pop out in their usual garb
weapons emerge and they gear up
romeo looks unsure

romeo exits with the cart
the boys remain
the doors close
connor and murphy look at each other
you ready fer dis shit my dear brother
cal lets do some gratuitous violence
a demolished environment
the towering windows are blown out providing a threatening view of the city below
here eunice stands looking out over the panorama
to herself on a sultry saturday in september the saints saved seventeen souls
try saying that five times fast
she turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway lined with pulverized statues
a long table of ravaged food extends
crime scene personnel toil
ritualized bodies everywhere
greenly is by the panic room
he pushes the talk button
theres nothing to be afraid of
its all over
he wont come out
he joins dolly and duffy who stand on the periphery
eunice is dead center absorbing the scene when suddenly fbi agent john kuntsler barrels in with his g men
special agent bloom
you are hereby relieved of all obligation to this investigation
he holds up his i
a collective groan from crime scene personnel
thats right kids
this crime scene is now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government
as of now you will all report to me special agent john kuntsler
the detectives look to kuntslers g men as if squaring off
dont let us interrupt you
just dont forget to turn over everything you find
we have people standing by ready to take credit for all your hard work
he chuckles as all return to work
kuntsler turns to eunice
so how ya doin bloomy
kuntslers shit eating grin disappears
he leans in
nice little science project you got going with these three goofballs
re detectives you trying to turn them into your own little junior g men
well you can put sprinkles on shit bloom but its still shit
so you and your keystone cops can all go home now and let the professionals handle this
id love to hear a gen u wine professionals assessment of a crime scene
how bout you detectives
dolly duffy and greenly chorus the affirmative
kuntsler looks unsure then phonies up some bravado
seems pretty obvious
the door was broken down
weve got our point of entry
the assailants fired in this direction
points toward windows
explains the windows
the victims were
there are three inaccuracies in what you just said
number one david
if the windows were shattered by gunfire coming from inside the room the glass would have been blown outward
as you can see most of it is on the inside
his eyes widen
number two dolly
blood splatters in the direction of the rounds fired
if the assailants discharged toward the windows the blood would follow suit
here the majority of splatter is in the opposing direction
number three duffy
there is no number three
he only fucked up twice
looks like bloomy aced her science project
kuntslers men look embarrassed
that was just off the
i would have seen the blood thing
i havent even had time to
why dont you let me take a crack at it john
wont cost you nuthin
and just why would i do that
mammas right on time
eunice alone saunters before the huge windows which are now intact
concezio holds court nearby
he is shaved and dressed
his capos sit around in a loose semi circle
there are six dangerous looking men standing shoulder to shoulder before them
this evenings topic of discussion
desperate times require desperate measures
desperate times require
some you know some desperate shit
starting tonight every one of you fat fucking slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread
a chorus of protest
shut the fuck up
they obey we got no choice
you motherfuckers better get in touch with your inner gangster
its time to knock the dust off your ball bats
you break bones
you smash heads
you do whatever you gotta do
which brings us to the relevance of our new guests
to button men each one of you is to stick to the guy that called you here like glue
you arm yourselves to the teeth pick your own crews
these bible banging psychos will make an attempt
its your job to blow their souless hearts out of their chests
its time to reclaim the streets with an iron fist
we gotta take back whats ours with some sincere ironfistery
eunice walks the roof with kuntsler et al in tow
lets explain the glass now
why is most of it inside the room
they halt before a window washing scaffold
or it will be why in a moment
ysee these boys
well to put it simply they tend to get reeeeal
its a creative plan
duffy greenly and the boys descend the tower
greenly works the controls as duffy helps the boys tie on harnesses
probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie
and here i am again all tyin myself up with rope
what is the deal with you and rope
it happens ta be a useful thing
the boys start yelling over each other
duffy turns to connor
you didnt get this from a movie
murphy regards his brother well
the eiger sanction clint eastwood
and it worked like a fucking charm for him
romeo peeks out a cracked door at a mafioso guard

eunice stands alone on the end of the scaffold
and you can count on it like the u
through rain sleet hail or snow
something always seems to go wrong for these poor sons o guns
the scaffold suddenly stops
what the fuck

oh god uh how about eat it
what are we at a buffet now
good god man

lets brainstorm on that idea for a minute
the boys ropes are secured and they each pull a rambo knife
romeo pushing his cart jives down the hall toward the guard singing la couca racha
the guard puts out a halting hand
thing has always amazed me
eunice stands dead center
how quiet it gets
you ever noticed that
its hard to imagine that just a few hours ago it was the god damn o
coral in here
fantasy sequence cool country western music
close on a pair of cowboy boots pacing toward
eunice stands before the looming windows
the immaculate food table stretches before her
she is now in full cowgirl regalia leather chaps rawhide coat boots cowboy hat and a pair of gleaming six guns on her hips
with the brim of her hat slung low eunice bursts into twirling gunplay with her colts
she spins them all around flipping them catching them etc
she holsters and stops
one thang im gon guarantee ya
first connor jumps off then murphy
they fall down and out in slow motion knives in hand
eunice rolls the chamber of one of her colts along her arm
we gon have us a good time
the boys snap to a stop and swing in toward the building
with their free hand they each pull a
in the old barn tonight
the country western music goes hard core
slo mo two bullet holes pierce the windows behind eunice as she levels her colts
the mammoth panes shatter but stay in the frame
slo mo all gangsters bolt upright as their plasma screen explodes with the boys rounds
some pull weapons
romeo pulls his
s and takes out the guard
he kicks in the door and rushes in
slo mo the brothers smash through the glass
they fire as they swing over eunices head
slo mo eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut their ropes in mid air with the rambo knives
the brothers land on their knees
their momentum carries them sliding on either side of the table
slo mo eunice runs along the table top crushing food and keeping pace with the boys as all three let the led out
slo mo the gangsters and button men return fire in chaos
slo mo gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture into walls
slow motion gun battle
slo mo yakavetta runs toward his panic room
at the last second jimmy the gofer hip checks him and dives in
the door slides shut
for a few moments the gun battle rages around eunice who stands in the center rapid firing at the gangsters
soon it is over
the brothers slam concezio to his knees and level to the back of his head
as he begs for his life
and shepherds we shall be for thee my lord for thee
power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
so we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be
romeo watches in awe
in nomine patris e filii e spiritus sancti
romeos been waiting guns up and
who ordered the whup ass fajita
whup ass fajita
the brothers turn to each other
thats fuckin stupid
eunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a colt
hold up now
everything freezes in place
eunice shuffles over to romeo
was that the best you could do
i couldnt think
whispers in ear ya broke down the door didntcha
romeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes
quick cut he breaks down the door
quick cut the brothers shoot yakavetta
quick cut romeo guns up and once more with feeling
ding dong motherfucker diiiing dong
the brothers look at romeo then to each other

eunice stands before the panic room door
she is totally disheveled
she swipes her hair back
and that gentlemen
is the sound of the fat lady singin
everyone stands in shock kuntsler his g men the detectives even crime scene workers
greenly whispers to duffy

suddenly the panic room door slides open and jimmy yanks eunice inside
the door shuts
everyone rushes toward
duffy bangs on the door
greenly slams the talk button

greenly wheels around facing kuntsler

thats just weird
what do you think it means
feels like our ghost ta me
what do we do now
i mean the brothers aint goin nowhere until we get panza or they do
weve all had enough excitement for one night
lets sleep on it
crew cut watches eunice and the detectives from the dark alley
he has shaved his head bald giving him a sinister look
the place is empty except for connor and murphy having a celebratory shot at the bar and cleaning their weapons
whens romeo returnin to the hide out
soon as hes done apologizin to his uncle for wreckin his restaurant
and he should be sorry
they chuckle as a loud knocking is heard
as doc peeps through the spy hole and unchains the front doors
hold your damn horses
he lets greenly in and locks it behind him
greenly takes a few steps in stops and grabs his crotch with both hands
sack o matic i said
as the boys guffaw boom
a shotgun blast through the door sends greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back
crew cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a shoulder strap
he pulls two sigs and rapid fires at the brothers
the boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their weapons
connor and murphy check their clips
i got nothin
connor racks his
cal and looks in the chamber
one in the hole
they see a shotgun behind the bar
murphy grabs it
just as they are about to stand they hear doc cry out
they stand and level
crew cut has doc from behind
mm to his temple
put dem down
throw dem over
the boys do not flinch
crew cut pushes his gun into docs temple hard
he cries out in pain
throw dem over
the boys toss their guns over the bar
crew cut levels toward them holding doc in place
he whispers in docs ear
which one first
re murphy dee other eh
he cocks back his hammer
a silence pop
rings out from the shadows
crew cuts hand is hit
he drops crying out in pain
slo mo poppa m emerges from the shadows and moves to crew cut with a smoking silenced walther pistol in hand
the brothers have just a moment of shock before greenly chokes up some blood
they jump the bar and rush to him
call da fuckin ambulance
as they hold greenly and beg him to hold on we move to poppa m standing over crew cut
crew cut looks up at him in awe
where is the old man
poppa m pulls two
he snaps the rotary chambers out puts one bullet in each gun spins the chambers and snaps them shut
he holds them out to crew cut
the boys weep oblivious to this
just hold on
hang in there brother
greenly struggles to speak
proudest day of my life
he seizes violently and dies
the brothers are in anguish
crew cut picks a
he and poppa m level to each others foreheads
crew cut is excited
poppa m is calm tranquil
the brothers bolt up in shock
the boys watch in horror trying to figure it out
poppa m motions for his opponent to go first
crew cut cocks his hammer back with a click
the brothers eyes go wide
what the fucks he doin
crew cut pulls the trigger click
connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun
im gonna blow this mother fuckers brains out right now
he cocks it and levels to crew cuts head
poppa m holds out his free hand
connor lowers the gun
poppa m pulls back the hammer click
where is he
crew cut is unsure of himself
shakes his head
the brothers focus on poppa ms gun as he tenses on the trigger
crew cut clenches up bracing for impact
poppa m pulls click
the brothers drop to their knees and pray hard
crew cut recovers
he smiles pulls back the hammer
make me famous
crew cuts eyes widen in fear
pulling back hammer where
the brothers pray faster as crew cut thinks in horror
crew cut falls dead
the boys sit at the kitchen table with poppa m
romeo is propped up on a counter nearby
cesar sets out coffee
im so sorry boys
this is all my fault
cesar takes romeo and leaves giving them some privacy
what are ya talkin about da
poppa m strokes the faded butterfly tattoo on the back of his hand
i was an immigrant to the u
i was sixteen
i came to new york where my father jacob macmanus was a cobbler
had a little shop and i was to learn the family business
mafia was everywhere in those days
italian thugs talk to jacob macmanus yrs
in these flashbacks we will refer to young poppa m as noah
noah works in back but watches
but your grandfather was proud
i cant help ya with dat lads
ya got problems with your shoes id be happy to have a look got fair prices
noah stands shaking as he watches his father beat to death
we fade into later as he holds his fathers body wailing
an italian kid with a leg brace louie yrs staggers in and hobbles to noah
il ochio de dio
we gotta call the polizia noah
we gotta call somebody
noah louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest affair
noah is emotionless
i buried my father then i buried the men who killed him
louie my best friend helped me
noah holds a knife to thug s throat at a card table
he has thug s head pinned to the table top with a
nearby louie holds a large
magnum with shaking hands
seated thugs and hands raised are scared as they look at noahs dead eyes
come on kid
it was an accident
we can work dis out
whatever you want
he aint gonna do shit
to thug ill take two
what da fucks da matter with you
cant you see

in italian to louie youre italian kid
help us out here
put one in the back of his head and you get anything you want
i i i
am his friend
fuck him and fuck his friend
deal the cards
he aint got the balls
noah shoots thug then cuts thug s throat
the other mafiosi scream in horror
louie kneels and weeps
noah shoots thug in the heart and calmly takes aim at thug
he shoots him in the throat and he is blown to the floor grasping his bleeding neck
noah rounds the table and takes aim
the man is choking on his own blood
noah slowly lowers his gun and just watches
louie works on a pair of shoes
they are both a bit older
it started out slowly
just the ones who were a threat to us
mafioso and talk to the stoic noah
come on kid
its good for you good for us
well move it right out the back of the place
itll never touch you
you got the word of the bonnavese family on that
no response from noah
whats da matter with you eh
we see louie peeking through the curtains
what are you stupid or something
he smacks noah across the face
noah and louie bury the bodies of mafioso and
louie stops and rests
he watches noah and thinks
closed sign in the door
noah and louie eat sandwiches
then one day
why should we not help others who suffer these mafia thugs
noah puts down his sandwich
louie talks to noah with passion m
and he listens while nodding his head
then it began
over dialogue and music we see the following images
noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather
louie helps noah make a serious looking leather vest
louie hobbles in with a sack
he dumps a bevy of handguns on a table
all different makes
louie would pick the marks and plan everything in detail
louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m
holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest
noah loads the vest with guns as louie tightens the buckles stands back and looks noah over
and i would go in and do the jobs
a mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator
the doors open
insides is noah dark jacket english mac hat
he opens his coat revealing the vest
he draws two weapons executes them all and calmly hits a button
the doors close
i would execute over and over again those who had taken my father from me
we do a montage of noah killing mafiosi in many different ways
so it went for years
we pan to the gaping mouthed brothers
howd ya end up inside da
back in i did a hit came out and the police were waitin for me
he set me up to life
why did he set you up
cant wait ta ask him
why didnt ya flip on him
cut down yer time
the guy fucked ya
why the hell not
a picture of a woman with two babies is slammed to the glass
hed learned of the birth of my sons
connor and murphy hang their heads
connor looks up
do you know louies full name
the boys look at each other
greenlys bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance
eunice stops the emts unzips it and touches his face
she weeps and then crushes into dollys chest
he holds her and cries too as duffy watches in anguish
eunices cell rings
she ignores it and dolly pulls it from her pocket and tosses it to duffy never letting go of eunice
put eunice on
connor hands the phone to poppa m
eyes still red from crying eunice covertly works at a computer
soon a picture of the roman comes on up
eunice looks at his face with trepidation and then
i hope they do it slow
you piece of shit
close on an old time phone being carried to a rear table
we drift by a poker game and young italian thugs betting horses and sports
s and smoke are abundant
the phone is set on a back table
patronazzi yrs an ancient italian man drinking espresso picks up
its the old man
in italian alternating coverage
hello old friend
are you in need
i am making marinara and alas i have run out of tomatoes
to help an old friend
how many can you spare
patronazzi looks up
slowly many of the young thugs turn
i am in good supply of tomatoes
the boys slumber
we push in on their staggered profiles
they simultaneously take a deep breath
flash to white
the boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of fenway park
it is empty and quiet as a church
a man walks toward them
they struggle to see
presently we reveal rocco
he passes them
the games starting
the brothers follow him
red sox emblems are abundant
funny thing about the red sox
we never gave up hope yknow
its what kept us going all those years
and they did it
they finally fuckin did it
what are we all gonna do now huh
they emerge into the stands
perfect baseball field empty park
i lost a lot of money on em
but i gotta admit
always felt better
betting the underdogs
rocco walks on
the boys follow
the boys stand on the mound
rocco walks a circle around it
so hows things going
the boys drop their heads
its rough having your faith shaken
the brothers have a pained expression
but it happens to all of us
you know whats always tripped me out
how hundreds of years ago a bunch of desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships crossed the ocean blue
they had no clue what was on the other side of it
took real balls
but they sailed into infinity and made it all the way to the shores of the new fucking world
re surroundings and all they had was their faith
im always surprised how so many people miss the simple fact that faith
is the reason all of us are even here
you cant underestimate the power of it
shit you were the ones that taught me that
rocco looks to his left and right
listen your my boys so im gonna give you some inside
the sox are gonna do it again this year
the line in vegas is huge
put everything you got on it
the boys look to each other
maybe we should
youre sure roc
you know this
i just have faith
and for a second there you almost did too
ysee its contagious
and if enough people catch it
look out baby
a roaring cheer arises shaking the very foundations of the arena
the boys turn in awe
the stands are still empty
they jolt awake and look to each other
while the wicked stand confounded
call me with thy saints surrounded
poppa m stands before eunice
she hands him an envelope
he lives in york maine
about minutes from here
better go quick
i logged on to an fbi database to get the info
homeland security does internal monitoring now
only a matter of time before they flag it
will they know its you
she nods will you be all right dear
i hear costa ricas nice
she looks at him as her eyes well up with tears
i never thought id ask this of another human being but please
kill this man
she is overcome and weeps
poppa m holds her
it ends taday
kuntsler pours a coffee
g man comes in holding a piece of paper
anybody word from bloom yet
i want that little bayou bitch in here
something stinks about this whole thing
im having d
dump her ip and check for flags
see if shes been poking around
poppa m the brothers and romeo walk kneel at the altar before a memorial to mckinney candles pictures cards flowers etc
as they pray a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin to realize who they are
our foursome stands and walks back down the aisle
they make eye contact with a few people
when the saints are gone the churchgoers gather in the aisle and stare at the front door in disbelief
one guy opens his cell phone
then he thinks
and closes it
g man excitedly gives kuntsler a file
his eyes widen
kuntsler slaps the file down in front of jimmy who is cuffed to a metal table
he looks at a picture of the roman
kuntsler and his men speed along sirens blaring
this is s
jonathan buford kuntsler
security code a b
i need an immediate r law enforcement override clearance
what is your specific request agent
everyone in the tri state area with a gun
the romans common two story home looms in the b
at the end of a cul de sac
walking down the middle of the street is poppa m black trench hat dark shades
he opens the door and enters the
poppa m listens far off scratchy music
he moves quietly through the house stopping at the foot of the stairs
he removes his rosary hangs it on the banister and moves on pulling a weapon
the roman swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it
beside him a horned phonograph plays s jazz
behind him we see that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home
the roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame
across the pit an empty chair
extended before him is a stunning garden standing in stark contrast to the common house vines flowers cobblestone walks fountains
the center piece is a turkish pool with pure white lillys afloat
poppa m slowly approaches the roman from behind
he holsters his weapon and sits
the roman halts the phonograph
we havent much time
the roman smiles and gestures the surroundings
she is beautiful yes
ah but you
you are blind to beauty
you are a destroyer noah
you know my reasons
you know why i did what i did
but do you
you think it was for your father
you were born a killer
is in the very blood that runs through your veins
then explain this
the roman flicks a photo over
it lands in poppa ms lap
it is the picture we saw earlier
a woman holding two babies
you were not there to raise them
not a single day
yet how closely they follow in the footsteps of their father
they have inherited your blood noah
poppa m looks at the photo deeply
outside back wall of greenhouse
thugs from patronazzi hunker down here
they are all armed
whispered into walkie remember not a scratch on the old man
we look out the bay windows
it is a straight shot down the slanted roof to the roof of the greenhouse
thugs stand quietly inside
wait for the signal
a gloved hand grabs up poppa ms rosary
connor pockets it as he and murphy silently climb the stairs
teams load into vans
squad cars speed through traffic
poppa m tosses the picture into the fire
what are you
the roman denotes his garden
i am a creator
our very natures stood in opposition as old as the story of the scorpion and the frog
did you sell me out louie
you can never understand
i wanted to join with them
they were building an empire
creating something and i was helping them
i used you noah to eliminate their problems to destroy their competition to cut out their cancers
i earned my place among them
poppa m looks around
is this your place among them
because all i see is a an old man sitting in a garden
alas the scorpion and the frog both lost everything yes
i should have paid more attention to the story
i was no longer useful to them
they cast me out
kuntsler barks into a walkie
the location is to be surrounded and secured upon arrival
nobody goes in
he suddenly looks out his window to the sky
in the distance two other copters fly in the same direction
are those fucking news choppers
why the priest louie
why all this
because i knew it would bring you and your sons
you would destroy the yakavettas and clear my way
this time i will take what is rightfully mine
just a little piece for my old age
after all i have never been a greedy man
the roman puts the needle back on the record
another thug opens the bay windows
birds eye view looking down on connor and murphy
they rapid fire their huge
cals through the wall
slo mo the heavy rounds blast through the wall and massacre the three thugs as they are about to exit
all following visuals in slo mo with slamming music
poppa m stands throwing open his trench and revealing his leather vest a six gun rig in the front
the roman in awe
the double doors crash in and men barrel through as poppa m turns pulls two weapons and fires upon them hitting one
the boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either side of poppa m
they fire as they fall hit the ground and roll
romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house blasting away with his gold
s a shotgun hanging on his back
the garden is being torn apart as the brothers poppa m and romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire
the boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized
the gun battle rages around the roman who remains seated in the very mouth of madness
his heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded
romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart
murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool
connor stands firing in a jesus christ pose
poppa m drops his empty weapons and pulls two more laying down a second barrage
romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder
he falls dropping his
he struggles to fire the shotgun
poppa m takes one in the chest
connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing
murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing
the boys and romeo manage to take out the last of the thugs who are blasted into the turkish pool
it is over
the music fades
squad cars screech to a halt as the chopper lands behind them
kuntsler exits shouting orders
many officers level over their hoods as s
piles out and moves toward
the roman looks around tears in his eyes
the boys hobble to their failing father who is on his knees
help me up
they get him to his feet
poppa m turns to the roman
he levels a revolver toward the seated man
with his last bit of strength
ill see you in a minute louie
poppa m fires one right between the romans eyes
poppa m crumbles
his sons lay him down
oh no no no
poppa m smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass ceiling
a plume of butterflies escape
its a beautiful day
it is da
the brothers weep
nearby romeo is slumped and bleeding on the edge of consciousness
a strange calm comes over the brothers as they stand and look to one another
can be heard surrounding the perimeter
the boys look to romeo
he smiles at them and nods
the brothers turn and walk into the house
the echoed voice of poppa m
and shepherds we shall be
cops level over their squads
for thee my lord for thee
slo mo the boys move toward the front door
power hath descended forth from thy hand
we cut to people around the country glued to their t
s crowds hush in bars airports stores
that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command
the door opens and the boys walk out guns down
so we shall flow a river forth to thee
romeo raises a weak hand as s
moves cautiously through a battle field of dead bodies
and teeming with souls shall it ever be
slo mo the boys stop in the middle of the lawn and look out over the massive presence
a policeman yells in his bullhorn m
slo mo close on the brothers guns fall to the grass
in nomini patri
slo mo the brothers drop to their knees
slo mo the brothers put their hands behind their heads
e spiritu sancti
dip to black
the music fades
subtext seven days later
crowds flood a cemetery
poppa ms casket is lowered
hundreds took off work today to say good bye to the man boston is calling simply the father
insert of romeo
still in a coma
the condition of romeo mata the young hispanic american allegedly operating with the saints remains critical
outside eunices home
the search continues for missing special agent eunice bloom
as of yet law enforcement has turned up nothing but have not ruled out foul play
new footage of the aftermath at the romans home
the young men whos names police are not releasing to the public have yet to utter a word since their capture
even to their court appointed attorneys
a mob of protesters chant set them free
five guests ballplayer comedian actor politician and a host are seated in the midst of an audience in the round
the format is similar to politically incorrect
it doesnt change anything
what they did is still more important
its still the issue
they deserve medals
they deserve the death penalty
the arguments are heard as the boys awaken in their hospital beds at the same moment
only god can judge
oh save it for group father
they are bandaged and hooked to machinery
well i know this
they certainly dont belong in prison
the boys turn and look out the windows at a group of cons in the yard staring up at them
oh i dont know
connor and murphys faces split with evil grins
they mimic guns at the cons and gesture as if shooting them
maybe thats just the place for them
