href b b the crow by davis schow based on a screenplay by john shirley based on the comic book created drawn and written by james obarr september boom
a crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a perched crow large in the f
as a spade smooths the walls of a new double decker plot
were losing the light lets pack it in
scoop digger parked f
towering gothic style church b
rolls of astro turf
they look up toward the sky
what you gonna ski on this
he indicates the mound of fresh dirt
spits into the grave
come on lets bag this
its beer time
alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt
as we move alongside a pair of canvas sided combat boots as the wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in sequence
cemetery defocused b
large glossy black the bird follows the arc of movement in the previous shot
ruffles its feathers as it begins to sprinkle rain
a dirty blondish tenement kid of eleven clad in a blend of cast offs and hand me downs her version of street punk chic
she totes a skateboard under one arm itself a berserk jackson pollock chaos of band stickers silver marker and graffiti with day glo wheels and transfers her impromptu bouquet so
she may unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain
she stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and exit b
guess the picnic got rained out
she looks down o
at as elly places the gathered flowers down
as elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave near shelly websters
tilt up from rose to the name eric draven
rain spatters the granite darkening it
extreme close up crows eye it blinks in its alien way
as it takes wing from its unseen perch
lands stop erics headstone
it pecks tentatively at the top of the monument
she hasnt gotten too far before she notices the bird
the bird blinks at her from the headstone
what are you like the night watchman
another blink from el birdo
as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking back
brutal building facades like dead eyes and bad alleyways like hungry mouths are gradually revealed as we continue pulling back to unveil that the cemetery is smack in the middle
of the city
close up of a foot long hot dog being drowned in mustard
what this place needs is a good natural catastrophe
albrecht is a black beat cop in a rain slicker
mickey is the grease aproned entrepreneur of maxi dogs a steamy open front fast foodery
you gotta put the mustard underneath first
maybe a flood like in the bible
here let me do it
he grabs the dog from mickey
mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks
albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog coating the bun with mustard rolling the dog in the bun
flashes mickey a gimme look
dont cheap out on me
heyyy its the elly monster
how do you ride that thing on a wet street
care for a hot dog
elly grabs the stool next to albrecht
they ve done this routine before
no onions though okay
horror no onions
they make you fart
spots elly a coke
whats goin on elly
i went to see a friend of mine
well hows your friend
shes still dead
albrecht and mickey exchange a look re ellys matter of factness
thunder kabooms o
the crow pecks the top of the stone again and a chip of granite flies off bang
as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock
a dot of blood on its ebony beak
a thin watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the stone towards the earth
rain does not interfere
lightning plays in the rolling cloud cover b
as it takes off from the gravestone into the rain
it slowly fills the name eric draven into the rock
a low angle like the shot introducing ellys boot
this time we see cowboy boots leather chaps
the foot taps
as lightning strikes
just enough for us to see a figure in a long duster and a cowboy hat
draven fills with blood
blood continues groundward
turning to meet frame as the crow alights on his outstretched arm
this is the skull cowboy
we glimpse the deathshead beneath the brim of the cowboy hat
as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave
shaking off rain
it walks a flat silver throwing knife across its knuckles like a quarter somersaulting
the turf stirs beneath the white rose
magically a slim white parts the earth to grasp the rose
skull cowboy pov erics grave as the figure of eric draven stands up from behind his own headstone
clad in cerements cheap black burial suit slit open in back
a nothing tie
rain sluices mud from his upturned face
he looks to the sky
as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree
erics pov the skull cowboy water blurred through the rain standing with the crow perched on his arm like a hunting falcon
he releases it and it flies to the tree
wipes mud from his eyes tries to clear vision
the crow lights in the tree and they meet eye to eye
eric looks back o
and we rack to include the skull cowboy
what the hell are you
follow the crow
the skull cowboy speaks in nicely distorted buzzlike charnal house whisper
unsettling and hackle raising
eric turns back to the bird which takes wing in the rain his eyes follow it
he looks back disoriented doubtful but the skull cowboy is gone
taking wing in the rain showing the way
alone in the cemetery
after a moments hesitation he lurches off following the crow
a candy flaked muscle t bird is parked at the curb
a moving shot during o
past dead video and pinball devices
pasta desk with an open briefcase coffee cup ashtray someone was just there
then past a woman trussed with duct tape to her office chair gagged hot fear in her darting eyes
complete camera move to include skank a blade thin speed freak with pattern baldness always loud jittery a manic dust puppy
and t bird an arrogant arayan brush cut iron pumper who is prepping an incendiary
he exhibits a small squeeze bottle of arson cocktail to skank
uncle t birds proof accelerator
i squirt you with this you could jump in the detroit river and burn all the way to the bottom
insert a close up of the bomb in his hands as he works
silver canisters an led timer wires
you know lake erie actually caught on fire once from all the crap in it
wish i coulda seen that
he clicks a switch
led countdown blurs
were ready to rock
skank notices the captive womans handbag on the floor
picks it up
looks through it for valuables
what about working girl
intercut the womans increasingly horrified reactions
what about her
i say we leave her here to fry man
t bird looks casually at the woman
lets take her with us
her eyes bug in a terrified no
as the t bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street
one eye on his digital watch doing an equally fast countdown
skank wrestles their captive the woman in the back seat
pissed off skank shut her the fuck up
skank punches her and she sags
then he looks forward
whoaaa t bird red light red light
as the t bird slews wide cutting sidewalk scattering nightwalkers immediately attracting everybodys attention
reacting with a mouthful
mickey grabs the counter phone instantly
call it in
albrecht is off and running for the corner already
yeah do it
to elly stay right there
hold on mickey
he points at albrechts hot dog
yelling after you want i should save this for you
the car slides to a nose down panic stop
dump her man dump her
the woman comes tumbling from the car which blasts off with a war hoop from the guys inside
gun out hauling ass on wet pavement
aims at the departing car
gives it up
still too far away
pedestrians in the way
hurting cut bleeding tottering toward the dumpster
duct tape stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth
with her as she falls into the alley darkness
straight into the arms of their eyes lock
eric stiffens with his first flash
nb erics flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature of things with which he makes physical contact
hints and fragments in fierce super saturated color
puzzle pieces he must assemble
each flash keynoted by a blowback noise and accompanied by a degree of pain
it hurts to remember
the faces of skank and t bird are murky ephemeral their voices hideous distorted echoes
a knife snaps open
we see the blade
skank hits her pow
and an airborne crow pov spiralling up and away from them
perched on a fire escape high above watching and waiting
he lets her drop away horrified
and staggers back into the cover of the alley
her blood is on his hands
skidding in spotting the woman
kneeling to her
youre gonna be okay
can you understand me
im a police officer
the woman is no longer in pain
deathly calm now
he touched me and it stopped
what did you say
i saw a ghost
her eyes roll back and she dies in albrechts arms
dont go darlin you stay with me now
booming back from albrecht the woman onlookers as police units screech up to assist
eric in lurching flight panting
stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of arcade games
circling then lighting on the fire escape above eric
crowvision is what the crow gives eric to see
visually distinct and immediately identifiable
which hes already seen through the crows eyes
looking up at the crow
suddenly he cottons and covers his eyes just in time to shield from the rear windows exploding outward in a spray of fire and debris
he reels back crashes into a dumpster
landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat boots in the trash
the blood from his hands mars his burial shirt
he tears the shirt away leaving his tie absurdly intact
wipes his face with his shirt
stops held by his discovery as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest
almost a circle
comically he feels his back foe exit wounds
then hauls himself upright coming level with the crow
his glance at the bird is almost accusatory
angle the crow inscrutable
we should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place
bare muddied frozen
tilt to eric
his gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash
he grabs them pushes them onto his bare feet
his eyes catch the firelight
in the rain
we are now within the neon techno depths of club trash
the bg music is hard savage primal a doom laden radio werewolf band rules
cabaret blitzkrieg packed with death to yup trendazoids
well see more of this circus later
right now the bg sound is our biggest clue to the flavor of this establishment since we are thinly filmed in dust mounted among dozens of other band shots
visible among the posed members of a group called diabolique is eric wielding guitar on the club stage
nd blur as people grange powerful a seasoned assassin cruel but loyal
his facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor
ngo nwa ish clad chinese gangster style white topcoat white scarf tinted shades and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him lean dark haired asian killers who would
gladly die for ngo nwa which they will in just a minute
they have just passed the diabolique x
ngo nwas gloved fingers in passing leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of eric in the photo
as the foursome reaches the door grange turns doubtfully suspiciously to nwa
he will see me
as grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open
without a word nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in granges face by the bodyguards who post themselves to either side
the door closes and the bg noise is gone
through a large window mirrored on the club side all sorts of activity is visible through automatic mini blinds
a fly vision bank of tv monitors is hot with surveillance
lao a painfully clean cut armani clad asian impeccable almost dashing but the dynamic here is crystal clear nwa is the king lao the dark prince in this hierarchy
at the desk lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny perfect rat skeleton by ngo nwas unheralded entry
the desktop is bare except for and arcane vietnamese fighting knife half a meter long with an ideogrammed blade dramatically positioned beneath an artemide lamp
lao rises and feigns servility
nb the following exchange will play fast and entirely in formal greeting dismissiveness contempt then chastizing anger as nwa indicates the blade with some ridicule
phony assuagement knows its bullshit lao turns staring out the blinds fighting for control
he turns back to his master
nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office indicating that lao should be grateful but is somehow errant respect is required begrudging agreement lao sees the blade
he lifts it reverently bears it the nwa hilt first in both hands as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth
why give me this
nonetheless nwa accepts the blade
even nwa has to admire it
turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum
his attitude indicates lao is too far away to do anything untoward
sinister punchline lao spins through the air and heel kicks the blade through nwas chest pinning him to the door
its over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes nwa
lao is much more than merely treacherous he is extremely capable
in perfect english when i spoke of an offering i didnt mean an offering to you
grange standing out of arms reach in the corridor kills both bodyguards with a double headshot as they turn in greeting as the door opens
lao exchanges a look with his right arm grange nods affirmatively
you gonna smoke his bones now or however it is you do it
lao smiles indulgently
he wipes the blood from the blade on the jacket of his ex lord
lao now bows to no one
eric wearing the combat boots climbs as the crow leads him
he jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal
blood flows from the gash
he vises his fist shut
eye to eye with the crow
opens his hand
the blood flows back into the wound which closes itself leaving another scar
vising the rail
speaks to the night
almost a mantra
my kitten walks on velvet feet and makes no sound at all
and in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall
i think he loves the lady night
to crow am i alive
am i dead
something in between
no answer here
a hint of friendliness
thanks for sharing that
as the t bird grumbles tp park curbside
a junkyard of loot and dusty discards
junkie thievings and other peoples stereos
behind a wire meshed security counter gideon reads a racing form chain smoking throughout the scene
he is pear shaped stubbled unkempt
food on his shirt
jingle of doorbells
gideon lowers his paper to reveal skank and t bird on approach
ahhh jesus the creatures of the night here they come
tweedledum and tweedledummer
skank riles hey blow me fat boy
just as quick gideon cocks and levels a magnum at skank
blow yourself bigmouth
interposing whoa hey whoa
hands up business
he lifts a small carton onto the counter
t bird passes items through the screen slot and gideon gives each one cursory doubtful inspection
coupla more rings
nineteen bucks at sears
fake leather purse
he hands though the bag rested from the woman
whats this a little ah bloodstain right
doesnt matter fifty bucks for the box and im doin you a yeah i know fatso
do us all a favor
make top dollar smile
you wouldnt want top dollar not to smile
mention of top dollar clams gideon efficiently up
he hands over the cash to t bird with a grimace
eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky flying past him skimming the roof leading him on
eric exhales shrugs feeling mocked by the bird
and he takes off on a run
only to stumble and fall
but the falls turns into a tumbling roll that lands eric back on his feet still moving
he looks back as if to ask did i do that
and runs out of the frame
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up
track with him to the edge of the roof heavily misted in rain
he jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof
the next roof top is a one story jump down
eric clears the jump with a woof of air
keeping his eyes on the flying crow gaining strength
his next leap is more like a broad jump
keeping airborne keeping ahead
eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space
as eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building
as eric smashes into it just missing hinging at the waist grabbing for purchase suddenly panicked gravity pulling him downward
eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one handed
he hangs for another deadly moment then slowly to his own astonishment executes a one handed pull up that will save his ass
he completes the pull up bringing his chin level with the ledge
as he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and eric plummets with a howl of defeat
its a looooooong way down
as eric lands and splits a trash can in two
a beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped
push in as eric rolls from facedown to his back
as he completes the roll gasping amazed hes still in one piece
it flies easily down to inspect eric as he slowly sits up examining his hands
frustrated and pissed off
not your welcome but other worldly patience
wherere we going next the sewer
still dark silence until eric lands from above frame feline
the crow lands simultaneously b
perched near a roof access door with a shaded dim yellow bulb
it just blinks at him
as eric yanks open the rusty rooftop door from the outside and sweeps down the steps in a swirl of night mist trash and detritus all around clogging the arteries
of the building which is old unoccupied forsaken
the crow lights on a scarred banister knob
erics footsteps come down into frame
a year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape
which now sags faded
a sticker across the jam notifies potential trespassers that this is was a crime scene
eric slows stops his hand on the banister
as is wafts ahead of eric arriving at the door first
eric has had enough
are we finished yet
sliding along as he speaks until it hits a cigarette burn
stiffening as he suffers his second flash images and dialog are not linked
a rapidfire montage set in the loft a year earlier it is decorated for halloween
the broken door
the stairwell is filled with cops and cop noise lab guys bustle
albrecht is there making notes as a detective steps over to him
victims name is shelly webster
the guy who got tossed is uh
checks his notebook albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister
he sits down hard hurting from the flash
his eyes seek the crow
he completes albrechts line draven eric
low dolly of ellys little combat boots moving toward the entryway of the pit
music gradually up louder o
as she nears
a grown ups place
a burly bouncer appraises her his tone jokey
he knows elly
you got any id
oh my sides
the bouncer jerks a thumb
go on in
a grungy sawdust floored shot and beer joint packed tight with urban burnouts rushing to drink their lives away
hammering music and rude whorehouse lighting
each predator straining to be badder than the next
track through this maze at ellys eye level until we reach darla waitressing her heart out the drug mileage on her obvious
i told you youre not supposed to come in here
a quick lie i lost my key
disgustedly goddamn kids darla fishes up a key and slaps it into ellys hand
hey darla before we die of old age how about it
to elly out
i gotta work
rack past darla and move in close on a corner table where sit funboy skank t bird and a black vested muscle gypsy tin tin
as eric shoves the door open from the outside
the lock popped from the frame spins on the wooden floor
the barrier tape whisps and dust roils
dark chilly damp
a rats nest of disuse
as eric enters
glass blown out
he scans the loft
sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor
a white long haired cat walks into a pool of night light
extends his hand
the cat nears likes eric
as the cat makes contact
sudden white jolt a flash
flash we hear eric strumming his strat o
we see what he saw shelly holding the cat
recovering from the flash
he purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more harder stronger
flash a man and a woman make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight
shelly and eric once upon a time
as the cat dropped hits the floor and scrambles out of the way
vising his head teary eyed his nose bleeding
he whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall
flash eric and shelly in a mock waltz
he spins her and they collapse on the bed
slowly pulling his arm out of the wall
whispering stop it
his eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man
he hits with an o
as a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots
lets have some fun
funboy pops the bullet like a contact capsule and washes it down
t bird turns to tin tin the new guy
t bird you first
youre outta your fuckin mind
into it almost jazzed tin tin downs his bullet and shot and t bird does likewise
points to skank
im not the lunatic
skank riles pulls a huge auto mag and sticks it in t birds face cocking
fuck you t bird
just as lightning fast t bird has his own gun out and jammed right under skanks jawbone
he makes a kissy face
i love you too you madman
they all crack up laughing like ax murderers
skank drinks tin tin spot checks the satchell from top dollars
darla delivers more shots and funboy feels her ass
pushes himself up
is perched in a dead light fixture monitoring eric
pushes himself up
realizes he is in the center of a faint chalk outline on the hardwood floor
he reaches to touch the dark stain of old blood
flash shelly spills into frame mouth bloodied
t bird instantly on top of her rough
as he abandons the outline and staggers to the window
where he cuts open his hand on jags of glass
flash eric held firm in the grasp of t bird and funboy one arm each
five bloody bullet holes in erics chest
the thugs and hurl eric backwards through the window which shatters
reeling backward same trajectory as in the flash but toward the floor in slo mo
a jumble of good bad images from the loft tin tin embedding a page of paper in the loft wall with a throwing knife
shellys face as she lights a candle
a popping champagne cork
the echoing cannonade of the shots that killed eric
skank backhanding shelly
shelly blowing bubbles from a clawfoot tub full of suds
eric catching funboys first slug high in the chest
new angle of the glass in the window blowing out as t bird and funboy through eric through
he plummets to black out frame
funboy contemplates his drink as the previous scene reverbs
more fun than a torture chamber
tin tins pocket pager goes beep and startles them all
skank nearly shoots it jumpy
tin tin pulls back on a black leather trenchcoat after clicking off the pager
i hate this goddamn thing
angle darla watching them from a distance as tin exits
an enormous cockroach trundles past large in frame
rack to show eric lying on floor b
as his eyes pop open
a flurry of dark motion as the crow flies past frame
angle the crow having snatched the bug in its beak
rising from the floor
watches his fireplace
we have company
erics paper mache masks of comedy and tragedy still hang there
the skull cowboy steps out of the dark and into the vague blue light
shadowy as ever
having fun yet
beat ill give you a hint
kill the men who killed you both and the day of the dead will be your reunion
the skull cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife like tin tins
erics gaze follow it closely
you must use your eyes
he points to the crow
weirdly distorted a shared vision between eric and the crow
as he ducks out of the path of the knife he sees through the birds eyes
it hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall
erics roll finishes him up nearby
he grabs for the knife as if to use it on the skull cowboy but the knife causes an unexpected painful flash
flash eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe tin tins knife stuck in his shoulder
vising his head with his hands in pain
too much pain
leave me alone
he looks up the skull cowboy is still there
contempt do something about it
a horrible beat between them
the eric runs full tilt across the room bounding to the open window and then leaping
as close to surprise as he gets
steps out to watch as flies feet first out into space
erics fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps
high above erics feet shoot out the window knocking loose stray shards that fall toward frame
he swings into an upside down pose impossibly holding himself rigid against the buildings side face down
by his quarter inch finger grip
every muscle rigid quivering with tension
then he relaxes and swings back inside
he arches flips to land on his feet
the skull cowboy is gone
no knife either
the crow watches
i guess im not ready to leave
he picks up the cat wary of flashes which dont come this time and returns to the window
the last time we saw each other i didnt do so well
holds cat up huh gabriel
he moves to the fireplace
with his free hand lifts the tragedy mask off its hook
puzzles it fact to mask
i bet you need some cat food
eric walking the tragedy mask hanging from his hip
an occasional pedestrian passes without comment brutalized by the city
eric more confident smells the nights bouquet
two men around a trashcan fire
we should recognize tin tin by his black leather trench coat
a wonderfully rude rap tune got a white woman tied up in my closet gonna jab her with a stick razzles b
as eric reacts to what the crow has just seen
and directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley
he pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel
follow as he hands it across to ratso who removes the suitcase sized boom box the source of the music from his shoulder to accept
ratso is a feral skull head street trash
three hundred and your a gunslinger
high angle tin tin and ratso as the crow is still watching yet perched
a brief shove and standoff
the gun deal has gone bad
please tin tin you know im good for the money man i promise leslie put me up to it please man dont choking scream tin tin has just up rammed
a throwing knife into ratso
ratty shut the fuck up
tin tin lifts ratso on the knife gutting him
ratso goes slack deadern hell
tin tin reaches around to click off the boom box
then lets ratso s corpse fall
another satisfied customer
galvanized by the surprise voice
he automatically draw a fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside the coat
cant yet track the source of the voice
who the hell is that
beat venomous come on out man i wont hurt you
he steps out from behind another flaming trashcan
wearing a long black scarf and the tragedy mask
hello tin tin
trying to process what he sees
and buy time
little early from trick or treat homie
re ratso this dick trying to bushwack me
tin tin blows out a breath
time to kill again
guess you got that goddamn right
the shrug becomes the launch of a knife
his black gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from his nose
eric continues striding toward tin tin
as tin tin throws another knife
eric closing in
he claps hand together immobilizing the next knife
opens his hands almost an oops gesture
keeps on coming
as they meet
tin tin attempts a roundhouse
eric blocks it and smashes tin tin into the alley wall
a year ago
a man and a woman
in a loft
you helped to murder them
last halloween eh
beat yeah i remember
i fucked her too i think
you cut her
you raped her
rage you watched
hey i got my rocks off so fuck you in the ass man
theyre face to face now sweaty and tense
eric peels off the tragedy mask
i want you to tell me a story tin tin
i dont know you
but as eric bears down on tin tin tin begins to recognize him
for the first time tin tin starts to loose control
youre dead man
arent we all
as erics hands place ratsos boom box on the table and click on suitable weird b
erics boots pass frame
an open can of cat food clanks down big in f
as eric walks b
obviously wearing tin tins trenchcoat
gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can
the mirror spiderwebbed with cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame
eric is seated his image crazily split into many
he pulls on a long sleeved tight knit black shirt
widen angle to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle stubs
placed all around
ceremonial and weird
halloween is coming
the day of the dead
in the mirror multi erics
he touches the glass tightening up as he realizes hes in for another flash shelly sleeping on her divan a year ago wakes as eric o
she cracks an eye open
your scary quotient needs work
considering old cosmetics
everything he touches will hurt him
but hes ready to eat this pain
he grabs a lipstick
flash shelly at the vanity in happier times i think reds my color dont you
he drops the lipstick on the floor
grabs a hairbrush
flash eric smashes into the street after his death fall trailing broken glass
hes wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks
flash eric sucks up funboys gunshots in the chest
his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks not blended yet
he looks at his own reflection
in one cracked triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face but the skull cowboy
glad to see youre finally with the program
bugger off to the graveyard skull face im busy
you work for the dead
forget that and you can forget it all
the cowboy tips his hat and isnt there
eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now
he smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave wave white
coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity
eric looks down towards him
and toward the lipstick he dropped
as it glides down to pick up the lipstick
contact and flash eric smashed on the street t birds car b
upside down in erics pov as he rolls over and blood courses from both corners of his mouth a definite foreshadow of the crow face
she always red red was her color
we see only a reflected corner of erics mouth as he duplicates the blood trail in red lipstick making one one half of a crow harlequin smile
a medium shot as lightning strikes a storm brews
crossing the floor
tin tins knife slotted to the bucklework
erics hands discard a hairbrush there
he moves off
looking up o
watching his master stalk around with purpose
thunder rumbles long o
the storm boils
eric framed in broken window
eric all in black firm wrapped
the trenchcoat flutters cloak like
his shadowy face framed by the upturned collar his hair punkish and spiky
as he moves forward in the light
the crow lights on his shoulder
all right bad guys
full crow regalia
face makeup streamlined
erics eyes flash
in drawn out yell here i commme
pull back swiftly vertiginously as eric swan dives from the window his voice a howl
coat wing like
match his dive yell with o
slow motion as eric fills the frame and we cop lights bounce competing with the trash fires
albrecht and several other uniforms assess the double death scene
a detective torres tries to appear in charge
couldnt have happened to a nicer couple
tin tin frozen in deathshock all of his knives sticking out of him
dead ratso b
where he fell
sure it coulda
funboys not here neither is t bird none of top dollars number ones
you know you sure got a hard on for a guy thats guilty of zip on paper
top dollar runs showtime whats the matter dont you like adult entertainment
this sack of shit is called tin tin
dont any of your little pals have real grown up names
he was a runner for top dollar
sigh this isnt top dollars style anyway
this was somebody else
albrecht lights a fresh smoke
torres waves the smoke away
and youre gonna tell me who
who ever made that
camera follows to wall behind tin tin
a crow silhouette has been daubed in blood there now dry
what in the hell
do you call that
i call it blood detective
if you want you can call it graffiti
close up of gideons thick fingers shuffling grimy currency
some scratchy s tune plays throughout b
like a broadcast from another time and place
looking up at a metallic sound o
piss off were closed
as the outside security gate rattles gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door
fucking creatures of the night they never goddamn learn
sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate scree back against the frosted glass of the front door
and he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door gun up
before he can touch the door the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass pegging gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass
he loses the pistol
eric walks through the door causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him
he disclaims thespian
suddenly i heard a tapping as of someone gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
pause you heard me rapping right
reacting to erics weird appearance and looking for his gun
youre trespassing asshole youre breakin and enterin and you just bought me a fucking door
during gideons rant eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders nonplussed
now he flings gideon across the room
gideon crashes into the counter cage
as eric advances on him im looking for something in an engagement ring
as eric comes up behind him gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter
youre looking for a coroner shit for brains
and he tries to nail eric with the knife
no eric behind him
tilt to reveal eric hanging off the cage above gideon
eric slams the cage door against gideons head
drops down like a spider and collects the knife
i repeat a gold engagement ring
it was pawned here a year ago by another gentleman whose name i believe was
eric twists gideons sail like shirt and gideon turns bright red
cute nickname dont you think
gasping i aint got no fuckin ring
eric nails gideons hand to the counter top
alls i got is in a box
behind the counter
eric jumps through the cage door
gideons eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand immobilized
scans the shelves
rows of boxed ammo
knives and assorted knuckle duster curios
and the ring box
dozens of gold rings
erics fingers sift through them
he brings each ring to his face
intercut with gideons feeble struggles and invective o
he tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder
until obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light flash shellys face
a perfect vision
he closes his fist tightly around the ring
a moment of decision
then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter
uses the butt to knock the knife free of gideons hand
it goes spinning across the countertop
eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into gideons nose as the big man slumps to the floor
tin tin confided in me before he ran out of breath
you have one chance to live
no fucking way
hell kill me
who would waste time killing you
gideon sweats pants contemplates the hole in his hand
cowed top dollar
another jolly nickname
you want those assholes you want top dollar
like the car
he hangs out with skank
that little ass hair and they hang at the pit hell funboy lives there
ask top dollar
a whole club of pirates with pirate names
eric seems to go berserk smashing and puncturing cans of flammables and powder while gideon flinches nursing his holed hand
blows just miss gideons head
soon hes cowering
looking down at gideon in revulsion
you feed off the living
as another tin ceases to exist next to gideon
then eric is gone past him without further word ignoring him entirely
as he exits shotgun shouldered he pauses to admire a white fender strat hanging among the pawnables
he reaches for it
as he summons some last minute budget bravery
you walk outta here top dollar will erase your ass
top dollar owns the fucking street here and you cant dick with me you son of a bitch
the guitar now bowslung across his back the shotgun levelled at gideons position
one chance to live
as he realizes what eric means
hauls ass and bangs through the rear door with a bleat of terror
as he cuts loose with the shotgun
as seen from across the street
eric silhouetted unmoving as the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him raining glass and debris
stirring his hair
eric is the black eye of the fireball
lit by flames and residual explosions
he hurls the shotgun into the inferno
casually brushes flaming smoking detritus from his own clothes
i said dont move
as he turns slowly to see albrecht out of reach gun drawn
erics attitude lightens albrecht is not the threat here
i thought the police always said freeze
albrecht divides his attention jumpy between the odd sight of eric guitar on his back and the raging instant inferno of gideons
im the police and i say dont move snow white
youre under arrest i dont care what else is wrong with you
you move and youre dead
eric has begun to pace towards albrecht
a gesture of submission
albrechts battle calm begins to waiver
and i say im dead
and i move
eric bows bringing his forehead in line with the guns muzzle
then shoot if you will
he gives it up
this is too weird for him
are you nuts walking into a gun
you must listen carefully the fire department will be here soon
there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance
meaningfully as shelly webster once needed your assistance and as you are shortly going to need my assistance
albrecht gestures casually almost comically with his pointed gun
the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them
you wanna run that back for me one time
sirens near o
eric listens to them to the night
listen top dollar
he owns the street here
he will erase my ass
you dont say
i know top dollar has turned your streets into his hell
fucking a my friend
the others are called skank t bird
beat watch me office albrecht
eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk
slow and easy
albrecht doesnt completely trust him
up comes the gun
eric slices open his palm
to his fingertips
as eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall
then exhibits the gashed hand to albrecht
as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up
and the silhouette
youre the one who did tin tin
pull back fast to reveal eric is gone from the frame
albrecht does a quick
flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face
guy shows up looking like a mime from hell
beat least he didnt do that walking against the wind shit i hate that
a night owl pornucopia
t bird enters beneath a garish theater marquee
the bill rump romp with buttbusters ii
t bird approaches the snack bar
wet breathy mating noises from the auditorium throughout o
looking supremely bored the counterman dickey bird thumbs a porn tabloid
t bird heads left through s steal door that dickie buzzes open for him
t bird walks past dust covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse lance and angelique making history in reverse on the back of the movie screen oratoria as good as
porn films can make it
i dont know how to describe how i feel lance so restless youre my moon queen angelique
porn queen o
oooh i want youre rocket right now in my sea of tranquility lance as t bird approaches the movie sounds dwindle o
he ascends the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time
as t bird nears it a viewplate snaps open to asses him
by the time he reaches the top the door unbolts to admit him
as t bird enters
the room is organized around a long meeting table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal drug paraphernalia weapons
across the table are a couple of sentries like the one that admits t bird to the room
track past them to a lank haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade backlit by showtimes exterior neon
this is top dollar
who looks like a johnny winter acid casualty but is deadly cold definitely the man in charge
wild fucking night
i hear our pal tin tin got himself very dead
and gideons just burned all the down to the foundation
tops eyebrows go up
i didnt have nothin to do with that
bet that pisses you off right
top what the fuck is going on tonight
stay normal t
copsll be all hotwired and aggressive
no combat moves until i check this out
taking in the street the pit and a little girl seated on an abandoned car
seated on the looted wheelless car playing with a small doll
she doesnt notice someone is watching her yet
she looks up o
at eric who is still out of the frame
what are you supposed to be
he smiles for what seems to be the first time
warm even past his crow makeup
he glances back and logs the location of the pit for later not in a big hurry just now
turns back to elly
you look like a rock star without a job
he indicates the car hood a seat next to elly from which he may observe the pit
if youre not some kinda child molester
eric looks behind himself
he shakes his head no and sits down next to elly
the music pounds and smoke is everywhere like incense
intercuts of the clientele retro robotic clove cigarettes and rubber clothing fetish casual wear
right in the center of the noise looking downscale and dirty in this milieu
passing top appraising him finding him as boring as life itself
undertaker chic she stares at top
i thought halloween was tomorrow night
an oriental bodyguard passes him in f
motioning to follow
lao watches club activity on his flybank of tvs
when top dollar shows up at the office door two sentries try to bar his passage
he shoves through
get outta my way you mooks
laos demeanor indicates that they should not kill top
an unexpected pleasure
alot of action on the streets tonight and nobody bothered to clear it with me
tin tin got himself whacked
who got himself what
one of mine
and it wasnt a standard hit
i had heard something like this
beat describe it for me
i was wondering if you could tell me anything
about a wildcat operative
i know of no one
beat but even if there is i am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with
anybody violates my turf our turf ill rip out there heart and show it to em
to be sure
now tell how your friend died
annabella a comfortable large spider in the web deskworker sits typing at a terminal
miked headphone in one ear police scanner chatter o
she blows and pops a pink bubble of gum
albrecht enters frame from across her countertop
whatever it is the answers no eddie
im too busy tonight
annie i need a file
there is a desperate edge to albrechts voice
beat her guard up clear it with the captain if you need a file
this is special darlin
annabella eyes albrecht doubtfully
just dont tell me you owe me one
a year ago
still hanging by the car a bit more familiar with each other now
a low slung mirror windowed limousine hisses past them and curbs across the street from the pit
my mom works over there
im waiting for her but shes probably with him right now
mister funboy lives there
he has a room upstairs
i dont like him very much
elly is not happy about this
we see grange get out of the car heading to the pit and notice in passing a guy with the white face talking to the little girl down on the
can you play that thing or do you just carry it around everywhere
elly indicates the guitar strapped to eric back
i can pick out a tune now and again
can you play teddy bears picnic
re doll it used to be her favorite
does she have a name
you sure ask a lot of questions
elly hands the doll to eric and he experiences a wholly unexpected flash
flash elly and shelly sitting as shellys vanity goofing with makeup test driving lipstick the doll visible on the vanity
pain is trying to fight its way out of eric in surges
smart alec hel lo
earth to anybody
eric snaps out of it
elly retrieves the doll
do you feel okay
you gotta go now i bet
i have to go
half zomboid half determined he exits
as he circulates to the bar unimpressed
to the bouncer top dollar
never heard of him
oh probly upstairs bangin darla
pay for your own beer and theyll probly be down before you can drink it
close up of an x of the loft slaughter in albrechts hands
subject a document pinned to the wall with a knife
flipping through the file
subject eric dead in the street in front of the loft building
the blood on his face reminiscent of his crow face
as albrechts hand moves the photo we can see in the file several band shots of eric as a member of diabolique
including the shot on laos wall gallery of past performers at club trash
a doughut on a paper plate suddenly touches down in the middle of all this research startling albrecht
dont thank me
your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit
i knew that
albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light
close up document torn by the knife hole made by tin tin
it reads we the undersigned tenants of calderone court apartments
another nice white girl with a cause
like a big kick me sign
albrecht takes up and x of erics face
and her nice white boyfriend eric draven
with a felt tip pen he superimposes the crow smile like the make up like the blood
your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the beat patrol just like in a bad detective story eddie
are we doing the wildgoose thing again
under this albrecht sketches in erics spiky crow hairdo
you gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk
that doughnuts chocolate you know
push in on the doctored photo
its the crow
push in on albrecht
well hello there
chocolate dont thank me
the crow perched on his shoulder
not in a hurry
its a raymond chandler evening and the pavements are all wet and im lurking in the shadows for it hasnt happened
grange at a table
smoking and waiting
his back protected he is stationed near the fire stair door and has a good overview of the room
close up of a base pipe being lit and hit hard
erics gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing
a hypodermic needle rises into frame
a nicotined fingernail flicks bubbles in the syringe
follow needle down and broaden angle funboy taps up a vein in darlas arm and shoots her up
both are naked in a shabby bed
bare lightbulb above
ooh baby gimme all of it
as the plunger depresses
as the crow quite unexpectedly arrives and perches on the sill scaring the shit out of our two dopey friends
funboy pulls a giant auto pistol mock aims calms down doesnt fire
its a big fucking bird
she falls back against her pillow eyes dreamily defocusing
relaxes the gun which half disappears into the sheets at his side
its a squab
here bird here birdie
except that eric now stands near their bed across from the birds position the guitar bowslung
contained panic as funboy and darla both startle
the needle flies and lands at erics feet
funboy struggles to maintain against his high
oh wow oh wow dont fucking do that man
i nearly had a fucking heart attack
fun look at that guy
its just the dope dont worry fun hes not going away hes scaring the piss outta me
funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers
suddenly he seems totally focused
time for you to take your bird and leave freako
eric rips open his shirtfront to reveal a circlet of bullet punctures
this gives funboy pause
take your shot funboy
you got me dead bang
funboy tilts the gun off target
grins as eric flat handedly past his chest indicating where to shoot
you are seriously fucked up man
just look at yourself
in a blur he sighs and shoots eric through the heart
he shoots he scores
then his expression drags a little bit
looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest
who starts scrambling to get out
grabbing clothes on the floor around herself
she runs right into erics outstretched hands
eric twists her arm
where we may clearly see the needle tracks
morphine is bad for you
he holds her arm captive
tight and we push in closer to see the dope evacuating from the punctures a reverse of erics blood trail
the dope drips from darlas arm to the floor
darlas eyes roll up into the unconscious
how the hell did you do that
funboy regards erics battlescars and guitar
either die or do a solo
eric looks briefly to his chest wound wincing
he cant seem to make it tie off fast enough
he turns his attention back to funboy
but his strength is mysteriously ebbing
yeah i got a more fun idea myself
funboy lashes out and broadsides eric across the temple with the gun
eric falls rolls back to a stance but funboy is right on top of him howling like a lunatic and pistol whipping eric relentlessly
i hate trespassers
i hate prowlers
i hate peeping toms
and right now i hate you
as eric caught off guard by funboys hyper high and weakened by his wound comes slamming into the wall losing his footing
here comes funboy and we tilt up from erics position as he looms cocking the pistol which now has erics blood on it
ahh the hell with it i still got five shots left
in a blur eric grabs funboy s gun hand
twists to the crunching of bones
funboys skewed around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh
funboy fall back across the bed
owwwaaaa fuck me
look what you did to my sheets you lame piecea shit
does it hurt
does it hurt
you dead ass clown faced fuck of course it fucking hurts
what the shit are you gonna do about this
eric sits on the bed next to funboy inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand the needle of the syringe already inserted
i have some pain killer right here
and he fills the syringe all the way
as he begins to see the light
he cant get away
no wait no wait thats too much man thats like overkill nobody can take that much youre wasting it
your pain ends now
and eric rams the needle into funboys heart driving home the full dose
funboy begins to convulse
eric falls back on the bed his force spent
darla comes to in the corner shock traumatized
cough and eric opens his eyes
the skull cowboy standing in the room tips his hat
howdy beat you look a mess
like an ole cooter dog
streaked with mostly his own blood
getting a little ambitious and extracurricular arent we
you need to learn to mind your own business or youll never get where you think youre going
maybe i was wrong about you
the skull cowboy seems saddened or disappointed
all we get is a little shake of his skull head
darla makes a sound and eric turns toward her
shes really confused
shes looking to eric for some kind of answer
your daughter is out there on the street waiting for you
shes stunned utterly speechless
all she can do is look in erics eyes try to ponder the phantoms there
darla shoves helter skelter past eric and out the door without a glance back at funboy
eric recovering follows slowly staring at the open door stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with funboy
the skull cowboy has vanished
grimly eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late funboy
as a hastily dressed darla bangs out through the fire stair door behind grange and flees the pit
hey gnight darla
to grange that there is darla
bartender indicates up with his thumb
grange moves to the fire stairs door
grange has seen the door ajar and now enters gun first
freezes when he sees half sheeted bloody a hypo hanging out of his heart
eyes darting drawn to a crow silhouette spray painted with a syringe of funboys blood
a thin outline drippy
whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on the crow is no longer in the room
eric is perched on the sill guitar and all looking right at grange as if waiting from him
he winks holds a finger to his lips sshh and jumps out into the night
he almost fires but doesnt
we see instead the priceless expression on his face as we albrecht lights another smoke quitting for the night
waves to the late working annabella en route
albrecht hasnt gone three steps before eric appears behind him cat silent matching pace
nb eric has got a new black rock n roll shirt on
and a shell casing from funboys gun tied in his hair
albrecht startles drops his file
nearly draws his gun
dont ever do that man
albrecht pants hysterical but calming down
i told you cops dont say freeze
he retrieves erics doctored photo from the spill of papers
you my friend are dead
i saw your body
you got buried
i saw it too
albrecht gathers up the file
eric stands there
we realize he is hesitant about touching the file
walk with me
as albrecht comes up with the file as they walk
you died man
i cant believe it but here you are
last year you and your girlfriend i need you to tell me what you remember
what happened to us
you went out the window
she was beaten and raped
she died in the hospital
eric didnt know this
fixes albrecht with a look
hey you asked man
beat she held on for thirty hours in intensive care
he body just finally gave it up
beat regret i saw it and couldnt do jack for her
eric has grown increasingly distraught over albrechts lines
now he turns to albrecht and holding albrechts temples with his fingers puts his thumbs over albrechts eyes
we see eric react to a brutal flash
but we dont see the flash
and eric tears from albrecht staggers back now holding his own head
his crow face slacked in realized horror
you okay man
i mean what just happened
the venom of bad memories
you were there you saw her
i saw you seeing her
understandable nervous albrecht lights up a cigarette
you gotta understand i was hoping shed talk give me a lead a clue something to work with
but she only said one thing to me before she died
eric lowers his head penitent
fizzles im sorry as hell man
a day of life plus change
eric plucks the cigarette from albrechts lips taking a single contemplative puff from it
halloween is coming soon
you will have top dollar if you watch for me at the showtime tomorrow night
i should be trying to stop you
eric nods keeping his eyes on the cigarette
for giving a damn
dont smoke these
as a bus grumbles past on the street eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame
to see a blank building wall
he does a full degree turn
eric is gone again
damn i wish he wouldnt do that
coat flapping eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves away from albrechts position
lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone and is smoking powdered rat bone
in a pipe and grange reports to him
the son of a bitch winked at me
the he jumped
lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of granges tale
did you see an animal of any kind
did you see a bird
i saw a guitar
beat irritated this isnt some rock n roller you forgot to pay is it
beat there was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird
laos expression is one of sublime content
grange it couldve been a chicken
a long shot of the t bird parked across the street from the store as two figures t bird and skank approach on the store side
i wish to hell i had torched gideons that fat fuck
i wish to hell i knew who it was that made tin tin into a voodoo doll last night
they stop walking
look at each other and sanctimoniously cross themselves
tin tins big r
t bird indicates the liquor store
we need some smokes and some road beers
skank hustles toward the store
t bird crosses to the car
widen angle to include the car as he nears it
behind him two year old kids axel and chopper enter the store after skank one wearing a long duster
as the kids enter and split between the counter and magazine rack
east indian clerk
two boys fight video game wars in the corner
skank browses grabbing odds and ends
as t bird climbs in digs the last cigarette from his pack snaps his zippo and in the sudden orange light sees erics purloined strat in the back sear reflecting
he tries to spin and draw his gun but eric is upon him nestling one of tin tins throwing knives right inside t birds ear
what the fuck are you supposed to be man
inserts eric liberates t birds automatic from the shoulder holster erics hand closes t birds door for him
im your passenger
and stop talking
on ignition key and gearshift making ready
he looks outside and sees eric as the car fires up pipes and glasspacks grumbling
skank moves bristling
whats all this happy horseshit
and the car peels out maniacally
skank tries to pursue but the two kids draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store
alright alright alright everybody be cool and stay exactly where you are
chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves skank of a gigantic auto mag
off skanks look of total outfoxed disgust
vertiginous windshield pov of onrushing street highspeed
faster t bird
youre a hell of a wheelman you know you can drive faster
eric now holds t birds own gun on him
eyes locked on t bird
t birds jump between erics nightmare visage and the roadway
you call it blood you got the gun
you just tell me where you want to go
clearly t bird would relish bisecting eric with a meat cleaver as he says this
hes nervous and needs to hold the road
were going someplace youve never been before
as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement kicking wake of litter
pedestrians scurry to clear the way
parked in an alley facing the street
two cops work on large styro cups of steaming coffee
mj driver and speeg
smells like rain
smells like a septic tank
you got that cream stuff
in the bag
speeg rummages inside the takeout bag
i hate this cream stuff
they cant even call it cream legally
they snap to as the t bird blazes past doing ninety
what in the crap
mj floors the pedal drenching speeg in coffee on takeoff
as the cruiser roars out to give chase
eric lends the chase car a backward look
you caught one
man you gonna get us killed dead and i dont even know what you want
eric cocks t birds pistol and levels it at his face
i want you to stop talking
eric rifles the glove box tossing items out the window clips for the gun
a giant dildo brief eyebrows up to t bird
then a roll of previously established gaffers tape
what eric needs
as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit youre very popular
thought you could handle this thing
t bird macho calcifies
hes going to win
to hell with you
climbing swiftly toward the mark
a way pursuit until the t bird reaches the outskirts of the city
until the t bird zooms past frame
the lead cop tries to duplicate the t birds corner cut and starts spinning
it clips a light pole
rebounds into the path of mjs unit
as mj stands on the brakes
as mjs unit broadsides the first cop car
the t bird careens through dockside silence alone then fishtails screeching to a lung compressing halt
t bird respirating like a jackhammer
eric holds stoic
so what you gonna rape me now
time for your reward t
payback with interest earned
eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll
a high angle of the car as eric opens the trunk
erics pov the trunk
loaded with plastique canisters timers arson paraphernalia
slow tilt starting with t birds foot firmly taped to the pedal
mummified into his seat
hands taped to the wheel
throat taped hard against the headrest
the car is now in gear idling
he drops an incendiary right into t birds lap
t bird squirms
eric reaches in with a bungie cord
a little restrictive
chilling you held her down and raped her
you were the first
she burned while you were inside of her
re bomb whats the lag on this
about twenty seconds would you say
t bird thrashes but hes immobilized
cant even budge the wheel
ive comrades in hell t bird
give them my best
eric activates the timer
yanks up hard on the bungie cord
the bungie cord pulls t birds foot all the way down on the pedal
eric steps back plucks the guitar out as the car starts to move
the car roars for the edge of the dock about a distance of a football field
eric examines t birds auto pistol and pops the clip
intercuts as the car speeds for the waters edge eric thumbs bullets from the clip one by one
t birds eyes bug in horror and he goes mmmmmmmmhhh
thumbing out the final bullet
lifting off and blowing all to hell a billion smithereens of phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water
weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges
heaving the gun into the distant water
he produces t birds accelerator
squirts it into the ground
he prestidigitates and t birds zippo appears in his hand
he flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle
walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into a burning crow shape
close up of a frying pan busy burning some pretty firebombed looking eggs
i never was too good at this domestic shit
staring outside at nothing in particular
dont say shit
beat thats okay
corn flakes are okay
she pauses as she hears a lilting faraway guitar strain
across the street she can make out the figure of eric on his roof playing the guitar
extreme close of a pignose amp
more soft guitar strokes as camera follows a patchwork a taped together jerry rigged cables to angle eric on roof shirtless crosslegged his crow make up streaked by the nights
his fingering is unsure and he tries the tune again
insert we she shellys engagement ring on a leather thong around erics neck
like an amulet
hes got it right this time
strong sure chords
we can almost imagine him conjuring shelly via musical sorcery
he holds a stroke letting it ring
sun rises behind him
hey shut the fuck up
erics eyes closed with the moment dart left
elly is seated on a stool
mickey gives her a chili dog
chili dog for breakfast
mom tried to cook
hey mickey i need a special with everything
to elly everyones a comedian
mickey exits frame
youre elly right
i know your mom
grange sits next to her
laos mirrored windowed car is parked across the street b
a lot of people know my mom
grange points o
indicating he wants coffee from mickey
i know your friend too the one that looks like a rock star
i dont know you
easily id like to get in touch with him
elly sizes grange up
youre not a cop either
what do you want him for
im looking for a good guitar man
grange withdraws a bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to mickey
cuts him some slack he kinda wanders around
youll see him if you pay attention
i need to find him kind of soon elly
no shirt the ring on the thong around his neck workout mode
he twirls and performs odd crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room
on purpose he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe
flash shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo victorian gown
push in tight as she is embraced by a nude eric
he undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place
follow the gown as it crumples down the length of shellys also otherwise nude body to the floor
hanging there inviting the pain the flashes bring
breathing as though he is pumping iron pumping up
embracing a ragged full length dress that used to be shellys
flash eric and shelly wearing the same dress exchange an extremely passionate and intimate kiss in the moonlight
as he drops the dress
absorbing the pain and memories
executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill
he grasps it with both hands
flash a series of close shots of eric and shellys hands each moving along the others body
curves and dips and contours
but erics gaze never leaves shellys eyes
his gaze similarly fixed
bringing his hands away and clapping them together deep breath fingertips pressed to his face like kung fu prep
when he opens his eyes the crow is there before him on the sill
he wipes his torso down with a towel
its almost time
he holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it
we can hear tendons crackle like a harness
closes it into a powerful fist
tight on skank as he slams his fist down on the table
he has a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter
top i made the sumbitch
face all painted white like some kinda fuckin kabuki homo
wide angle to include all present lao grange lao guards and top dollar and a sentry
top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy
sounds like our crow is out maneuvering you
youve seen the graffiti all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims
what about your turf top
mockingly you dont seem to have ripped out anyones heart yet
pissed off the night is young
hot the found t bird flash fried to what was left of his fucking car
top is angry too but wont show it to lao
he rises and goes to the window
top sees something outside below that really torques him off
a phantom graffiti artist is spray painting a crow shape on the condemned building right across the street
top whip drawing an auto pistol and shooting below
hey you little fuckweed
thats against the law
his gun smoking
i dont give a shit what kinda bird this guy is
as top turns from the window pull back to incorporate the chunky shadows where the lights dont fall
eric is there perched on the narrow exterior ledge
but we dont know it until he opens his eyes two dots of white in the blackness
lao at table angered by this macho horseshit annoyed at his time being frittered
i am sitting over here
he slams a palm on the table and the room goes silent
top looks sheepish
do you think this childish machismo impresses me
regains composure when i was a boy in saigon i watched my country change one block at a time one building at a time
whole lives erased
a way of life polluted
today no one forces me to move
i use my powers to change your country one block at a time one building at a time
whats it supposed to mean
your comprehension is not required
your cooperation and indeed your ability are the issues on the table
top rallies to this
whatever you say i can do
skank looks around nervous and jumpy a contradiction to tops guarantee
from the ledge
endstamp is for a
he sniffs the cartridge
we can see funboys cartridge in his hair
he fists the shell casing tightly
jittery grabbing a clip for his own automatic
what was that
it wasnt anything
skank loads stands and jacks the action on his gun
lao looks questioningly to top dollar
too many poppers skank
a black blur as eric arches through spilling top
eric back flips the length of the table and kicks the gun from skanks hand
spinning mid air to land in erics open hand
death cleans house
standing on the table eric fires rearward under his own arm to clip lao guard
he pivots shooting and takes out lao guard who slams backward into the steel door as it being opened by the sentry outside
the door is shut again
grange sprays the room with a calico auto shoving lao beneath the table for cover
bullets hit him and demolish everything behind him
skank hits the deck again
eric fires and lao guard sucks three hits across the chest firing convulsively against the ceiling blowing the lights
springing up from behind table
but eric is gone from the field of fire and one shot strikes skank rising at the far end
making for the door grange as shield
lao draws a pistol
the door opens and lao shoots a sentry to clear him out of the way
a last look back toward eric and grange hustle lao out
door slam o
top is out of ammo as eric lands from above frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand
awed but maintained you want my attention man you got it
wounded but clawing toward eric just the same
its him top
he dusted t bird
you have to be skank
to top dollar one moment
as he speaks widen frame as he turns and grabs the incoming skank by the hair
thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down
without a beat he pitches skank right out the window
skank howls all the way down
damaged from the wreck limping home piloted by our pals speeg and mj
skank smashes down into the roof imploding the flashbar and windshield
mj drenches his lap in fresh coffee
owwwaahhh son of a bitch
who watches with slow marvel from the shadows jesus christ
he runs to assist the demolished cruiser
just top eric corpses and lazily drifting gunsmoke
top dollar youre the only one here still wasting good air
five large in the drawer right over there
i never saw you
do you know what you destroyed
take the dope too
eric backhands top into the wall
gets in his face seething
a year ago
a very nice lady circulated a petition
answer yes or no
thats ancient history
do you know what you destroyed
top dollar yells right back at erics anger
who gives a fuck
im a businessman
you gonna do me then do me and shut youre face
you dont even remember
i never forget anything dickhead
that building was a sweep and clear the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition
it got a little rowdy
end of story
let me fill in some gaps for you
and he grabs tops head the way he grabbed albrechts earlier slams top into the wall
nose to nose
flash shelly backing away from oncoming funboy in the loft trying to retreat nowhere to run her home invaded scared
top is quivering almost helpless in erics hypnotic grasp
eric winces hard and flash shelly cut bleeding struggling against t bird
viciously close more intimate and lethal than anything
youre a detail man top you need to see more
this time top tries to twist from erics grasp but its no good
flash shelly comatose in icu eyes fixed and staring hoses darting in and out cold blue refrigerator light
bloody bruised and broken from albrecht s memory arching stiffening in pain
all of her pain top
all at once
eric bears down on top dollar again
blood begins to leak from his eyes nose ears
all for you
flash rapidfire close ups
a jagged compound fracture jutting shellys eye blood red sclera purpled and sunken
her scraped raw hand clawing at air
a tight shot of her monitor going flatline eeeeeeeeeeeeee
as top sags in erics grasp terror fixing his wide staring dead eyes
eric lets him drop like a laundry sack
i didnt think you could handle it either
bang of impact heavy against the steel door
as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power ram
all weapons snap up to bear on eric
thats all she wrote bozo
you stand down now and thats an order
using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming swats while launching himself into the air flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops
open fire on command
bullets tear the room to pieces
the fire escapes covered
picking up eric on his dive through the window bullets chasing him
immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork
eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof
eric somersaults over
bullets chip brick in his wake
showtime girded police cars and marksmen eric a distant shadow figure above
here comes a team leader with a bullhorn
on the roof
a fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him
a forearm up against the fusillade
below him here come lead swat and his merry men
eric runs for it
half a story higher
he hits the wall and skitters up gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork
lead swat hesitates because of what he sees
holy shit its spiderman
he tries to pull a bead and fires too late
whatre you boy scouts staring at
he sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop
as he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight boring in from behind and above the row of buildings
cops below cops in the chopper everyone rushing parallel to eric trying to keep up
pan quick to the next ledge
cops right behind him on the roof as well
and finds a void waiting there
no connecting building
staying ahead of the search light
a fantastic series of artful moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof
sighting eric as the light picks him out
eric glances at them
hes off the roof
we cant see him
pulling his weapon off target because there is not target
dammit to hell
beat to men come on
eric lands like a falling safe scattering garbage
but hes okay up and running
as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a stop blocking the exit
as he backpedals scanning for an alternate escape
from car come on
we can see albrecht
eric dives inside and the car burns rubber
albrecht harried and frantic but in control
keep your head down
he twists and turns the car glancing rearward for pursuit
gradually he calms down
i figured you might need a ride home
eric looks up at him from his half concealed crouch
i figured as much
did you cap off funboy
funboy had to leave this mortal coil
yeah among others
sees erics condition hey man youre hit
its only a flesh wound
its only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds
eric sits up as the car gains distance
grabs the cigarette out of albrechts mouth
takes his single puff
you shouldnt smoke these
he pitches the smoke out the open car window
litterbug of the living dead
eric turns back to albrecht
eric shoots him a doubtful look
i mean ive done what i came to do
it shouldnt hurt this much
but it will pass
not buying it right
beat you sure i cant just take you to the emergency ward
it hangs a turn and their escape is made
they couldnt do anything for me
how bout the morgue
i have one more thing to do
lonelier less traffic more deserted
youre gonna kill somebody else
beat no response were gonna stop and get a shit load of band aids
eric is obviously fighting to stay centered stay conscious
his last fight has caused him a great deal of damage taken a lot out of him
he needs to recharge
i have to prepare for an anniversary
this coming night
hold on their two kinds of determination
as we high blue sky
it might even be pretty if it wasnt detroit
the tv flybank pulses with videotaped images of club trashs of various performers including diabolique
on several screens one by one various images of a guitar playing eric draven freeze frame as we pull back to the desk
lao has the x from the corridor gallery
he places it within eyeshot and resumes work on the desk below frame we cant see it yet among other scattered research and inconcubula
entering and crossing to the desk
as he comes up to the desk he draws back
the hell is that
calmly this is a cobra mr
yes it is real
revealing lao with a sealed cage holding a large live cobra in his hands
the killing blade is nearby
that thing is poisonous
beat you and i are the recipients of unwanted good fortune in the form of a man everyone is calling the crow
grange makes a face
cant keep his eyes off the cobra
give me a break
that guys a wacko
i intend no slight to you but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is
i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury
not a plymouth fury i bet
lao chuckles indulgently
do you know of spirit assassins
you do know the dead can rise
properly motivated of course
like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip
but tonight i can take what is his
only thing youll get from that clown is a faster way to die
to the contrary
lao smoothly beheads the snake with the blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body
he squeezes behind one of the eyes and a venom sac protrudes like a dark pimento
lao pulls it free of the milky clinging tissue and eats it
off granges stunned expression
all the dying tonight will be done by the former eric draven
lao exhibits the blade to grange as though it explains all
who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead
when he begins to care about the living youll find his heart can bleed
and i want it to bleed for me
kill a dead guy
lao pops the second venom sac swallows it
truly kill him
so i may crush his skull and smoke it
grange can handle it
let it suffice that i need him
and to get to him well need his little friend
finally an assignment grange can comfortable understand
eric barechested emotionally tapped clean of makeup and blood but exhausted his movements retarded and slack
staring fixedly into the fireplace where he burns everything he could find of his past the junk from the makeup table the masques photos of himself and shelly
moving with elly as she nears the open loft door
she peeks cautiously inside
without looking toward the door he speaks
whats going on
beat a closure
and eric consigns to the fire the dress we saw earlier
holds a photograph in a broken frame
subject eric and shelly goofing for the camera
he chucks it into the fire
draws a deep breath
i feel good
how are you elly my friend
elly is clearly uncomfortable groping for an excuse just to see eric
eric is staring at her intently
what is it
i knew i knew you
even with the makeup and stuff you wore
beat you really loved her didnt you
the photo burns and blackens in the grate
you brought flowers
as long as you dont forget her elly she lives
upset shes dead
and now youre just gonna go away and never come back too
i hate this place it isnt fair
he draws her close
wipes away an errant tear with his thumb
sometimes the people we care about are gone for no reason
sometimes thats really tough
but if the people we love are gone we keep them he taps ellys temple then his won
its a big responsibility
and that makes it okay to mourn
beat i know that if you werent here id be very sad
elly gives eric a hug
you look funny without your white face on
like its your day off or something
he quizzical expression amuses him
somebody here wants to meet you
gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them
elly is immediately smitten
i remember him
is he still yours
i think hes yours now
the cat seems to like that idea
elly wraps him hugely up in her arms talking to him howre you gabriel whatcha doin while elly is preoccupied with the cat eric gives up his last bit of
shelly to the fire a portrait photo of her small and creased
he puts it in the fire watches it burn for a beat then turns to elly
i have something else for you
back focus as eric lifts off his neck shellys ring for ellys inspection
the ring twirls large in f
nobody ever gave me something like that before
eric places it around her neck
shelly wouldve wanted you to have it
this way youll think of her every time you see it
and shell be alive
elly taps her own temple with a smile keeping one hand on the ring
trick or treaters wisp past
ghosts witches demons out for halloween
walking home with gabriel zipped up inside her coat is elly
a fire engine wails past in the opposite direction
strictly downscale building
elly to gabriel youre gonna like it here
a car curbs across the street as she enters the building
as the window cranks down to reveal grange at the wheel
darla nervously smoking doing her best to stay clean but jittery
elly enters the shabby living room with gabriel in her arms
i was wonderin where youd gotten to she sees gabriel oh elly honey a cat
he was a present
besides were moving anyway
well discuss this later
you left the door open
as elly goes to close the door it opens
grange enters accompanied by two asian martial arts strongarms lao guards
grange looks around bemused his manner avuncular
ellys surprise is evident
darla is just plain pissed off
i dont remember you
and i dont remember inviting
to his men if she opens her face again shoot her in the head
mouth stalling in the on position as lao guard pulls a gigantic gun draws and cocks
as he scoops her up captive
he strolls the circuit of the room stopping near the window
you should listen to your mother
she said no cats
grange pitches gabriel right out the window
grange pulls out a compact polaroid camera
now thats the expression i want
as she struggle mightily to no avail as grange moves in to snap his shot
on the sx whirr and flash white out we dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset
eric plays the guitar loud the shelly theme in a major key
where before it was wandering uncertain now its bold and heartbreaking
pain replaced by strength and a sense of homecoming
as eric gets to the end of it the notes are flying out
at the climax rips the guitar up over his head and brings it down smash on the pignose
hes finished here
as the broken guitar sails out over the building edge
as eric comes down the stairs
notices the open door
he enters cautiously to find an envelope laying in the middle of the floor
he opens it
with a note
the crow flies past behind him as his expression hardens
eric brutally crisscrosses his arms with black vinyl tape
pulling on black night fighting clothes skintight
as eric seen in mirror jabs his fingers into the white makeup and smears it on
eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems to be in costume
the wind whips his coat
kids bustle around him with trick or treat bags
the crow perched on his shoulder
somewhere a few blocks over a building is burning
a fire engine races past on the street
he steps out in its wake and crosses over to waiting for him as he crosses to the fence
beyond the fence in the distance the church looms
a kid in a creature from the black lagoon mask comes passes eric then comes back for a touch
trick or treat
eric is standing over the grave of shelly webster looking down
he holds for a moment then moves on
eric ascends toward giant oak doors tres gothique
the crow flaps past leading him
new angle top of steps where waits the skull cowboy
as eric approaches the skull cowboy interposes himself between eric and the huge double doors
eric glares up defiant
moves up the steps
the skull cowboy extends a skeletal hand
stop screwing around
angry ready to battle you talking to me
your job is done
you interfere with the living again
tell me ill get hurt
that i might die
beat ive already done that
i dont need anyones help
eric lower skull cowboy superior the storm wild around them
do this thing and you will be vulnerable
the blood will not return
beat no powers
fine with me
he advances a step up the skull cowboy hold fast
youll be alone
im already alone
through a castle keep like slit grange monitors erics arrival
he speaks into a headset
weve got company
is he inside
eric talking to dead air
almost arguing with it
as he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped laser sighted snipers rifle
hes just out front talking to himself
you tell me
eric eyes steely stares down the skull cowboy
dont waste my time
very well its your ass
and the wind kicks up around them both powerfully
as the force of the storm dust devils around him and begins to disassemble him
the fire in his eye sockets goes out
his hat flies off an is pulverized by the wind
the garments begin to disintegrate and blow around rotten cerements falling apart in mid air
angle eric on steps transfixed by this unexpected development
a shard of the skull cowboy blows past erics face and transmutes to dust
transparent ancient bones crumbling and blowing away
as eric lunges for whats left of his mysterious smart ass mentor meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the skull cowboys heart would have been
he has time to register the dust in his palm before it too renders down to nothingness leaving a vague green glow that dies
and as he looks to the sky flapping down to land on erics shoulder
eric is astonished
but why are you still here
no answer in the crows eyes
thats good enough for eric
he marches to the double doors and shoves them back
the high breeze blows in with him disturbing dust in the disused gothic dark
hollow cathedral echoes to sounds
a giant tv positioned on the alter broadcasting static
leery of potential danger from a thousand dark places
onscreen elly gagged with duct tape and handcuffed to an iron ring bolted to a flagstone wall
could be anywhere inside the church
i believe our friend elly call you mister crow
beat please acknowledge the mike will pick you up
i can see her
of course you can
angle grange in the gallery in darkness
the running lights on his night scoped laser sighted snipers rifle which throws vague sprays of eerie red and green light
dont permit your rage to cloud the issue
i believe in barter
i propose a simple trade
grange sights his weapon
bluring as grange resights
eric is not the target
blur finds the crow at the far end of the nave perched in front of a giant stained glass window
new angle grange squeezing off two quick silenced shots
angle stained glass window the first shot blows a hole in some pastoral religious presentation
tinkle of glass
angle eric spinning at the quiet
sound to witness
spinning and hissing venomously
as before but the crow is not as fast
as it catches the dart and goes down in a flurry of feathers
his knees buckle
sympathetic pain from the hit
you intended to finish this evening in the cemetery
i am here to help you on your way
swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle similarly scoped
he sights the fallen eric in a spray of green light
groping for support to drag himself back to standing
ive got him if you want him
into headset move in guys
high angle the sanctuary as lao guards and move into light closing on erics position in the center of isle
both wield calicos and one bears a sword
close angle alter lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get up a practical fighting outfit
makes a show of drawing the killing blade
i wish to possess what you have now
i want the girl
that is why i will prevail
eric cramps up clutching his throat in obvious pain
holding the crow by the neck tightly
he plucks the tranq dart from the its body
crashing to one knee invisibly bludgeoned struggling to breathe
lao has no fear walking around the stricken eric
sooner or later my action were destined to bring me a genuine fury
and it turned out to be you
i appreciate your abilities as few mortals can
thats why i desire them
youre too late
there was a guy outside on the stairs you really need to talk to
but he turned to dust and blew away
beat gasping i dont have any power for you to take
i dont believe that
lao motions to grange with the killing blade
grange relaxes his deathgrip on the crow
move in close on eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief
time for you to die for me
beat funny how the dead can still bleed
how they need air
eric immobilized as lao draws back the blade
to grange break its neck
angle resuming grange at window as he prepares to do dirty on the bird
over his shoulder we push in to the bullethole from the first dart until were in tight close up of an eye watching through the hole
albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry trying to simultaneously monitor the peephole muttering sotto to himself
had to go get yourself hip deep in shit didnt you my friend
it begins to rain
albrecht glances resentfully toward the sky
give it a rest huh
a hefts a machinegun clipped over and under
cuts loose on full auto into the madonna on the window
as the window explodes toward grange and he sucks big hits from behind dropping the crow
the bird hits the ground flapping weakly
lao guards exchange a look and whip up their calicos albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily destroyed all around his position
chunks of the window continue to disintegrate
eric tuck and rolls out of the way as we go close on lao screaming
i said no shooting
then hes ducking bullets himself as albrecht steps in through the blown out window the machine gun stuttering on slugs
the sanctuary comes apart around lao
he retreats to the alter and exits whence he came
tight on pew eric dives just as guard comes after him with the sword which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there
guard releases it and cross draws his calico as eric springs back into the frame straight up
tight on guard as erics lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire
intercuts albrecht and guard scrambling to reload
guard changes magazine albrecht swaps clips
angle down length of pew guard slides
sits up with his gun as eric down pew grabs the sword
angle albrecht at window firing now with a gun in each hand
resume eric and guard who eats it from albrechts gunfire but not before he puts a round through eric
eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet
resume albrecht as he tosses away the dry pistol
his machine gun jams he fights to get the clip
angle guard reloaded and rising having caught albrecht dead bang in the open by the window
moving angle with eric a complex leap with the sword flashing
he lands near guard and slashes upwards blade up
close up guard screaming in pain gaping down o
tight on albrecht looking up following the trajectory of something airborne toward him
close up guard s calico spinning mid air with guard s hands still attached severed mid forearm by erics devastating strike
angle albrecht drops guard to reveal eric in the background
eric salutes albrecht with the tip of the sword
with albrecht as he moves into the nave which has been torn apart by gunfire
two dead guys
you sorta looked like you might need my help
this isnt your place
this isnt your fight
and i dont need your help
dont do this
i dont want you here
the hell you say
this isnt just about you any more
eric stares dead on at albrecht acidly then breaks the guards sword dropping the pieces and turning his back on albrecht who pursues eric to the crow flaps upward through
eric grabs the thick bellrope testing it
a final look to albrecht
youre bleeding man
you cant make it
eric shinnies up the bellrope ignoring albrecht
watching as eric dissappears from view fast
you wont mind if i just take the stairs then smartass
he hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the steps
angle moving with eric on the rope a weird perspective of speed climb
all the way to the top
slanted shingled slippery dark
lightning deep in the turbid clouds
the crow circles as eric rises into frame
here i am
downframe lightning strikes the ornate lightning rod large victorian lance like at the far end of the roof from the bell tower
silhouetting lao and elly standing in front of it
elly flinches at the strike
can you fly crow man
he stops his ascent to light a cigarette
i aint cut out for this superhero shit
lao snaps ellys free handcuff to the dimly glowing lightning rod and advances one foot on either side of the peak of the roof his blade brandished
close moving shot eric hands up to grapple but weaponless
he spiders to meet lao suddenly picking up speed and running along the precarious peak
lao sees him coming braces to strike but eric executes a broad flying leap right over laos head
eric lands slips sprawls sideways clinging to the peak of the roof
lao hurries in to slash with the blade as eric averts
the steel rings
eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick that dumps lao
eric spread eagles to keep from falling
distantly lao similarly saves himself
new angle the fight here comes lao crabbing back toward the peak
eric rolls to ellys position grabs the lightning rod and tries to wrest it loose
sizzle of flesh as erics hands are scorched the metal is still blue hot
moving with lao as eric battles to free the lightning rod
lao closes up distance gives a warcry and prepares to swing as eric wrenches the rod loose and turns to deflect laos blow
the weapons spark as they meet
and there goes elly her handcuff freed sliding down the roof slope
angle roof slope with eric as he dodges lao by using the lightning rod to vault down to where elly is about to slip off the roof
with the rod embedded in the roof eric hangs on and elly hangs on to eric
up angle lao a dark figure against the night sky raising the sword
eric guides elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses
when he looks up lao is gone
angle bell tower albrechts head pokes up at last
looks around finally spots eric below and to the left
yells serio comic
is he dead yet
insert albrechts holster as laos hand draws albrechts gun quickly
angle albrecht and lao lao has blindsided albrecht
he jams the gun into the base of albrechts neck and fires three times
close angle eric hes too far away to matter
insert albrechts cigarette as it rolls down the slope trailing sparks snuffing out
angle eric holding onto the lightning rod as lightning cuts the night above him
angle lao at bell tower triumphant and a bit wild shouting
youve caused another death mister draven
the girl will die as well because of you
the base of a triangle lao eric elly
you go to hell you pervert
rage over the loss of albrecht
he rises hurting but mad as hell
glares up toward lao
and how many lives have you destroyed
i took yours from you
your little girlfriend
i took hers too
your meaningless petty life
i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose
youre no avenger
eyes alight with hatred for lao
to himself youre right im not an avenger
not any more
as lightning strikes eric fires his gaze toward the sky
seeing the crash dive toward lao through the rows eyes
as the crow wings down into frame and lights on laos head clawing
close up the crow on laos head slashing with its claws
pecking out laos eyes
with eric on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his climb the crow lao upframe b
resume lao as the crow abandons him
lao staggers and falls down the roof toward eric
slanted angle eric and lao eric arrests laos fall fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose
time for a sacrifice
laos face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the eyes used to be
he smiles gruesomely
i dont need eyes to take what i want from you
he embraces eric and rams the killing blade deep into erics back
on eric as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his sternum
a lot of pain
can you fly
he pulls lao into a backward roll down the roof holding him eric lands on his back forcing the blade through himself and into lao
eric completes the roll and kicks lao off into space the killing blade still embedded in him
with lao as crashes sliding sprawling down past ellys position
gets to his knees atop the flying buttress
sees the blade in his own chest
close up elly she sees it all happen
resume lao a regretful look toward eric
he plummets off the roof edge
angle eric slides down roof he slows stopping when elly is in frame
he clutches his own chest
regards his own shaking hand drenched in his won blood
on elly as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth trying to get to eric
she flails and cries out
dont let me fall
close up their hands finally meet and grasp tight
a low angle tracking shot as when we first met elly
erics and ellys feet pass graves
erics pace is slow crippled limping
they stop at a grave where elly bends into frame to steal the flowers there
eric is bloody and out of it
she helps him walk
now do you get to see her
shelly i mean
in a better place
youre not gonna come back are you
erics response is halting and uncertain
but he tries to give her hope
he reaches for shellys ring around her neck holds it up to her
i dont know if i can
but you have this
and you know where to come
you mean youll like dig your way out of the grave
eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries
he grasps ellys face in his hands and bends painfully to kiss her on the forehead
for you ill try
spent empty he holds the rose determinedly but hes never going to make it the few yards back to his own grave
his legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus
one groping hand tries to drag him further
leave me now
tears on her face
she cant watch this
she turns and drops the flowers on shellys grave
still too far away to matter
he gives it up his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat before shellys hand intrudes into frame to grasp his hand
no ethereal glow no heavenly choir
just a near dead erics blank faced astonishment and he moves forward
she struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve
she turns toward erics grave
then surprised she looks close
eric is gone
the white rose lies neatly on the top of the undisturbed earth there
emphasizing that elly is now alone in the graveyard
low angle on elly rose in the foreground she walks off
hold the rose
a grey day but no rain
elly stands wistfully by the window her doll on standby
the apartment is in order and perhaps we notice a few new items
gabriel the cat miraculously alive is sprawled on a chair licking himself
darla bustles into frame b
her wardrobe more upscale her hair done
her manner is hectic but natural
first day new job gotta go
this does not get the expected smile from elly
you sure youre gonna be okay
elly turns from the window and nods silently
the aforementioned grey day in the city
darla comes up
arm around elly
cheer up he attitude much more connected and loving
push in on elly so we know she is clutching shellys ring tightly in her hand
darla looks past elly out the window
at least it finally stopped raining
it cant rain all the time
darla kisses elly on the temple and it out the door
elly opens her hand to consider the ring
she looks back out the window elly is looking right at it
so is elly
it takes wing and flies away
an up angle from erics grave toward the tree as the crow flies into frame and perches there shucking water
push in on the crow
