godzilla first draft by dean devlin roland emmerich by dean devlin roland emmerich first draft an iguana
crawling off its nest leaving its eggs exposed
grainy kodak color nineteen sixties documentary footage of a beautiful polynesian island
we see quick shots of kimono dragons gila monsters and chameleons all in their natural tropical environment
super moruro atoll islands french polynesia june incongruously over this jungle environment we hear a static ridden radio filtered voice slowly counting down in french
it is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about
suddenly with a brilliant flash of white light a nuclear explosion mushrooms into the sky
we see a series of real shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the french government held in this tropical region
explosion after explosion devastates the locale
one building after the next accelerating in momentum culminating in one final explosion
the clould filled sky begins to drizzle
the ash like fallout drifts downward onto whats left of the islands below
we follow this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile unrecognizable now and down onto whats left of the lizards eggs
suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean modern high resolution
we zoom in on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash
we continue to push in getting closer
smashing through the choppy waters barely by the storm we see the cori akido a japanese oil supertanker
super pacific ocean present day we track across the complicated computerized navigational console that is actually steering the immense ship
in the b
we hear a japanese t
at the end of the console is the ships skipper an overweight japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy satellite broadcast of a sumo wrestling match
suddenly the sonar blares out a warning alarm
startled the skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to the console
the sonar displays an enormous mass heading quickly toward the ship
the skippers eyes go wide
he hits a klaxon alarm awaking the entire ship
he presses the radio intercom
in japanese captain
this is the bridge
we have an emergency
the crew rushes out of their quarters and into the hall
quickly they race for the upper decks
the ships elderly cook pokes his head out of the kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by
in japanese whats going on
before anyone can answer the ship is rocked by an enormous thud as something hits the side of the immense ship
the crew tumbles as the ship sways violently
the old cook is thrown to the floor
he looks up nervously
the captain enters quickly joining the skipper at the console
in japanese what was that
in japanese i cant tell
again the ship is hit
an enormous crashing sound is heard as the ship rocks to one side tossing the captain and skipper to the floor
suddenly we hear the tell tale famous screaming wail of our creature from somewhere outside
terror shines in the captains eyes at the sound
the crew getting back on their feet reacts to the horrible wailing sound
suddenly the ship is hit again
this time something enormous rips through the hull crushing one of the crew members as it tears through the walls
water rushes through the large gaping hole quickly filling the hallway
the cook and whats left of the crew scurry for the stairs as the water level chases them
the ships computers are whirling with warning lights and alarms
as the skipper tries to adjust the controls in vain the captain grabs the ships p
in japanese abandon ship
man the lifeboats
but before he can say anything more something whips across the bridges enormous windshield shattering the glass
was it a tail
no way far too big
the doors burst open as the crew and the cook rush out onto the deck
again the ship is hit rocking it violently
is ripped away revealing a life boat
two more life boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately tries to hoist them up and over the side
something enormous jolts out of the water towards the ship
through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what it is but it slams into the side of the ship ripping into it pulling down the starboard side as
could that have been a claw
are thrown backwards
the lifeboats swing wildly several of them smashing into bits as they slam against the ship
or whatever it is rips into the side again
this time the entire ship begins to flip over
bounces off the deck and slides off the side
following it is the cook
desperately the cook grabs onto the ships side railing to keep from falling off
he looks back and sees something so horrible that he screams in terror and lets go of the railing
the old cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker clearing at their highest speed we see through the rain doused windshield dr
niko nick tatopoulos
music blares from the tiny headphones of his walkman
singing im singing in the rain just singing in the rain
the utility van races through this small russian town right past a roadblock marked with the international signs for no trespass and nuclear radiation
what a glorious feeling
im happy again
as the van disappears down the road we crane up revealing a city sign reading chernobyl russia
with the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the distance the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this field of dirt
nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van
he opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic cases
walking a few yards away from the van he dumps the cases on the ground opening them to reveal an assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment
taped to the inside are several photos of a girl well meet later
some of the photos are of her looking young and beautiful
others are of the two of them happily together
with a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to life
inside one of the cases are several cables attached to long spikes
he grabs them and dashes away
im laughing at clouds so dark up above
nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to shove the spikes into the muddy earth
the suns in my heart and im ready for love
once firmly in the ground he rushes back over to the van and pops the hood
we see the steaming engine and a large electric car let the cloudy skies chase
he attaches the cables to the battery and they spark
nick yelps and jumps back
shaking off the shock he rushes back over to the mud pit dropping down to his knees
suddenly raising from the mud we see dozens of earthworms
excitedly tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass jar and begins filling the jar with worms happily in his element
im singin in the mud just scooping up my worms
unable to hear over his walkman he is oblivious as an enormous russian military helicopter lands right behind him
from the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several russian officers coming toward him
nick scrambles to his feet
broken russian good day
i am here with permission
i have a a
in english permit
how do you say permit
he goes through his pockets looking for his permits
tatopoulos looks up as the russian soldiers move past him and over towards his cases of equipment
a man in a long raincoat comes forward
the worm guy right
extending his hand as he approaches kyle terrington u
the russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it off to the helicopter
what are they doing
youve been reassigned
you cant shut me down now
my research heres not finished
it is now
coastal town of papeete tahiti
with the ocean in the distance through the heat waves we see a row of official looking black sedans coming toward us
the doors to the sedans open as a group of very official looking government types
stopping to light his cigarette is phillip raymond s intense dangerous and worst of all
raymond leads the official looking group down the hall
a briefing officer rushes over
the following dialog is entirely in french with subtitles the japanese consulate has been calling and weve been getting pressure from the americans
what did you tell them
are there any other survivors
only one sir
he was very lucky
the group arrives at a door at the end of the hall
the briefing officer opens the door
in the corner of the large room we see the old cook from the tanker curled up in the fetal position
the doctors and a few nurses are attending to him
get them out of there
two of the officials move in and escort the doctors and nurses out of the room
raymond nods to two other officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment including a video camera
raymond enters and moves close to the old cook kneeling down in front of him inspecting his distant glare
the old cook seems to be in a world of his own rocking back and forth
raymond nods to another official who comes forward
in french ask him what happened
the second official ask him in japanese but the old cook does not respond
he asks again but the old cook seems to be in a world of his own
in english its no use
hes been like this since we fished him out of the ocean
whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock
raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high
the old cooks eyes slowly come back to life transfixed by the fire
slowly he brings the flame close to the old cooks face
in english what did you see old man
drawn out of himself by the flame
raymond shoots a look at the second official for an explanation
in english i have no idea what he is saying
a small sea plane flies over this jungle region of panama darting up the gulf into the lush greenery of the countryside
super guilfo de san miguel panama km outside of la paz slowly the plane begins to descend landing by a small village
several soldiers unload nicks cargo as he steps out of the plane onto the dock
as he walks towards shore he dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at a police barricade their access to the village denied
panamanian police and u
military working together to keep people out
marching up the shore to greet nick is major tony hicks s efficient who is spearheading this operation
correcting its tatopoulos
the worm guy
to guards at blockade can someone get those people off the beach
excuse me would you mind telling me what the hell im doing here
the major leads nick up the beach away from the crowds
you didnt answer my question
in fact for the last hours no one has answered any of my questions
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise
several soldiers and researchers are investigating the site when nick and the major walk past
look i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field
major hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade away from a jungle pathway
major hicks takes the pathway
do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm
yeah youre the worm guy
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworms dna
you have any idea what that means
no but i have the feeling im about to find out
it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before
mutated by seventeen percent
major hicks stops turns to nick
bemused seventeen percent huh
a new species created by mans recklessness
thats what ive been trying to tell you im only a biologist
i take radioactive samples and study them
then youre perfect
pointing to the ground heres your radioactive sample
with that major hicks walks away
youre standing on it
nick looks down sees nothing
i dont see it
no response where is it
we crane up above him pulling back farther and farther until we see hes standing inside of a yard long gigantic footprint in the sand
i dont see it
two scientists have spread out a tape measure to document its length as two others inspect it with geiger counters
nick sees them and realizes hes standing in a remarkable discovery
he looks up ahead and sees
overhead titlt shot foot steps
five gigantic footsteps in front of him
other researchers examining the prints with all kinds of equipment
geiger counters click clicking away
nick is stunned
nick rushes to catch up with major hicks who walks towards a command tent in the distance
flabbergasted that was a footprint
i was standing inside a footprint
but theres no animal in the world that can make prints like that
were hoping youre going to help us figure that out
the major gestures to the many villagers who are being attended to
some are injured others are being examined for radiation
the village has been decimated
somebody must have seen it
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them til is was over
a jeep pulls up and peters a young researcher comes rushing over with a video tape in his hands
as he passes major hicks
on the run tapes in
the french finally released it
peters takes off for the command tent
nick and the major follow
part military part scientific command post
lots of activity
peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a television
major hicks and nick follow
a tanker was attacked and sunk yesterday near the french polynesians
we think theres a connection
is that the tape of the witness
excitedly elsie chapman heavy set early s paleontologist and head of the research team leads several of her colleagues over to the t
ah elsie chapman paleontologist
shes clearly attracted to him
this doesnt escape nick whos not too comfortable with her flirtatious glare
she turns to a scientist standing next to her dr
craven have you met the worm guy
nice to meet you
turns on and we see the old cook rocking on his bed repeating over and over the same word
filtered through t
this is all too overwhelming for him
he turns from the t
and looks out into the jungle
slowly he walks away staring at something in the distance with total awe
elsie walks up next to him
what could have possibly done all that
we reverse angle and see what they are staring at
a gigantic path cut through the jungle
something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes on for miles on end
over the stunned face of nick we filtered gojira
the same beach scene we saw when nick arrived
filtered american and panamanian troops quarantined off a section of the panamanian jungle today amid unconfirmed reports of a crashed air force jet
as we widen we see this is one of several wall mounted monitors all showing channel wnew
through the glass doorway nearby we see charles caiman s handsome entering the office
murray wants these copied to each field producer
standing in front of the desk is audrey timmonds early thirties attractive small town girl who still hasnt toughened in the big city and talking with her co worker lucy
and im supposed to remind you to call him on all of caimans expense p
speak of the devil
just then caiman passes behind them
nervous think i should ask him
im going to ask him
you think i should
audrey makes the decision and bolts after caiman
lucy rolls her eyes
as he walks towards his office audrey races up to him
seeing her he walks faster hoping to avoid her
did you talk with humphries
this is not the place
just tell me did you talk with him
he said hed consider it
its between you and rodriguez
are you serious
hes going to consider me for he job
what else did he say
they arrive at his office
an enormous standee of himself with the action news crew is there
why dont i tell you over dinner tonight
he stops at his door
audrey is startled
caiman youre married
and youre beautiful
call me charlie
caiman ive been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year
and ive never asked for anything but this job is really important to me
im too old to be an assistant anymore
i need to know this job is going someplace
so have dinner with me tonight
its your choice
caiman shuts the door on her
she turns and is face to face with the standee of caiman
she takes out her chewing gum and plasters it on his nose
over the bumpy jamaican highway we follow from above several military jeeps racing in convoy
super great pedro bluff jamaica elsie nick and clive are cramped together along with nicks equipment in the back of the jeep
nick looks very uncomfortable
elsie looks at nick
three years digging up worms in chernobyl
how did mrs
tatopoulos handle it
oh im not married
a girlfriend then
perhaps i work too much
filtered you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart
nick seems to get lost in thought
not for a long time now
well i think youre cute
awkward oh thank you
whispered to clive is she always like this
conspiratorially i had to beat her off with a stick
the sound of a helicopter zooms overhead
a helicopter zooms past our convoy
as we follow the helicopter we reveal
taking up nearly the entire beach an enormous cargo ship lays on its side in the sand
two gigantic holes ripped into its hull
nick hops out and joins major hicks et al as they push past the gathered crowd of onlookers
the group gives a collective gasp as they see the ship for the first time
three men who well recognize from the tahiti hospital take measurements of the holes in the ship
who are they
lieutenant get those people away from there
french accent they are with me
everyone in the group turns to find mr
and who are you
raymond hands him as well as anyone who wants one his business card
chargeures property and casualty insurance
we are preparing a report
that is our job
well your people are getting in the way of my job
major what do you think could have done this
get your people out of there or i will
the major walks away
raymond studies him as he does
nick cant take his eyes off the enormous holes in the hull
he steps closer and turns to peters whos taking radiation counts of the ship
mind if i borrow this
peter hands him his geiger counter and walks into the cracked hull of the ship
inside is eerily dark and creepy
the guts of the ship are tangled inside
holding a geiger counter he gets readings from all over the area
one particular spot above him seems slightly stronger
nick sees something there
he opens his knapsack and puts on some rubber gloves removing a glass jar like the ones from chernobyl carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp shard
clinging to it he finds a meaty chunk of he tries remove it but he only gets half
he places it into his jar
just as he reaches for the other half with a jolt the section above him collapses
a rush of water falls and a human body swings down just in front of him
nick tumbles backwards his heart pounding
the body swings lifelessly as it hangs from above
the others rush to his side checking to see if hes all right
you okay nick
nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar is suddenly handed to him
are you looking for this
raymond studies nick as he joins the rest outside
we are moving very quickly underwater
ahead of us are some large fishing nets with a catch of fish carried in the bunt
quickly we are heading for a collision
a great day for fishing
slicing through the water we see three new england fishing trawlers the harpo the chico and the groucho
arthur is at the wheel
suddenly the engines whine as the ship begins to slow down
surprised arthur checks his throttle
leonard and his st mate are puzzled by the engine whine of their own ship
jerry why are we slowing down
shes heavy in the bunt
that was fast
the captain jules hasnt noticed a thing as he lays on his deck tanning himself a boom abox blaring next to him
the ship jolts for a second
jules slides and bangs his head into the boom box
the nets are full
then bring em in
she wont budge
jules gets up to move aft when thud again the ship arthur tries to gun his engine but it only whines
soon all three boats stop dead
nothing but quiet for a long beat
what is going on
then with another jolt all three boats begin to move shes going sternway
what the hell did we catch
the three boats begin to pick up speed moving backwards in the water
water splashes up into the boats winches begin to crack under the building pressure
the boats begin to move incredibly fast backwards
things on the boat begin to break and crash down onto the decks of the ships
cut us free
cut the nets
the same cry is heard on all three boats
leonard grabs an axe and starts hacking away at the tow lines
jules and his deck hands do the same
wire sheers are brought out for the larger cables connected to the nets
desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards
screaming at his men cut the damned cables
jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure
their boat stops
leonard and his crew tumble to the deck as their boat is freed
is not so fortunate
the lone boat dragged backwards faster now without the weight of the other boats
then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get pulled down dipping into the water
with an unstoppable force the harpo gets pulled under water
deck hands leap off the boat as the top cabin is crushed as the entire ship slowly for a moment all is quiet
no one can believe what just happened
hearts pounding catching their breath
then with a whoosh of air pressure the harpo bursts out of the water
with a gigantic splash the boat flops on its side and capsizes
the waters calm but the nerves of jules and leonard dont
a storm is brewing ahead as this large military transport plane glides into view then banks away
a small piece of nicks sample is cut away and placed on a glass microscope slide
nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his microscope examining his specimen
quickly stepping over him a young soldier rushes over to major hicks seated with the rest of the team on the planes opposing benches
the solider interrupts their discussion
major we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down
exact position forty seven degrees latitude longitude
what makes you think its related
the trawler was pulled under
the team exchanges worried glances
hicks moves over to a map where the other incidents have been marked
he traces his finger up the th longitude until he hits the th parallel
just off the east coast
its only two hundred miles off the american eastern seaboard and we dont even know what it is
theropoda allosaurus some type of enormous reptile the likes of which we havent seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs
sarcastic so wheres been hiding the last sixty million years the depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored
his kind could have survived there completely undetected
what about the traces of radiation
everyone turns to discover nick has walked over holding his loosely scribbled notes in his hand
the radiation is not an anomaly its the clue this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur
dont tell me why its not tell me what the hell it is
what do we know
it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific
an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years
hence the radiation
more than that
i believe this is a mutated aberration a hybrid from the fall out in that region
sarcastic like your earthworms
were looking at a completely incipient creature
the dawn of a new species
the first of its kind
racing close to the ocean waters below something dark and enormous moves swiftly below the surface
we tilt up from the raging tides up to reveal
a storm has arrived as rain moistens the city ahead
dripping wet audrey enters from the rain removing her raincoat
she walks to a booth where lucy and animal a slovenly italian video cameraman is his mid thirties are taking their lunch break
animal has two plates of food he cobbles down
sitting my life sucks
oh please your life doesnt suck
his life sucks
between chews thats cuz im married to you
how can you eat like that
i cant believe he put the moves on me
after everything ive done for him
as far as hes concerned youre just a pair of breasts that talk
i like that image
you know how i spent last weekend
walking his damned dog
im telling you hes dirt
hes a douche bag gutter slime dog crap puke chunks
im eating here
audrey youre too damned nice thats your problem
nice gets you nothin in this town
you gotta be a killer to get ahead you know what im sayin
im sorry baby but you just dont got what it takes
animal you dont think thats true do you
nice guys finish last
first rule of the jungle
well i can be tough if i want
seeing something oh my god
everything turns to see what audrey is looking at
audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the counter
excitedly turn that up turn it up
the waitress does
on the t
plays the same news story we saw from before from panama
this time we see nick and major hicks walking on the beach
i know that guy
i know him
unimpressed who is he
he was my college sweetie
look at him
he looks so handsome on t
what the hell is he doing in panama
even in the rain doesnt keep people away
buyers haggle with sellers
a large market truck loads of fish
no one seems to notice the river across from them
enormous turbulence in the water
slowly something begins to lift sheets of water fall
bursting out the backside talons of the enormous reptile pierce through
the tail slices through the turbulence
two ships anchored at dock begin to lift upwards as the beast below them begins to rise
a groaning wail roars echoing
the people of the fish market turn just in time to see
lifting impossibly into the air above the pier
suddenly a tidal wave of water comes crashing down flooding the fish market
through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see the jfk highway in front of us
suddenly we see
comes crashing down atop jfk highway crushing it
the transit bus tumbles off the demolished highway
the man in the market truck is tossed and enormous teeth puncture the top and bottom of his truck as its lifted in the air
the man leaps from the open back of the truck
he lands hard down in front of one of the fish market stores as hundreds of fish rain down from above
with a loud crash the demolished truck slams to the ground nearby
with a large re elect mayor faustino poster behind him the mayor is at the podium
before him is a sea of umbrellas
id like to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful new york city day
some in the crowd laugh as others applaud
lost in the sounds of the crowd we hear a soft thumping in the distance
when i came into office four years ago people didnt think we could reduce crime and i did
leaning to the cop next to him
sarcastic yeah he did
people didnt think i could restore order
this time the thumping is heard growing much louder
and i did
the city is a safer place today
before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with fear as the thumping grows louder and closer
suddenly with a large crashing sound a building nearby begins to to his aides what the hell
people scramble to get out of the way as debris from the falling building litters the area
the mayor is pulled inside by his security men
bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we see the enormous leg of the reptile as it kicks debris out of its way
several cars are squashed quickly as the enormous feet of the beast stomps through the street
cars flatten and scatter flipping toward us from the weight of the beast
we try to keep up with it but its too fast
after it passes the mayor sticks his head out of the doorway to see the demolished street scene
what was that
caimans on the phone as his secretary enters with some files
rain and thunder continue outside
into phone i dont give a crap about some war in a country i cant pronounce
thats not a lead story
find me a damned story will ya
just then his secretary notices a desk lamp the shade shaking and the light flickering
she hears the thumping approaching
she turns and sees
the enormous head of godzilla growls as it passes by caimans office window
i think your story just walked by the window
caiman turns but theres nothing there
hes confused shes dazed
just then the tail whirls past with a thunders whip
animal lucy and audrey are at the cashier paying
did romeo have a name
that why you dumped him
i just couldnt see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches
i wanted to have some adventure some fun
and now you live the glamorous life of caimans assistant
lifes a bitch aint it
in the distance we can hear the thumping approaching
how long where you and dis guy goin steady
nearly four years
girl im surprised he didnt ask you to marry him
thats the problem
suddenly the thumping gets louder very quickly
everyone in the diner reacts
tell me thats not another goddamned parade
the next thump rattles the entire diner
things begin to fall
through the window we see people running in thats aint no parade
before anyone can speak the entire building is shaking
through the front window we see
smashing down directly outside the window
cars are smashed
one car sails directly into the window shattering it
animal uses his size to cover the girls from the falling debris
as the danger passes animal charges for the door
animal comes rushing out
water sprays from displaced fire hydrants debris still falls cars burn
animal goes over to his news van that has been partially crushed
he pries open the rear door and takes out his video camera and takes off running
audrey and lucy arrive too late to stop him
turning the corner animal runs full speed through the debris trying to jam a video cassette into his camera
it wont fit
he sees up ahead
just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks ahead
thinking quickly animal bolts down a small alleyway
his camera damaged animal struggles to get the tape inside as he exits the other side of the alley
he darts out into the street to get his shot
the thumping is overpoweringly loud
he looks up to see then for the first time we can clearly see the entire massive creature that is
as he comes barreling towards us
the titanic lizard is ferocious and agile
swiftly he moves closer
animals hands fumble with the tape
he jams it in sweating
he fingers the power button the red light goes on
quickly he shoulders the camera
nearly on top of him godzillas own image is suddenly covered by his own immense foot as its lifted and about to come down directly on us
before he can do anything about it
towering above him
he has no time to flinch as the gargantuan foot smashes down
in terrifying amazement animal remains standing in between the beasts toes
abruptly the foot lifts again
animal is unscathed and frozen with fear
close on animal as the endless tail of the creature drags just past him
it seems to go on forever
finally it disappears
deserted and demolished
cars burn debris falls
animal the lone figure just stands there his chest heaving hyper ventilating
a military convoy with police escort races past us
sirens blaring the convoy and escort speed onward
just as they arrive at a military roadblock
crowds have gathered as the military try to keep them at bay
the guards let the convoy pass
the military is putting up a number of large tents
a sergeant moves over quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles
quick salute sergeant oneal sir
any word from the mayors office
just then dozens of news vans pull up
reporters and camera crews come rushing toward them
the guards rush to intercept
stepping out of the next car in the convoy nick and elise join major hicks
theyve agreed to evacuate the city
theyve called out the national guard and riot police are on alert
as they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close
nick and elsie are overwhelmed
aside to nick evacuate manhattan
thats over three million people
has that ever been done before
i dont think so
several military guards have to clear a path for them as they enter the tents
still in construction
the team enters
weve lost sight of it sir
you want to run that by me again
nervous after the initial attack he just
interrupting major secretary of defense burk on the line
this takes major hicks off guard
the last person he wants to talk to
nick walks over to the sergeant
i dont understand
how can something that large just disappear
were not sure
were scanning the area now
he probably returned to the river
just like everywhere else weve been were always one step behind
nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open revealing a beautiful view of the manhattan skyline
several soldiers enter setting up telescopes
i dont think so
over manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from the destruction
military helicopters scan the city
staring out at the skyline nick is mesmerized
i mean look at it
an island water on all sides
but like no other island in the world this is a place where he can easily hide
beat hes in there someplace
a soldier comes rushing in
channel eight caught it on film
he rushes over to a bank of monitors turns one on
on the screen we see the shaky video animal took of the creature just as it was about to step on him
filtered wnews exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago
nick and elsies jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight of the immense creature
cameraman victor animal palotti barely survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage
the sounds of applause lead us to
everyone is applauding as animal carrying crates of equipment passes the t
playing the same news story
embarrassed animal smiles awkwardly
way to go animal
thats my man
animal passes audrey and lucy who are packing up some files
great stuff animal
werent you scared
sure i was
i thought lucy was gonna kill me
damned right you crazy wop
we see the room is in disarray from packing up cartons of boxes and equipment
the workers have taken a break from the packing as they watch the t
the station manager murray enters anxiously
we have to be completely relocated to the new jersey station before our broadcast
reading from list okay caiman devoe and animal youre on the helicopter
everyone else well see you in jersey
gotta go honey
you guys gonna be all right
audreys going to stay with us tonight
see ya then
animal hurries out after him
audrey and lucy go back to packing
audrey looks up at the t
just as they replay the footage of nick and elsie being led into the command tent
filtered military and government health officials set up a command post on the new jersey coast this afternoon
surprised at first audrey suddenly becomes very excited
she sees caiman exiting the studio at the end of the hall
she rushes over to him
take me with you
ive got something on this
i know a guy on the inside with the military
you got my bag
audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the elevator
you dont understand i can get us information
listen this is the time when the big boys have to go to work okay honey
with that caiman walks into the elevator
pissed audrey just stares at him
audrey throws the bag at him knocking him backwards as the elevator doors close
lucy walks over
come on girl weve gotta go
lucy and audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos that has taken over the city
hundreds of people trying to leave at once
as they move into an overcrowded subway entrance audrey looks up just in time to see the wnew news helicopter lifting off from the building behind them
we see the destroyed parts of downtown manhattan
police barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the fires
in what city officials are calling the worst act of destruction since the world trade tower bombing
caiman stares earnestly at his video camera
police and the national guard have quarantined off over twenty square city blocks
below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of the city
police and national guardsmen guide the traffic
hundreds of thousands have jammed the streets in the largest evacuation in the history of the city
and many people are not happy about it
quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier
i dont understand why we have to leave our homes
its over already isnt it
what are we running from
a big lizard
ive got cockroaches in my building that could kick the crap out of it
near chaos as police and national guardsmen attempt to bring order to the hundreds of honking screaming motorists
dozens of armed officers pile out of the van
maintaining blockades in front of their military vehicles
the evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction area ahead
police block the street smoldering buildings behind them
the detour only makes things worse
several national guardsmen walk up to the city bank building where they find an enormous hole smashed into the side of the building
the guardsmen peek inside
we see through the building to a hold on the other side
godzilla apparently walked right through
the guardsmen are visibly shaken
way beyond capacity the flooded subway platform bursts with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains
caught in the craziness we find audrey and lucy trying desperately to get on board
please dont push
people are getting shoved down onto the tracks and the trains cant leave
the last to fit inside lucy and audrey cram in just as the doors shut behind them
people left behind bang on the closed doors as the subway pulls out
a gigantic traffic back up all the way down the westside highway
the bridge is a veritable parking lot
well this is great
with his close aides in tow the mayor stares at the melee below
if were wrong on this evacuation theyll string me up from the liberty torch
the mayors helicopter sails over the george washington bridge and over to a small landing pad near the command center
a large group of people dressed in business suits await the helicopter
just as the helicopter is landing the crowd moves toward the chopper
who the hell are they
its a contingent of building owners and community business representatives
i dont have time for this nonsense
most of them are campaign contributors
well thats a different story
as the mayor steps out hes greeted by a nervous crowd of people shouting how long do we have to shut our business down
will the city cover the damages
among them donald trump tries to get the mayors attention
i share your concerns
i want to get the city back in business as soon as possible
as he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly into
who waits for the mayor
the mayor is momentarily stopped
handing his card chargures insurance
we represent nearly thirteen percent of the buildings in your city
if youll excuse me
we are very happy that you are in control of this situation
with that he gently pats the mayor on the back leaving a small nearly undetectable device on the mayors collar
you can count on our emotional and financial support
oh well thank you very much
briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through the crowd
raymond watches him pass seeing the device stuck to the mayors collar
rushing over from the parked news chopper animal and caiman race for the mayor who walks through a mob of reporters
hurry were going to miss the mayor
but before he can get close two police officers stop them
sorry you gotta have a press id past this point
dont you watch t
can we see your press pass sir
flustered caiman searches his pockets for his press pass
i had one here on my bag
where the hell did i put it
we see caimans plastic smile on his press id
suddenly audreys picture is placed on top of caimans
smashed together like sardines audrey plays with caimans press pass trying to put her photo over his
what the hell are you doing
remember my friend we saw on t
your old sweetheart
yeah well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post
somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama
theres a story here
i know it
you got any tape or glue
i left my forgery kit back at the office
audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding his backpack a ruler sticking out of the back
hey do you have any glue in your bag
whats it to you
can i use some
what do i get
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man
youre kidding right
the kid simply puts his hand out
people flood off the train out into the station
please exit the station
for those of you without accommodations the city has opened up shelters on monroe and th and at bergenline and nd
please exit the
audrey and lucy walk through the crowd
audrey turns and gives lucy a kiss
wish me luck
audrey i dont think this is a very good idea
caiman finds out and hell have your job
im tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity luce
if theres a story here im going to find it
lucy nods in acceptance as audrey disappears into the dense crowd
lucy worries for her friend
carried along with a styrofoam cup of coffee
we widen to reveal a man carrying the junk food to a grey van parked not too far from the command center tent across the way
the man knocks on the back of the van
the van opens to reveal
filled with high tech monitoring equipment raymond and his men are listening in to a conversation
the man with junk food hands it to raymond
he opens the bag and takes out a croissant
he bites into it and grimaces
to wash away the taste he drinks from the coffee
its worse than the croissant
you call this coffee
french accent i call this america
the man takes a seat near raymond as raymond turns up the volume on his headset
mid argument youre telling me that in an election month ive evacuated the entire city for nothing
from behind the mayors head we see the monitoring device attracted to his collar
as he speaks we widen to do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city
representatives of all branches of the military national guard and the mayors office are here
the room overflows with people
nick elsie and the scientist stand near the back of the tent
were been monitoring the waters around the island
as far as we can tell it hasnt left the area
but you dont know for sure
we think theres a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area
but you dont know for sure just then sergeant oneal enters hurriedly
he wants to speak but waits for the opportunity
controlling his temper mr
mayor if hes not in one of those buildings then we give the all clear
but not until weve checked each building
sir that may be more difficult than we originally projected
more good news
weve run into a problem
we crane down to reveal several military sedans pulling up into flat iron square where broadway meets th
sergeant oneal leads the team out of the cars and down a subway entrance
marching down the stairs the team enters into the very large subway station
for all we see it seems like a normal subway station except for the fact that every one of the team members look astonished
anderson and his men found this late this afternoon
the camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we suddenly see what the team is staring at
the four normal subway tunnels have been carved out making one gigantic tunnel
debris and crumbled brick are everywhere
several soldiers with flashlights approach the hole
anderson moves over to the astonished group
some of the scientists fan out examining the area
we were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone
we see that not only is the ceiling gone but the building above is hollowed and torn to shreds
another hole in the building leads to the street
when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone
how many tunnels lead off the island
only five sir
weve checked them all
he hasnt used any of them
have them sealed off
and how should we do that sir
fill them with cement brick them up put land mines in them bombs i dont know just make sure that goddamned thing doesnt leave the island
as the soldiers slowly move down deeper into the tunnels their flashlight beams scan the area
could they stumble onto something dangerous
as he approaches major hicks and sergeant oneal
you know hes not an enemy trying to evade you
hes just an animal
what are you suggesting
when i needed to catch earthworms i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them
i had to draw them out
still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant
nick moves to the edge of the platform looking off into the dark tunnel
all we need to do is find out what it wants what it needs and hell come to us
the lead soldier sees something
cautiously he moves forward thinking hes onto something
we hear something moving in the darkness
we follow his beam as the noise grows clearer
the beam falls onto something on the floor
flopping on the ground is a large fish
as the beam moves farther along we see two no three fish ahead
a battalion of armored tanks roll down this deserted city street
a large number of ground troops march behind
banking in formation the helicopters swerve heading towards mid town manhattan
soldiers pile up sand bags creating a make shift fortification
sharp shooters and a bazooka brigade settle into place
major hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio
major hicks sits by a bank of communications technicians
where are they now
delta niner what is convoy position
led by armored military vehicles we see a convoy of twenty yellow dump trucks passing over the bridge
command were just entering the city
sergeant oneal listens to the response on the radio
convoy eta five minutes
the sergeant signals several military technicians who are mounting several video cameras to hurry
a buzz of activity
military officials and personnel
the mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the room
whispering to aide they find anything yet
the aide shakes his head
monitors come to life with a live video feed from several cameras we saw mounted
in blue overalls the repairman walks up to a large satellite dish
we widen to reveal the dish is parked next to the command tent
he kneels down next to some cables leading away from the dish toward the command tent
suddenly all the screens fuzz out
just as quickly the monitors return to normal
no one seems to notice
the repairman finishes affixing a small device to the cable
he taps his earpiece and speaks into his own lapel
french accent it is good
we see raymond and his men have turned this dingy motel room into a command central of their own
raymond is putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors turn on
they are seeing the same video feed as the mayor
pleased he takes a sip
you said this was french roast
his aid turns holding a package labeled french roast
defeated more cream
his associate hands him some milk
he adds it to the coffee
no use it still sucks
on the monitors we see the dump trucks entering flat iron square
the dump trucks arrive and the soldiers guide the trucks forming a circle their tails facing each other
as the last one passes it reveals nick and sergeant oneal
i sure hope your plan works
im kind of hoping the same thing
the twenty of them in concert begin to dump their cargo
tons and tons of fish are dumped directly on top of us
on the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish get dumped into a large pile in the center of flat iron square
leaning forward very clever
have been piled into the center of flat iron square
thats a lot of fish
a master of the obvious
sergeant oneal shoots him a glare and moves over to the men
together they march into a building at the edge of the square
loading up rifles taking positions
gas masks being handed out down a long line for all the soldiers
the tanks move into their final positions
the national guardsmen and soldiers supporting the tanks take positions
entering from the stairs out onto the roof sergeant oneal and his men take positions observing from above
everyone is waiting
the silence is deafening
as everyone waits nick scans the area thinking
suddenly something catches his eye
through a steam vent in the streets
nick sees steam lifting into the air
he notices several other vents doing the same thing around the square
quickly nick rushes over to a young officer
i need your radio
the young officer leads nick over to his jeep
nick grabs the receiver
sergeant oneal the subway vents
we have to shut them down
oneal listens to nick on his radio
filtered with the air pressure pushing up hell never smell the bait
turning to soldier get some men down into those air vents
shut em down
with a loud whine we hear the vents shutting down
the large whirling fan blades slow to a stop
one by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the vents are turned off
there is a long tense moment of waiting
when will it come
will it come
before the young officer can stop him nick rushes over to a manhole cover in the center of the street
the cover is to heavy
he yells back
we need to open all the manhole covers in the area
let the scent waft down
the young officer signals other soldiers
nick steps back and lets the soldiers go to work
as he walks back he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection down a side street
he runs over to it
a particularly heavy one in the center of this intersection a block away from flat iron square nick alone wrestles to remove it
with all his might he drags it clear
suddenly through the hole he hears some strange noises from below
rattled he slowly backs away from the hole
the noises grow increasingly louder
then with a deafening roar the ground behind nick erupts and godzilla rises ripping up the boulevard as he does
nick spins only to find himself face to face with the gigantic creature
godzillas head slopes down apparently looking nick in the eye
all around foot soldiers appear guns trained shoulder hoisted rocket launchers prepared
out of the corner of his eye nick sees all this
he gently signals with his hands that they should not fire
sensing no danger from nick godzilla simply steps over nick
as the gargantuan creature walks over us making a beeline for the fish
nick turns and runs following him
godzilla moves into the square
the military hunkers down ready to strike
cautiously the beast moves over to the mountain of fish
major hicks watches the monitors as godzilla approaches the fish
commence phase one
lets gas it
everyone on the rooftop puts on their gas masks
let em fly
all the soldiers put on their gas masks
a team of eight pull out a gas canisters and yank the releases
they drop them down the long barrels of air cannons preparing to fire
nick runs past the fortification trying to get a closer look
the young officer yells after him
wherere you going
nick stops briefly as the young officer tosses a gas mask to nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a closer spot
suddenly sailing over his head we see
firing from the air cannons the gas canisters streak across the sky landing behind godzilla
the yellow gas forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards
across the way eight more canisters are fired at the beast
quickly godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes
frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke he dashes forward over to a large bronze statue
the smoke annoying and distracting him godzilla spins his tail waving the smoke away
but the smoke returns
godzilla yells out
frustrated he rears back and for the first time we see the infamous power breath of godzilla
with amazing force the smoke canisters cars and anything that isnt nailed down sails backwards from the intense pressure
nick is hit by the wave of air pressure and is sent flying backwards impossibly high in the air
an enormous fabric banner advertising this season at the met catches nick who slides down the banner hitting the ground hard
just as he looks up he sees
tumbling toward him from the power breath
nick scrambles to his feet just in time as the rolling truck smashes into the building behind where he just sat
the troops have to scatter as the tumbling trucks and cars are flung at them disabling their attack forces
trucks and rocket launches are crushed by the tumbling debris
godzilla continues to blow at everything around him
cars and trucks rolling
soldiers diving for cover
the glass in all the surrounding buildings shatter shards of glass raining down
windows street lamps all blown out by the tremendous gale force winds
on the monitors we see the melee
fire at will
fire at will
fire at will
from all angles soldiers rush back to their equipment and attempt to fire
very few are able to get off rounds
oneal tries to steady himself as the soldiers fire down at the creature below
one hoists a missile launcher
as the firepower begins around godzilla he takes a hit in the shoulder and screams out
suddenly he leaps away just as several missles hit the flat iron building behind where godzilla was standing only moments earlier
dashing down a side street godzilla leaps over the waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time
several tanks are squashed as the beast bull dozes right through the regiment
we see the flat iron building crumbling on one of the monitors near major hicks
in the rear of the room the mayor looks sick
soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and debris
only the smoldering devastation is left behind
the monitors only show static or devastation
into radio oneal what the hell is going on there
quickly his men are packing up
into radio hes gone sir
echo divisions in pursuit
four armored military vehicles come skidding around the corner in hot pursuit
each with a team manning enormous mounted weaponry
galloping like a gisele uptown godzilla is speeding up the boulevard
the armored vehicles open fire
some shots clip into godzillas back
ahead he is running directly into
blocking off the street in front of him
pinned down the creature screams and ducks away down another side street
the missiles cant turn fast enough and slam into a building demolishing it
the window is smashed in
a small group of looters are loading up their mini van
finishing up the group is about to leave
jimmy lets go
i want this
the group rejoins jimmy as they try to pull an enormous pin ball machine from the window
as they carry the machine back towards the mini van
godzillas enormous foot flattens the mini van like a pancake
the looters go pale
as the military armored vehicles race by in hot pursuit
godzilla bounds onto broadway and freezes looking around
as he looks downtown he sees
skidding around the corner a few blocks back the armored vehicles reappear
godzilla turns uptown and bolts
as he gets up to full speed
a team of four cobra helicopters swoops down heading directly for godzilla
the mayor stands over a radio technician
filtered we have him locked on
then fire damn it
godzilla runs into the famous lighted square looking remarkably like tokyo just as the cobras come sweeping down out of the sky
godzilla spots them and leaps away just as they fire missiles which rip into the famous jumbo tron video billboard demolishing the building
the cobras swerve quickly pursuing godzilla down a side street
godzilla appears turning the corner and racing down the street
from behind the cobra helicopters come screaming down on him they fire rockets at godzilla who again deftly turns a corner
the errant rockets blast into the chrysler building as they attempt to follow him but fail
shards of glass come raining down as the building crumbles
as they race around the corner they slam on the breaks just as the familier cone of the chrysler building comes just inches in front of the vehicles tumbling into
the static increases over the radio
filtered that is a negative impact
the mayor in the back of the room stands furious
its the goddamned chrysler building thats what it is
his aides try to calm him
into radio you said he was locked on
moving through the narrow side street
the heat seekers cant lock
hes colder than the buildings around him
the four cobra helicopters zoom around the corner and into th avenue
godzilla is ahead of us
the choppers fire again this time using their gun turrets accelerating toward the beast
under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on top of him godzilla dives into an office building
the helicopters surround the crumbling building and open fire decimating it
they stop firing and stare into the smoldering mess theyve made
i think we got him
just then erupting out of a building behind them
pounces out of the building snapping up two of the helicopters in one bite he whirls around and swipes another out of the air with his enormous claw
the clawed helicopter slams into the ground just as
come sliding around the corner directly into the crashing helicopter which explodes on impact
the entire team is taken out with the concussion
major hicks is on his feet steaming mad
into radio echo four where is he
as the remaining cobra helicopter swerves around godzilla is gone
i dont know sir
he just vanished
as the helicopter passes a dark building we see a shape move
we realize that like a chameleon godzilla had taken the color of the building and hid
with the helicopter past him he chases from the rear
realizing oh jesus
the chopper guns it full throttle
godzilla gives chase
even at its top speed it cant out run the big creature
the chopper tries to lift away but before he can get the height godzilla snaps his gigantic jaws and the fires burn and the rubble crumbles
godzilla gives one final scream and dives into a building disappearing
the majors aide try to hold him back as the mayor is charging at major hicks
what the hell is the matter with you people
you caused more damage than that thing did
empty and devastated
fires continue to burn
nick sergeant oneal and several of his men walk through the devastated area
nick kneels down and there is a large reddish brown puddle of blood
nick takes out a small glass container and scoops some up
i cant believe it
he did all this and we did nothing to him
nick walks over to him consoling
thats not true
we fed him
only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of fish once was
our team stands there amidst the rubble
a network news anchor speaks directly at us as a video of the chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind him
while it may have looked like beirut it was in fact manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute force
the video switches to the white house where we see the president signing a bill
the president today declared a state of emergency and has issued disaster relief funds to new york city
we see that weve been watching the video on one of many video monitors showing all the news broadcasts
as an assistant moves away from the monitors we follow him out of the truck
we continue to follow the assistant outside revealing the enormous mob of reporters that have gathered just outside the military command tents
as we follow the assistant he passes several reporters doing stand up reports
rumors continue to mount as to the origin of this perhaps lost dinosaur
having shut down the united nations in the evacuation foreign diplomats are demanding an international coalition be assembled to track the creature
the assistant finally arrives at caiman who is doing a live remote
animal works the camera
maintaining a total media blackout officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature
behind him in the crowd we see audrey pushing her way through the reporters her fake id pinned on her shirt
she turns and sees caiman
quickly she ducks down and moves deeper into the crowds
suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up nearby
audrey pushes her way to see whats happening
the cars are blocked from returning to the command tents as the reporters mob the first car in line
nick observes the chaos
through the crowd he sees a pharmacy a neon sign reading never closes
he looks back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and gets an idea
to the driver its okay ill get out here
he opens the car door and pushes his way through the crowds who are less interested in him as they are the military officials
pushing his way through nick sees what a circus this has become t
news camera crews journalists concerned citizens worried mothers and of course merchandising
nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys copies of animals now famous news video clip and of course tee shirts with still images from that same clip
through the dense crowd audrey sees nick in the distance
excited she starts to push her way through
ringing the night bell nick calls for the pharmacist who enters weary eyed
can i help you young man
do you have any home pregnancy tests
especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate
this is all weve got
the pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off the shelf home pregnancy tests
ill take them all
you must have quite some harem
nick spins to find audrey standing right behind him
embarrassed nick awkwardly pays for the tests
is that you
you look wow uh howve you been
its good to see you nick
the pharmacist puts out nicks change
he scoops it out and we follow them as they exit together
so you made it
he points to her fake press id shes still wearing
youre a reporter
thats what you always wanted to be right
im happy for you
really i am
nick opens the door for audrey and follows her out
so you still picking apart cockroaches
no im into earthworms now
you wouldnt be interested
theyre real boring creatures
very reliable dependable no surprises
youre still mad at me arent you
you just left me without a phone call a letter nothing
all this time
yeah i guess im still a little mad
that was eight years ago
some people change you know
most people dont
im sorry you feel that way
audrey turns and walks away
nick regrets his behavior and calls after her
eight years is a long time
can i offer you a cup of tea
id like that
theres an awkward moment as neither knows what to say
one thing though
whod you get pregnant
off nicks awkward reaction
nick has set up a mini lab in his private small tent
the home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart
nick mixes some of the contents together
i still cant believe it
how does a guy go from an anti nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission
when you and i use to attend rallies in college we helped to create awareness
but from the inside now i can actually effect change
pointedly i never lost my idealism
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect
i have this theory that were inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what weve done to nature
and you think this creature is one of them
the first of its kind
i found this blood sample earlier this evening
how close did you get to that thing
i got pretty close
what else do you know about it
nick finishes his concoction adding the blood sample into it he takes the piece of litmus paper from one of the home test boxes and dips it in
well we know he eats fish hes of reptile genus hes a burrower hes amphibious and
nick points out the litmus paper
it turns red
hes pregnant are you sure
nick gets up and starts to gather his materials
thrilled well obviously these tests werent designed for this but fundamentally theyre looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy
i dont get it
if its the first of its kind how can it be pregnant
excitedly nick begins to pace
the ultimate expression of evolution it reproduces asexually
think about it all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction
thats why he came to new york
like every species of insufficient progenitors hes nesting
do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time
nick moves to the front exit of the tent
forgive me but ive got to get this into the lab to confirm all this
ill be right back
nick rushes from the tent
alone audrey cant help but poke around a bit
she opens one of his cases
taped to the roof of the case she sees
happy times long ago
theyre both young and in love
audrey is surprised nick still keeps them
feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back down
as she does she notices a video tape labeled first sighting
unable to resist she puts it in and turns on the t
the shot of the japanese cook appears
filtered through t
she hits the fast forward tape and sees the enormous footprints in panama
she fast forwards again and sees the beached cargo ship in jamaica
audrey is torn
she makes a decision pops the tape back out puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the tent
moments later nick returns from the front
a flash of lighting and thunder accents nicks confusion
on two monitors we see audrey doing a stand up
filtered which is why in this case all the kings horses and all the kings men may not be able to put the big apple together again
audrey timmons wnew
we pull back to reveal audrey animal and an editor ed watching the piece
you owe me a breakfast
turning to animal so what do you think
its a real good piece
but howd you get a hold of this material
audrey covers her own mixed emotions
like you said good guys finish last
she snatches the tape and she takes off running
concerned and worried animal watches her leave
rushing out of the wnew truck and into the rain audrey spots her station manager murray
in the b
we see caiman getting make up about to do a live spot with another cameraman
murray i need you to look at this tape
not now audrey weve about to go live with the morning report
youre going to want to include this
ive got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked
suddenly interested you do
whos story is this
about to go on caiman waves off his make up artist as he watches audrey hand murray the tape
his field producer counts down to going live
through the lenses we see exiting his tent and moving on towards the large center command tent
we reverse to reveal
one of raymonds men observes with binoculars from the window
tucking his napkin into his lapel raymond eats breakfast with his men
another man jean claude listens at the monitoring equipment
he turns to raymond
he turns on the room speaker
filtered major hicks what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work
nick is moving to take his seat next to elise at this very crowded conference
the big wigs are here and the room is packed
major hicks walks to a large map of manhattan
general anderson the problem was the terrain
if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park
points to the map we should be able to take him down
last time you didnt even scratch it
thats not true
our worm guy er i mean dr
tatopoulos found blood
all eyes turn towards nick whos still arranging his papers
nervously nick addresses the crowd
clearly he was injured and bled
you see all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that dont rely on heat seeking
um excuse me sir but the situations more complicated than that
the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has
are you trying to tell us theres another one of those things out there
i dont believe so
then how can it be pregnant
what is this the virgin lizard
theres a smattering of laughter in the room
no it reproduces asexually
thats why we must find the nest
if we dont dozens will be born each one capable of laying eggs of its own
very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population
so after we kill the creature well begin a search for the nest
it may be too late by then
these eggs will hatch very quickly
how could you possible know that
the fish we found down in the subway
hes not gathering all that food for himself
hes preparing to feed his young
raymond listens intently
he grabs a folder off the desk and opens it
we see photos and documents of every member of the team
he finds the photo of nick and examines it
audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join ed and animal at a booth
they just promo ed your spot
its coming on right after this
an aide comes in and whispers something into the governors ear who nods approval
tatopoulos is right we must act quickly before this problem escalates
you want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory
hes come through for us before and if he feels strongly
come through for you
major your campaigns a disaster
you werent even able to to prevent this thing from coming to manhattan
excuse me gentlemen but i think we should see this
the aide moves over to a television and turns it on
just as the t
comes to life we see the old japanese cook
how the hell did this get out
the image of the cook saying gojira freezes and cuts back to reveal caiman doing his stand up
filtered from an old japanese sailors song called a mythological sea dragon who attacked sailors to our own modern day terror
today in my special report who is this godzilla where did he come from and why is he here
audrey is furious on her feet
youre special report
im the one that found that stupid song
thats my special report you bastard
animal tries to calm her down as the story continues
and its gojira not godzilla you moron
fiddling with the motel t
raymonds men attempt to clear the fuzzy picture
finally the picture clears
filtered a path can be traced back from manhattan to jamaica back to panama and all the way back to the french polynesians where nuclear testing has been going on
for over twenty years
everyone stares at the television
major hicks burns with embarrassment
filtered but why
research team member dr
niko padopolus believes the creature is nesting using manhattan as ground zero to cultivate his species
you went to the press with this
no i didnt
i didnt talk with anyone
the military men are furious at the breach of security
all eyes turn toward nick
they mentioned you by name
you gave them the tape
no its still in my tent
oh my god she took it
pissed general anderson walks up to nick
pack your stuff
youre officially off this project as of now
caiman is still on television wrapping up
he stole my report
thats my report
we know audrey
filtered and in this reporters opinion all the kings horses and all the kings men
audrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t
caiman you suck
the television is snapped off and raymond walks over to the window looking out thinking
more suitcases and trunks
widen to reveal
nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his things away
im sorry about all this
nick hoists his bag and moves to leave
make sure they find that nest before its too late
reluctantly nick nods acceptance and exits out into the rain
we see the torn photographs of nick and audrey laying on the floor
bye worm guy
audrey in a street phone booth
what do you mean murrays not there
a second ago you told me he was on the other line
something catches audreys eye
lugging his bags out into the rain nick moves over to a waiting cab
lifting a heavy case nick places it into the cabs trunk
audrey moves up behind nick
nick ignores her and continues to load the cab
is this cause of me
because of the story
well what the hell did you think was going to happen
you never said it was off the record
i shouldnt have to audrey
youre supposed to be my friend
i trusted you
i didnt mean for it to turn out like this
confessing look i lied to you
im not a reporter
when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure id make it
but i havent
thats why i needed this story so bad
i just couldnt tell you im a failure
so you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes
the last bag stowed nick moves to get into the cab
he stops and turns back to her
good luck in your new career
i think you really have what it takes
he gets in and slams the door
the cab takes off leaving a very alone audrey standing in the rain
sad to herself im sorry
long waiting lines for people trying to leave town
people sleeping on the floors
one group gathered around a television set
we see images from crowed refugee shelters
filtered every shelter in the tri state area has been overflowing with displaced people
tent cities have begun to spring up all over the county
as we track away from the t
we find nick taking a seat at a small bar next to the gate
a waiter comes over
can i get you something
before nick can answer
pernot no ice
taking a seat directly across from nick raymond sits down sizing him up
nick is confused
do i know you
weve met before
remembering oh yeah the insurance guy
raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in front of nick
sdece service de documentation exterieure et de contre espionnage
agent phillip raymond
sounds like a big company
its the french secret service
we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creatures nest
alarmed are you sure
how do you know
why are you telling this to me
i need you to trust me
why do you need that
i need your trust if youre to help me find the nest
oh my bags
ive checked them in
we have already taken care of them
nick realizes raymond is serious
the waiter hands raymond his drink
raymond toasts nick
a makeshift tent city has been set up in the park
animal video tapes an interview with a displaced person
no one tells us a goddamned thing
my family is getting soaked out here
we have no place else to go
we just want to go back to our home
animal begins to pan his camera around the tent city when he sees a sedan in the distance
he focus in on it and sees
coming to stop at a light
animal quickly lowers his camera and hands it off to the reporter hes working with
ill be right back
animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after them following
pulling up in front of a warehouse nick and raymond step out of the sedan
staying hidden from view animal pulls over
intrigued he watches them enter the building
raymond enters with nick
the room is filled with equipment radios guns explosives and armored vehicles
we notice that more of raymonds support team are here
how did you get all of this stuff into the country
this is america
there is nothing you can not buy
raymond gives nick a tour
so why all the secrecy
why arent you guys working with the us military
i am not permitted to speak of such things
nick stops and confronts raymond
you said you wanted my trust then i need yours
raymond considers this
i am a patriot
i love my country
can you understand that
it is my job to protect my country
sometimes i must even protect it from itself
from mistakes we have made
mistakes that we do not want the world to know about
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific
this testing done by my country left a terrible mess
we are here to clean it up
moving down alongside the building animal walks down the side alley
he climbs up onto a garbage hamper and peers into a cracked opened window
animal sees nick and raymond with all the hardware
several of the men are repainting the vehicles to resemble those of the us army
nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools
jean claude turns from the radios
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten
that is when we will go in
raymond leads nick over to a large map
we know how to get into the city
we just do not know where to start looking
nick moves closer to the map putting his finger on the flat iron square subway station
rd street subway station
where we first found the fish
with a little luck this will lead us right to it
so youre in
are you kidding
i always wanted to join the french foreign legion
animal quickly climbs the stairs
people are everywhere
he has to step over them to get to his apartment
as he opens the door to his apartment he sees
filled with people lucy is serving coffee
she smiles at animal as he enters
who the hell are all these people
i just couldnt just let them sleep in the street
in the bedroom
crying her eyes out because of you
all that you gotta be vicious stuff you filled her head with
you where the one
go in there
talk to her
lucy pushes animal towards the back bedroom
audrey has been crying
crumpled kleenex wads piled up all around her
a television plays a news broadcast boasting the headline they call him on the t
we see a news conference with general anderson addressing some reporters
simultaneously can you comment on the nest
how many more of these things will there be
filtered thats why im holding this conference
to try and avoid a needless panic
animal enters and watches from the back of the room
contrary to some frivolous reports we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city
its all my fault
what have i done animal
what have i become
look at me
this isnt me
i dont do things like this
you made a mistake
suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of the room
animal looks at the stranger as he leaves
yeah i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me
didnt you tell me he left for the airport
why are you asking
i just saw him
hes with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight
audrey tries to make sense of this
suddenly she realizes
hes going after the nest
you wanted a story well baby you got one
excitedly animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big overcoat
animal i cant
look you want to make it up to your friend
well if hes right this is your chance
he starts going through his drawers taking out battery packs tapes etc and putting it in his pockets
misgivings i dont know
ive already made such a mess of things
animal walks up to the door ready to exit
smiling audrey im going after them
you can come with me or not
conflicted audrey is not sure what to do
animal opens the bedroom window and begins to climb out
what are you doing
lucyd kill me if she knew
nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a military uniform
as he moves into the room we see all of raymonds men dressed similarly
as they climb into their vehicles raymond hands each a stick of chewing gum
nick gets in the passenger seat of one of the vehicles raymond climbs in behind the wheel
whats with the chewing gum
makes us look more american
nick looks over at the faux americans
its a tough sell gum or not
just let me do all the talking
with that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out into the rainy night
an armed blockage seals the jersey entrance to the lincoln tunnel
we widen to reveal audrey and animal by a small side entrance
animal works the lock
what are you doing
its the maintenance entrance
runs along the side of the tunnel
when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it
just then the lock turns and the door opens
a line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes through a guarded entrance each vehicle checked
nick and raymonds humvee nears
raymonds humvee rolls up and a guard walks up to the window
checking clipboard who you boys with
oh were with the three two
i didnt ask you soldier
sergeant oneal just called down for us to join in
now hes suspicious
the guard approaches raymond checks him out
you got a problem talkin
perfect southern accent why no sir im fine
the guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule
finally he waves him through
all right keep it moving
ala presley thank you very much
they drive off
nick is stunned by the act
elvis presley movies
by way of explanation he was the king
the door creeps open
animal leans out to find the tunnel deserted
he and audrey step out and into the tunnel
we follow them as they are headed for the exit of the tunnel into manhattan
raymond and nick drive through central park
we can see dozens of military people and vehicles in a large meadow
the enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the center of the field as many others are planting land mines
tanks rockets and soldiers align the area
the convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but raymond and his men keep going straight
they drive slowly right past the trap sight and out of the park
doors slam and immediately boots march past
we widen to reveal raymonds team quickly gathering their gear and heading down the subway entrance
raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to nick who nearly topples from the weight
be careful with that
nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked explosives
shocked he looks back at raymond but hes gone
nick regains his breath and follows
older and nastier but the same fish we saw in the tunnel before
we follow the beam to its owner and find nick
we widen to reveal that were
the crisscrossing beams from the assault teams flashlights nearly blind us as nick leads the team cautiously into the depth of this tunnel
periodic fish are found along the way
suddenly the faint humming sound in the tunnel stops
everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction
a familiar smell passes over them as they sniff the air
theyve turned off the ventilation system
theyre calling him to dinner
lets hope we are not the hors doeuvres
nervously they continue onward
animal and audrey arrive spotting the assault teams vehicles
they head carefully down the stairs
audrey and animal camera in hand shooting everything climb down into the station
animal rushes to the end of the platform and searches down into the tunnels
through the camera we see the lights in the distance of the tunnel
whispering theyre down there
animal jumps off the platform down onto whats left of the tracks
audrey squeamishly follows
nick kneels down to inspect some debris
an old screeching sound is heard in the distance
suddenly the ground begins to quake
the screeching gets louder and louder
raymond moves up to nick and points ahead
nick nods in nervous agreement
just as they move towards the sounds the entire wall of the tunnel collapses next to them
bursting through the tunnel wall godzilla appears
his enormous claws burrowing he makes his way through and into the tunnel
quickly he moves past the team
the team dives into a cross tunnel just as the colossal beast blasts past them barely missing them
audrey and animal have just gotten into the tunnel entrance
the entire place is shaking
audrey is in a panic
animal lets get out of here
but animal hoists his camera and starts filming as something is moving towards them
audrey is tugging at him as the shaking gets more violent
with all her strength she finally gets animal to start moving backwards
just as theyre out of the tunnel the creature blasts outward
audrey and animal dive into the maintenance ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision
animal is shielding audrey with his body
she looks up just in time to see godzilla crawling up and out through the ceiling
an amazing site
animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it disappearing from view
once gone they both break into enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter
recovering raymond and the team walk back into the main tunnel
they near the hole godzilla just created examining it
nick climbs into the hole
i guess we go this way
raymond and his men follow
major hicks is at the radio as the generals sit behind him
into radio sergeant status
the park is bathed in light
armed troops surround the area
tanks and missile launchers are in place
sergeant oneal kneels down by a sandbag fortification
into radio any sign of it
from the rooftop of one of the central park south high rises a team of spotters scan the area
moving steadily towards central park godzilla makes his way up seventh avenue
section heading north to target
the sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters take off running taking positions
the tanks turn their gun turrets towards downtown expectantly
missile launchers turn arming devices locked
major hicks stands near a computerized schematic of manhattan
a large red flashing blip nears central park
godzilla moves up th ave
he reaches central park south and stops
he glances over to the park where bright lights are glaring
something is making godzilla more cautious this time
unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying within the shelter of the tall buildings
into radio dont fire until hes cleared the buildings and has moved into the park
still unsure he roars out frustrated with his own indecision
come on come on
nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel created by godzilla
climbing over the debris they make their way to another opening
we follow them as they clamber through the hole and into
the largest subway rail station in new york
godzilla has torn it to shreds
we get the feeling this is where godzilla has spent most of his time
scattered fish abound
high above there is a immense black hole in the tall ceiling
wherever it leads to is very dark
nick and raymond stare at the hole together
what is up there
climbing the stairs out from the subway nick et all walk up onto the street to see
the team cautiously approaches the building
carefully moving out from between the buildings godzilla takes a step into central park
into radio prepare to fire
guns are cocked locked on and hoisted
suddenly godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around
the red blip suddenly begins to move away from the park
into radio damn it
shoot it before it gets away
fire at will
fire at will
all the weapons surround the area fire at once
several more cobra helicopters zoom down out of nowhere
plunging downward they fire at godzilla
the firepower ripping up everything around him godzilla roars and deftly dives out of the park and back between the buildings
but as he bounds over to th street there is a contingency of mobile rocket launchers waiting
godzilla dodges and the rockets as godzilla races by
with the helicopters right on his tail godzilla makes a westward run across th street
smashing parked vehicles and his tail swiping buildings as it dashes
godzilla is heading straight for it the helicopters shooting from the air
suddenly godzilla leaps higher than weve seen before
he hurls himself over the west side highway and splashes down into the hudson river vanishing beneath the waters surface
furious major hicks throws his headset against the console violently
admiral johnston leans down into frame
the navy has a little something there waiting for him
in the murky waters of the hudson river
the alarm klaxons are ringing out as everyone rushes to battle stations
the captain moves over to a sonar screen a large mass nearby blips on the screen
into radio weve got him on sonar
arizona closing in
different monitors have put up a three dimensional schematic of the hudson river
we see outlines of the three nuclear subs approaching their target
filtered indiana closing in
calvin coolidge closing in
the doors are pried open
its very dark in here only the assault teams flashlights illuminate
as they enter the lobby the team splits up into different search groups
nick raymond and jean claude move down the large front lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding the main auditorium
cautiously they move towards us
in the distance we see the rest of the team moving the other direction
raymond and nick arrive at a door leading to the main auditorium
nick is about to push the door open when raymond stops him
on command jean claude snaps together his automatic rifle as raymond pulls out his semi automatic pistol
he nods okay to nick who slowly opens the door
as the door opens a small pile of fish tumbles down over their feet
they step over the fish and enter
nick raymond and jean claude cautiously step over the fish inside
only their flashlight beams can be seen
his beam cruises over the area nearby
its been gutted
fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere
suddenly nick spots a strange cluster of objects
he moves closer
with their combined light we can a pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are
raymond walks behind the egg illuminating it from the other side making it partially translucent
we can see the embryo inside the egg and three eggs
i thought there would be more
you were right
slowly nick turns and sees what jean claude is staring at open jawed
together their beams of light scan across the main auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover dozens of eggs piled in clumps everywhere
that cant be
thats got to be over twenty eggs
another of raymonds men r man has found a switchboard he examines the switches
animal and audrey are wandering through the debris
okay whered they go from here
r man locates the switch hes looking for and hits it
nick raymond and jean claude are stunned as the work lights suddenly turn on illuminating the room revealing
all over the main auditorium floor
a stunning tableau
nick is speechless
raymond turns to him
the light filters down from the gaping hole in the ceiling
they must have climbed all the way up into there
together they notice some large metal piping that has fallen from the auditorium
they move over to it and begin to climb
the arizona races past us
we follow a runner who hands a report to the admiral who is conferring with the general and major hicks by the schematic
the admiral reads the report
theyve surrounded the target just at the mouth of the hudson river
he swims at enormous speed heading directly at the arizona
the lights dim as they prepare for battle
are we locked on
locked on captain
the torpedo is fired and comes darting directly at godzilla who abruptly swerves
the torpedo however follows him
from the other direction closing in
godzilla dives skidding close to the bottom
the torpedo begins to close the gap
suddenly godzilla shoots upwards heading directly for the underside of the calvin coolidge
the calvins captain rushes over to the sonar screens
hes shifted course
hes heading right at us
godzilla rams the underside of the calvin coolidge before she can turn
the entire sub spins twisting over its side and colliding directly with
slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear submarine
with a concussion the sub explodes
an enormous spray of water erupts from the river bubbles and debris float to the surface
the computerized representation of the calvin coolidge vanishes off the monitor
weve lost the coolidge sir
the admiral burns
the blip representing godzilla turns
hes shifted course sir
hes heading back towards manhattan
close in and lock on
godzilla attempts to make his way back to the shore
the indiana and arizona close in on either side
locked on sir
boxed in from either side godzilla races through the water
at the same moment both submarines fire their torpedoes
godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of manhattan and begins burrowing furiously
as his gigantic claws start digging up earth an enormous turbulence of clouds and dirt cloud the waters around him cloaking him
the captain and his ensign are at the sonar
we track two torpedoes approaching target godzilla
impact in eight seconds seven six
huddled around the schematic and radio they hear
filtered five four three
the torpedoes enter into frame and disappear into this undersea dust cloud
an enormous explosion blasts from its center waves of concussion reverberate
with the explosion and enormous tidal wave rises and crashes down over battery park with tremendous impact
parked cars and phone booths are washed away
the ensign checks the sonar
the crew erupts in cheers
they hear the cheering from the sub over the radio
they got em
the generals congratulate each other and major hicks
toppling down out of the murky turbulence we see godzilla falling away from the shoreline backwards the ocean floor drifting down to the bottom of the hudson river like so
many cement shoed gangsters
raymond and his men are laying out the plastic explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs
jean claude walks up to raymond
we do not have enough explosives
raymond turns and sees nick across the room studying a group of eggs
raymond goes towards him
crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor animal and audrey appear
theyre stunned at what they see
quickly animal hoists his camera and begins to film as an amazed audrey walks through
kneeling down along side the eggs nick examines them
nick we have a problem
nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to listen to the egg
he leans his ear against the shell
suddenly we hear a loud crack
nick jumps backwards
the shell ruptures and an large fissure opens up across the egg
as we hear other cracks o
nick turns and sees more eggs beginning to open all around them
hidden in this forest of tall eggs animal leans in close to one getting video footage of it cracking
audrey nervously watches
what she doesnt see however is a babyzilla fish hanging from its jaw as it approaches from behind
stunned they can only stare as the babyzilla breaks free of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous i think we should leave now
the babyzilla kneels down and immediately starts gobbling up the dead fish laying nearby
cautiously nick and raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough distance they they break into a run and head for the exit
the babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears audrey
animal continues to shoot the cracking egg
whispered one more second
this is fantastic
just then animal turns to see the babyzilla right behind audrey
dont you think we have enough
audrey turns to see what animal is staring at
her eyes go wide as she backs up into animal
another babyzilla appear on the other side of them
just be calm
dont startle them
animal leads audrey backwards as they make their way towards the large team entrance at the end of the floor
the two babyzillas swallow their fish and begin to sniff the air
audrey moves up the isle
an egg cracks and an arm breaks out through a shell grabbing her leg
audrey freaks and frantically she kicks herself free
they both suddenly take off running
nick and raymond race to the stairwell
raymond pulls out his radio
into radio everyone outside
laying down the plastic explosives
hearing the radio he drops what theyre doing just as several eggs near them begin to crack
quickly he and his partner take off running
two other men are still laying cables for the explosives
one of them is kneeling in a pile of fish near the eggs
come on lets go
ive almost got this
just then a babyzilla pops up behind the eggs a fish in his mouth
he swallows the fish and begins sniffing the air
he turns and stares directly at the slowly retreating r man
he smells his own hands and realizes he smells like fish quickly he turns and runs
but babyzilla is faster
he runs up from behind and leaps onto r man s back
r man begins to fire at babyzilla just as another one tackles him from the side
in moments they are both devoured
audrey and animal reach the entrance and race inside
the main exit doors are locked from the outside
they turn back just as
appear in the team entrance doorway sniffing the air
audrey sees something grabs animals wrist and pulls him to one of the locker room doors
through the door we see the babyzilla approaching as audrey and animal leap inside slamming the door behind them
there is a sudden thud against the door
animal rushes over to a large locker cabinet and with all his strength pushes it over blocking the door
now what do we do
nick and raymond run up to another open doorway and look inside
dozens and dozens of eggs hatching
babyzillas everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to devour all the fish
a babyzilla appears only feet away and turns and stares directly at us
quickly raymond slams the doors shut as they both retreat back into the hallway
raymond smashes the glass covering of a nearby fire hose and raps it around the door handles locking it closed
suddenly a loud thud as something begins to bang against the locked doorway
weve got to lock them inside while we can
raymond tosses his cellular phone to nick
contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape
how do i do that
tell them its a code dragonfly
they should get you through
amazed by raymond nick just stares at him
what are you waiting for
nick snaps out of it and dials
filtered all circuits are busy right now
please hang up and try again
a large and angry mob has gathered at the roadblock to the bridge
people their cars packed with belongings are screaming to be let back into manhattan
horns honk and the blockade guards are getting nervous
the mayor marches over to major hicks who is consulting with the generals
do you have any idea whats going on out there
the phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city
were sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body
that things dead
what the hell are we waiting for
just then elise rushes over to the major
major if nick is right this could be our last chance to do something about it
we have to search for the nest now
major hicks is torn
finally he nods in agreement turning to another officer
organize a search party
i want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system
you dont have the authority to do that
the major turns and cooly approaches the mayor
try and stop me
major hicks smiles at the mayor who exits petulantly
we see dozens and dozens of babyzillas fighting with each other over the last of the fish
suddenly this image is slammed shut as doors are closed and a fire hose is rapped around door handles
we widen to reveal
raymond fastening the hose around the door
secured raymond takes off running
nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as raymond comes up
we hear a busy signal from the phone
nick dials again
whatd they say
i cant get through
i dont know whats wrong
filtered all circuits are busy right now
jean clude and his partner arrive
weve secured the doors on both levels
wheres luc and pierre
they didnt make it
quickly recovering nick my men and i will hold them here
you will have to go and get help
nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs
the rest of the team snap together their automatic rifles and prepare for a fight
animal and audrey are checking out every corner of the room
theres got to be another way out of here
audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate covering the air vent
think we can fit up in there
only one way to find out
he rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside
jean claude sends luc up ahead as they guard the doorways
a loud thump is heard on the door they are guarding
each turns their weapon towards the doors
suddenly a portion of wall between them collapses
a dozen babyzillas leaping through the plaster
as they spill out into the hall jean claude attempts to open fire
one of the babyzillas is hit
his brothers attack
luc from the other side tries to lay down cover fire but hes overrun by the herd
nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway
just then he passes a locked door banging on the other side
just up ahead he can see the main lobby
but before he can get there a loud crash is heard as the locked door in front of him smashes to bits as
flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead
nick slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away
he turns to run the other directions when
come bursting through the locked door behind him
pinned down with no way out
nick sees the elevator nearby and races over slamming his hand against the button
come on come on
the babyzillas by the front door spot nick
a couple of them start to sniff the air and start to move towards him
behind the babyzilla also catch the scent and turn
this is not good
just then the elevator doors open nick leaps inside
nick frantically pushes the close door button but its painfully slow to react
i hate these things
just then the babyzillas appear
theyre just about to move in when the doors finally close
nick breaths a sigh of relief just as a loud thud is heard as one of them slams against the door
its too late the elevator begins to rise
climbing upward animal reaches a plateau and crawls into cross vent
he reaches back and grabs his camera
putting it down he turns back and helps audrey up and in
out of breath she nods
animal takes the lead again pushing his camera in front of him
he reaches another vent that looks down
hes about to pull it free when something catches his eye
standing guard automatic rife in hand raymond appears with his back toward us
animal lifts his camera to shoot
what is it
animal doesnt answer he just shoots
the elevator doors open and raymond swerves his gun around ready to shoot
frightened nick throws his hands in the air
hey its me
audrey has pushed her way up alongside of animal to peer down through the grating
nick keeps dialing the cell phone still busy
theyre allover the main lobby
i couldnt get out
just then the vents above collapses and animal and audrey come tumbling down
in a flash raymond has his weapon trained on their heads
who the hell are you
i know her
raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera and fires ripping the camera apart
nick moves to audreys side helping her up
what are you doing here
i thought you said thered only be a dozen eggs
i was wrong
just then a loud thump is heard against the near locked door
the thumping gets louder and heavier
do you have a radio a walkie talkie
anything we can use to contact the outside
what about the phones
circuits are overloaded
gets an idea i know a way
i know how you can get a message out of here
the door bursts open and twenty babyzillas stampede into the hallway
audrey is fast on her feet
she takes off running and they follow
the babyzillas give chase
animal hangs back and runs over to the destroyed video camera and pulls out the tape
just as he does the babyzillas are nearly on top of him
he dashes off
audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that leads to a back stairwell she ushers the rest inside
she slams the door behind her as the babyzillas appear and begin to sniff the doorway
they spill out into the hall and rush past all the luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium
come on the broadcast booth is right over here
how do you know
our network covers the ranger games
the babyzillas are gathered by the doorway sniffing
one of the more aggressive ones starts to claw at the door ripping into it
another charges it thud
they rush up to a door marked broadcast booth
audrey tries the door its locked
animal charges his shoulder into it but it doesnt give
raymond gently moves animal out of the way and shoots the lock to pieces
he opens the door for everyone to enter
they rush into the empty broadcast booth
animal turns on the lights as audrey goes over and boots the computer terminal
raymond moves some equipment against the door securing it closed
the network is on an intranet
its a direct feed into our computer system
your station wont have any easier time contacting the military than i did
that stumps her
animal gets an idea
when you worked with them did they monitor the news broadcasts
getting the idea yes they did
well go live
well broadcast from here
hopefully theyll see it
more of the creatures have gathered by the door
two more charge and the door collapses
the babyzillas rush up the stairs
ed is watching the news feed
caiman is on
filtered yes the threat is over but the pain continues
suddenly eds computer begins to beep
ed slides his chair over and looks at his monitor
it reads he double clicks it and a letter pops up that reads
ed pick up transponder cfx and watch the feed
to himself theres no ranger game on tonight
ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and turns on a blank monitor
racing in front of the camera we see audrey in the control booth
if youre seeing this ed please put us on live
this is urgent
i know this sounds crazy ed but you have to do it
please trust me
incredulous im not putting you on live
nick turns on a small television and we still see caiman doing the news
audrey turns to animal
hes not going to do it
oh yes he will
animal turns the camera and points out the window at the babyzillas below
eds eyes nearly pop out of his head
filtered ed you see that
theyll be all over the city if we dont stop them
ed rushes over to the console and goes to work
the mode is festive
the generals are preparing to leave as is major hicks
sergeant oneal and some of his men are watching the t
filtered as our fears have been allayed thanks to the dedicated work of our boys in uniform
everyone in the room begins to cheer
suddenly caimans image goes fuzzy
in a moment its replaced by audrey
filtered are we on
are we live
nick sees audrey on the t
and gives her the thumbs up
were live from inside madison square garden where dr
niko tatopoulos has discovered the beasts lair
doctor tell us what is happening here
animal swerves the camera over to nick
raymond stays back behind the camera watching
weve discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago
the creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and flood into the hall
sniffing around they pick up the scent and take off
a soldier tugs on major hicks shoulder try to get his attention
what is it
you better see this
the major turns around just in time to see nick on the t
if the military are listening they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape
oh my god
the camera swerves to see through the luxury booths across from them the dozens of babyzillas approaching
the bedroom is packed with lucys guests as they watch the t
seeing the babyzillas
oh my god
on the screen the image turns to nick
filtered if those creatures escape and multiply in a very short time a new species will emerge
one that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet
major hicks is on the phone
into phone thats correct i want you to blow up madison square garden
no im not drunk
to oneal contact the news station
tell them were on the way
raymond spots a large spool of co axle cable
quickly he ties it to the support beam
reporting live from madison square garden this is audrey timmonds everyone is breathless watching the news
thats my girl
animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent
the computer beeps animal reads the message
the good news is they got the message
the bad news is weve got five and a half minutes to get out of the building
suddenly the room rocks as the babyzillas begin crashing against the blocked door
raymond jumps to his feet
okay partys over
time to leave
with that he sprays bullets into the front glass window shattering it
glass rains down below
raymond tosses the spool of cable out the broken window
anyone care to join me
animal dislodges one of the video cameras hoists it on his shoulder and moves over to join raymond
several f s prepare to take flight
we focus on one an enormous bomb attached under its wing
the f taxis away from us
repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast booth animal and raymond land on the upper level balcony
raymond signals to the others to follow
audrey and nick are nervous as they stare at the long drop down
the door is begging to give way from the repeated thumping
suddenly audrey leans over and kisses nick
in case i cant later
with that she jumps out repelling downward
nick is stunned by the unexpected kiss
suddenly the door gives and the babyzilla flood into the room
audrey hits the ground followed by nick
raymond leads as they make their way out
on the other end of the room some babyzilla appear in a doorway and watch our friends scurry away
the babyzillas take off in hot pursuit
the f s fly in formation
their leader carrying the same bomb we saw loaded earlier
raymond guns in each hand comes rushing into the hallway
he sees a small group of babyzillas down the hall and gestures for the group to go the other way
raymond backs away guns trained on the babyzillas who sniff the air and decide to pursue
raymond turns and runs
as they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard of several dozen babyzillas who are tearing the concession stands to ribbons looking for food
spotted the babyzillas leap forward after the team
raymond spots the escalators across the hall
the escalators hurry
we follow the squadron as they pass us to reveal the beautiful manhattan skyline approaching
the team races into the corridor
animal reaches down and hits the power button near the moving stairs
the escalator comes to life
the team runs down the down escalators as the babyzillas flood into the corridor
some try to go down the up escalator and fall all over themselves
others are spooked by the moving down escalator
finally the brave ones begin to leap down the down escalator
racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into the main lobby and freezes
they are surrounded on all sides by babyzillas
like the scene in hitcocks the birds it is eerily still as everyone freezes
closing over the city the lead bomber breaks formation flying lower closer to the rooftops
through the windshields heads up display hud we see a target locking on flashing
im locking on now
as several sniff the air they begin to close in
the babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to the ground level and rush over from behind
raymond spots the large hanging chandeliers in the front lobby
he fires a short burst slicing the cable supporting the chandelier
the chandelier drops and shatters in the center of the main lobby
the babyzillas scatter opening a pathway to the front door
raymond pushes the team forward as he takes the rear through the pathway which begins to close up as they pass through
the babyzillas recover and begin to charge
as raymond passes some candy machines he grabs one and smashes it to the ground
scatter all over the floor
as the babyzillas run they begin to stumble allover each other tripping on the gum balls
animal is the first to reach the main door he opens it and audrey and nick are the first to exit
raymond firing madly behind as he rushes for the door
the locked flashes red
the immense bomb drops and takes flight on its own
we can see its heading directly for madison square raymond exits and animal shuts the door behind him
the babyzillas slam against the doors
it takes all of animals and raymonds strength to hold the doors closed
raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a temporary lock
he pulls animal away and they take off running
rapidly approaching the famous forum
not far behind nick and audrey as they race from the building
behind them we see
collide and an enormous explosion erupts engulfing the entire building in a mountain of flame
raymond animal audrey and nick are thrown several feet forwards toppling to the ground from the incredible impact
as the building crumbles in flames we hear several of the babyzillas screaming
soon they are silenced
slowly nick sits up and turns to audrey
theyre both shaken up
nick touches her cheek gently
are you okay
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting
youd be surprised
id like to find out
she hugs him tightly
animal turns to raymond who has cut above his eye
hey man you all right
i could use a coffee
we begins to pull away from this tableau slowly lifting upwards when suddenly
then violently bursting up through the ashes a very angry emerges
bleeding from his injuries godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young
for the first time in the film we can see a partial expression of godzillas face pain
but quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards staring directly and accusingly at our heroes
what do we do
running would be a good idea
and they do just as godzilla pounces
fortunately our team darts around a corner just in time
as our heroes come rushing around a corner godzilla bursts through the building in front of them sealing off their exit
raymond notices a very narrow alley
raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings
they run for their lives as godzilla appears behind them
his claws are too big to reach into the alley so he bulldozes his way into it the building ripping apart as he marches forward
bricks go flying as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side
slowed down by the the position of the alley godzilla swings his arms violently to clear a path
racing from the alley raymond races over to a parked in one deft move raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt pops the ignition device off the steering column
and hot wires the car in under seconds
as he does this the others pile into the car
not even completely all in raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over
animal nearly falls out
just as godzilla bursts out from between the buildings the cab darts away squealing around the next corner
power sliding around the wet street corner the yellow cab fishtails onto th ave
whipping around the corner behind them godzilla appears
as hes much faster he nearly overtakes the car in a single leap but the cab swerves again moving down another street
the cab darts onto th street
debris tumbles down in their path as godzilla smashes through another building
the rear window shatters as falling bricks and debris hit the car
again the cab darts down a small side street
using this small cut across the cab quickly exits out onto the next main street th
godzilla rushes down the side street his tail shattering buildings as he does
animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power up
the light goes on and animal quickly holsters it and begins filming out the shattered back window
cut uptown take th to th then cut up broadway
youre crazy go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk
in the rain
leaping forward godzilla bites down snapping at the cab as it swerves just out of danger gunning it
what are you talking about
the east side is always faster
but we can get to the west side faster
through the rear window we see godzilla snapping down trying to take a bite
the cab again swerves wildly darting down a side street
somebody make up your mind
take central park
taking her advice raymond swerves up th ave
he guns it and races up ahead
the last two turns of the cab have temporarily disoriented godzilla who looks around to find the cab
he moves up a block and begins to look around
several blocks ahead godzilla spots the cab
he narrows his eyes and wails angrily
suddenly he bolts after the cab
animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the back window
gaining on them godzilla is in hot pursuit
better step on it frenchie
the military is cleaning up the trap from before
sergeant oneal spins as the cab leaps out from behind the trees
what the hell
the cab power slides right past and out of the meadow again just as godzilla stomps directly into the clean up crew
soldiers dive for cover as others scramble out of the way
godzilla marches after the cab his tail swiping several vehicles which tumble crashing into the troops
in a flash godzilla disappears back into the forest on the other side
oneal grabs his radio
command command this sergeant oneal
major hicks moves over towards the radios
captain rogers do we still have those f s in the air
theyre heading back to base now sir
turn em around
the cab heads up the deserted streets racing full tilt
animal pulls himself back into his seat
i think we lost him
leaping out several blocks ahead godzilla emerges
he kneels down and gives a gigantic power blast of his breath
cars street signs vending machines sail backwards from the force
a newspaper vending machine slams into the hood of the cab as the cab squeals around a corner avoiding the rest of the onslaught of debris
the f s bank and head back towards manhattan
racing up through the streets of harlem we see the cab
everyone is looking around for the creature
anyone see him
suddenly from behind animal spots the creature several blocks behind
again he lifts the camera
running full boar directly at them
godzilla quickly makes up ground
running at the cab its only a matter of seconds before hell reach them
raymond looks up spots something
up ahead is a sign for the exit for the george washington bridge
raymond decides to take it
the cab swerves heading towards the bridge entrance just as godzilla bites down barely missing the cab as it turns the corner
godzilla leaps over the entire block landing directly the cab spins pulling a full degree turn and peels out just before godzilla can snap down again just missing the cab
the cab peels around the creature and up the onramp
just then godzilla leaps after them
his jaw open he everyone ducks as the enormous jaws of the creature taking a gigantic bite out of the highway some high tension wires and the support structure over
the bridge godzilla chomps down on the cab
the large cement sign slams into the roof of the creatures mouth preventing him from crushing the cab with his teeth
the sign supports will not hold much longer as it crumbles just above the cab
the torn electric cables dangling dangerous close to the cab
godzilla pushes his tongue towards the back of the car trying to draw it into his throat
theyre freaking out as the jaws are closing in on them
spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes against it lifting the rear of the vehicle
like a dog with a bone godzilla shakes his head trying to rip the rest of the highway free
the portion of highway in front of the cab tears free lifting
from the cab we see the horizon lift as the road begins to give way
the sign above crumbling further
nick turns and sees
sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab
he takes off his jacket wraps it around his hand and opens the cab door
grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand he jams the cable down into godzillas tongue
nick leans back inside slamming the door shut
he temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just before he is about to slam his jaws shut again
as the tongue momentarily retreats from the shock the wheels catch and the cab lurches forward
as the sign crumbles and the jaws crush down the cab sails out of his mouth as the beast swallows the piece of highway
landing hard onto the pavement the cab peels out burning rubber as it enters the george washington bridge
godzilla swallows only to realize he didnt get them
seeing the cab on the bridge godzilla gives chase
the cab races towards us when godzilla steps onto the bridge
his enormous weight makes the entire bridge the cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them
its as though they were driving during an earthquake
with each stride godzilla takes the bridge becomes more unstable
swooping down the f s head directly towards the bridge
we see godzilla about to overtake the cab
the hud begins to flash locked on
we are red and free
only a stride away from being overtaken
all at once they fire
missiles heading right at camera
opens his mighty jaw about to clamp down on them
the missiles connect slamming into his chest exploding
his torso rips apart
he screams out
his wail a painful death cry
his foot stomps down as he tries to retain balance
the impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that knocks the cab into a spin
slamming into the guard rail the cab bounces back into the road and keeps going
the injured godzilla bites the bullet and continues pursuing his gait slowing
the cab is able to make some distance
again they fire
a group of missiles darting out
the missiles hit ripping into him
again godzilla screams out his forward motion stopped
where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in horror
the cab slides into a spin as it comes to a stop just in front of the crowd
nick jumps out first staring back at godzilla
audrey comes up from behind
his eyes rolling back into his head as he screams out
slowly he tumbles
godzillas enormous head comes crashing down in front of us
the tremendous impact sends tremors across the bridge
the gathered crowd is rocked from the impact of the toppled godzilla
his last breath escaping
defeated and weary his eyes blink slowly as we watch his life slip away
oddly nick stares sympathetically at godzillas sad and lifeless face
the stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them begins to applaud nervously then vigorously
the mob breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our heroes surrounding them
the room is going berserk everyone slapping hands
lucy turns and gives a high five to everyone around her
cameras flash like mad
several news crews fight their way through the crowd
overlapping how did you discover the nest
tatopoulis can you tell us what happened back there
sorry guys ive promised my story as an exclusive to another reporter
nick winks at audrey
caiman pushes his way through the crowd of reporters over to her
we did it
weve got the exclusive
way to go audrey
i dont think so
i want that story audrey
remember you work for me
caiman i quit
audrey waves goodbye as animal walks over checking his camera and his coat pocket
audrey did you take the tape out of the camera
they look around but hes gone
nowhere to be seen
i couldnt have just lost it
a phone begins to ring
nick checks his pockets and finds raymonds cellular phone
where are you
raymond watches the mob scene from a distance
tell your friends i will send the tape after i remove a few items from it
nick nods to audrey that its raymond
i just wanted to say au revoir and thank you for your help my friend
line goes dead to himself au revoir
who was that french guy anyway
oh just some insurance guy
off audreys confused expressions we pull back farther and farther
we see the mob the military the command tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal godzillas mighty head laying on the end of the bridge
we float through the demolished station almost as though we were a moving point of view
we travel thorough the debris of the station into one of the tunnels
we travel deeper and deeper into the distance
a shaft of light up ahead
we move closer to it
as we get nearer we realize its one of godzillas gigantic eggs
we move closer and closer to the solitary egg
just as we are about to collide with it
