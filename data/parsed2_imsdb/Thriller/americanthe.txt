written by rowan joffe based on the novel a very private gentleman by martin booth draft
a saab outside the dacha
a light within
jack dark fit mid forties is staring at the embers of a log fire
he sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey
the impressive us army special forces crest tattooed on the shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with jacks quiet manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair
jack is no longer young
a creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder
ingrid is naked
with an intimate familiarity she kisses jack on the top of his head sits close behind him and wraps her arms around her lover linking her slender hands across his
her head resting on his shoulder her face beside his ingrid and jack watch the fire together in easy silence
ingrid leads jack through the trees
her coat has a white fur collar
they are fresh faced and warm from bed
they head towards a vast and frozen lake
jack senses something in the woods
beneath the conifers impenetrable darkness
jack looks around
thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound
there is not the slightest breeze
what are you looking for
her swedish accent is sing song
his anxiety is evident
ingrid laughs out loud
there are no wolves in the woods so close to the city
they continue through the woods until they reach the shoreline of the lake
ingrid steps onto the ice
holds out her hand
jack takes ingrids hand
solid as stone the frozen lake takes his weight
they walk out ingrid slipping and laughing
the landscape is magical
jack begins to relax slipping and swearing
suddenly he stops
there are footprints in the thin snow going out across the lake
beside the snow hares prints are those of a man
jack studies the two sets of tracks
those of the snow hare are heading out into the lake
the mans prints are heading in the opposite direction towards the shoreline
jack spins around in the direction theyve just come from
then about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake a low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the branch
jack grabs ingrid yanks her towards the cover of the lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow
she grunts winded
he lies besides her
we hear the crack of a bullet so quiet it might be a bough snapping under the weight of winter
jack pulls a walther ppk s semi automatic handgun from the pocket of his parka
then bobs up and down once
theres another crack from the trees
jack pinpoints the spot from the drift of blue smoke almost invisible in the winter air
theres someone in the shadows
he rubs snow into his woollen hat edges up until he can just see over the snow and pumps three shots into the dusk under the trees
we hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound as if jack has just shot a tobogganist
more snow slides off the trees
ingrid gathers her breath but loses her wits you have a gun
jack keeps his eyes fixed on the trees
you have a gun
how do you have a gun
why should you carry such a weapon
jack looks at her briefly but makes no reply
she is busy thinking
so is he
he stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees
ingrid follows frightened
the man is slouched forwards in a drift of snow his body cushioned in white softness
jack kicks the sole of his boot
jack talk to me
jack grabs his collar and turns him over
he doesnt recognise him
jack fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing
in his breast pocket he finds a military identity pass
who is he
hes not dressed like a hunter
why is he alone
hunters always go in pairs
swiftly jack removes the bolt from the mans rifle and throws it far into the trees
go for help
call the police
ingrid sets off stumbling up the track they have made through the snow
jack shoots her just once in the nape of her neck
she twitches in the snow her blood staining the white fur of her coat collar
from a distance ingrid looks like a shot snow hair
jack approaches her
and steps over her trying not to look down
trying not to look back
outside the dacha is another man standing by a black mercedes benz sedan
the second hunter
he is holding an automatic pistol but hes not on alert
jack fells him easily with a bullet in the ear
he removes the clip from his walther and reloads it
jack packs a few belongings in a holdall
jack smashes the cb radio in the mercedes and removes the distributor cap from the engine burying it deep in the snow
then he gets into the saab
and drives off
over images of jack on a ferry to gotland changing clothes and vessels for ystad travelling by road to trelleborg catching the night crossing to travemunde driving to hamburg and
from hamburg catching a train to
at a fast food stand not far from the central train station a middle aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog
it is autumn and without the usual mass of summer tourists larry stands out as an american
jack does not
larry is shocked to see jack but pretends the hot dog is the centre of attention
what brings you to rome
i closed the stockholm account
larry might be older than jack but he doesnt seem it
his demeanour is sprightly
but there were complications
then larry turns and walks eating carefully
he is not a man who likes to get his hands dirty
jack walks beside him
both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings
a beat and a girl
larry takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look at jack
jack is tired
theres a bar across the street the laquila
give me two hours
jack washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of the bar
in the background on the stereo the white stripes cover one more cup of coffee
jack stares at himself in the mirror
he looks exhausted
jack is sitting at the back of the bar
he has a good view of the whole establishment including the entrance and the door to the bathrooms
he lights a cigarette
larry comes in and sits opposite him
genuinely shocked you started smoking again
the waiter slides over and flicks a cloth at the table
the waiter disappears
larry puts an envelope on the table
jack takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket
larry is about to speak but stops
the waiter reappears and puts down two cups of coffee
larry puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring
then speaks low and fast you cant stay here jack
you wont see em coming not in a big city
but you cant go far either
if the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to brink gallazzo simenov any of the first division you have four or five hours at most before every airport train station
bus stop toll booth and ski lift from stockholm to skopje is under surveillance
not a question
an acknowledgement that larry knows exactly what hes talking about
and jack is listening
you find a hole somewhere nearby and you crawl into it and you stay put until i say its safe to come out
jacks expression is as immoveable as a cliff face
turn right outside the bar then second left
youll find a silver citroen c with chieti plates
check the glove box and follow the map
its a fucking fortress
and as dead as a graveyard
anyone within a three to five mile radius youll see em coming
he pushes something across the table
a mobile phone in a cellophane bag
larry finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin
do nothing till you get my call
jack gets into a compact citroen c nothing flash
he opens the glove compartment and finds a plain manilla inside the envelope is a passport bearing jacks photo in the name of edward clarke a drivers license in the
same name and a map
a long tunnel one of the longest in europe
jack at the wheel
it seems like night red stripes strip lights shadows
vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes
a button of light expanding
as we burst into daylight
were in another world
jacks car is winding its way up a twisting mountain road towards
a ramshackle lonely desolate italian hilltop town
the town sits beneath its own castle
medieval towers gables streets and church bells framed by the snow capped mountain peaks beyond
this is not the italy of e
forster or of bella tuscany
this is the italy where the crusaders built their fortresses
the italy where sergio leone conceived of his great westerns
a church bell tolls
jack stops the car
at the crossroads is a signpost pointing to the town
the sign reads jack looks at the sign
he looks up at the silent town at the vast stone ramparts
an old man comes out of a crooked medieval doorway stares at jack and disappears into another building
jack looks at the dead sockets of the windows random beneath the rotting patchwork of rooves
a dog barks
the wind hisses
the atmosphere is deathly
jack makes a decision
and drives away
we see jacks car heading away from castelvecchio
the car crosses a spectacular viaduct that spans a deep the drivers window opens
a mobile phone in a cellophane bag is thrown out
it drops hundreds of feet down the ravine
castel del monte is a well preserved happy looking little mediaeval town with a handful of tourists
a chunk of time has passed
jack is sitting on a table outside a small bar wearing dark glasses sipping a coffee and reading a guide book
he looks like a tastefully dressed well educated american tourist
he blends in
and no one pays him much attention as he finishes his coffee pays his bill gets up and leaves
we follow jack as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts and looks across the spectacular valley
towards the deserted castelvecchio
at a leisurely pace jack passes a row of municipal rubbish bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town
hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of jacks parked were right in the heart of the mediaeval old town like the stronghold at the centre of a castle
jack approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off the main square
the sign reads pensione abruzzo
the internal courtyard is refreshingly cool
in the centre of the courtyard is a fountain made of marble shot through with black veins
in the fountain stands an alabaster statue of a girl
shes wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water falls
the water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre diameter pipe made of bronze
as jack crosses the courtyard he glances at the statue
he finds it hard to tear his eyes away
a toothbrush in the glass by the sink
the guidebook on the bedside table
apart for this jack has avoided unpacking living entirely out of his holdall for some time
from the holdall jack produces a pair of leica x geovid brf rangefinding binoculars
through his casement window he has good view of he sweeps the town in grid formation calm and methodical
this is a routine assessment
jacks pov apart from the occasional appearance of an old man woman or dog the dead town across the valley is empty
jack is lying on top of his bed fully clothed and wide awake
taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame
is his walther semi automatic handgun
blinding sun fills frame
jack is ostensibly photographing the sights the mediaeval architecture the square the church
the church is at the top of town
a priest dressed in black surveys the world below him
locals are going about their business a few scattered tourists are enjoying their holiday
one tourist catches the priests attention
perhaps its his build
or the fact that hes the only tourist on his own
or perhaps its the obsessive grid like methodology with which jack photographs the little town
jack turns casually down one of the towns many narrow alleyways
the alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind corners and dark tunnels the street enclosed by arches criss crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by
its a stalkers heaven or hell depending on how dangerous the prey
jack proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a crossroads where four narrow alleyways converge
each alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of steepness
jack photographs each alleyway
from an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game show on television
from another alleyway comes the sound of a barking dog
no dog is visible
curious jack turns around walking back the way he came
the sound of barking gets louder
on his right hand side jack finds a hidden archway
the hidden archway resembles an archers slit but is big enough for a gown man to slip through
unlike a window the slit is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls
the confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap between them very very difficult to spot
jack slips though the hidden archway
inside is a courtyard
rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms
a mongrel tied to a post is barking savagely his leash keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into jack
jack stares at the dog a mysterious creature of fear and fury
jack reappears through the hidden archway and slips back into the narrow alleyway
its like hes materialised from thin air
he takes photographs first of the hidden archway and then of the street sign via romana
just then a man on an original s ducati turns down the alleyway and drives towards him
casually jack continues walking
the ducati gets nearer
the man on the ducati is wearing a black crash helmet with a tinted visor
jack picks up his pace
the ducati is ten metres away
jacks right hand moves towards his pocket
jacks hand goes in his pocket
jack drops to his knees
the ducati backfires for a second time
still on his knees jack pretends to tie his right shoe lace
the man on the ducati stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet
hes a corpulent ruddy faced italian man in his late sixties
he glances at jack
da dove provenite
for an instant the directness of the question catches jack out
jacks pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty
perhaps hes playing up on this
it suits the role of american tourist
the man laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct grammar lamericano
a womans voice comes from within the house loud and angry distracting the man on the ducati who screams back passionately enters his front door and shuts it behind him
with a hearty slam
jack walks on
jack puts some coins in a cigarette machine
the machine takes his money but wont dispense his cigarettes
he hits the refund button but nothing happens
jack checks the time
and thumps the machine hard
jack adjusts his position and checks the time again
can i help you
the man behind him is reflected in the surface of jacks battered rolex
im no good with machines
jack turns smiling politely
the priest smiles back
he is dressed in an ill fitting un stylish black suit a black silk stock and a deep roman collar fraying at the edge
his name is father benedetto
he is older than jack
you are american
this is stated matter of factly like a man practising english
you speak italian
you stay at pensione arbruzzo
also a statement this time with touch of triumph
jack is disconcerted but doesnt show it
not for much longer
this much is true after a fashion
they speak in english unless otherwise specified lavoro
che genere de lavoro
che genere de fotografia
pictures of the region
he stands straight and smiles winningly
sights and landmarks
for guidebooks magazines
jack shows no discomfort
actually its a syndicate
lots of different publications
so you must share a glass of wine with me
jack is slightly thrown
youre very kind but i
you want to know the truth about abruzzo
a priest sees everything
jack is using the local pay phone
do you have any idea how long ive been trying to reach you
what happened to the cell i gave you
jack speaks quietly keeping an eye on the town square did i forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity
dont get jumpy on me jack
that cell was secure
jack lights a cigarette
ive got a job
its a custom fit
you dont even have to pull the trigger
whos the client
she triple checks out
plus she comes to you
you dont have to move an inch
this is a small town larry
i dont like small towns
i grew up in one
besides im already attracting attention
so will anyone whos trying to kill you
this is a good point
jack lights a cigarette
ill think about it
think about this
i cleaned up your shit and made you disappear
you owe me my usual twenty percent commission plus the first installment
the rest is yours
after this youre free
turning over the word
the sun is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook the hilltop town
jack is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt
hes sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of a crumbling fifteenth century edifice overlooked yet secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun
father benedetto pours two large glasses of brandy from a globulous green bottle of armagnac and sniffs his drink like a honey bee hovering over a bloom
the quality of the brandy is good the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun
he pronounces warmed war med
his english is sophisticated but quaint like an out of date book
jack sniffs his drink before he sips it
not like a connoisseur like a white house taster checking the safety of a presidential beverage
in english the only good thing to come from the francesi everything else
father benedetto grimaces
the french are
pezzi di merda
this is not an american discovery
italians have known this for centuries
in italian when rome called france the province of gaul they were just the same
their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate
only their brandy is worthy of any attention
father benedetto looks at jack
in english forgive me
i speak too fast
you study our history
father benedetto looks horrified
you come to italy to make a guide book and you dont care about history
i take pictures father
you are american
you think you can escape history
you live for the present
jack likes this man
his shrewdness is disconcerting but humane
jack sips his brandy
i try to father
suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart
laquila is the capital of the abruzzo region and the nearest big town to castel del monte and castelveccio
like these two villages laquila is relatively isolated nestled high up in the appenine mountains
jack comes out of a supermarket carrying two bags of groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street
jack passes a sign for a modelling agency
its a small inconspicuous sign but it catches his eye because its graphics are subtly lewd and its attached to the buzzer of what is otherwise a purely residential apartment
entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year old italian girl
she catches jacks eye
he walks on
the remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal apple pecorino cheese honey and walnuts
on his lap top jack has organised several weeks worth of photographs of castel del monte into three categories
exit routes car
exit routes foot
now he is cleaning and oiling his walther ppk s
jack completes his morning exercises then showers and dresses
his manner is precise and methodical
only a man who has lived alone for many years can live like this
when his preparations are complete he picks up his binoculars and studies the nearby town of castelvecchio through his medieval casement window
the dead town has come to life
theres a market in progress
the central piazza is a hive of activity
food local produce clothes and cheap cd stalls
the market has attracted tourists
standing by a phone box not far from a cheese stall is an attractive woman in dark glasses
shes rifling through her handbag searching for something
under her right arm is a rolled up copy of il messaggero
we notice the front page of the italian daily newspaper has been folded in half
jack lowers his binoculars
decides to proceed with caution
moving through the busy market jack is also carrying a copy of il messaggero
with the front page folded in half
he approaches the old woman running a cheese stall
un po di formaggio per favore
e un po di pecorino
jack glances casually around for the woman
shes sitting outside a cafe about twenty metres away chatting on her cellphone
jack pays for his cheese and approaches the cafe
jack sits at an empty table next to the woman
she finishes her call in english
shes well spoken
as she replaces the phone in her handbag she knocks the newspaper off her table
jack picks it up
amidst gathering clouds
the woman speaks quickly purposefully barely looking at youre assuming im english or youd never have mentioned the weather
in fact im belgian but i went to boarding school in england
and am quite happy to converse on all subjects meteorological
judging by her stilted choice of words this is code
a waiter comes out and flicks a cloth over the table
its nearly midday and the sun is hot
he speaks with a tired voice buon giorno
hes addressing the woman
una spremute di limone
her italian accent is perfect
the woman looks at jack for the first time studying him awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it
una gelata alla fragola
the final fail safe
now they can introduce themselves edward
the identification process over there is nothing more to do but get down to business and conversation becomes suddenly awkward
my car has no air conditioning
i asked for it but
she trails off
what car did they give you
her hazel eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe
she doesnt answer
jack clears his throat
then says quietly range
she takes a long time to answer
when she does she does so over the rim of her half empty coffee cup scanning the crowd like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by her
one fifty to one seven five meters
seven at the most
preferably mm parabellum
the waiter delivers the spremuta and the raspberry ice cream
the glass of lemon juice twists in mathildes slender fingers
the weapon must be fairly light
possible to be broken down into its constituent parts
as compact as possible
jack clears his throat
you want a submachine gun to fit in a ladys purse
a small vanity case would be permissible
a small briefcase would be possible
camouflage lap top dvd player mp or digital camera
shes not sure if hes joking or not
neither are we
no such thing
youll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else
itll dampen the decibels dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash
i cant make you silent but i can make you invisible as the finnish phrase goes but only as long as youre prepared to lose some range
jack scans the crowd
on the other side of the square he spots a young man in his mid thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn hovering by a stall
average height slim athletic build sunglasses stone washed designer jeans very neatly pressed with a sharp crease
by the clothes stall
light blue shirt open at the neck expensive buff suede shoes
is he with you
the young man has disappeared into the crowd
i didnt see him
in any case im alone
jacks jaw muscles grind
i can accept a slight loss of range
you want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle
can you do it
give me a month
then a week for final adjustments
the sun is sinking
its hunting hour
a falcon hovers on the wind above the town looking for prey
jack is lying on top of his bed fully clothed but fast asleep
his eyes roll left and right beneath his lids
in his right hand is a book of medieval italian art twitching in his sleep jacks grip on the art architecture book slowly loosens
as the book hits the floor jack opens his eyes sits up and rips the taped walther from beneath the bed pointing it at the door
jacks heart is beating
jack is looking through his binoculars
of a small yellow and blue italian post office van heading up the winding alpine road towards castelveccio
with the market gone the town is once more dead
and provides no cover
jack parks his car not far from the town square turns off the engine and gets out
jack is sitting in the cafe where he met mathilde
he is watching the entrance to the local post office
he studies his watch
its been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny rural branch of the poste italiane
jack puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets up
the shop is small and dusty
so is the postmaster
the postmaster grunts his reply jutting his chin
il fermo posta
the postmaster turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old persons walking aid
from one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band
some have been there for weeks
deftly like a teller counting through a thick wad of banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin wasted fingers
this makes all the difference
the postmaster clicks again disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes
clarky clarky clarky
and reappearing with a package
the package is from an italian photographic suppliers
jack flicks his eyes downwards
he has already put his passport on the counter
the postmaster scoops it up with bony fingers
looks from the picture to jack
jack bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face
jack unwraps the package
he removes film photographic paper development fluids fixing solutions then a solid monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a single piece of lightweight alloy
a bolt assembly
only with this final piece is the puzzle complete
laid out on the floor is a socimi sub machine gun
without touching it jack studies the weapon like a connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine
in particular he notices that the serial number has been scratched off
then he moves slowly assembling the weapon with precision engineered expertise inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and securing it with the nut opening the sidefolding tubular
stock and engaging the buttpad snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder looking down the barrel and slowly squeezing back the finger grooved trigger as we our beautiful twenty four year old italian girl enters
she sits on the edge of the bed whose ageing metal springs squeak slightly and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray on the bedside table
she kicks off her slip on shoes
slips off her panties
lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on the bed in one practised motion
jack sits on the bed beside her
he doesnt look at her
she reaches up to touch jack as we cut to jack is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness
your source in rome
clean bill of health and no oc
this was a straight favour with a dollar chaser jack
the guys got a second cousin in nocs on the graft who filched him the socimi
i hope you paid below the odds
the more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room
no ones gossiping jack
jack watches father benedetto waving at him from the other side of the square
father benedetto is sitting in his api three wheeler
this comical and endearing method of rural transportation is a cross between a moped and a miniature pick up truck
in the back of the truck are a mass of writhing snakes
the api is turning over but it wont start
the bonnet is open
jack is fixing the engine
he gives a signal and father benedetto turns the ignition key again
this time the engine starts
father benedetto claps and cheers
sombre wood panelling stained dark with polish and smoke
two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique sideboard their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the life of our lord
the room is filled with a dining table a massive black edifice of oak five inches thick with six legs fluted like the columns of cathedrals
using antique crockery ancient copper pots and utensils like old fashioned instruments of torture father benedetto performs culinary alchemy transforming flesh into meat dough into bread hard earth nuggets into
he hums as he cooks opera arias
and johnny cash
jack sips from a glass of wine and watches father benedetto potter around the wood fired stove
the priest has his own wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming
jack eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in silence
father benedetto watches him pleased to see his guest so absorbed
as soon as jack has finished father benedetto invites him to help himself from the ancient tureen
then he bustles over to the stove humming again
jack eats studying a framed photo of father benedetto with his arm around a tough corpulent italian man in his mid twenties
father benedetto returns to the table with a large covered dish issuing steam into his face
he notices jacks eye line
all the sheep in my flock are dear to me but some are dearer than most
especially those that have strayed from the fold
off jacks intrigued look father benedetto clarifies fabio
he is a
in italian car doctor
but i suspect his practice is not entirely sound
father benedetto whisks the lid off the covered dish revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce
with sauce of orange juice orange peel chestnuts garlic marsala wine and
come si dici in inglese
brodo di pollo
father benedetto serves each of them with a complete bird and pours white wine into fresh glasses
also salsify in garlic butter
fried wild mushrooms with truffle
jack helps himself to vegetables
father benedetto watches him as he savours his first taste
jack licks his lips and sips some cold white wine
the two men regard one another the priest awaiting a verdict
father benedetto shrugs
the holy father eats better than this
the flash of a smile crosses the priests face
have you ever wanted to be anything other than a priest
have you ever wanted to be anything other than a
come se dice in inglese
i do what im good at
im sure you have other talents
you have the hands of a craftsman not an artist
you are good with machines
yet you told me just the opposite when we first met
jack hides his unease from the watchful priest
journalism cannot make you a rich man
father benedettos eyes flick over the rolex
perhaps you are rich already
im not a young man
i have my savings
in italian my meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining theres less and less money in the offertory
but if a man has god in his vaults
he looks searchingly at jack
i dont think god is interested in me
in english i know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and trebbiano
jack is silent
the two men continue eating
then casually what are the snakes for father
father benedetto taps the end of his nose in the universal sign for secrecy
the grave soul keeps its own secrets and takes its own punishment in silence
he has a twinkle in his eye
the priest is on a mission to extract the truth
and jack knows it
jack is driving
he checks the rear view mirror
jack accelerates the car driving it hard at the sidewalk
the vehicle slams into the curb mounting the pavement with a thump of crunching metal
just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders downhill through a series of small holdings allotments and scrap metal yards
the car moves slowly
we can hear the scrape of trailing metal
jack pulls up beside a high chain fence
the dogs on the other side start barking
this sets off other dogs in other scrap yards
jack gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut beside the fence
before hes a metre from the door it opens and a tough well built unshaven italian man in his mid twenties looks him up and down
sono un amico di padre benedetto
suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth lamericano
jack smiles politely
the metal door slides open
fabio leads jack inside
at the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue alfa romeo being resprayed white
beside it one half of a lancia is being welded to another
jack knows better than to stare
he follows fabio through to
girly calendars italian style
im taking pictures forty minutes north of here
right up in the mountains
father benedetto said you might be able to help
in italian you need models
for your photographs
he winks at jack
hes being friendly
my publisher wouldnt stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis
the technical english is slightly beyond fabios grasp
this suits jack
in italian want me to take a look
i just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft
in italian youre a mechanic
just a hobby
jack looks at the tools hanging on the walls and littering the work benches
in italian help yourself
in english my garage is your garage
i appreciate that
fabio gets on with work sliding himself beneath the resprayed alfa romeo
jack picks out various implements laying them on the work surface drill hacksaw lathe vice mallet
behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers several gear wheels with the teeth sheared off
he holds the biggest one up
fabio is engrossed his work
fabio grins and growls
a gearwheel with no bite is useless to him
jack wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and puts it in the sports bag with the tools
at the door he pauses
thats when jack sees it on the notice board
a photograph of father benedetto and fabio
fabio is much younger in this photo fourteen or fifteen years old
hes wearing an as roma football strip
again the priest has his arm around the boy
father benedetto rings the church bells for mass
three church bells ringing large medium and small
as the clappers hit the soundbows we smash cut to jack has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone floor of his room
beside them is the socimi sub machine gun
using the church bells as sound cover
jack puts the gearwheel on a flag stone tile and smashes it into five pieces with a four pound mallet
by torchlight jack is fashioning connectors from the smashed steel gear
its very very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor light
jack is wearing a knapsack
hes crossing a meadow and making his way towards a ruined hamlet
his manner is dark purposeful alert
the grass is long and the trees offer deep shade
everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers
his guardedness begins to evaporate
he has never seen anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted
he looks around transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves brash whites harsh and brilliant crimsons exquisite blues
the air is humming with insects bees and butterflies
jack is transfixed
jack scrambles up towards the abandoned houses sweating in the heat
his original cautiousness has returned
carefully he checks the area for signs of recent disturbance
from the foot of the deserted hamlet he surveys the valley with binoculars monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human activity
satisfied that hes alone he takes a deep breath of mountain air
and scrambles back down to the valley
jack has parked his citroen in the shade of a squat but ample walnut tree
in the near distance is a lake
jack crunches over half formed walnuts until he reaches a patch of soft grass beside the water
this he decides is the perfect spot
he unrolls a blanket kneels and from his knapsack he produces a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of frascati a loaf of course bread
gms of pecorino gms of proscuitto a small jar of black olives an orange and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of the socimi submachine gun
jack sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten rolex
it takes approximately thirty four seconds to assemble the bastardised socimi including telescopic sights and sound suppressor and a further six seconds to press ten rounds into the magazine slot
it into the base of the hand grip snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the rubber cup on the sight
carefully he surveys the lake
settles on a clump of reeds
and with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon concentrates until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still
as jack holds his breath
then squeezes the trigger
not the conventional phut phut phut of a movie silencer but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a tac sound suppressor
through the sight we see the water churn at four oclock to the reed clump and four metres off
from the knapsack jack takes a watchmakers steel handled screwdriver and adjusts the sight then loads another ten rounds in the magazine
the reeds are clipped the bullets slapping into the bank behind mud spurting
jack adjusts again and reloads
the reed clump is shot to shit
the sound of church bells
jack is at work modifying the sound suppressor to make it more efficient filing the connectors until the trigger squeeze is softer adjusting the position of the telescopic sight mountings
and finally checking the balance of the weapon jack poises it on the edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be the guns centre of gravity
the socimi balances perfectly
by now the sun is low and the light fading
jacks eyes are sore and his fingers aching
he sits on his bed with his hands on his knees silent in the dying light
were in the living room of a small apartment
its simply and attractively furnished
there are girls not obviously hookers
the first girl is on her mobile phone
every now and again she glances at jack
the second girl approaches him for a light
e clara qui
is clara here
non e stasera qui
shes not here tonight
she loops her arm through jacks
volete una bevanda
would you like a drink
jack shakes his head
forse un altro tempo
perhaps another time
jack parks in his usual hiding spot and heads for his pensione
a hundred yards ahead of him on the other side of the street is the same young man he spotted in castelveccio
cautiously so as not to spook him jack continues walking passing his pensione and heading for the town square
the young man is four parked cars away leaning against a fiat parked in front of a small pharmacy his right hand on the roof bending over as if speaking
to the cars local occupant who appears to be giving him directions
twice he looks up and gazes along the street in both directions casually as if keeping an eye open for passing traffic in the narrow street
jack side steps swiftly into the local bar
crowded with locals
jack orders a coffee
through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on the young man
but the darkness outside throws back reflections of the bright neon lit bar within
one reflection catches our attention
the italian girl
she is drinking and laughing with friends young italians like her
she catches sight of jack
he turns away
jack comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket
no sign of the young man
he slips down a side street
jack slips from one side street to another taking full advantage of short cuts alleyways and crumbling walls
his route is circuitous
it betrays a perfect knowledge of the maze like back streets of the town
eventually jack peeps out of a tiny passageway half way down his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his the entrance to the pensione is
jack crosses the street and slips inside
were in the corridor outside jacks room
jack takes his right hand from his pocket
hes clutching the walther
slowly he reaches his left hand upwards towards the lintel above the door where he finds
a single feather
from the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned deadbolt locks slide open
each lock is new and home made
jack enters shuts the door locks all four bolts
and sits on the bed
a cluster of houses by the side of a main road a bar a restaurant a phone box
jack puts a coin in the slot
ive got company
jack scans the area outside
if hes not baby sitting the belgian contract then hes either a joe a cop or a shooter
hes not with the company theyre fast its been three days and no ta
hes not intel theyre deep background and he wants to be noticed
he might be a cowboy but he cant be a cop they work in pairs and hes alone
strike guarda di finanza state police and nocs hes not italian he doesnt look like one dress like one or behave like one
so who the hell is he
you got a long list of enemies jack
whats he waiting for
jack hears the sound of an engine
his hand moves to his pocket
he watches a black vw sharon pass
theres a family inside
want me to help take care of this
i can handle it
you sound spooked
its a bad line
i appreciate the value of a pre emptive strike in circumstances like these i really do but if youre going to go generation kill then do me a favour ok
because im running out of bribe money
a beat make it look like an accident
little more than a halt one platform one track one station building locked and shuttered
jack steps out of his car
no one around
he checks his watch its exactly noon
a train approaches
its a three carriage local
it rattles round the bend in the track up the valley diesel fumes pluming
there are no more than a dozen passengers on board
mathilde is the only one to alight
her once brown hair is now blonde
shes wearing a light summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag
they shake hands as the train pulls away belching and honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and crosses some alpine rapids
how good to see you again
something quaint old fashioned in her diction
english with the hint of a belgian accent
jack opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag beside a wicker picnic hamper
the carabinieri around here like roadblocks
they get into the car
as the jacks door slams we smash cut to mathildes sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape
you picked a beautiful spot
she takes off her shades
her once hazel eyes are now grey blue
she glances round the hire cars drab plastic interior
you would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this
perhaps shes nervous
her attempt at humour isnt working and she stumbles slightly on her grammar i would have thought you to have had at least an alfa romeo
this attracts less attention
is it far
she looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over head
she eases herself back resigned to a long climb
the train was tiring
one has to keep alert so much in cities
her eyelids are drooping
ill wake you before the turn off
she smiles gratefully
but does not shut her tired eyes
the clock on the dash reads
jack negotiates the alpine road leaning into the steering wheel shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the mirror to the road and back again mathilde is asleep
jack scans her taking in every detail her low heeled shoes are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a seiko wrist watch on a metal strap and a thin
gold chain at her throat
her tan is light her breasts neat and her legs shapely and recently waxed
but jack doesnt look at her like an object of desire
he looks at her cautiously with an expression that says this young woman is ruthless
if she were not she wouldnt be alive
thats when he notices the car in his rear view mirror
its too far behind to decipher the make or model and it weaves in and out of frame as jack negotiates the alpine road
mathilde wakes with a start
the clock on the dash reads
are we nearly there
the turn offs up ahead
his eyes flick to the rear view mirror
hers to the wing
she spots the car behind
jack catches her eye questioningly
i told you i work alone
jack slows just before the turn off and pulls over
now its mathildes turn to look questioning
just a precaution
he gets out of the car and pretends to urinate
the car behind passes at speed
a blue seat
the driver neither slows down nor looks in their direction
jack gets back in the car
and turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the meadows
jack parks his citroen in the shade of the squat but ample walnut tree
in the near distance is a large lake
this is the exact spot where he came to test the weapon
mathilde gets out of the car and stretches
are those houses occupied
jack looks at the ruined hamlet on the hillside
i checked three days ago
we should check again
ill check alone
there are adders the mountains
ill be careful
her voice is curt
the trust she showed him in the car is gone now
they cross a meadow and make their way towards the ruined hamlet
the grass is long and the trees offer deep shade
jack walks in front to ward off any snakes
everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers
mathilde has never seen anything so beautiful
overwhelmed she stops
and watches her
she undergoes the same transformation that he did
then she comes to remembering herself
and walks on
a four foot asp viper slithers across jacks path
he claps his hands and the snake writhes for cover
jack walks on
mathilde follows pretending not to be frightened but walking closer to jack now scanning the long grass warily
jack scrambles up towards the houses checking the area for signs of recent disturbance
from beside the end building jack surveys the valley with a tiny pair of binoculars monitoring every square on the imaginary grid for human activity
you have tested the gun here before
satisfied that hes alone he lowers his binoculars
mathilde takes a deep breath of mountain air
its beautiful here
she is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was once a terraced field
her dress dips between her legs as she leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees tired from the journey and the long hot climb
i wish everywhere could be this tranquil
jack looks at her sensing a kindred spirit
youd be out of a job
you dont like the peace
its hard to like something you know nothing about
the wicker picnic hamper is sitting on a rug by between the parked car and the lake
from the hamper jack removes a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of aspirinio a loaf of course bread
two clods of mozarella gms of proscuitto gms of parma ham a large jar of pitted green olives a thermos of sweet black coffee and wrapped in cloth squares the
disassembled parts of the improved socimi submachine gun
as mathilde starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill jack checks the stopwatch on his rolex
it takes her approximately twenty eight seconds to assemble the bastardised gun including telescopic sights and sound suppressor and a further three seconds to slot the empty magazine into the
base of the hand grip snuggle the butt to her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight
shes almost ten seconds faster than jack
he stares at her not an alluring young woman with good legs and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and everything it means
ive made up two sorts
he reaches into the picnic hamper
thirty lead and thirty jacketed
i should like a hundred of each
its an order her voice is emotionless
and fifty explosive
not a problem
he hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge boxes the shells snug in little plastic trays
will mercury do
she smiles almost imperceptibly
mercury will do very nicely
she puts the gun down butt first leaning it against the side of the car
i have made my own targets
she reaches into her blue canvas sports bag and removes several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split bamboo cane
without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms
in her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass crickets honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer skirt sweeps across the flowers
watch out for vipers
he keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless waving with her right hand the hand holding the ammunition boxes
shes no fool
neither is he
he has the gun
at ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth stones a boundary cairn overgrown with little purple trumpet blooms
she unfolds the cardboard
at this distance all we can make out is a silver grey shape against the stones
returning to the car she picks up the weapon
at least three hundred and sixty miles per hour
thats including twenty off the top for the sound suppression
impressed mathilde looks at the marks on the metal where the serial number has been removed with acid
eight two one
ive not had one before
youll find it easy
ive re balanced it for the longer barrel
the fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now
which wont matter if youre firing and im guessing you are from a fixed position
no major recoil issues
you should be able to hold onto any target
even the smallest
mathilde puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and stands with her feet apart braced
the breeze beneath the walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against her legs
for a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the gun holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt would hold a bore
youve done a good job mr
thank you very much
she makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight with her fingernail
she cant have turned the vertical screw more than one notch
then she fully loads and fires again
jack lifts his binoculars and looks at the target
its the unmistakable outline of a boeing about one and a half metres long
painted against the cut out is the upturn at the end of the wing
the front doorway is shaded in
standing in it is the silhouette of a man
in the centre of his head are three small holes
with the magazine containing the remaining jacketed rounds mathilde takes aim again
through his binoculars jack can see the empty space where the targets head used to be the scarred stones behind and the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm
mathilde says nothing
she fills the magazine with lead rounds snaps it in place and hands the weapon to jack
go to the stones and fire near me
hes taken aback
she looks round for a target
into the bush with the yellow flowers
five seconds apart
slowly jack walks down to the stones turns and looks back
the citroen is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut tree
so is mathilde
in the poor light all he can see is her dress and her blouse
he wipes the sweat from his eyes and shuts them tightly
this is not just a weapon test
its a test of trust
he opens his eyes again
mathilde turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon
he aims the socimi at the yellow flowers right beside her
holds his breath
and pulls the trigger
mathilde remains untouched
so do the yellow flowers
troubled jack blinks rapidly and counts to five
then he fires again
through the sight we see two stems of yellow blossom fall sideways
relieved jack walks slowly back to the car
the sound suppression is superb
i couldnt place the direction of fire
from her sports bag she removes a plain brown manilla i shall require the rounds and the weapon by the first of next month
in the meantime would you tighten the adjusting screws on the sight they are too loose
and lengthen the stock by three centimetres
i also want a sixty round magazine
youll upset the balance
im prepared to accept that
then im happy to oblige
what about the a case
standard pattern in black with combination locks
is there a number youd prefer
eight two one
eight two one
mathilde hands him the envelope and disassembles the weapon
jack wraps the socimi parts up in their cloth squares and places them in the bottom of the picnic hamper
what do you want done with these
she has collected up the spent cartridge cases
throw them in the lake
she walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in
again the beauty of the place transfixes her
by the time she turns back jack has laid out the picnic
she picks up a bottle of wine
i dont know italian wine
like mosacata but frizzante
deftly he uncorks a bottle
and pours it into the grass
it wouldnt look right if the picnic wasnt touched
you chilled the wine
it had to be chilled
theyre italian cops
disappointed you think of everything
im paid to
jack points slowly
on her tanned forearm is a butterfly
they both stare at the insect transfixed
its so beautiful
she looks up at him
like its a revelation she says you like coming here
it serves its purpose
youve never taken a woman here before
jack is momentarily taken aback
the butterfly flits away
sadly perhaps you do not have a woman in your life
it is not easy for us to keep relationships
not in our world
i have an acquaintance
she waits for him to say more
friendships are transitory
suddenly theres movement in the bushes
jack snatches up his binoculars
mathilde scans the tree cover
he hands her the binoculars
and hurriedly packs up the picnic
her sunglasses back on mathilde watches the meadows slip backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back down the alpine track
i wish you hadnt brought me here
a real sadness
jack glances at her
this is the sort of place i wish id discovered by myself
then maybe one day i could have retired here
but you already know it
jack is touched
im much older than you
by the time youve retired ill be dead
the citroen pulls up
the young womans manner is once more tense and formal
we will meet as before
the distant sound of a diesel engine
the train is approaching
on the first of next month
he nods again
not even a nod this time just a slow blink
mathilde opens the door runs around to the boot and grabs her canvas sports bag
then returns to the passenger side of the car and looks in
thank you for a lovely day
she leans in
and kisses him lightly on the cheek her lips light and quick on his stubble
you must take your mistress to the meadow for a picnic
she closes the car door walks onto the platform and vanishes onto a waiting carriage
the train honks and belches moving off down the track in the direction from which it came
jack watches it go
and drives off
two old men drinking beer at the bar
two more at a table playing scopa with old fashioned trentine playing cards
sitting at the back of the room jack stares at a shot of grappa
above him mounted on the wall is a television
on the tv is a western charles bronson and henry fonda in once upon a jack downs his shot gets up and walks over to the bar
the barman nods at the screen
jack turns and looks
henry fonda in close up is about to shoot a red headed boy of seven in the head
just at the moment that the gun goes off
jack turns away
in poor english you like cow boy movie
then shakes his head
clara and jack are naked
jack tries to kiss her on the lips but clara turns away just enough to let him know this is against the rules
jack kisses her neck
as he moves his head between her legs her fingers already ensnared in his hair tighten their grip stopping him from going further
jack looks up at clara across her belly and she looks back at him her expression fixed yet curious
against her rules but not we sense against her wishes jack kisses clara softly tenderly deeply until she is moving against his tongue using her sex like a mouth to
kiss him in return
they make love breaking each of claras two remaining rules in turn
first jack puts her in a position she initially resists
then he kisses her
clara comes not wanting to
suddenly preoccupied jack does not
jack is in bed with clara
she looks at him
with certainty morboso
morboso is like
when you cant stop thinking about something
he stares back at her wordless
a long pause her eyes searching his
jack sits up lights a cigarette and stands by the window looking through the blind down into the street
you neednt act
clara watches him confused but fascinated
you might have to act with your other clients but you dont have to pretend anything at all with me
she lights herself a cigarette
i want you to be yourself with me
be as indifferent as you like
i came here to get pleasure not to give it
he hands her cash
she counts it
maybe i pretend very well
i got more tip than the other girls usually get
he walks to the door
i dont sleep with the other girls
jack is asleep
he is not alone
in the bed beside him pale as death
eyes rolled back in her sockets
jack wakes up suddenly gasping
the bed is empty the sheets twisted and damp
over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in all italy
in the gun metal light of dawn fiddly work cartridges taken apart tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely mm the hole half filled with mercury
and plugged with a drop of liquid lead
jack is converting jacketed ammunition into explosive outside the sun is merciless
inside jack has taken refuge in the cool of the church
he is alone
he is not praying
just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion at the thorns and the nails and the running blood
jack checks for reflections in his watch
its father benedetto dressed for mass
ive been looking for you
he mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his soutane takes jack by the arm and leads him to one side away from the light of the
a man was here asking questions about you
he came to the church this afternoon
what did he want
to know where you live
he said he was a friend from switzerland
and you told him
the priest looks at with complete disdain of course i do not tell him
how do i know him
he is maybe the police
certainly he is no friend
a friend would know your pensione
father benedetto leans close and whispers friends do not carry guns
father benedetto glances shrewdly at jack his eyes searching into him
if you live in italy and you are a man of the cloth you meet many people
besides i lived once in naples
if you live in naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a
custodia per armi di spalla
how you say in english
jack glances up and down the aisle
old ladies are dribbling into church in twos and threes
the bell for mass starts ringing
youre a true friend father
i am a priest
jack turns to go
again the priest leans close holding jack by the elbow in a gesture of austere confidence
i make a mistake
he did not say he was from la svizzera switzerland
he said forgive me the names in italian are so similar la svezia sweden
three bells are ringing in the tower
beneath them a row of mediaeval gargoyles dragons griffins dogs and devils look down over the little town their faces frightening or frightened
jack is among the gargoyles leaning over parapet his eyes made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars surveying the town below checking each square of the grid for a
glimpse of the nothing
then he notices parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far from the main square
with the young man we spotted in castelveccio market sitting at the wheel
the young man comes out of a shop
this is the first time weve seen him up close
in his early thirties hes wearing a dark brown leather jacket and expensive jeans
his blonde hair is cropped short and theres the hint of a botched prison cell tattoo visible just beneath the collar of his shirt
the young man opens a small silver tin and a single deft movement removes a portion of snus swedish chewing tobacco and inserts the it between his top lip and
it is a strangely sinister act
then he blends in with the tourists milling down the corso and round the square heading towards
jack is sitting in the window making himself as visible as possible to the world outside
he downs a grappa then gets up to pay for it
his movements are slow and leisurely
the barman hands him his change
and a small white envelope
jack is not expecting this
in italian someone left this for lamericano
jack looks at the envelope
he turns casually away from the barmans prying eyes and opens the envelope with extreme caution
inside is a folded cutting
its from the swedish daily newspaper ostersunds posten
jack unfolds the cutting
we catch a glimpse of ingrids dacha
a police line
three dead bodies in the snow the two hitmen and the girl
heart racing jack slips the cutting in his pocket
grabs three sugar cubes from a silver bowl on the bar
the young man is watching a puppet show in the middle of the square
the puppeteer is using glove puppets and the punch and judy style performance involves punch fucking judy with a grotesquely carved outsize sex organ
there is a large crowd gathered
jack leaves the bar turning left and walking purposefully down the street
the young man follows
its a hot summer night and there are more tourists than usual
the young man uses them as cover
jack turns down a dark deserted alleyway
the young man hesitates
his right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket
and he follows
were with the young man as he stalks his prey through the mediaeval maze of streets
we end up in the narrow alleyway that jack photographed on his first day in town
up ahead disappearing round a distant bend we catch a glimpse of jack his heels clacking on the cobbles
the young man follows swiftly his trainers silent
he gets to a crossroads where four narrow alleyways all identical converge
the young man is unsure which alleyway to take
the streets are empty
from an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late night film on television
its a romantic film the violins muffled and sad with longing
from another alleyway comes the sound of savage barking
the young man looks around for the source of the barking but the streets are empty
suddenly the barking stops
the young man looks confused
from his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable click of a cocking mechanism
were recognise the secret courtyard the one reached by means of the hidden archway
with one hand jack feeds another sugar cube to the mongrel
with the other hand he holds his walther behind his back
and cocks it
the young man is waiting at the far end of the alleyway hugging the wall scanning the crossroads ahead unsure which of the four possible alleyways holds his prey
jack emerges from the hidden archway and walks quickly up behind him
jack has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent
he has thirty metres to cover
the gun hangs heavy in his right hand
its fitted with a tac sound suppressor
he raises his right hand
the gun is pointing at the young man
his finger takes up the slack of the trigger
then a ducati turns into the alleyway behind jack its headlights on full beam
jack drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced walther deep into his jacket pocket
the young man looks his way
jack is outlined by the mopeds beam of light
the two men are face to face within spitting distance
the ducati hurtles towards the young man
the man on the ducati is wearing a tinted black crash helmet
the young mans eyes widen with fear
the ducati misfires
mistaking the sound for gunfire the young man drops rolls and fires back
we hear the sound of a single suppressed shot choop
the bullet grazes the front suspension of the ducati and lodges in the rear cowling
the man on the ducati swerves and crashes hitting a stone staircase
jack looks around
the young man has disappeared
the man on the ducati is out cold
the front wheel of his ducati turns slowly squeaking
a bullet hits the road not far from jack
another bullet hits the wall behind him
swiftly jack grabs hold of the battered s ducati
jack rides the classic ducati turning left and right without hesitation through archways down steps dropping level by level cursing in time with his jagged breathing until
jack emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on the winding road
all we can hear are the crickets
then the sound of a car
an audi tears past us following jack out of town
jack is heading for the mountains
he takes the first corner at mph
the audi gleams black in the moonlight
gaining on him
jack takes the next bend at top speed his classic cc engine howling
the audi slows then powers through the bend accelerating
the young man puts his foot down
the speedometer climbs
the audi comes up swiftly behind jacks ducati and tries to ram him
jack dodges the audi swerving from one side of the road to another
a soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley
the audi overtakes the ducati then swerves left trying to crush jack against the concrete barrier that masks a three hundred and fifty foot fall
jack breaks hard and the audi misses him smashing into the concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching metal
the audi follows the ducati into
long dark neon lit
and blind curved
the audi comes up fast behind the ducati
jack swerves the ducati onto the other side of the road
the audi swerves left and tries to crush jack into the left hand wall of the tunnel
suddenly a car comes round the bend
what happens next happens fast jack swerves left and skids into a service lay by narrowly avoiding the car
the lay by is small and jack has to slide the ducati on its side as he crashes it into the box like space
the lay by is too small for the audi
the audi and oncoming car collide
the audis crumple zones buckle as both vehicles bonnets concertina like a road safety test
the audi has air bags
the oncoming car does not
on impact its driver goes through the windscreen of his own car and onwards through the windscreen of the audi
the wreckage is awesome
deep within the mangled metal of the two cars
the young man groans and twitches
jack appears at the crumpled window of the audi
he reaches through the broken window grabs the young man by the head
and breaks his neck
jack washes away the worst of the dirt and the blood in a jack on the ducati
turns off at a sign for laquila
laquila is the nearest and largest town in the region
its also the location of the via lampedusa brothel
jack comes out of a pharmacy and quite literally bumps into he winces with pain
you are hurt
whats wrong with you
its nothing really
just a broken rib
un costollo rotta
let me help you
i came off my bike
but you have to go to the hospital
no no no
i have pain killers
i just need a strong cup of coffee
i know a place which make the strongest coffee in laquila
her limpid brown eyes twinkle
a small simply furnished bedroom with a bed a desk and a chair
as he sips a large cup of strong black coffee clara cleans a vicious welt on his right shoulder blade
as the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite tattoo
of a butterfly
his eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly
why dyou call me that
you have a tattoo
on your back
but not completely
the situation at the beginning of the movie is perfectly reversed
from the relative safety of castelvecchio jack watches castel del monte through binoculars the phone box
the pensione dabruzzo
no sign of the police
no sign of any shadow dwellers
jack is in his usual phone box
his manner is quietly purposeful
how did he know i was here larry
you think i hired him
are you out of your fucking mind jack
i doubt it
after everything ive done for you
the car the cell phone which you threw away the safehouse the fake passport
someone has to pay for this shit jack
i have to pay for this shit
it comes out of my commission
youre my lousy profit margin
why the fuck would i take a contract out on my own profit margin
youre not thinking straight
i was the one who told you to leave town
i told you to come to rome
god damn it youve got a job to do
why the hell would something smacks into the phone box at high speed
jack drops to his knees and reaches for his walther
outside the phone box three teenagers are kicking a football around
tins of fruit drops three kinds black cherry pineapple and lemon
each tin is emptied of its fruit drops
twenty rounds of ammunition each round packed in silica fit exactly into each tin
lead rounds in the black cherry jacketed in the pineapple and explosive in the lemon
jack re seals each tin with sellotape
the colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded with window shoppers tourists taking coffee old men discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and chattering like songbirds
jack is in dark glasses
hes sitting in a coffee shop under the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of il messagiero
we see hes studying a small column concerning the murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of chieti
jack spots clara walking along the corso
shes with a girl he has not seen before
anna is small town girl with a keen sense of fashion
she and clara are hand in hand
clara sees jack and speaks to her friend
they cross through the throng of boulevardiers
my friend anna
this is my friend signor farfalla
claras eyes twinkle mischievously
the girls cease to hold hands and anna offers hers to jack
jack half rises like the perfect gentlemen folding his newspaper and accepting annas greeting
how do you do
i am very well thank you
this is to be an impromptu english lesson
jack acquiesces gracefully
will you take a coffee with me
that would be very good
he indicates two empty chairs
clara moves her chair to sit closer to jack
under the table her knee presses against his
anna also moves her chair nearer to jack but her motive is to move it out of the sun
she is not flirting
anna is learning english
have you been to england
anna seems momentarily confused
but you are
she looks at clara
jack glances at clara
how much has she told her friend
i have not been to england only to france
but i would love to go to america
the waiter comes over
due cappuccini e un cafe corretto
anna is like all italians
she thinks america is like in the movies
little italy west side story chicago
clara contd i tell her in these times america is like here there anywhere
the streets are not
pave ed with gold
she beams happily at jack
he smiles back at her
if not with gold than at least not with enough medieval cobbles to loosen every self tapping screw in a fiat
neither girl understands
but everyone smiles happily
the waiter brings the coffee and clara insists on paying
where do you come from anna
jack plays teacher
i live in via dell argilla
nearby to clara
jack briefly wonders what else he could teach her
he scans both girls and decides clara is the prettier
clara seems to sense this
she smiles to herself
jack is touched
we cut wide and watch jack talk inconsequentialities with the girls
they stand to go
perhaps we will have a drink together soon
i am free
her words sound rehearsed
she considers a crowded timetable
ill see you then
where would you like to meet
jack is not expecting this
clara looks at him mischievously
anna is listening
how about our usual place
our usual place
she feigns complete perplexity
where is our usual place
the twinkle in her eye
shes testing him
jack is the perfect gentleman
maybe we should try something different
where would you like to try eduardo
jack spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the road
there is no warmth in his suggestion
but clara doesnt care
she looks genuinely delighted
this is the best food in the area
youll be there
ill be there
see you then eduardo
see you then clara
it was a delight to meet you anna
arrivederci signor farfalla
there is an unmistakable twinkle in annas eye
how much she knows is uncertain
she kisses him swiftly and softly on the cheek
clara does the same on the lips
behind the mischief in her eyes is something doubtful
has she gone too far
jack visits three stores in a photographic shop he buys half a dozen film protection in a haberdashers he purchases several packets of hooks and eyes like the kind you
find on brassieres
in a office supply shop he buys some custom made headed notepaper invoice books notepads envelopes metal pens a calculator and a mobile phone
jack opens a black combination lock samsonite briefcase and lines the bottom and sides with the lead lined film protection bags cut to fit
into the base of the briefcase he glues pre shaped pieces of firm grey plastic foam
these form the pockets into which he slots the constituent parts of the socimi submachine gun
they fit perfectly
over this jack uses the hooks and eyes to clip a false bottom a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom made headed notepaper invoice books notepads and
to the briefcases central divider he adds the metal pens a calculator and a mobile phone
he sets the combination to
then shuts and locks the briefcase
this done he sits on the bed and stares at the case
with his work complete he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness
a small park not far from castel del montes town square
it is just after dawn
the pine trees and the poplars are silent
the sun is not yet up but the day is light
sparrows hop about searching for crumbs
jack ravaged by lack of sleep wonders about like the demon of a lost darkness looking for his hole down to the underworld
hes twenty meters away his hand raised in half welcome half benediction
they greet one another and father benedetto falls into slow step with jack
the priest walks with his hands behind his back
jack with his hands in his pockets
i walk here to meditate
once a week wednesday the farthest one can travel in the week from the sabbath
the trees are like the stations of the cross by certain trees i thank god for certain favours he has granted me or certain gifts he has made to me
and all men
for example here by this pine i thank him for the many friendships i have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled
they reach a cypress tree and father benedetto bows his head in prayer
after a while he says some walk here in the cool of evening
others come at night
there is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself i wonder how many bastards have been made here
he gives a small sideways glance at jack
perhaps youll stay and settle here yourself
what makes you think im leaving
you told me as much when we first met
besides those who seek for peace seldom find it
theyre always moving on looking elsewhere
a beat and they are usually sinners
all men are sinners
some are greater sinners than others
and those who seek peace have much sinning in their history
i dont seek peace
i never have
perhaps ill stay
this is the priest in me speaking
and the friend
but you have done much sinning signor clarke
you still do
i see a whore
shes young enough to be my daughter
i do not refer to the sins of carnality
but to the deadly sins
arent all sins equal
we are not discussing theology my friend but you
you like this town this valley
father benedetto contd you should like to remain here and find your peace at last
yet you cannot
there is something you cannot ignore
jack is silent
you want to speak but you dare not
you know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them
you know i am trustworthy yet still you are cautious
father benedetto stops compelling jack to stop too and face him
what job do you do signor
are you on the run as they say
its an expression no
everyones on the run from something
some men watch some of the shadows
you watch them all
ive done nothing i didnt have good cause to do
do you wish to tell me
for what reason
for your own sake
perhaps i can pray for you
a change of pace
i make things
why do you say that
you work in metal
you are given some steel by fabio the car doctor
you know a lot about me
i know only what you do in the town
people talk to me
i am their priest and they trust me
and i should too
they stare at one another
jack wants to confess
he does not know why
but he doesnt
he does something were not expecting fabio
the car doctor
was he conceived here father
father benedetto is motionless
why do you ask me that
he looks like you
even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other
where was he conceived father
under one of these trees
like all the other bastards
there is a very very long pause
father benedetto stares up at jack with extraordinary intensity
i do not remember signor
it was twenty five years ago
father benedetto walks
a gust of wind makes dust swirl from the gravel path
the two men do not speak again until they reach the next set of cyprus trees
in the end it is i who confesses to you
expecting me to reciprocate
for your own good
you cannot doubt the existence of hell
you live in it
it is a place without love
as for me i go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me
some know what you know
perhaps i have no right to wear these robes
but i do have a heart full of a fathers love
something close to his heart
and for that i am both grateful and happy
what do you have my friend
another gust of wind
the priest looks up into jacks face
the assassins eyes are red and stinging
perhaps its from the dust
jack dresses very carefully for dinner
it is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda that overlooks the town
overhead a canopy of vine and jasmine
above that a sky full of stars
of the thirty or so candle lit tables that dot the veranda more than half are occupied by romantic couples
jack scans the tables and checks his watch
its shortly after seven pm and theres no sign of clara
then turns to leave
she kisses him once on the lips
shes hot and flustered
shes been rushing
i did not think you would come
i wasnt sure you meant me to
clara looks doubtful
its the same look she gave him at the cafe
she is breaking the golden rule of prostitution
her heart is pulling one way and her head another
a waiter approaches
judging by his disapproving tone the waiter seems to know what clara does for a living
clara senses this immediately
clara and jack sit at a table overlooking the town
the waiter lights their candle and deposits two menus peremptorily
una botiglia di acqua minerale non gasata et
una parasini per favore
completely ignoring her the waiter addresses jack with a wink
menu in inglese
to the waiter he speaks italian
so do i
she repeats her order articulating each word emphatically like a teacher to a slow school child una botiglia di acqua minerale et una parasini per favore
she isnt upset
its just her way of letting both men know that shes in charge
the waiter turns to her deferring to her strength of character
he nods with some genuine deference and leaves
mostly to herself cittadina
clara smiles back
they have this contempt in common
the waiter reappears and pours a thumbful of wine
it is pale red in colour and frizzante
at claras insistence jack tastes it
it is dry and has a tar like aftertaste
it is good you will agree
he looks at her and for a brief moment he undergoes what is a unique experience for him a positive longing to repeat this brief moment many times in the
clara catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms
can i ask you something eduardo
you are married
i doubt any of the couples here are
with the exception of the germans at table seven
shes wearing a wedding ring and they havent spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes
i was sure this was your secret
what makes you think i have a secret
im an ordinary man
i earn a living
jack observes a gypsy selling roses
i do not think you are an ordinary man
i think you are a good man
but you have a secret
the gypsy approaches offering clara a rose
she refuses firmly
he thinks we are a couple
jack signals to the gypsy and buys clara a rose
why spoil the illusion
she looks at him and smiles
in italian as long as we know it is an illusion
her smile is only a little bit sad
still jack doesnt know what to say
they are saved by the appearance of the waiter
clara orders full of italian charm putting jack at his ease
he watches her contentedly the way she talks and moves
jack and clara are walking
he has a cigarette in his mouth
they look like film stars
clara slips her arm through his
they say nothing
the pedestrian shopping street is thronging with other couples
the coffee bar has an outside section
clara and lamericano are seated in a throng of happy youngsters claras age
jack is the oldest person there
the waitress brings two glasses of prosecco
she puts a small silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of jack
in front of clara she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae
clara grins at her sundae like a little girl
shes a bit drunk
she eats savoring the ice cream
jack watches savoring her pleasure
how is it
its come se dice slang no
she scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce and holds it out to jack
come on eduardo
it is good you will agree
his mouth full i will agree
sensing his teasing my english is nice
defending herself you know how to swear in italian
try mangia merde e morte tuo cazzo un brufolo
eat shit and die pimple dick
i guess ive led a sheltered life
too much work
claras cell phone starts to ring
its on silent but the screen is flashing just visible where it sticks out of her handbag
clara looks down at the phone
too much work
she turns the phone to silent
and looks up at jack
i dont apologise eduardo
for this i do
he means it
except this job is full of testa di cazzo
but you are too young to
would you be flattering me if i wasnt a client
hes put clara on the spot
am i a client
clara takes a deep breath
this say yes
she points at her head
she points at her heart
this cannot be for sale
but i am not want to
come se dice
give it away
she looks at him
jack studies her searching for his own feelings
i buy you a present
she fishes about in her handbag
and produces a silver box
jack unwraps the shiny paper
inside is a plastic case like the sort you put engagement rings in
inside the case is a badge hand painted depicting the symbol of the region the eagle of laquila
jack sticks the badge in his lapel
an embarrassed beat
clara kisses him
my apartment is not far from here
jack opens his eyes
hes shocked to have slept so deeply
clara must be in the shower
he looks around at the little room casually like a curious lover
opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet
finds a vibrator
opens the bottom drawer
finds a red purse
inside the red purse
finds a beretta double action model a bobcat
just at that moment clara comes out of the bathroom
jack shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep
jack has driven to the remotest phone box he can find not far from the entrance to one of the regions four national parks beside a lake below a mountain
range and approached by a long straight empty road
no one could possibly creep up on him here
nevertheless as he talks jack makes his habitual and continuous scan of the area
were moving the drop
we dont know yet
ill call you ten am on the day with a venue
give you enough time to make the noon delivery
i dont deliver larry
i never deliver
its too dangerous
she comes to me
i know the town
thats what we agreed
i told em
i told em if there was even the slightest chance security had been breached youd have dealt with it immediately
for the first time in the movie we cut to larry at home larry is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a large imperial mahogany desk
in front of him are two banks of screens
the first bank displays cctv views the entrance to his apartment block a staircase and the entrance to his apartment itself
another bank of screens shows news channels cnn bbc world and al jazeera
our pretty young belgian client and her associates think someone on your long list of enemies might have put a tail on you
course not jack
but if for the sake of argument it was possible im thinking it could be galazzo
or italian undercover
the crooked kind
how come im still here
the belgians think theyre planning to wait for the drop and exterminate you and mathilde in one swoop
with the help of his desktop computer larry is comparing the scrolling share prices on cnn with the fluctuating value of the us dollar
where the hells this information coming from
im fucked if i know jack
if you want my opinion theyre just being jittery
i told em you were the most security conscious professional i know
i told em no one gets close to you
i told em if we couldnt trust you to keep a tight lid on operations the who could we trust
they can trust me and so can you
jack is tense
every word is carefully enunciated ive never jeopardised an operation in my life
you dont have to tell me that jack
for christs sake you closed your own girlfriends account
ecu on jack
the words are out before he can stop them
a beat jack
he rubs his eyes wearied by his own insensitivity
that was um
im just saying you can be relied on
jack has hung up
he is lost in fearful thought jaw muscles grinding
amongst the gargoyles
jack looking through his miniature binoculars
of clara seated in a cafe talking to a slick tough young italian man in a suit
he is showing her photographs
of what we cannot see
clara looks very very serious
the young italian man leaves
jack watches him get into a smart black alfa romeo containing two other italian men
when he looks back at the cafe clara has gone
jack opens his picnic hamper and in it he puts a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of aspirinio a loaf of course bread two
clods of mozarella gms of proscuitto and his walther ppk s
clara is waiting on the via strinella near the entrance to the parco della resistanza sheltering in the shade of a tree
she is holding the red purse
at her feet is blue plastic bag rounded out by a watermelon
jack pulls his car into the curb
she opens the passenger door leans in and kisses jack long and full on the lips
put them in the back
weve got a way to go
she puts the plastic bag in the trunk
inside the trunk is the picnic hamper
clara climbs in and fastens her seat belt
she puts the red purse between her legs
jack glances at the and drives
where we go
how far do we go
and were not going to the sea were going to the lakes
in the mountains
come se dice
you have in the back
a pick nick
we are going for a pick nick
just the two of us
she looks at him
i have practise my english eduardo
i love to have pick nick
it is a beautiful day isnt it
the car negotiates a familiar hairpin bend
clara is station hopping
she finds some lou reed
she loves loud reed
jack is concentrating on the road
is it more far
another twenty minutes
she pauses to work out the mathematics
but shes not frightened
in twenty minutes
were going off the beaten track
she looks confused
you will speak italian
one day i will teach you
jack turns off the main road and onto an alpine track
this is the same route he took with the belgian woman
the car bumps and tilts on the rough terrain
clara is startled by such an insignificant track
where are we going
now shes anxious
this is not what she expected
you shall see
i think it is good we should stay close to the road
theres no need to worry
ive been here before several times
he swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the citroen pitches as if struck by a wave
clara clings to the door with her right hand her left hand dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself
youre not afraid of coming into the wild with me are you
she laughs tensely
of course i am not
not with you
she snaps her fingers
she waves her hand in the air
you should have a jeep
it is not good for a
its as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her english
this is a citroen
he strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand
this was made by the french for taking potatoes to market
besides i always come here in this car
i dont want to walk back to town any more than you do
i think you are crazy
this will go to nowhere
i assure you it does
she pouts her reply
the track disappears into a wood and runs out altogether giving way to grass
now there is no road
jack stops the car and turns the engines off
clara lets go of the seat
is this where we go
they are surrounded by trees
we go another hundred metres through the wood
but from here we just roll forward
and youll see a wonder
she grips the seat again
you wont need to hold on
ill go slowly
just relax and look
he eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move forward the springs squeaking slightly
after metres jack twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes
they roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample walnut beyond them is the lake the meadows
and the ruined hamlet
the hidden valley is a riot of colour the blooms and blossoms more brilliant than weve ever seen them
by the edge of the lake stands a heron still as fence post
clara gets out of the car dumbstruck
jack gets out too
he watches her
then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through his miniature binoculars
by the time clara turns towards him the binoculars are hidden
no one comes here
she speaks so quietly jack can barely hear her
clara turns away unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the grass
she is wearing no bra
on her back dapple the shadows and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut
she kicks off her shoes which curve through the air
and unzips her skirt
it falls to the grass
she bends and steps daintily from her knickers
then turns to face jack
jack cannot take his eyes off her
dizzy he steps forward without meaning to
she is coquettish and tosses her auburn hair to one side
i am going to swim in the lake
are you coming
she doesnt wait for his reply but turns and runs through the grass towards the water
there are vipers
but i am lucky
the heron flies off rising from the reeds with an ungainly flapping
shouting he is an italian bird
we disturb his siesta
quickly jack glances inside the citroen
the red purse is nowhere to be seen
come signor farfalla
as he removes his clothes he stalls for time using the cover of undressing to search for the red we can see it wedged under the passenger seat
due to the design of the car jack cannot
jack turns to face the lake
he is naked
yet with the caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he reaches the waters edge
clara is standing in the middle
stand by me
he obeys her order
he walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water holding it out in front of them
jack spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake bed
brassy and gleaming
a spent shell
he covers it with his foot
as the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds tiny fish appear in a shoal to gather about their hands
they hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move in to nibble at the skin on their fingers
if we stay here for a year theyll devour us
it is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding then love is good for the people
he looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in his head
she kisses him pressing herself against him her skin and body as pure and warm as the water
he tries helplessly to pull away
maybe we should
do you make love in the water
she places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from the smooth stones wrapping her legs around his waist
she tries to push herself onto him but he resists
he doesnt know what to say
she looks at him confused searching
he walks towards the bank
the tiny fish dart around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds travelling with the waves made by their departure
clara is lying naked on a blanket
beside her is the red purse
through sleepy half closed eyes she is watching lamericano
from her pov jack is kneeling behind the open picnic hamper unpacking the food and wine
the lid of the basket obscures his hands
jack looks at her
is this your real name
is clara yours
she looks at him
waiting for his reply
edward is my real name
she doesnt believe him
you are sure you are not married eduardo
about this hes telling the truth
clara reaches for the red purse
from behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the click of a cocking mechanism
clara hesitates for a moment
jack watches her intently
she reaches into her purse
jack is expressionless
when clara withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of a beat
jack watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin rubbing it around her breasts pushing them aside pressing them upwards
then she caresses the lotion into her belly and down her thighs bending at the waist as she works it into her shins
will you put this on my back
she proffers him the suntan lotion
jack stares at her baking body transfixed by its terrible and perfect beauty
hidden behind the lid of the picnic hamper
his trembling right hand grips tightly to his walther
a long pause
time seems to stop
ecu on jack
suddenly clara sits up
eduardo whats wrong
when he speaks his mouth his dry
when he moves towards her he is holding nothing in his hands
he takes the tube of suntan lotion
dear father benedetto
and begins to run it into claras back
i promised myself that i would write to you as your friend to say goodbye
jack shuts the boot of the car
he scans the lakeside
no sign of the picnic
no sign of clara
everything ive ever done
then he spots something
on the ground not far from the car
he walks over and picks it up
its one of claras shoes
ive done for a reason
jack is staring at the shoe
i never thought the day would come when id run out of reasons
reasons to worry
reasons to run
reasons to pull the trigger
jack turns and walks over to the car
clara is in the passenger seat
maybe that days come
jack gets into the citroen
or maybe ive just found a reason to change
and hands clara her shoe
i still dont understand
whats the point of a gun if its not loaded
one of the girls borrow it to me after the second hooker in chieti is murdered
with some of the clients it make me feel safe
i dont tell the police of course but
how they do to these two women
a police agente from rome show me photographs
they show photographs to everyone in via lampedusa
clara shivers with disgust
how one person hurt another in this way
jack looks lost like a man drained of all resolution
does the gun make you feel safer with me
you are not a client
then whys it in your purse
clara looks unhappy
i have to work tonight amore
jack looks away
maybe this is suicide
cops often put the graft on working girls
perhaps the girl i told you about clara has sold me out
contd maybe shes a cop herself or maybe shes a hired gun
then again maybe clara is who she says she is and my belgian clients will take the gun shoot me themselves and keep the money
always a risk in my profession
or perhaps my trusted colleague in rome no longer trusts me
perhaps even you father with your connections in naples
what will you do
i guess ill go to work too
and after that
tomorrow and the next day
i cant stay here forever
as the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he could
its not that ive given up on life father
just the way that i was living it
if you can call it living
i want always to stay here
its time to go home
let me come to your home
i cant clara
shes upset but decides not to press her demand
if i had one request father it would be this
that its not clara who finally pulls the trigger
but whoever it is
clara kisses him and simply says stay forever here
by this time tomorrow ill be dead
fade to black
a postman hands the mail to father benedetto
ciao fabio come stai
bene grazie padre
we follow father benedetto inside as he rifles through a bunch of church circulars
one letter catches his eye
he opens it and starts to read aloud dear father benedetto
i promised myself that i would write to you as your friend to say goodbye
jack stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit the black samsonite briefcase in his hand
he surveys his room
all evidence of his existence has been meticulously tidied away
everything ive ever done
only thing is left behind the book of medieval italian art architecture on the bedside table
ive done for a reason
the sun is shining
the mountains young and sharp and beautiful
the car moves swiftly across the viaduct that spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel
jack watches the road
on the long straights he looks backwards and forwards
jack comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a forecourt consisting of several rows of agip and q pumps a convenience shop a repair garage and
the car park is not large
jack parks the citroen facing the exit
there is a single bar across it but this is raised
jack double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and slips his walther into his jacket pocket
stepping out of the car he looks around the car park
its only a quarter full and ominously quiet
somewhere in the distance we can hear a sound creak creak creak creak
jack takes the briefcase from the rear seat and walks away
he makes a show of locking the car but doesnt
as he approaches the cafe he passes the garage
we see the source of the creak creak creaking sound a sign for engine oil on hinges revolving slowly in the breeze
jack sits at a table at the back of the cafe
from here he can see both entrances the public entrance and the service entrance and also the door to the bathrooms
through the window he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the slip road to and from the autostrada
jack places the briefcase on a chair beside him and puts a paper bag on the table next to the sugar dispenser
he checks his watch
it is two minutes before noon
he orders an espresso
his nerve heightened senses take in everything the sound of the cicadas the buzz of the neon strip lights and the creak creak creak of the engine oil sign outside
jacks eyes flick outside to the forecourt
we hear the cafe door open
and in an instant mathilde is at his table
she is dressed in a tight black skirt a simple blue blouse and a dark blue jacket
her hair is neatly styled her make up immaculate and heavier than weve seen her wear before
she looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a samsonite briefcase
i see you have brought it in from the car with you
she speaks quietly her voice low and attractive
all there as agreed
whats in the paper bag
the waitress comes over with jacks coffee
mathilde orders another for herself
for your journey
she opens the bag and takes out one of the tins
she can immediately feel that its heavier than it should be
i guessed youd have a sweet tooth
that is most thoughtful of you
the polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight belgian accent
the waitress returns with the second espresso and mathilde pays for them both
jack watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it
i suppose ill read about this in the times or the international herald tribune
or il maessagiero
for a moment she is pensive
yes i expect so
she drinks her coffee holding her cup in mid air and looking out the window
jack follows her eye line to check shes not signalling to an accomplice
the forecourt is still empty
creak creak creak creak
mathilde looks at jack
her expression is impossible to read
perhaps its tinged with sadness
she drinks the rest of her coffee
im just going to the ladies
she picks up the case
there is nothing jack can do about this
she has taken him off guard and grasped the initiative
all he can do is wait
mathilde enters a cubicle opens the case bypasses the stationary lifts the false bottom and checks the socimi parts are present and correct
then she loads a magazine
mathilde returns from the bathroom
shall we go
not a question a command
jack is obliged to stand up
mathilde walks towards a large ford
she is carrying the briefcase
jack has his right hand in his jacket pocket
you wont need your piece
the slang word belies her
for an instant she has forgotten her belgian accent
she sounds american
you never know
she stops beside the ford
jack still has his hands on the walther
everythings just fine
she definitely sounds american now
her right hand slips into her pocket
jack twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever
she hands jack an envelope
buy yourself a retirement clock
her american accent shows that shes letting her guard down
maybe its designed to make jack do the same
how do you know im retiring
she leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips
have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet
jack doesnt answer
his whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming
perhaps there is a second person in the car
a coach pulls into the car park
it stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of teenage kids descend
mathilde looks both irritated and relieved
whispers to jack do it
she gets into the drivers seat of the ford and swings the briefcase into the back
jack tenses as mathilde raises her hand in farewell
the ford pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada
jack watches it go
thumbs back the lever on his walther
gets into his citroen
and opens the envelope
just a hundred thousand us dollars
jack stares at the money
he isnt supposed to be alive
for a while he stays put
he shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids
to a girl calling amore
to the cicadas
to the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada
jack drives fast
turning off the highway beneath a sign for laquila
at the end a small street jack parks his car like a true italian illegally
runs towards claras apartment
and rings the buzzer
jack rings again
shouts up at her window were at another roadside service station
larry comes out of a kentucky fried chicken
he climbs into the passenger seat of the ford
mathilde drives off
larry is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt
hes about to get his hands dirty and he doesnt like it
not only did you not kill him you gave him my fucking money
what else could i do
there were kids everywhere
besides hes suspicious
thats why im paying you the gdp of a small country to get close to him
you could have got him in the sack
you should have got him in the car park
now youre going to have to take him out long range
i prefer it that way
she is a trained assassin
she respects jack
the socimi is the perfect weapon
lets hope his workmanship is up to scratch
he slams a full magazine into the butt of a sterling sweden turned jack into a liability
three stiffs two shooters and an innocent civilian
i cant afford a mistake like that again
europol are crooked but they arent cheap
jacks supposed to make me money
not run up cleaning bills
he made short work of the last guy you hired
never mind larson
he didnt stand a chance not against someone as paranoid as jack
the swede was only there to take jacks heat off you
so dont fuck this up again
he grabs a tin of fruit sweets
mind if i help myself
larry opens the tin to find it full of ammunition
he looks around the ford
is there any actual candy in this gas guzzler
jack turns off under the sign for castel del monte
the town square is jam packed with cars and coaches
hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church steps
there is even a camera crew
the church doors open and father benedetto steps out to a huge cheer
behind him local men are carrying a larger than life painted wooden statue of saint dominic
draped over the saints shoulder and wrapped around his neck are around twenty five or thirty live snakes local viperi each one several feet long and as thick as a
a local band strikes up as the statue is carried down the steps father benedetto leading the strange annual religious parade around the town square followed by a group of
altar the giant ford pulls up outside the towns only proper hotel
mathilde gets out carrying the samsonite briefcase
jack is looking for someone
the square is so tightly packed its hard to see let alone move
then he spots her
shes on the other side of the square standing on the stone steps beneath a statue of an eagle
her friend anna is beside her taking photographs of the parade with a small digital camera
jack moves towards clara
anna through her viewfinder is the first to notice him
she points jack out to clara
clara waves at him
she says something to anna and descends into the crowd
jack and clara squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another as we cut to
mathilde emerges through the fire escape door and walks to the edge of the roof
she opens the black samsonite case and unpacks the top layer of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of the socimi submachine gun
expertly she assembles the bastardised gun including telescopic sights and sound suppressor slotting a full magazine into the base of the hand grip snuggling the butt to her shoulder and
placing her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight
in the centre of the cross hairs
jack and clara meet
she kisses him
it is a long and loving kiss
the cross hairs find the centre of jacks head
taking up the trigger slack
kids on their parents shoulders keep blocking our view of jack
the trigger finger hesitating
were right in the midst of the crowd
jack and clara have to shout at one another above the noise of the band
when can i see you
i have to work tonight
their happiness clouds over
but the clouds pass quickly
you come to my apartment after
if i asked you would you come away with me
come away with you
then when were through we could come back here
unless you have other plans
she swears in italian
then throws herself around jack and squeezes him with all her strength
there are tears in her eyes
i love you signor eduardo farfalla
he looks at her
the trigger finger squeezes
the socimi submachine fires
an explosive bullet travels down the chamber at approximately miles per hour headed straight for jacks temporal lobe
only it never gets there
the gun jams
a chamber explosion is a nasty thing
instead of shooting out of the barrel the round explodes in the cannons chamber
hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine ripping into mathildes hands forearms and face
a loud bang pulls jack and clara apart
amidst the noise of the festival no one else seems to notice
jack looks in the direction of the hotel roof
someone got what was coming to them
he turns to her go to your apartment and pack
wait till i get there
dont answer the door to anyone but me
she looks at him
i trust you
she wants to but she doesnt
my name is not eduardo
my name is jack
she looks worried
you promise youre not married
he hands her an envelope
it contains his final instalment
look after it
perplexed in case
he wants to say it but he cant bring himself to
in case this is goodbye
larry is waiting on the corner of the town square
he is dialling and re dialling a number in his mobile phone scanning the crowds around him
in the two seconds it takes the taxi to pass by jack steps free of a row cars on the other side of the street
as larry comes into view again jack sees the sterling submachine gun in his hands
and larry sees jack
larrys finger tightens on the trigger
lamericano throws himself to one side
there is a quick burst of popping explosions ripping along the line of parked cars
jack is about to fire back at larry but larry takes cover behind a tourist and fires back another brief burst
jack is hit in the shoulder
he drops his gun
and retrieves it just as larry fires again
screams spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire moving down the street and spilling into the town square
jack runs into the square
larry pursues him firing for a third time
the buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo around the square bouncing off the walls and confusing the crowd
people start to run in different directions everyone heading for the maze of alleys that surround the main square
altar boys scatter
so do the local men carrying the statue of saint dominic
the statue tumbles and smashes
escaping snakes writhe
father benedetto takes cover
the two local carabinieri in their land rover get caught up in the chaos
confused they turn on their sirens
larry spots jack in the crowd and fires a fourth time
one tourist is killed outright another injured jack dives for cover behind the statue of the eagle where he spotted clara
youre too old for this life jack
larry struggles for breath as he reloads
this is jacks chance
you get sentimental then you fuck things up
rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle jack spreads his legs faces larry and fires the customary two precision engineered shots that make up a military style
execution the first shot hits larry in the heart
larry is thrown backwards against a parked car accidentally altering his arc of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside jack chips of marble stinging against his calves
again jack takes aim
a beat as his finger tightens on the trigger
half larrys face is wiped out of existence
whats left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees
his hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops
he falls forwards and his sterling clatters on the cobble stones
not even the sound of a siren
the town square is empty
except for father benedetto hiding in the wreckage of the broken statue
jacks walther hangs ominously by his side
father benedetto stands unsteadily
like lightening jack spins instinctively raising his walther and zeroing in on father benedetto
his face is devoid of all emotion
he is a bloody machine looking at a potential target
we hear sirens
across a slew of dead bodies jack keeps the gun pointed at father benedetto stands stock still facing jack
the sirens get louder
what will you tell them
father benedetto takes something from inside his soutane
and holds it up with a trembling hand
i will them that the man who wrote this letter is my friend
father benedetto smiles sadly
father benedetto shuts his eyes muttering a quiet prayer
the sirens get closer
we hear carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out of their cars cocking submachine guns
when father benedetto opens his eyes again
jack has disappeared
using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes that make up the medieval heart of the town jack avoids the carabinieri and stealing a bicycle makes it onto the
main road before a road block has been set up
jack collects a sports bag from a locker
jack washes the blood from his hands
when he emerges from the bathroom jack is wearing the clothes of a fifty year old american tourist from the mid west with glasses and a baseball cap
he checks the time of next bus to rome
then glances at his watch
he has thirty minutes
jack walks towards claras apartment building
two hundred metres up ahead two officers of the guardia di finanza wait in an unmarked car
jack walks past claras apartment building
and keeps walking
the bus for rome is barely half full
blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged american tourists jack boards the steps purchases a ticket and takes a seat at the rear
a long tunnel one of the longest in europe
jack alone at the back of the bus
it seems like night red stripes strip lights shadows
vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes
a button of light expanding
as we burst into daylight
