written by christopher landon revised by carl ellsworth march tense do you think he sees us
no he cant see us
but he feels us watching
a few feet beneath the surface
something shimmers in the sunlight
as ripples dissipate we make out the shape of a bright yellow crankbait waiting patiently for its prey on the end of a pound line
we hold on this for another silent beat
then a huge black bass suddenly swoops into frame circling the bait
both startle at the sight
kale a clean cut all american kid reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel
whoa did you see that thing
kale anxiously winds the spool settle down slow it down
jeff lightly puts his hand on kales slowing the cranking to a slight steady pull as we widen to reveal them standing near the stern of their foot bassmaster
the undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as we move closer to kale and jeff taking note of their t shirts jeffs has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of
a bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its fins
beneath it the slogan weapons of bass destruction
the fish on kales shirt wears a stock car uniform a single word across the bottom basscar
as jeff steadies kales hand and pulls away you dont want to scare him off
youve got his attention now just play with him
tease him a little
kale and jeff watch the water in anxious silence
kale inching the line back toward the boat
one more crank then the black bass suddenly attacks the lure with a tremendous holy shit
its all you kale keep cranking
kale cranks fast and furious
but this is one fish thats going down fighting
i need reinforcements
jeff moves in grabs the rod and reel from behind kale
the rod curls under the weight
pirate accent give it all ya got mate or youre gonna lose him
laughing pulling struggling dad your pirate impersonation sucks
how would ya know have ya ever met one
i doubt it the bass sloshes furiously around the bait now just a few feet from the boat
hes freakin pulling us in
no brecht has ever lost a fight to a fish
the bass suddenly snaps free
the line goes limp
jeff and kale lose their balance nearly falling backward
then continued d
all becomes silent save for jeff and kales heavy breathing
kale winds the empty line back to the boat shoots a glance to jeff then throws the rod aside in mock disgust
jeff takes a seat in the captains chair
throw me a kale is already in the cooler
he throws jeff a coke
both sit in silence for a beat
then hey at least the weathers great
were spending quality time together
grabbing pole that fish is going down
not missing a beat lets nab the bastard
they both cast their lines an amber glow sets the mountainside ablaze as jeffs suv winds through the serpentine pass
kales on his cell kale contd into phone as needed hey mom its us
listen fire up the grill cause the bassmasters are headed home
jeff slaps kale five as he veers the suv into the left lane passing a slow moving pathfinder
kales attractive mom julie on cordless preps dinner
so i can actually put the burgers away this time
yes be gone with the red meat
jeff grabs the phone from kale
into phone as needed were having fish for a week
kale smiles as a lincoln navigator pick up zooms past in the right lane swerves back in the left lane in front of them
over the above id say an hour
love you too
jeff flips the phone shut tosses it to kale
they exchange smiles
a silent moment passes
they both turn to face the road as suddenly swerves back into the right lane revealing a directly in front of them
jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of kale as he swings the wheel hard right and slams on the brakes
but its not in time
the clips the mini vans right rear bumper smashing it into the left lane concrete barricade
the suv spins into the right lane where that suddenly broadsides it with such force that it flips the suv up and over
it tumbles off the highway barreling into
a couple of final metal crunching flips send the suvs undercarriage crashing to a violent stop on top of a rickety wood beam mounted guardrail
a silent beat
then steam billows from the hood
blood streams from jeffs hairline
his eyes flutter open
he looks up to kale strapped in the passenger seat unconscious
a small gash on his forehead
we only see blue sky through kales shattered passenger window
kale are you okay
kale opens his eyes
jeff reaches up touches kales face
i think so
kale looks down at his dad his eyes widen in horror not only at the sight of jeff but of the ravine beneath them for this brief moment we may
have thought the suv was stable
but we crane back up and out kales passenger window to reveal a much grimmer reality the suv is perched lengthwise on top the suvs right front and rear tires
precariously grip the rail keeping it from plunging feet to the ravine below
oh my god dad jeffs leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard
but youre gonna have to climb out kale
can you do that
kales hands shake from the shock as his fingers search for the seatbelt buckle
but the shoulder strap is locked in place preventing kale from turning
he tugs it furiously
i cant it wont give thats okay ive got it grab the door i dont need your ass falling on my face kale reaches up grips the outside of the
door as shakily reaches to kales seatbelt buckle and presses
kales belt snaps loose
kales body drops but he hangs on to the window just as a continued d
the suv rocks violently as the guardrail starts to bend and peel away from the cliffside under the suvs weight
reaches up grabs kales legs and pushes helping kale climb out the window
slowly slides down the outside of the door then turns around on his chest reaches his hand back down to jeff dad here jeff reaches up as a a few
inches behind the suvs rear bumper suddenly pop loose
kale screams hangs on for dear life as the guardrail and the guardrail is buckling fast
another beam rips free of its foundation kale slides a few more inches down the door and right front fender allowing to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath
having at least some footing kale reaches back inside dad please you can do it jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up
kale summons his strength grabs jeffs wrist pulls him up and through the passenger window just as the jeffs weight pulls kale down
kales feet slip off the rail
kale slams chest down his torso wrapping around the top of the rail feet dangling
but hes still clutching jeffs wrist as the suv crashes into the ravine in a mushroom slips from kales grasp
kale struggles to hang on but hes losing the battle and the balancing act
and he knows it
tears well in kales eyes
kale you have to climb up no im not leaving kale another guardrail beam uproots no dad please ive got you with a slight smile i know cu jeffs left
hand enters frame clasps kales
another beat of eyes on eyes
the guardrail continues to buckle
then jeff starts to pry kales hand away jeffs arm releases from kales grip
kale opens his mouth to scream as a shrill bell rings
on the ringing bell
students disappear into their respective classrooms
as the corridor quiets down
prelap subtitles as needed este verano despues this summer after visiting de visitar hawaii hawaii i will perhaps quizas visitare a mis visit my grandparents in abuelos en corea
on ronnie yun a scrawny korean kid with a knack for perfect spanish stands at the front giving his speech

the class laughs again
gutierrez shakes his head zeros in on the student behind ronnie
sleeping with his arms folded on his desk a grey hoodie pulled over his head
senor gutierrez takes some chalk flicks it at the kid
he still doesnt budge
ronnie nudges him
dude the kid stirs raises his head
the hoodie falls away to reveal kale
longer disheveled hair
the spark in his eyes been replaced with an empty haze
so kale think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months ahead
kale glances around
all eyes on him
he looks at ronnie who nods in support
kale gets up heads to the front of the class
trying to focus
then este invierno the class chuckles
este verano voy a que
kale shuts his eyes frustrated at the interruption
senor gutierrez also losing patience steps closer to kale
que usted va a hacer
subtitled what are you going to do
i dont know alright

no eye contact guess not
in kales face you guess not
i dont know who you think you are or who you think youre dealing with
you cant give me a straight answer fine give me one good reason why i shouldnt fail you right now
kale clocks gutierrez
on senor gutierrez displaying a black eye sitting next to the schools principal and counselor in a single row of seats behind the attorneys tables
kale a little more cleaned up wearing a suit sits between julie and his defense attorney
julie noticeably tired glances at her son her expression a fusion of anger and sympathy
kales eyes shift her way but his head never turns
the judge mulls over his notes
kales lawyer prompts him to stand
youre six months shy of eighteen that means the assault two charge youve pled guilty to carries a max of one year in juvey
with these priors youre up to three
the judge lets that sink in
kale remains silent
but losing a parent isnt easy
which is why im sentencing you to three months house arrest
julie closes her eyes in relief
you can thank your counselors and lawyer later
brecht i just cut you a break
dont test me
the judge taps his gavel
a pair of hands wrap an electronic monitoring bracelet around kales left ankle
wider to reveal the hands belong to kales case officer janet parker no nonsense
kales perched on the center island
julie watches from the b
as parker clicks the bracelets buckle into place a green led light illuminates
its on the top edge of the bracelets band so kale can easily see it if he looks down
next to this light is an additional red light that isnt on
making final checks okay you
are all set
to go nowhere
re the led lights now green means youre good youre in the safe zone which covers about continued d
a sixty foot radius from this guy here
parker points to a big black box the central tracking unit on the kitchen counter
hes like a modem
he gets a constant signal from mr
bracelet that he sends through your phone line to the monitoring station downtown
so they know where you are where youve been and what youre thinkin
what if he accidentally goes beyond anticipating re red light on bracelet red light flashes
means youve got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green or else the execution squad shows up
and they dont bring blindfolds
its also tamper proof and waterproof
so dont try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line
it wont work and youll look stupid
now ill be checking up on you a lot
heres my card youre set up to pay his incarceration fee ms
to kale twelve bucks every day
re a booklet everything else is in the manual
making her way out oh except this house arrest might sound like a breeze but trust me ive seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long
some after just a day or two
so make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy
kales sits in his video game chair wearing his x box live headset playing halo hes on the final boss level
gunfire and explosions blare over his stereo speakers

kale throws the headset aside makes sure all the wires are connected

kale glares at the screen another beat then gets up wanders out of his room
kale slowly heads down the stairs rounds the corner into
kale runs into julie who wears a black blouse and slacks the required uniform of the steakhouse she works at
shes just thrown a couple of microwave dinners on the kitchen table
shes scrambling around eating a couple bites gathering her things
dinners on the table

kale sits at the table picks through his food

messing with bracelet freakin irritated ankle disorder
julie cant help but crack a little smile well that one couldve been avoided
kale looks back up
hes not smiling
whatever chance we had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly fizzles
another beat then julie pushes her chair back heads to the counter grabs her apron and purse
heading out do the dishes
kale glances around the kitchen
a mess of dirty dishes stacks of paper
kale looking disheveled and very perplexed now has his tv pulled out from the wall
hes behind it meticulously checking and re connecting all the wires and ethernet cable
carefully studying the manual as he goes
he blows on the halo cd wipes it down with his sweatshirt gently puts it in the tray giving us the idea this might not be his first attempt at
he powers up the xbox grabs a controller
so far so good
he scrolls through the screens a little hope returning
kale throws a mini fit slams the controller to the floor
rips the controller cord out of the xbox a few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds
otherwise its a tomb
clothes strewn everywhere
we track across the floor and a virtual debris field of junk food bags wrappers mountain dew cans
find kale in bed ankle and bracelet stick out from the sheets arm hangs over the side still a mess as we find kale hair disheveled rummaging through the cabinets
lots of costco size boxes crackers pringles
a huge box of twinkies
kale spots a jar of peanut butter
he grabs the nearest bowl pulls a bottle of hersheys syrup from the fridge pours it all into the bowl
hes about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when something in the bottom of the can catches his eye
he reaches in pulls out a bill for xbox live subscription kale lounges in on the couch watching the price is right as he spoons the peanut butter from the
jar dips it in the bowl of chocolate syrup devours it
brings up a two liter of mountain dew takes a big swig to wash it down
to contestant on tv cmon bid a dollar one dollar ill bid one dollar bob
kale belches as he raises his spoon saluting the screen
then after a beat a look of grave concern crosses his face the toilet flushes o
kale opens the door leans against the frame spent
he stands there a beat absorbing the silence of the house
he eyes a door at the end of the hall
cu the doorknob
kales hand enters frame slowly turns it
the door creaks open to reveal continued d
ornate cherry wood desk
plush leather chairs
on the desk dads reading glasses sit on a stack of papers next to an antique typewriter
the walls adorned with framed poster size covers of dads books non fiction true account titles whistleblower the inside story of a real corporate insider the senators shadows how eight
men conspired to control one
on another wall a family portrait of jeff julie and kale age six jeff at a book signing smiling wide
kale takes it all in from the doorway
his feet never once cross into the room
his eyes say everything
loss anger regret
he gently pulls the door shut
kale samples some rap clips on i tunes
likes what hes hearing
on the screen kale moves the cursor to buy song
the account screen pops up
kale types his password
after a beat bold red letters pop up the apple id or password you entered was invalid or incorrect
kale types it again
then like we all do to be sure kale types his password at a rate of one key per second
kale fumes smelling a rat
the shades are drawn
kales door is closed
find kale looking utterly miserable lounging in bed watching bikini destinations on hd net
julie enters wearing a business suit and name badge emblazoned with the re max logo
kale quickly changes the channel to the local news
heading to the window more trash tv
thirty three year old patricia walsh was last seen three nights ago
kale points to the tv showing a photo of a smiling patricia walsh vibrant flowing red hair missing keyed in underneath
julie shoots him a look then rips open the blinds
sunlight pours in
she gathers trash off the floor
the lawyers sending some papers over
and your point is
ive got two open houses youve gotta sign for them
thats the point

kale turns to julie who suddenly drops a pile of kales clothes on the floor in front of him
off kale sorry youre a felon
and were broke
i cant do it all anymore kale
this isnt gonna be vacation as usual
i want these washed and the kitchen cleaned by the time i get home
that might be difficult

julie picks up her keys and briefcase pecks kale on the forehead leaves
you heard what i said about the lawyer
kale furiously stuffs clothes in the washer blindly cranks the knob presses start
kale shovels dishes and glasses into the dishwasher breaking a couple as he goes
he pours half the box of cascade in the dispenser kicks the door up and closed cranks the knob
kale sits on his bed staring into space
he eyes the clock
tick tick tick
we hear kids playing in the street o
kale glances out the window
his pov kids on bikes neighbors out on walks
the sights and sounds of summer
and kales not invited
he glares down at his ankle bracelet
it glares back
kale sits on the floor as he spreads a line of elmers glue across the bottom of a twinkie
hes just completed the first couple of floors of what will be
kale on cell sits in his video game chair painting his toe nails
into phone as needed dammit ronnie im losing my mind

phone filter party sounds in the b
dude the chicks here in oahu rock the houusse
oh my god this one is totally showing me her kite board
belay that she wasnt pointing at me
look kale ive gotta hop wait ronnie hello
kale tosses the phone and the nail polish aside
sits there in silence for a beat
then eyes a racketball on the floor
picks it up
starts mindlessly bouncing it against the wall
and keeps bouncing it
and keeps bouncing it
kale reclines in his chair now furiously swatting the racketball against the wall with a racket
we pull back to reveal scuff marks on the walls and ceiling where kale has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to bounce the ball off
multiple walls and return it perfectly to his hand
he swats it
and swats it
kales passed out in his chair the racket still in his hand
hes about to fall out of the chair when a loud bang o
jolts him awake
kale goes to the window tilts his head trying to see where the noise is coming from
kales pov hes able to make out some bits of movement next door but his view is obstructed by the architecture of his house
kale steps back from the window studies it a beat then opens it slowly sticks his head out
his pov a u haul truck comes into view
its backed into the driveway next door
alan norris appears from inside the trucks cab carrying a moving box
he hands it down to his wife bonnie who walks back in the house
kales about to pull his head in when another person comes out of the moving truck
shes carrying a box thats obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline of the moving trucks ramp
but her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about
well soon know her as ashley the norris daughter
she reaches the end of the ramp
bends over to retrieve another smaller box her back and ass to kale who stares in utter disbelief
ashley stacks the boxes picks them up and heads into the house her face still a mystery
kale watches her go
suddenly the doorbell rings o
kale snaps to yanks his head back in and kerbongs it on the underside of the window
he drops to the floor
kale staggers to his feet
more doorbell ringing
kale heads down the stairs to the front door
kale swings the door open to see a burning paper bag on the welcome mat
kale instinctively stomps on it with his socked feet
shit water shit
kale frantically hops around looking for a hose bucket anything wet but the flames are already out
kale looks down finally realizes this but theres another problem his socks are smothered in slimy dog shit
we hear giggling o
kale glances up as two neighborhood brats on bikes emerge from their hiding place behind a shrub across the street
they high five each other
what a retard
kale glares then heads down the steps into
kale walks briskly menacingly toward them you think thats funny
the brats grow more concerned back away as kale draws closer what are you gonna do kill us like your teacher
not before i shove this shit up your ass
the brats pedal away
kale races through the sprinkler crossing his yard into the far corner of ashleys trying to cut the brats off as they race down
the chase is on
kale increases his speed
almost catching up to them terrified to brat dude you said he couldnt leave his house
kale overhears stops cold
he glances to the ankle bracelet shit
kale races back down the street his shit stained feet leaving tracks as he goes
he cuts through ashleys yard again yelling at the bracelet all the way turn green turn green turn green
kale races by ashleys parents leaps back into
he looks at the bracelet
still flashing red
he hops up and down as the sprinkler streams approach him from behind
no cmon im way inside turn green continued d
he spins back toward the house runs smack into the streams trips on the sprinkler falls on his face
now his foots tangled in the sprinkler
spraying water all over him
kales foot jiggles the sprinkler free
he then sees the ankle bracelet green light
thats what im talking about
he gazes over ashleys parents each with a moving box as ashley steps out the front door
freezes at the sight of the sopping wet shit and grass stained kale
kale locks eyes with her
then smiles and waves
its cool im all green
then sirens wail
kale turns to the street two police cars screech to a stop
kale loses the smile
phone filter prelap kale calm down the officers were probably in the neighborhood already
on kale pacing on cell phone pressing an ice filled ziplock back to his head
into phone as needed okay fine but if id known kale first times happen

kale heads away
the doorbell rings
kale opens the door grabs the couriers clipboard signs his name slams the door even harder
on kales feet entering frame inching their way through the yard
on the bracelet the green light suddenly goes out red light flashes
kales foot quickly steps back
a beat then wider kale ties kite string around the gnomes hat then unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet already hammered into the ground
he pulls the string taut and ties it off
we pull back to reveal kales emerging kite string perimeter a crude semi circular arc around the yard tied off at different points using makeshift stakes gnomes mallets shovels screwdrivers
same boundary construction here
kale shoves a screwdriver into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox
he ties some string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors the pilchs yard sees their black labra doodle watching him
hey doggie come here
the dog trots toward kale
it almost reaches his outstretched hand when it suddenly gets zapped by the underground electric fence
it yelps away
spins back around sits and stares
re his ankle bracelet hey you and me both

she sets them on the drive slams the liftgate
kale turns around
ashley throws him a quick glance then heads around the back of her house
kale stares after her
cu the doorknob
kales hand enters frame slowly turns it
kale stands in the doorway
he takes a moment considering what hes about to do
then his foot steps inside
he goes to the window gently pulls the blind up to reveal the he peers down sees ashley and her mom standing by the swimming pool
ashley disappears through the back door
kale tilts his head up curiously gazing through the pair of open windows on the second floor of ashleys house
unmade bed stacks of open moving boxes poster frames waiting to be hung
kale squints steps closer
enters the room
digging clothes from boxes stuffing them in her dresser then she pulls her hair back yanks off her t shirt revealing a black bra
on kale he continues to watch as ashley digs a towel out of a moving box and with her back to us pulls off the bra and disappears into the
off kale the front door swings open to reveal ronnie dv camera in hand

over the above mrs
pilch wearing an unflattering tennis skirt exits the house
the dog hops around her as she waves back to her heavy set male maid lonnie
four oclock every thursday she goes to the country club to play tennis with betty big bangs there
kale and ronnie watch as mrs
pilch heads down the walkway meets her rail thin ish female tennis partner at the curb
as they walk away the dog tries to follow but gets zapped by the electric fence and yelps back into the house

a white mercedes pulls in the driveway
pilch gets out carrying briefcase and flowers

optical illusion line of sight doesnt apply to the subject
kale now tilt your gaze up
window lonnie vacuums as mr
pilch enters the room behind him
pilch flips off the light switch cutting the power to the vacuum
lonnie startles turns around sees pilch standing there with the flowers and a big smile
a beat then lonnie jumps in pilchs arms kissing him passionately
kale slaps his hand over ronnies mouth
ronnie pulls away reaches in his pocket yanks out his asthma inhaler and takes a hit
then re hallway and window seal this area off kale

kale leads ronnie to the window
ronnie takes in the mess in kales room the scuff marks on the walls the completed twinkie tower
he glances to the desk sees a penciled geometric diagram of kales line of sight spying theory shit kale wasnt lying he did do the math
pointing out so
kale and ronnies pov in the yard across from kales back yard find robert giles gassing up his lawnmower in the driveway
hes early s clean cut fit decent looking
he closes the garage door via remote then fires up the mower pushes it around the side of his house toward the front yard
hes lived there a couple of years but ive never noticed he mows his lawn every two days

kale slowly pushes on the door
it creaks open
kale tilts his head listening

kale and ronnies pov ashley swims underwater the length of the pool
she finally surfaces in all her two piece glory
oh my god

they watch as ashley steps out of the pool towels off
she pulls her bikini from her butt lies in the lounge chair

off kale considering on kale now clean shaven sitting on the front steps
he eyes his watch then stretches his neck
then he sees something o
kales pov peering down the street ashleys stationwagon rounds the corner kale hops to his feet quickly fixes his hair as the stationwagon draws closer
kale casually strides into the yard approaching the kite string boundary and mailbox
then keeping his feet planted in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver he suddenly falls forward against the mailbox
reaches around with his free hand opens the door going to grab the mail inside just as pulls the car into and up the drive
she glances at kale who nods and smiles back
as the stationwagon heads up the driveway kale tries to push himself upright but his feet slip
he pitches forward more
he glances back over his shoulder sees ashley getting out of the car and looking his way
kale struggles under his own weight trying to keep his feet from crossing the line he looks back to ashley whos now heading toward him
a slight smile crosses kales face as can i help you
nope no im fine
helping him up too late
thanks that was really humiliating
ashley reaches in the box grabs the mail hands it over
i think any pride you had left was gone a while ago
oh you mean that thing with the cops
they had the wrong guy total foul up
im kale by the way
ashley nods with a semi polite smile starts to head away hey so howd the move go

ashley walks closer to kale checks out his ankle bracelet
yeah youve kinda got the whole martha stewart thing going on nodding but minus the hour allowance for office visits

ashley smiles disappears inside
kales in love
the wind howls outside
kale sits on the couch flipping channels
julies in the chair nodding off
on the tv kale lands on that same photo of patricia walsh the missing redhead we saw earlier
attended a friends birthday party at a local nightclub before she was last seen alone at a diner outside madison miles east of here
a waitress said ms
walsh was picked up around p
by an unidentified person driving a black s era mustang that was dented on the left side and may have kale clicks the tv off looks over to julie whos

kales watch alarm suddenly beeps
he quickly shuts it off eyes julie
she stirs but doesnt wake up
kale quietly gets up grabs the blanket off the sofa covers julie up
he then picks up his soda and bowl of popcorn from the coffee table heads away
kale immersed in shadow enters
he quietly pulls dads leather chair toward the window positions it just right and sits
kales pov ashleys working out to a yoga dvd
to ashley you started without me
as if eerily on cue ashley suddenly stops
what are you stopping for
she goes to her window and peers out kale ducks he looks back up sees ashley gazing in his direction kales breathing intensifies could she actually be seeing him
convincing himself no ashley turns around goes back to her yoga mat
she takes a breath getting back in the zone then she slowly raises her arms and bends into a ridiculously sexy pose
kale watches ashley another couple of beats
then her dad appears in the doorway
kale leans closer ashley stops the dvd
from her body language shes clearly annoyed at the interruption
the scene quickly devolves into a heated argument
but ashleys dad gets the last word in and leaves
ashley slams the door behind him flips off the tv storms in the bathroom and slams that door too
kale watches the vacant room
another beat then ashley emerges from the bathroom with a box of tissues
she sits on her bed pulls three tissues from the box staring off
from this angle it almost looks as if her eyes could meet kales at any moment
kale instinctively lowers himself in the chair his eyes never leaving her
then with a huge gust of howling wind we kale snaps awake
he sits up peers across to ashleys windows
dark shades pulled
kale pulls himself out of the chair
kale enters grabs his psp and falls back to the bed
as he starts playing headlight beams appear from o
he glances out the window continued d
kales pov a black mustang convertible pulls in giles driveway
kale goes back to playing the psp then suddenly stops realizing mustang kale hops up heads to the window kales pov kale watches as giles hops out leaves the car
running as he heads inside the house
after a beat the main garage door raises up
giles appears ducking underneath heads back to the mustang gets in
giles maneuvers the car around the driveway
the front end of the car swings around revealing a bashed in right front fender
a dent kale races to his closet pulls down a pair of binoculars heads back to the window
binocular pov in the garage giles is already out of the car rounding the back as the garage door lowers
kale crouches trying to see under the closing door
catching a glimpse of giles popping the trunk suddenly enters frame lands on kales shoulder

kale turns back to the window stares out at giles house
the lights go out
on kale sitting in the leather chair binoculars raised
on the floor next to the chair is a bag a slurpee cup a bag of beef jerky and an automotive magazine with a mustang on the cover
binocular pov ashley sits on the roof leaning against her closed window

ashley crouches down runs her fingers through the water
oh its so warm baby
ashley cups her hands scoops a handful of water from the pool splashes her face
runs her hands through her hair
she stands takes a deep breath holds it then exhales
ashley stretches her arms high above her head
this is for the gold
ronnie grabs the binoculars from kale puts them to his eyes moves closer to the window but his zoomed in vision causes him to underestimate the distance thwump
the end of the binoculars hit the window just as ashley dives into the pool ronnie and kale hit the deck as we hear the splash o
dude theres no way she heard that
dick my deaf aunt in omaha heard that
kale grabs the binoculars from ronnie
binocular pov ashleys underwater at the far end of the pool
she tucks and pushes off the wall swims back
peering out shes got great lung capacity
on ashley she suddenly surfaces hoists herself from the water
she spins and sits on the ledge rings the water from her hair
but she suddenly stops and shifts her gaze up toward kale and ronnie
pulling ronnie down i think she saw me theres no way ronnie grabs the binoculars back
re ashley o

kale peeks out their pov ashleys slipping back into her shorts and tank top
she heads to the back door tries the knob
over this ronnie turns to kale her swims always that short

kale and ronnie trade glances

kale trades a look with ronnie as ashley nonchalantly heads up the stairs
ashley barges in instantly struck by the mess
kale pushes past her starts grabbing underwear and garbage off the floor
its a little messy
kale keeps gathering clothes tossing them to ronnie who tosses them in the closet
ashley picks up the binoculars from the window sill peers outside

kale and ronnie trade looks
ashley turns around binoculars still raised aiming them like a gun at kale

stepping in actually he is
kales eyes widen in panic

ronnie points out the window to giles house

realizing then pointing out to giles what you think he he drives a car like the one she was seen in

ashley playfully grabs the binoculars back from kale
binocular pov ashley catches a glimpse of a faded texas sorry guys no bashed in fender just a longhorns bumper sticker

off kale and ronnie their dreams realized d
a box of spying crap is dumped onto kales bed
another dv camera an old bulky vhs camera a black and white portable tv couple of tri pods walkie talkies wires

so he couldve lived in texas
re computer screen hey check this out

the summary lists four main criteria
our guy meets at least three
white male between the age of twenty five and fifty
he doesnt have any pets right
not that ive seen you said he lives alone whats the fourth
nonchalant sexual dysfunction
kale and ronnie trade awkward glances shaking their heads to each other as if reassuring themselves they dont suffer from such a condition
changing the subject im hungry lets order pizza
tracking across kales room the two tri pod mounted dv cams stand watch over giles house
one camera feeds a grainy close up shot of giles garage door to ronnies portable tv on the floor
the other feeds a wide shot of giles entire house to kales color tv
both images appear on kales computer monitor
wider to reveal kale and ashley sit on the floor near the window
kale peers over to giles with the binoculars as ashley messes with kales cell phone
in the b
ronnies passed out on kales bed his hand resting inside the pizza box just inches from the last slice
re giles hes been gone awhile
on ashley shes messing with kales cell phone
handing him his cell here

ashley carefully unclips ronnies cell from his hip flips it open dials
after a beat kales cell rings with madonnas like a virgin

kale laughs as ashley delicately re clips the phone to ronnies belt
kales pov the pilchs dog wearing a pink sweater suddenly darts into kales yard
what the hell
their pov pilchs dog stops spins around and takes a dump
pilch in his robe suddenly appears from the shadows watches the dog do its business

pilch calls it over scoops up the dog and heads o
so thats why the grass is greener
only in disturbia
so why the move

the greener grass the safer pastures
theres a beat as ashley locks eyes with kale
then well i guess my mom thought itd help keep dad on a shorter leash
had its temptations
beat then matter of fact but my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did and dad doesnt care more than ever
what did they think an extra bathroom and two car garage would actually change things
somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape
ashley holds kales gaze for a beat
then she nods with continued d
something like that
eyeing the bracelet so

we see in his eyes that hes flashing to the past
theres an uneasy beat as ashley picks up on it then headlights appear outside
kale quickly turns away from ashley pulls one of the dv cams off its tri pod flips out the three inch lcd screen
dv cam pov giles silver toyota pulls in the driveway
engine and headlights turn off
another car dv cam pov kale zooms in
the grainy image finally steadies to reveal a second car pulling in behind giles
a thirty something attractive woman a redhead is at the wheel
she pulls in next to giles car

sure enough shes wearing both a green and a purple bracelet and has a black stamp blotch on her hand
over the above missing girl was seen at a club

they turn back to the window watch as giles escorts the woman to the house shows her in
a light comes on inside
dv cam pov kale zooms in on one of the living room windows spots the woman moving around inside looking at artwork
she sits on the sofa as giles enters with two glasses and a bottle of wine
he sits down pours the wine

kale sets the camera down turns on his receiver
as he toggles through radio stations rock alternative

binocular pov ashley watches as giles takes the womans hand and dances with her
their rhythm fits the music perfectly
on ronnie he stirs on the bed still asleep
eyes closed grinning re music hmmm
ashley and kale eye ronnie for a beat
then turn back to the window
dv cam pov kale pans back to the woman and giles
theyre really dancing close now
kales and ashleys eyes shift to each other then quickly flick away
then ashley raises the binoculars faces back toward giles with nows the time to bust your move
ashley glances to kale
kale turns holds her gaze
a palpable tension between these two
they ever so slowly lean toward each other when ronnie suddenly interrupts pushing himself between them
yawning re woman with giles whos that
ronnie looks to kale and ashley who glare back
realizing ookay just fill me in later
taking ashleys hand a pleasure
then aside to kale mouths re ashley duude

they lean in again when ashleys cell phone ominously rings with the first measures of beethovens th bum bum bum bummmmm
she pulls the cell from her pocket
re cell its my mom

ashley flips the phone shut joins kale whos watching the lcd screen dv cam pov giles and the woman are back on the couch
the woman is leaning her head on giles shoulder
as giles leans forward to take her wine glass the woman falls over behind him
kale and ashley cringe
and shes down for the count
kale and ashley cross the yard to kales kite string boundary
looks like this is as far as you go
they peer into each others eyes
then yknow i have to admit youre different than i expected
what were you expecting
i thought youd be more messed up
does that disappoint you
cause i can be more messed up if you want me to
no youre fine
fine like your first cousin fine or fine in kind of a brad pitt sorta way
they suddenly hear voices o
kale and ashley glance over to giles house
their pov the woman is heading briskly to her car
giles is right behind her
ashley grabs kales arm and pulls him behind a shrub on his side of the boundary
they peek back over to giles
their pov were crouched low now so we only hear the barely audible voices of giles and the woman
talking seriously about something voice raising just come back in the house you shouldnt drive he wants her to come back in i cant hear lets get closer continued d
ashley suddenly darts from behind the shrub and bolts toward the fence re his bracelet i cant but ashley keeps going
we follow behind ashley she creeps over to the fence presses up against it peering through the cracks ashleys pov we see the dark silhouettes of giles and the woman
ashley shifts her head straining to listen you really should stay
i just dont think its a good idea still searching more frustrated where the hell are they
the woman suddenly drops her purse
the contents spill onto the driveway
ashleys pov giles bends down picks up her car keys
here youre in no condition give me my keys
ashleys pov she sees giles make a motion toward the fence
suddenly the womans car keys whack the other side of the fence then plop down underneath it just a couple of feet from ashleys position
on ashley she startles looks over sees the keys
ashleys pov she looks back toward giles and the woman
hears the woman start to laugh
giles not laughing purposefully steps toward the woman takes her arm
ashleys pov the woman relents
giles helps her back toward the house
with kale hes seeing it all
whispering ashley come on
with ashley she glances down eyes the car keys sparkling in the moonlight
she scoots toward them as we crane up to reveal giles heading back toward the fence
on kale seeing this
kale tries to get ashleys attention but shes not looking cu ashleys hand she reaches for the car keys closer ashleys fingertips barely touch them when giles hand suddenly swoops
in from o
brushes ashleys fingers just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back to his side
somehow ashley keeps herself from screaming as she yanks her hand back presses herself against the fence
she puts her hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing kales pov giles stands frozen in the shadows behind ashley
with ashley she slowly turns her head sees giles through one of the cracks standing right there
ashley starts to slowly sliiide away
when suddenly a twig snaps under her foot
she peers back through the nearest crack
ashleys pov searching for giles doesnt see him ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we
tilt up and pan over to reveal giles peering over the fence
we can only hope its tall enough to keep him from looking down and seeing ashley
with kale hes seeing it all
on giles he raises up standing on his tip toes to get a better look down
shifting his head back and forth
with kale he ducks behind the shrub contemplating his next move
he glances down picks up a large pebble
he pops out and tosses it over into giles yard
we hear it dropping through branches scattering to the ground as kale ducks back behind the shrub breathing hard
he then peers back out his pov giles lowers back down turns and heads back toward the house
kale sighs in relief
waves ashley the all clear
ashley heads back over to kale breathless
oddly exhilarated that was intense
are you nuts
ashley silences kale with a finger to his lips
she then leans in gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away off kale utterly stupefied exhilarated kale slams through the office door binoculars in hand
he goes to his chair sits taking position
binocular pov ashley walks in heads straight for the window and draws the blinds
on ashleys window shades still drawn
lights are out now
the wind picks up outside as we pan to reveal kale asleep in the leather chair
we suddenly hear glass shatter o
kales eyes pop open
he looks around
did he hear something or did he dream it he pulls himself out of the chair makes his way to the door slowly swings it open
kale cautiously steps into the hall
he heads to
kale enters tosses the binoculars on the desk throws a glance out the window to giles house
kale turns to the bed pulls back the sheets
as kale unties his shoes takes off his socks we notice over his shoulder on kale not noticing as he strips down to his boxers on kale he throws his
clothes in the closet finally turns back and sees kales pov giles standing in the living room glaring at the woman
kale darts to his desk turns off the light grabs the binoculars
binocular pov giles and the woman are arguing
the woman paces around the room as giles stands there
the womans arms flail about
as she paces back by giles he suddenly shit
kale watches as the woman yanks herself from his grasp and knocks over the lamp
the bulb shatters on the floor throwing the living room into total darkness
kale drops the binoculars and grabs the dv cam
he fumbles with it flips open the lcd screen
but as he presses the power button the cameras lamp suddenly ignites momentarily kale spins and hits the floor
he frantically finds the switch turns off the lamp
dumbass dumbass kale stays on the floor slouched under the window sill for a couple of beats
then he slowly raises up peers out
dv cam pov giles now alone has turned on another light and is simultaneously picking up pieces of shattered light continued d
bulb and wiping some red liquid off the floor
could be wine
or blood even
giles wads the towel up picks up one of the womans high heels lying near the couch
giles then moves to the stereo turns it off leans down picks up the womans other shoe
he flips off the lights heads out of the room
kale trades the grainy dv cam for the binoculars
binocular pov kale pans across the lower floor windows of giles house thats now become eerily still
he tilts up to the second floor slowly pans across those windows again nothing
okay so where is she binocular pov over the above kale slowly pans back across the same windows comes to the last one and see giles staring kale spins and
dives to the floor knocking the other camera and tri pod over
oh shit oh shit
kale shoves himself against the wall frozen in terror
he doesnt dare get up
he spots his cell phone on the floor a few feet away
he extends his leg out uses his foot to slowly sliiide the phone toward him
kales trembling hand reaches for the phone picks it up kales about to flip it open when the phones lcd screen kale startles fumbles the phone realizes its ronnie flips
the phone open into phone as needed ronnie phone filter as needed dude ashley is ho ho hotttt giles totally busted me

he turns back to the door just as it suddenly pushes open smacking kale in the forehead
kale stumbles back screams raises the bat
kale kale its me
kale doesnt immediately drop the bat as he focuses on julie dressed in her serving uniform barely visible in the darkness
she flips the light on

kale falls back to the bed
i heard the door im sorry the wind caught it fine

he opens the fridge sees a new mountain dew twelve pack
he cracks open the carton pulls out a can closes the fridge door revealing kale jumps drops the can
it rolls to giles feet
picking up the can whoa whoa settle down slow down

smiles at the grocery
i had a flat tire when i came out
we tried to change it but dad put those security bolts on and that adapter thingy that unscrews it ended up stripping it instead my fault
no it wasnt
you saved my life
then to kale we had it towed to franks
with attitude gee really lucky you were there
just glad i could help
then favors julie must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house
kale reacts to that
theres an awkward silence as kales eyes instinctively glance down to the ankle bracelet
no its okay were managing
giles steps closer to kale bends down to get a closer look at the ankle bracelet
ive always been curious about those things do you mind
yeah i do
oh cmon kale
to giles im sorry
its none of my business
whoa hey dude
you seem like a straight hitter
you ask me whoever they are deserved it
kale reacts surprised at how genuine that sounded
stepping in okay
i dont think thats the case and i think id like to hear his opinion
and i think i opened my big mouth again
youre absolutely right
then heading for the door i should go
wait what about your coffee
i popped my spanish teacher
giles turns back to julie in that case cafe con leche por favor
searching bags shoot milks
still in the car
julie heads out the door
giles turns to kale
an awkward silent beat

i mean the color
that dark orange
always reminds me of texas
you a longhorns fan too
even though ive never stepped foot in texas me neither
had a lot of friends who went there
i stayed in minnesota till i moved here
so when you say you popped your teacher just a black eye
phew just making sure i wasnt living next to some psycho killer

i had plenty of teachers i wanted to just
giles quickly adjusts his tone as julie comes back with a last bag of groceries but no matter how hard it is to hold back the high roads always the
as giles says this he casually sits at the kitchen table
kale eyes him about to turn and leave but kale could you grab the sugar
to giles sugar
favors kale why not
kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer
he delivers it to giles as julie brings the coffee sits at the table
kale turns to leave again
oh hey kale
as kale turns back nice to finally meet you
off kale prelap oooh
ashley sits on the bed
she looks damned good too
dolled up lipstick
shes just heard the story from kale
i know hes a total freak right
and very vague
did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a sinister message

weve got the car with the non dent dent the bumper sticker the argument the staring contest and now hes showing up in my kitchen why because he slashed your
ashley rolls her eyes
pointing out window her car hasnt moved
its called the day after kale
nobody moves after a night like that

oh my god skinny psycho
i sat next to that bitch in spanish continued d
skipping that one i told her my parents were outta town and now the whole neighborhoods coming

try to make the most of it
hey i get it
you dont have to explain
kale youre welcome to come but kale looks at ashley realizes what shes referring to as he glances down to the ankle bracelet
with attitude well i appreciate the thought

ashley glares furious
she picks up the dv cam and binoculars approaches kale hands them over with try to keep these in your drawers tonight will ya
a sullen kale stares after her continued d
prelap crowd walla and thwumping music
kale sits in the darkness at dads desk
hes on the phone pressing his other finger to his ear trying to drown out the noise emanating from ashleys party next door
kale on phone gets ronnies voice mail

kale slams the phone down sits there a beat

jump cut kale on the phone into phone yeah im calling about the jeep cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug its ready

is there any way to tell if it was slashed or but a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile doesnt it
i mean its a really slow leak it cant flatten a tire in twenty minutes
beat as kale listens yeah i guess anythings possible
a roar of laughter o
makes kale jump from his chair
he grabs the binoculars heads to the window
binocular pov kale scans the crowd until he finds ashley talking with a group of partygoers
she pretends to listen to one of the guys stories as she furtively glances toward kales window
but its quick
we cant be a hundred percent sure if it was on purpose
wait what was that
you think im watching
well im not
nope i am minding my own business
binocular pov ashley excuses herself from the group and approaches the drink and food table where minnie tyco a
skinny psycho is standing nitpicking over her snack choices
ashley hugs her then taps the cute guy next to her on the shoulder
the guy turns around
ashley mouths oh my god like hes some long lost lover
ashley hugs the surprised guy who wastes no time in hugging her back
you think im buying that
kale keeps watching
im not biting binocular pov ashley glances up in kales direction again its more obvious this time as she keeps hugging the guy
kale tosses the binoculars heads out
kale slams a ladder up against the roof
kale slams a speaker down on the edge of the roof facing ashleys
makes sure the speaker wires are securely clamped in place then unwinds the roll of wire back across the roof toward the ladder
jump cut kale runs the wire down the hall
cu kales hand flips on dads bookshelf amplifier cranks cu kales i pod lcd screen lights up
his thumb hovers over the play button
binocular pov ashleys party comes into focus
kale presses play
the speaker explodes with the roar of barry manilow or air supply
binocular pov ashleys party comes to a grinding halt
kale pans around picks up ashley again
fire in her eyes as she storms o
kale smiles with perverse continued d
satisfaction as he tilts his head anticipating the doorbell to ring
another beat then ding dong
kale descends the stairs maintaining his wicked grin
he opens the door for ashley but instead gets pelted with a kale stands there frozen as the two brats jump from the bushes ad lib mocking kale as they
laugh and race away into the shadows
kales about to pursue when the sound of a door opening o
stops him cold
he spins around to see storming in from the kitchen and marching up the stairs
kale races back to the stairs
ashley increases her speed
ashley storms down the hall sees the speaker wires running into dads office
ashley slams through the door spots kales i pod rips it out of its dock
the music stops
she spins around runs smack into kale who swipes the i pod out of her hand and slams it back in the dock
the music blares
ashley moves in but kale blocks her path
she tries to get around him
he stands in her way
peering out the window as if shocked by something oh my god kale falls for it
ashley shoves him out of the way grabs the i pod
kale chases her out into
ashley bolts into
where she holds the i pod out the window stopping kale in his tracks
back off or ill throw it where you cant follow
take it easy thats sixty gigs of my life
okay okay what are you doing
what are you doing
im trying to enjoy my party
wait thats wrong
according to you im trying to conform coulda fooled me
what does that mean
forget no im not gonna forget it
you wanna blend in with that crowd fine then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me
realizing so you were watching me
question is for how long
or maybe a week
since i moved in
kale tries to respond but ashley keeps pressing and the whole my neighbors the killer thing
great cover continued d
its not a cover over the above ashley glances around so what is it kale
what else have you seen
what else have i seen
okay ive seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three
not two not four always three
ive seen youre the only one in the world who eats pizza flavored pringles
and you never stuff the chips in you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites
i didnt know that was even possible
youre also the first girl ive ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house
and what do you do out there
you dont talk on the phone you dont paint your nails you read books
now one would think with the whole numbers thing youve got going on that youd put them on your shelf alphabetically but you dont
your systems much more perfect
the ones you like go on the bottom the ones you love go in the middle and the ones you need the ones you keep going back to
well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia
you know what all this tells me
you know how things should be
the world according to ashley
and guess what
its a very entertaining and beautiful thing
even when it takes a hit
when you end up in a place like this
when your parents dump their baggage on you or just
when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop it sucks but just so you know i get it
but ive also seen those designer window shades of yours and guess what
they always go up the next day no matter what
and even if no one else has ive noticed that
and i aint sorry
the only thing ill even consider apologizing for is
not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner
a long beat as ashley peers into kales eyes
she slowly steps closer to him that was either the creepiest
or the sweetest thing ive ever heard
kale leans in and kisses her
they pull away lock eyes
then ashley pulls kale by his soaking wet t shirt kisses him back even harder
heavy make out
then they stumble back toward the bed out of frame as we hold on kales window and giles house beyond
our pov peering down into ashleys back yard
theres a couple of guys passed out on rafts floating in the pool
we slowly pan to reveal kale looking tired his eyes glazed sitting at dads computer surfing a website brutal killings in austin
on the screen as kale clicks pages we see flashes of crime scene photos from the three murders the bodies of the three redheads bloodied bruised
on kale he doesnt blink as he clicks on one photo after the other
we see a flashes of the victims eyes wide we suddenly hear laughter o
kale snaps to
he runs a hand through his hair gets up moves to the window
his pov ashleys pool a couple of girls giggle as they stand at the edge of the pool pouring beer onto the passed out guys chests
kale quietly enters and shuts the door
hes hiding something behind his back as he sits on the bed next to a sleeping ashley
she stirs opens her eyes peers up at him smiles
where have you been
kale holds up a folded piece of paper hands it to ashley
she curiously eyes kale then takes it opens it to reveal a printed out picture of a long stem red rose
if would have gone to the flower shop but i know
ashley pulls kale in for a kiss
she pulls away falls back to the bed
her eyes glance down at kales ankle bracelet
so how much longer
oh two months twelve days nineteen hours give or take
a beat as the two peer into each others eyes
then you know the other night
when you said you thought id be more messed up
for a guy who killed his teacher
i didnt kill my shhh
kisses him again i know
we get the impression she knows a lot
kale leans in for another kiss
but this time as they lock lips ashleys eyes shoot open
her pov the first hints of daylight out the window
oh my god what time is it
ive gotta go
ashley scrambles out of bed for her clothes getting dressed searching for her shirt
kale spots it behind the bed
as he gets up to retrieve it he hears a noise o
kale peers out the window his pov giles is dragging a heavy blue plastic bag down the stairs leading to the garage
you better see this
ashley throws on her shoes joins kale at the window
their pov giles pulls the bag into the garage next to what we presume is the mustang thats now been covered with a tarp
note the womans car is still in the driveway
kale grabs the binoculars
binocular pov we catch a glimpse of a few crimson red smears on the blue bag as giles heaves it behind the mustang
look quick what
kale gives her the binoculars
ashley looks over
sarcastic thats normal
giles garage door closes
re womans car her car
still hasnt moved
ashley pauses peers out the window again
she cant help but be a little concerned
then so what do you wanna do
off kale continued d
prelap you want me to do what
on kale holding up a universal garage door remote still in the package
ashley and ronnie are on the bed
note kale is wearing the same clothes he was yesterday the stubble coming back
hair more disheveled eyes a little puffier
phase one steal his code from his opener
theres more than one phase
theres only two
now look his remotes in the glove compartment of his toyota
all you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings
on or off
for the later purpose of doing what
breaking in to his house
no not breaking in
were just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time when hes not there to just
to get a closer look at the car the bag to ashley all this sounds reasonable to you
i dont know about that but re universal remote this is good up to thirteen digits realizing how long have you been planning this
ronnie eyes kale with concern
kale doesnt answer
giles suddenly fires up his lawnmower o
kales pov giles pushes the mower around the side of the house to the front yard
look if were gonna do this its gotta be now
he takes twenty one minutes average to mow his front yard
youll be hearing him the whole time
ashley grabs the remote

cu kales cell phone like a virgin suddenly blares
wider kale flips his cell open holds it in one hand binocs in the other
into headset as needed yo you set

kale presses record on the tri pod mounted dv cam
he peers back out the window
we hear giles lawnmower o
both sides of his house are clear

kales pov out his window ronnie suddenly appears from the bottom of frame keeping low as he darts to the fence
ronnie turns peers back up to kale gives him the thumbs up or down

binocular pov ronnie draws a breath then very ungracefully hops the fence and falls into giles yard out of sight
oww shit you okay what do you think
binocular pov ronnie scrambles to his feet from behind the fence darts to the drivers side door of giles toyota

binocular pov ronnie lifts up on the latch
ronnie tries the back door

binocular pov kale pans across to the other side of giles house
he pans back to ronnie
our pov over kales shoulder we see kale is clearly aiming his binocs at ronnie
but we also see on the far side of frame giles neighbor but kale isnt seeing this
theyre all gonna be locked well while youre there will you just check
ronnie goes around the back of the toyota to the other side
he lifts up on the passenger door latch
you see the package
we see and hear ronnie his ass to us rummaging around the inside of giles car
oh my god whats wrong

then okay i found it
kale grabs the pencil and notebook
whenever youre ready
looks like on on on off off on
no wait that one was off

kale glances up
just happens to shift his gaze to the side of giles house to see kales pov giles is walking back around with no lawnmower
but for some reason we still hear a lawnmower
no no kale grabs the binoculars
ill get it right this time
ronnie hes coming around
dude stop dicking with me i still hear his binocular pov kale whip pans to giles neighbor judy thorp trying to remain calm and succinct ronnie i am not dicking
the neighbor is also mowing her lawn and hes going to see you full on panic kale what do i do

put the remote back i did i did easy on the door
ronnie gently pulls the door shut

binocular pov ronnie tumbles into the back seat and out of sight just as giles heads for the car
ashley im on it
practically crying kale tell my mom shut up stay down and dont move
kales pov giles opens the passenger door
about to reach in when something distracts him giles pulls himself out looks over to see heading up the driveway
we barely hear her introduce herself to giles
giles steps around to the front of the car uneasily shakes her hand
ronnie youre good no answer
binocular pov kale tilts back to the toyota sees ronnie sneaking out the back seat door on the drivers side as ashley distracts giles pointing up to the trees on
the opposite side of the yard
who knows what theyre talking about
bird watching perhaps
whatever it is its working
ronnie was that the whole code
binocular pov kale pans back to ronnie as he hops the fence back into kales yard
kale tilts back up to ashley and giles in the driveway
talking to ashley even though she cant hear okay ashley youre good come on
over this a breathless ronnie stumbles into the bedroom joins kale at the window
was that the whole code
pissed excuse me
serious the code did you get it
youve gotta be kidding
ronnie and kale lock eyes for a tense beat
then re something o
kales pov the club girl giles brought home the other night exits the back door and walks up to ashley and giles
stepping closer great kale
kale and ronnie watch as ashley shakes hands with the club girl then throws a quick surprised glance up to kale and ronnie
giles body language tells us hes ready for ashley to leave
ashley gets the hint shakes his hand heads back down the driveway and out of sight
kale raises the binoculars again then furiously grabs for his pad and pencil
binocular pov the club girl gets in her car
giles closes her door watches as she backs out
kale tilts down to her license plate starts jotting down the number
what are you doing
getting her license number why
kale doesnt answer still trying to get the rest of the number as ashley enters eyes ronnie who gestures to kale
okay case closed
try telling inspector clouseau that
now he thinks he needs her license number
kales starting to get manic yeah he seemed like such a normal guy
sure he kept to himself but he was always nice to me
thats what they all say
thats what all the neighbors always say after the fact
only after theyve caught the guy after hes killed thirty people ashley and ronnie trade concerned looks

in their tracks at the mess

but now its noticeably different
wider the shades are drawn

over the above ronnie leans down lifts a couple of books out of an amazon
com box murderer tell tale signs of a serial killer and the shrine of jeffrey dahmer the titles ashley was referencing earlier
ronnie shows them to ashley who takes a receipt out of a nearby home depot box on the page smiths universal garage door remote qty
ashley and ronnie turn to kale
they notice on the wall behind him hanging next to his dads book cover posters a black and white poster size satellite photo of the neighborhood
giles house is circled and labeled in flourescent ink
kale finally looks up notices them looking re satellite poster ronnie youve seen this satellite website right
you can find any location on earth and take a picture yeah for a small fee kale what are you doing

because you lost him before maybe
you ever really knew him
before the world according to kale took a hit from that same stuff you were telling me about remember
all those curveballs
but its like its like youre still trying to dodge them by forcing pieces together that are never gonna fit
by getting all wrapped up in
re mess this

kale sits in silence his thoughts unreadable kale falls back in the leather chair fighting his emotions trying to keep them in check
he glances out to ashleys
he peers around the office the articles the books his dads photos
the family portrait of dad mom and kale smiling wide
their lives ahead of them
in the darkness find kale sitting in his video game chair staring out at giles house
his pov giles garage door is open
giles silver toyota is parked inside next to the mustang
theres a light or two on inside giles house but no signs of movement
kale throws intermittent glances out the window as he starts to unscrew the back of the dv cam
he lifts the back off then reaches in a nearby box and pulls out a blue tooth wireless circuit board
he starts connecting it inside the camera
jump cut kale screws the back of the camera on takes a swig of a soda
theres suddenly fierce knocking at kales front door
kale just sits there
more knocking and doorbell ringing

and kale realize hes in the house into walkie ronnie
ronnies dv cam pov shaky
we catch glimpses of ronnies feet hauling ass down a hallway rounding a corner onto what the hell on the screen ronnie suddenly pans the camera up to his face
as he runs clearly mouthing help me

peers out the window to giles
no telling what the hells happening or happened in there
kale eyes his ankle bracelet
kale eyes his bat
kale slams out the back door races across the yard skips over his kite string boundary on his ankle bracelet red light flashes
with kale he hops the fence racing to
kale darts to giles back door tries the knob locked
ronnie can you hear me
giles open the door
the house is still
kale bolts around the side uneasily feeling his way through shadows and low hanging branches
its even darker on this side
no lights on in giles house
kale cautiously rounds the side approaches the front door its open a few inches darkness beyond
kale eyes it a beat
then steps up onto the porch about to push it open when sirens blare o
kale spins around to see a police cruiser rolling to a stop
kale races toward it as two uniformed officers step out hey
the officer pulls his sidearm aims it at kale freeze

looking disheveled in his bathrobe

kales pov uniform whispers something to uniform
they turn back to giles
sir do you mind if we take a look inside
a couple more police cruisers roll to a stop
curious neighbors are now gathering across the street
absolutely be my guest
giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the house
giles turns shoots a quick glance to kale before closing the door
on kale all he can do is wait
he shifts his gaze to the gathering neighbors
a few lock eyes with him shake their heads
kale turns back toward the house
on the garage door as it slowly raises up
wider the uniforms standing with kale wait as the door opens all the way
a light comes on inside
giles and uniform come out the inner garage door as uniform giles drags the blue bag out from the garage
sure enough theres blood smears and visible strands of matted hair near the top
uniform unties the bag pulls the sides away
everyone gathers around peers inside then suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible stench emanating from within
kale eyes uniform who gestures him to look
kale steps toward the bag
kales pov we peer into the bag to reveal the wide open eyes of a dead deer
to the cops i hit it the other night
thought id save a few steps and get it off the road myself
i was gonna bury it sooner but its been a helluva week so whyd you have to have the car fixed in record time huh
because it was covered in her blood talking over him re mustang because its a classic i got it out of storage for the auto show i needed it in
its one of the biggest in the world
off uniform the auto show
all eyes on kale
giles has an answer for everything

as the uniforms lead kale back down the driveway
quietly drained so wheres my friend then
can anyone tell me that
does anyone believe me
kale looks over sees parker standing with julie whose eyes are filled with it all anger concern sadness
kale come on kale turns back to giles house
sees lights being turned out inside
as kale shifts his gaze forward he locks eyes with ashley standing in the crowd of neighbors
she watches him with concern
kale turns away drops his head as the cops parker and julie lead him away
a flash of lightning in the distance
kale sits on the sofa staring off
he looks to the stairs as julie and parker head down
parker nods to uniform whos standing next to kale
uniform meets parker and julie at the front door
julie quietly nods to them opens the door
a few more inaudible words are exchanged before julie gently closes the door behind them
julie heads back into the living room sits across from kale
a beat then im sorry kale
not the words kale expected
he looks up i really am
you know one thing i always told myself was that no matter what i would always know what was going on with my kid mom let me finish because i
have to tell you something
then i feel like i let you down
i was too caught up in my own grief to see straight
i thought time would heal this and taking a second job was
the answer to keeping a roof over our heads continued d
it was points to ceiling thats just wood
do you hear me
were still not through this obviously its gonna take more time maybe a lot more time and thats just gotta be okay because i know itll get better
beat i want us to be us again

i just didnt think youd believe me listen to me
i am always on your side
no matter what
it may not look like it sometimes but its the truth
and well get through this
he stands goes to julie and hugs her tight
kale enters amidst a few more lightning flashes and distant rolls of thunder
he heads to his window glances out at giles house
the winds picking up
kale closes his window draws the shade sticks his cell in the charger
he collapses to the bed stares at the roof over his head for a beat then like a virgin suddenly blares on his cell phone
kale stares at it
then jumps from his bed races to the phone rips it from the charger flips it open on the phones lcd screen a text message look at your screen
the lcd screen suddenly blacks out
the batterys dead
a wide eyed kale puts the cell phone on his desk slowly shifts his gaze to his computer monitor a grainy image suddenly pops on shaky at first then it
finally steadies and clears up
a torso and face come into focus ronnie lying in the corner of a very enclosed space
eyes open head tilted against the wall
nearly hyperventilating kale leans closer to the screen sees a pile of clothes and a stray racketball trophy lying next to ronnie
shit kale realizes ronnies in his closet
kale slowly turns eyes his closet door
he then steps toward it reaches out and slides the closet door open to reveal ronnie lying dead in the corner
ronnie kale kneels down to ronnie who suddenly pops back to life
kale screams falls back to the floor as ronnie cracks up
more lightning flashes and thunder
kale staggers to his feet
not knowing whether to hug ronnie or beat the shit out of him
dude dont kill me dont kill me i can explain how how long have you been here
you should have seen your face off kales glare i got out his front door
i got lucky
i heard you yelling but dude cops were everywhere still you could have what popped out and said oh yeah officers my friends right i was just in that house
id gone to get my cell phone out of the guys car i broke into earlier

kale paces around runs a hand through his hair as ronnie steps out of the closet dv cam in hand
dude i am sorry
can we just
hug it out
why didnt giles tell the cops someone broke in
i mean he did see you right
you know lets be positive for a change
i thought he did but maybe he didnt
or maybe hes a nice guy afterall and he didnt wanna make a big deal of it you know
i mean hes a guy he was a kid once
kale eyes ronnie
what if he wasnt always a guy
ronnie eyes kale for a beat wondering if hes serious
then kale cracks a smile
ronnie cracks up
but i do have to ask
what was in the bag
as if it were obvious dead deer
kale and ronnie lock eyes a beat
then crack up again
both laugh hysterically slap happy as hell
re dv cam hey you want more evidence detective
i was watching remember
kale grabs the dv cam from ronnie ronnie pulls it away
no no this is comedy it deserves big screen treatment
ronnie grabs some wires starts hooking the camera up to kales tv
kale and ronnie watch the video of ronnies break in
theyre cracking themselves up as we see on the tv ronnies feet stumbling through the garage the camera sliding away off the trunk of the mustang ronnie diving for it
hey i caught that
so thats when the garage door started closing
yeah he must have heard me
he came through the inside door re tv screen this is where i ducked low and started
on the tv ronnies feet start motoring across the concrete floor racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor
on the tv as before were mostly watching ronnies feet as they scamper around giles house
then the camera falls away slides across the floor toward that bookcase its pov for a split second aiming under the bookcase
yeah i lost signal on the tv this we didnt see earlier the camera is quickly scooped up by ronnie whose feet dart across giles entry hall floor toward the
we see ronnies hand reach for the knob
but i never leave evidence behind
on the tv ronnies feet dart out giles front door and into the darkness of the yard
and thats about when you started yelling bloody murder and the shit hit the fan
the tv screen goes black
getting up im starving
all that running around
ronnie heads from the room
re video im gonna burn this
kale gets up heads to the camera
about to eject the tape when a thought stops him
he pulls the camera off the tv sits on the floor presses play scans back through the tape
on the tv the same footage
nothing glaring stands out
the camera falls from ronnies hand slides to the bookcase
ronnie quickly scoops the camera up keeps running
youre not fooling me giles
kale scans the tape back again this time just to the point where ronnie drops the camera
on kale his eyes suddenly narrow did he see something
kale scans back again
ronnie enters starts rummaging through the fridge pulls a soda out then goes for the cabinets
on the tv just as the camera slides to a stop at the bookcase and aims underneath it kale freezes the image
kale grabs his remote cranks the brightness all the way up on his tv
kale scoots closer to the tv amidst another flash of lightning on his finger pressing the frame by frame advance button on the tv we start to see something under
kale presses the button a couple more times
on the tv the next frames are blurred this is the point where ronnie grabs the camera back but kales finger presses the advance button one more time
on the tv the next frame pops into focus
kales eyes widen as he keeps pressing the advance button
cu kales eyes are transfixed on the screen his face just inches away as a few more blurry frames flip by then bam kale recoils in horror as lightning ignites
ronnie get your ass up here
but a roll of thunder drowns our kales voice ronnie throws a bag of popcorn in the microwave punches the clock
as he reaches behind him for his soda can on the island a baseball bat suddenly enters frame and slams down on ronnies arm fwack
ronnie whirls around in excruciating pain to come face to face with who swings the bat across ronnies face
ronnie drops out of frame behind the island
kale grabs the cordless off his bed clicks it on dead
another lightning flash
he grabs the tape out of the camera buries it in his closet pulls out his racketball trophy then creeps to the door peers out kales pov the hallways empty
clear shot to the stairs
kale steps out raises the trophy ready for anything as he approaches the stairs glancing in every direction
he reaches the railing peers down
kale heads down slowly makes his way toward the kitchen peeks around the corner kales pov in the kitchen the popcorns popping in the microwave
kale rounds the island to the microwave presses stop then glances down sees ronnies body ronnie mom
kale spins around as more thunder
kale whirls around hurls the trophy at giles
giles knocks it away as kale bolts for the back door throws it open
kale bolts out the door but trips on a well placed garden gnome on the steps
giles or the brats must have put it there
regardless it slows kale down
he staggers into the yard screaming for anyone to hear
but the wind and thunder drown him out as now right behind him swings the bat and trips kale up
kale falls just short of his kite string boundary line
like a quarterback pressing to the goal line kale lunges forward but giles hand suddenly grabs kales ankle just as the ankle bracelet is about to cross the line
kale screams digs his hands into the earth trying to pull himself forward but giles is too strong
he drags kale backward then pins him to the ground pulls out a roll of duct tape quickly and efficiently wraps some around kales mouth hands and ankles
giles yanks kale up throws him over his shoulder and heads back toward kales house
giles quickly opens and shuts the door as kale struggles against him
hard in kales ear you finally wanna be an orphan
giles drags kale into
to reveal a bruised but conscious julie tied to the chair her arms wrapped behind it
kales eyes widen with rage as he pulls free of giles drops to the floor tries to roll away
but giles grabs him back up gets in his face if you dont stop fighting me i will gut her like a fish
kale glares as giles drags him into the
and pulls him up the stairs
giles slams kale down in his desk chair
giles eyes the dv cam sitting on the tv
the tape slots open
so wheres the tape
kale mumbles a muffled fuck you under the duct tape
youre right ill find it later
giles sits on kales bed
eyes the book on serial killers
he picks it up flips through it
its funny i hear a lot of authors say their first books were easy its the second one thats really hard
wonder if your dad thought that
off kales glare see with me its the opposite
the very first one was
sickly reminiscing very difficult
she was very beautiful
a lot of promise
the others in texas were flings low class
patty walsh had potential but so did amy
you saw her right
when you were watching me
you should feel good kale you guys saved her life
i was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up
so youre a hero kale
savor the moment
tosses the book you have microsoft word
off kales questioning look re computer turn it on
kale doesnt move
giles raises the bat i can type you know
kale turns to the computer lifts his taped wrists to the keyboard
i killed ronnie and my mom because
re kale not typing whats wrong
hey youre the one who couldnt leave me alone
truthfully im sick of covering my tracks
you think i like spending my spare time looking over my shoulder for people like you
word of advice if you ever need to hurt someone think everything through
because you do get a taste for it dont you
but damned if people arent just waiting to stand in your way
cops reporters determined relatives nosy fucking neighbors
next thing you know youre on tilt you cant think straight youre clocking your teacher in front of the whole class me
im hitting a damned deer
man that was some shitty luck
then anyway its pretty clear how weve gotta clean this up
the irony is youve done all the hard stuff
whaddaya think troubled youth finally snapped
maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend or maybe he just couldnt deal with the guilt from not saving daddy
off kale hey you googled me
giles steps away turns back to the bed as kale suddenly does snap
he leans forward grabs the lcd computer monitor with his taped wrists stands whirls around and hurls it at giles smacking him on the side of his head a one
in a hundred shot
giles goes down
