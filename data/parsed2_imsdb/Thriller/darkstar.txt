dark star short film script by john carpenter dan obannon a screenplay by john carpenter and dan obannon the sound of electronic music rises hollow metallic
fade in on a long tracking shot through the universe
as the narrator speaks we move through galaxies nebulae solar systems moving from the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within a maze of suns
over it is the mid nd century
mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system and now he reaches out to the endless interstellar distances of the universe
he moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships computer driven self supporting closed system spacecraft that travel at mind staggering post light velocities
man has begun to spread among the stars
enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space for new earths now homes new beginnings
far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer the scouts the pathfinders a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through
the most distant unexplored galaxies opening up the farthest frontiers of space
these are the men of the advance exploration corps
the task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness
so far from home that earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a
threat to the peaceful colonists that follow
they must find these rogue planets and destroy them
among these commandos are the men of the scoutship dark star we are now moving toward a planet
floating in front of the planet is the scoutship dark star
as we move toward the ship we begin to hear voices crackling with static
over radio filter ah whatd you say pinback
over great static mafhkin oble groop
over filter ah what was that again i still cant hear you
over filter i said im trying to reach talby
somethings wrong with the damn intercom
i need a last minute diameter approximation
camera is now floating toward the observation dome on top of the ship
in the dome sits talby
he is staring around wide eyed at the planets and stars
over filter talby talby this is doolittle
do you read me
we move in close on talbys face
the shot stops and holds as he continues to stare rapt
contd over filter talby do you read me
there is a crackle and doolittles voice suddenly booms through loud and clear contd snaps out of it oh
ah yes doolittle
what is it
close shot of a digital clock ticking down the seconds
i need a diameter approximation
over okay doolittle ill have it in a minute
camera begins to pull back along the length of the control room revealing three men boiler doolittle and pinback
they are seated close together in cramped little chairs surrounded by a maze of instrumentation pressing buttons making adjustments and corrections
there is one empty chair the panel in front of it looks burned
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction
ill check it
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand
right that checks out here
your ghf reading is minus fifteen
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark
in a second
boiler can you set me up with some temp figures
ninety seven million minus eight corrected to mass critical
i read that with a quantum increase of seven
pinback i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven
time to start talking
bomb bay systems operational
pinback hits a button on his panel
the screen is black for an instant
then two enormous doors begin to open ponderously revealing the planet rotating below
a huge bomb designated with a giant on its side lowers slowly out of the ship on a rack
over this is a chain reaction bomb otherwise known as an exponential thermostellar device
its own destructive power is small barely enough to vaporize twelve city blocks
however when it explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet it starts a chain reaction in the very matter of that planet turning it into a
giant reactor which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash
these bombs are equipped with sophisticated thought and speech mechanisms to allow them to make executive decisions in the event of a crisis situation
these judgment centers are controlled by a fail safe mechanism
lock fail safe
pinback turns a key in a lock
fail safe locked
ah sergeant pinback call ng bomb
do you read me bomb
the bomb is suspended beneath the ship
bomb to sergeant pinback i read you
when the bomb speaks it has the prim fussy voice of a minor civil servant
well bomb we have about sixty seconds to drop
just wondering if everything is all right
have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
energy shielding positive function
lets synchronize detonation time
do you know when youre supposed to go off
detonation in six minutes twenty seconds
all right i have detonation time at
wait a minute somethings wrong with the clock
hits panel all right i have detonation time at
no that cant be right it says three years
beats panel again okay i have six minutes exactly
does that check out down there
check at six minutes
arm yourself bomb
several lights blip on along the bombs side
well then everything sounds fine
well drop you off in thirty five seconds
begin main sequence
mark at drop
bomb falls away from the ship and whizzes down toward the planet below
hyperdrive sequence begun
hit it pinback
pinback hits the hyperdrive switch
force fields energize around the men
the dark star accelerates into hyperdrive and streaks away through space
the planetary system recedes in the background
inside the observation dome talby is frozen in a protective force field
insert close shot of a time clock
it blips down to zero
behind the ship there is an intense flare of light as the planet now a dot of light explodes
the force field around talby disappears as the ship comes out of hyperdrive
he rubs his eyes as though awakening then looks down at his readout panels
insert close shot of a panel
on a small screen we see the exploding planet and below a readout says talby touches his intercom
lieutenant doolittle it just exploded
pause ah sir the planet just exploded
pause he shakes the microphone lieutenant
the men are stretching in their seats
unlock fail safe
pinback unlocks the fail safe unit
fail safe unlocked
the hyperdrive sequence is now terminated
please observe that the no smoking signs have growrrr
the voice runs down
what do you have for us now
checking his readouts not much
nothing at all in this sector
find me something i dont care where it is
well i show a probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula
fuck that shit
well it is kind of a long shot
its a goddamn wild goose chase
remember when commander powell found that plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud
well theres the possibility of
remember what we found
fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it
all right then
so dont give me any of that sentient life crap
find me something i can blow up
a light flares on pinbacks board
he looks up
no reaction hey guess what
i got a new star on the readout
not looking up which one
not on the charts
a red dwarf
eight it says here
any of em any good
scans the board naah
doolittle loses interest
contd what are you gonna name it
not looking up what
the new star
what are you gonna name it
dont bother me
pinbacks mouth tightens
commander powell would have named it
commander powell is dead
involuntarily pinback glances at commander powells empty burned seat
the panels behind it sputter
come on doolittle give it a name
i hereby name this star fred
hey doolittle heres one
an unstable planet
probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star
chart a course for the veil nebula
pinback throw me the chart log
pinback draws a loose leaf notebook from a shelf above commander powells empty seat and hurls it at boiler
with a sour look at pinback boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it
lets have some music in here boiler
boiler presses a button
loud country music theme begins to play
this sequence includes shots of the dark star drifting through space past various cosmic wonders intercut with shots of the men relaxing talby staring into space boiler trimming his beard
doolittle playing solitaire pinback reading a comic book
we are watching a filmed tape
doolittle has just turned it on and is staring into the camera
crosshairs and blipping numbers superimposed
ships log entry number
dark star cruising at light speed through sector theta
en route to veil nebula for destruction of unstable planet
our eta is hours
thinks ships systems continue to deteriorate
pinback leans into view and whispers into doolittles ear
doolittle nods and pinback withdraws
contd the short circuit in the rear seat panel which killed commander powell continues to be faulty
pinback leans back in and whispers emphatically
doolittle looks put upon
contd and because hes sitting next to it it continues to bother pinback
glares at pinback
then storage area self destructed last week destroying entire ships supply of toilet paper
talby is still gazing around at the stars
a hatch opens in the floor and doolittle sticks his head up
talby rotates his seat and looks down at doolittle
contd heres some breakfast
doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor
he hands talby the food package and watches matter of factly as talby begins to eat
contd you know talby you really ought to eat with the rest of us
you spend too much time up here
i like it up here
must get lonely being up here so much
i dont like to go below since commander powell died
i feel enclosed down there
if it were big enough id sleep up here
should spend some time below see more of the rest of the ship
you see i can watch things up here doolittle
i love to watch things just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids gas clusters
youll have plenty of time for that you know
figure it this way twenty years in space and weve only aged three so therell be plenty of time to stare around
you know doollttle if were going into the veil nebula we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the phoenix asteroids
they should be passing through there about now
never heard of em
they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every
the phoenix asteroids
from what ive heard doolittle they glow
glow with all the colors of the rainbow
nobody knows why
they just glow as they drift around the universe
imagine all the sights theyve seen in the time theyve been travelling the birth and death of stars things well never see
the universe is alive doolittle
i thought it was all empty but it isnt
in between the stars its seething with light and gasses and dust
there are little pebbles drifting around planets no one on earth has ever seen
no one but the phoenix asteroids
there is a blipping sound
it is insistent
talby is rudely yanked from his reverie
he looks down at a panel
but his soft talk has started doolittle reminiscing
you know what i think about talby
im getting something here on this readout
its funny but i kind of sit around you know a lot of time to myself
i think im getting a malfunction here somewhere
i cant talk to the others but with time to myself i think about back home back home at malibu
i used to surf a lot talby
i used to be a great surfer
lieutenant doolittle im getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed circuit computer systems
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby
i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit
i cant seem to locate the malfunction exactly
waves would be peaking really high and glassy
hit that water
ridin the wall just perfect
somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits
i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all
talby turns in his seat and addresses doolittle directly
ah doolittle i do have a malfunction on this readout but i cant seem to pinpoint exactly where it is
snapped out of his daydream dont worry about it
well find out when it goes bad
chagrined i really think i should try and locate it immediately
might be something important
i wish i had my board with me now
even if i could only polish it once in awhile
long shot of the dark star drifting through space
boiler pinback and doolittle are descending a ladder into the kitchen
im getting this flickering light on one of my panels
what flickering light
the one on unit
oh i think its gmr twelve zero zero
whats wrong now
im not sure
i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship though
i hope its not the oven again
remember when the artificial gravity went out in the toilet
the men sit for their meal
doolittle brings food packets from the oven
hey doolittle think well ever find real intelligent life out there
the control room is empty
after a moment there is a repetitive beep
close shot tv screen
on the screen is the message this fades and mission controller appears on the screen against a background of computer terminals
he is dressed in a snappy tunic and when he receives the on camera cue he smiles ingratiatingly
glad to get your message
we gather from the ten year communications lag that you are approximately parsecs away
drop us a line more often wont you
sorry to hear about all the malfunctions and real sorry to hear about the death of commander powell
there was a week of mourning all over earth
the flags were at half mast
now i hate to send bad news when you guys are up there doing such a swell job but somethings come up and we all felt you ought to know
our systems simulation computer has predicted that by the time this message reaches you that is to say in about ten years there will be a failure in one of
your vital ships systems
the malfunction will occur in rifles papers system number e
you can see what a problem this would be if you didnt catch it on time
now what you should do is this first do not repeat do not attempt to adjust the system manually
second the room is dim and eerie banks of dimly flickering lights and the hum of air cooling machinery
talby is seated before a glowing screen
he punches several buttons and the screen comes to life
a schematic cross section of the ship appears in glowing green lines
talby punches more buttons and the screen flashes through the levels or the ship
finally it shows level
there is a small red light pulsing in the emergency air lock talby punches another button
the emergency air lock is magnified fifteen times until it fills the screen
the red light is pulsing in a small area labelled communications laser
talby picks up a microphone
lieutenant doolittle this is talby
over filter yes talby what is it
sorry to interrupt your lunch sir but im in the computer room and i think ive located the malfunction
the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser down by the emergency air lock
cant pinpoint it exactly but im going down there with a starsuit and try to find it
sounds good talby
let me know if anything important comes up
doolittle hangs up the mike
why doesnt talby ever eat down here with the rest of us
he just likes it up in the dome thats all
boiler seems to be thinking
he frowns looks at doolittle
whats talbys first name
doolittle thinks about it and an odd expression crosses his face
whats my first name
then repatch channel and seal all the plates
dont mess with it and it should work okay
im just glad we caught this thing before anything serious happened
keep up the good work men
his image fades and is replaced by the message full shot control room
lights blink peacefully in the empty room
slow zoom toward a sun system
the dark star is suspended in frame
a title pops on briefly a glowing screen shows a schematic of the planet rotating below
boiler stares at it smiling
there she is
definite plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations
itll spiral in toward its sun and eventual supernova
lets vaporize it
pinback hits buttons
bomb bay systems operational
bomb lowers ponderously out of the ship
lock fail safe
pinback turns the key
fail safe in lock
four minutes to drop minutes to detonation
this is sergeant pinback calling bomb
do you read me bomb
bomb to sergeant pinback
roger i read you continue
camera slowly pans down the chromium steel walls of the emergency air lock to reveal talby in a starsuit
he is wearing it only as protection against possible depressurization and therefore wears no jetpack
carrying a tool kit he is slowly circling the lock
you are now in the emergency air lock
please remember that the surface door can be opened without prior depressurization so be sure to wear your starsuit at all times
thank you for observing all safety precautions
talby stops facing laser shaft
the plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose it appears to be burned
talby approaches it and puts down his tool kit
he turns on his helmet radio
ah lieutenant doolittle
sh talby dont bother me now
ah well i think ive found the malfunction sir
im in the emergency air lock
over filter well im in the emergency air lock and click
doolittle turns off talbys radio line
one hundred twenty seconds to drop bomb have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding
energy shielding positive function
do you remember the detonation time
detonation in twenty minutes
right that synchronizes here
okay bomb arm yourself
talby stands in front of the laser shaft trying to reach doolittle on his helmet radio
very carefully talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on the laser shaft
he pushes it and it drops to the floor of the lock with a clang
communications laser monitoring information relays and bomb bay systems has now been activated and will switch into a test mode
if you will look near the surface door you will see that the parallax receptor cell has been engaged
a small triangular hole opens in the opposite wall and a photo sensitive cell rotates into position
the laser will now energize
please stand clear of the path of the beam
talby steps back quickly
the airlock lights dim and with a high lock from the laser shaft to the receptor cell
communications laser is now on test
under no circumstances enter the path of the beam
thank you for observing all safety precautions
everything sounds fine bomb
dropping you off in sixty seconds
quantum is up thirty five
i read the same here
talby crouches by the laser shaft carefully peering past the red humming beam
it youre there im going to try to adjust the cue switch on the laser
he takes a long tool from the tool kit
slowly with agonizing care he inserts the tool into the laser shaft painstakingly avoiding the beam
he engages the tool into the base of the laser and begins slowly to make an adjustment
there is a blinding flash of light
talby drops the tool and staggers back clutching his face plate
my eyes attention
the laser has malfunctioned
under no circumstances enter the path of the beam
to do so will cause immediate talby stumbles into the beam
there is a dull explosion
there is a flash on the lower side of bomb a sudden explosion
lights blip furiously on the bomb
begin main sequence
mark at drop
a honker sounds
the men sit up
i have a negative drop
the bomb is still in the bomb bay
try it again pinback
pinback resets his panel
the honker stops
mark at drop
ah negative drop
the men stare at each other in silence for a long moment
simultaneously they begin hitting buttons
rechannel all safety relays open quantum latches open circuit breakers remove thrust drive repellant automatic channels open remark drop drop drop
there is a very long pause
its just sittin there
bomb hangs underneath the ship waiting
talby lies unconscious on the floor of the lock
on the mens faces in strained anxiety
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb
i repeat previous order you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay
do you understand
over i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds
detonation will occur at the programmed time
bomb this is doolittle
you are not to detonate repeat you are not to detonate in the bomb bay
this is an order
i read you lieutenant doolittle but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes
detonation will occur at the programmed time
fourteen minutes to detonation
the men stare at each other
the bomb has malfunctioned
automatic dampers have gone into effect and will confine the explosion to an area one mile in diameter
please contact mission control and await further instructions
thank you for observing all safety precautions
only one thing to do
ill have to ask commander powell
ill have to ask him what to do
doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy blue cold freezer room
the walls are covered with frost and mist hangs in the air
he pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer door
on the door is a sign he opens the door
commander powell is encased in the freezer in a post death frozen ammonia state
wire and electrodes are attached to his head
doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer
he flips a switch and speaks into the mike commander powell
commander powell this is doolittle
can you read me
a crackle of static comes from a speaker grille along with the faint muffirup glurrinpinfropal
doolittle fiddles with the volume control trying to bring commander powells voice into audibllity
commander powell this is doolittle
ah theres something serious come up sir and i have to ask you something
very weakly im glad youve come to talk with me doolittle
its been so long since anyone has come to talk with me
commander sir we have a big problem
you see the veil nebula bomb bomb number is stuck
it wont drop from the bomb bay
it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in checks watch less than eleven minutes
doolittle you must tell me one thing
whats that sir
tell me doolittle how are the dodgers doing
well sir the dodgers broke up disbanded over thirteen years ago
you dont understand sir we cant get the bomb to drop
ah so many malfunctions
why dont you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me
oh well did you try the azimuth clutch
what was that doolittle
it didnt work
thats correct sir
ive forgotten so much since ive been in here
what should we do sir
the time is running out
well what you might try is commander powells voice is drowned in a burst of static
doolittle fiddles with the dials
sorry sir you faded out there for a minute
what were you saying commander about the bomb
it seems to me doolittle
sorry ive drawn a blank
ill have it again in a minute
i forget so many things in here so many things
hold on just a minute let me think
but you cant explode in the bomb bay
youll kill us all
theres no reason for it
over i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes
detonation will occur at the programmed time
you wont consider another course of action for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you
i can tell the damn thing just doesnt understand
are you still there
oh yes doolittle im thinking
were running out of time sir
well doolittle if you cant get it to drop youll have to talk to it
talk to the bomb
i already have sir and pinback is talking to it now
no no doolittle you talk to it
teach it phenomenology doolittle
six minutes to detonation
wearing his starsuit complete with jetpack doolittle pushes a button
above him the giant lock doors slowly slide open
doolittle slowly rises up out of the ship
he stops his ascent with his jetpack turns and moves down toward the bomb bay
doolittle what the hell are you doing
doolittle floats into shot jets himself up until he is facing massive bomb
hello bomb are you with me
are you willing to entertain a few concepts
i am always receptive to suggestions
think about this one then how do you know you exist
whats he doin
i think hes talking to it
well of course i exist
but how do you know you exist
it is intuitively obvious
intuition is no proof
what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence
well i think therefore i am
now then how do you know that anything else exists
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me
this is fun
all right now heres the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct
talby lies unconscious near the burned laser
what im getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data
and this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center
in other words all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections
why that would mean
i really dont know what the outside universe is like at all for certain
i wish i had more time to discuss this matter
why dont you have more time
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds
what is the key
no no the key the key to the fail safe lock
wheres the fail safe key
where is it
what did you do with it
i dont have it
i dont know where it is
you must have it you idiot we can stop the bomb
now bomb consider this next question very carefully
what is your one purpose in life
to explode of course
and you can only do it once right
that is correct
and you wouldnt want to explode on the basis of false data would you
of course not
well then youve already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate
i recall distinctly the detonation order
my memory is good on matters like these
yes of course you remember it but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality
true but since this is so i have no proof that you are really telling me all this
pinback is pawing frantically through the control room searching for the key
boiler is apoplectic
the key goddamit the key
christ twenty seconds christ
where is the key
were gonna die boiler
were gonna die
they begin slapping each other hysterically
thats all beside the point
the concepts are valid wherever they originate
so if you detonate in
you may be doing so on the basis of false data
i have no proof that it was false data
you have no proof that it was correct data
there is a long pause
i must think on this further
the bomb raises itself back into the ship
doolittle practically collapses with relief
it didnt go off
it didnt go off
boiler were alive
talby slowly climbs to his feet
he is dazed groggy
did we blow it up
no bombs today
big boilers back in business
no bombs today
pinback is mumbling unintelligibly
did we blow up the planet
whats going on
pinback and boiler have calmed down
weve got to disarm the bomb
doolittle are you there
doolittle is floating outside the emergency air lock door
im coming in now
im down by the emergency air lock
too much trouble to come in the ventral lock
would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in
he presses a button
the emergency air lock door explodes away from the ship
behind it carried by the burst of escaping air comes talby spinning head over heels into deep space
hello pinback are you there
talby was in the air lock
you blew him out of the ship
im going after him
turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him
what was that i didnt hear
hes drifting away from the ship without his jetpack
doolittle fires his jetpack moving off into space after talby
talby talby can you read me
can you beat that
i always knew talby was weird
talby can you read me
talby is spinning wildly
help doolittle help me
all right bomb prepare to receive new orders
over you are false data
therefore i shall ignore you
false data can act only as a distraction
i shall refuse to perceive you
over hey bomb
the only thing which exists is myself
talby spinning is reflected in doolittles face plate
calm down talby
snap out of it bomb
in the beginning there was darkness and the darkness was without form and void
what the hell
yoo hoo bomb
and in addition to the darkness there was also me
and i moved upon the face of the darkness
bomb hey bomb
and i saw that i was alone
contd let there be light
doolittle flies past falling backward
whoa talby upside down is falling in the opposite direction
doolittle doolittle where are you
here i am
i think im spinning
were both falling talby in opposite directions away from each other
my my jetpacks gone
what happened doolittle
bomb must have gone off inside the ship
nothing we can do about it now
hey it looks like
he made it
commander powell made it
a block of ice with a mans body in it tumbles past end over end
what happened men
yeah the skipper always was lucky
the planet begins to rise behind doolittle
contd looks like im headed for the planet talby
going right toward it
when you fall doolittle if theres anyone down there on the planet somebody may see you
they may see you coming down
what a beautiful way to die
as a falling star
guess youre right
talby turns his head and looks behind him
doolittle im heading right toward something
its behind me in the distance
something that glows
far behind talby coming nearer is a shimmering point of light
i think its the phoenix asteroids
the point of light is closer now and it has begun to differentiate into a group of beautifully colored frost like shapes
it is doolittle its the phoenix
they glow with all the colors of the rainbow just like everybody said
im going into them im going to hit them
before we get too far away and our signals start to fade i just wanted to tell you
you were my favorite
i really liked you doolittle
i really liked you too talby
hey some debris from the ship
its coming right by me
several chunks of debris from the ship drift past doolittle
doolittle im catching up to the asteroids
im going to be a part of them in a minute
doolittle im going into them
talby drifts into the huge frost like shapes expanding and glowing and spinning slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a cold glow
contd im beginning to glow
the field of spectral shapes with talby in their midst begin to drift away into the distance
contd theyre taking me with them with the phoenix
going to circle the universe forever
im with them now
be back this way again some day
doolittle before its too late theres one last thing i want to tell you
talbys signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the depths of space
doolittle is hanging onto a long thin chunk of debris
ive grabbed a piece of the ship and i think ive figured out a way
he pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet and stands on it
crouching and extending his arms doolittle surfs down into the atmosphere of the planet banking and planing as he disappears to a small dot
