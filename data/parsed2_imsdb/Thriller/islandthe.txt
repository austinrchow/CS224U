written by caspian tredwell owen we pull back in marked steps to include neighboring apartments with identical frosted facades
then more apartments above and below the tiers linked by ramps and crosswalks
it might be a prison cellblock but there are no guards apparent
indeed the residents move freely all notably male all clad in shearlings polo shirts and slacks
it is just another day in sector four
saties gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers
a glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley
the plaza formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile is divided into two service areas
male residents in line on one side females on the other
both genders combine in the seating area
lincoln reaches the head of the line
he swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner
a nutrition clerk a surly woman in uniform eyes the readout on her screen lincoln six echo
options are dried fruit oatmeal or anything in bran
you got a sodium flag pal now whats it going to be
he shrugs disgruntled
the clerk taps her screen
turning to a row of chutes behind her she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can
lincoln less than appetized loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast
then he heads into the seating area
in the seating area male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily
uniformed busboys intermix clearing and wiping tables
a divide in this community now starts to become clear
the busboys like the nutrition clerk like all the service maintenance and administrative staff well see have distinct uniforms but no facial marking
they are known as outsiders
the residents like lincoln have crosshatched scars on their upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists
mostly caucasian from mid twenties to mid sixties
there are no children here
we isolate a blonde mid s fresh bright eyes a fragile beauty a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal
her name is ester two alpha
seeing lincoln she smiles and waves lincoln
lincoln crosses a little surprised to see her
you dont recognize me
its just an expression thats all
you and your expressions lincoln
now sit down and ask me where ive been
sits a spreading smile okay ester
where have you been
at the medical center
just for tests but they had me on liquid nutrition
forks a mouthful of eggs mmmmm
this is the first solid food ive had in a week
thats not the exciting part
i got my first trimester report happy healthy and contaminant free
both of us
its in perfect condition
i just hope i can keep it that way
i still have six months to delivery
then you leave all this behind huh
will you miss me
her eyes betray a flicker of something
it unsettles lincoln
ill miss your coffee
cmon i already burned up my quota
but this is the last time
in a deliberate move she drops her napkin on the floor
as she ducks down to retrieve it lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee
rising again ester registers his souring look
what is it
lincoln just nods across the plaza
ambient conversation is now ebbing at an arrival
an outsider in a grey vaguely clerical uniform sanguine settled precise eyes
he might be a prison warden but for the generally warm reception
he is known as the community director
his name is merrick
he crosses to a lectern unlooping a chain from his neck with a three forked pendant known as a tri key
he slots the tri key into the lectern
the glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o a live feed of himself
now amplified by the plaza speakers merrick begins his address good morning
to everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen welcome to the community address
today im coming to you from sector four
for those of you here with sugar quotas let me recommend the french toast
i just tried some and its excellent really
but i know what everyones hungry for s o lets move on to the lottery
as always the draw will be made from our host sector
so tell me sector four is everyone ready for the daily spin
applause and whistles erupt mostly from the younger residents who take on the zeal of a game show audience
the older ones including lincoln greet the prospect with labored tolerance
merrick turns the tri key i n the lectern
the glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text let the spin begin
to a burst of cheers he turns the tri key another notch
the glass wall becomes a spinning blur like a tumbler on a slot machine
but instead of icons it clicks through names each separated by a blank line from adams one alpha to zucker three charlie scrolling the entire population of sector four
as the spin slows a pent silence falls
expectant eyes watch the names click through the ps the qs the rs the ss and
starkweather two delta
cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient
the excitement abates as it becomes clear hes not among them
well starkweather if youre watching on etherscreen your time has come my friend
youre moving out to the island
another burst of cheers and the rest of you never lose hope what do we know about the daily spin
everyone gets to win
an d tomorrow it could be you
merrick steps down and departs
the plaza reverts to its former mood dotted with murmurs of disappointment
your time will come
thats easy for you to say
your times guaranteed
all you have is six months
six months of mood swings sore back and swollen feet
want to trade places
scowl lifting give me some more of your coffee
the portal is spanned by a rank of latticed metal gates known as an ethergate
residents swipe their ethercuffs o v e r scanners the gates hiss open and they step through in systematic order
the subway formed in arches of creamy ceramic tile is not unlike our own
in place of escalators moving walkways deliver the residents onto the platform
along the platform wall runs a strip of mirrored panels etherscreen reporting in banner crawl at the tunnel edge of the platform is a safety fence where the residents wait
in a patient line lincoln among them
his focus is drawn to two younger residents whispering furtively nearby
a stim unit says it hits the wall
but i get to set the can
resident shrugs and hands him a drink can
resident ducks under the fence reaching the can down to the track
or what looks like a track
the struts lining the bed are not sleepers but buffers of galvanized rubber
nor are there any rails
the relay system is provided by a series of metal posts flanking the buffers to run in twin parallel
known as lode poles they now start thrumming and pulsing with red light like runway beacons
hurry it up
the shuttles coming
resident regains the platform
we push in on the drink can balanced on a buffer
it starts rattling
then suddenly shoots upward into the air arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall clattering into obscurity
resident whoops in victory
a rush of air heralds the shuttle
it sails out of the tunnel floating three feet above the track
a hybrid of subway car and nautical craft it has runners in place of wheels like hulls on a catamaran
it is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the lode poles an invisible river known as a lode stream
the shuttle drifts to a gentle halt hovering rocking a little
its gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence lowers
lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard
an avenue of cream colored buildings
uniform in architecture rising five stories to meet a mirrored roof
despite lighting arrays the absence of sky lends a chasmic quality
lincoln follows the flow of residents up the avenue
building signs read dept
of labor dept
of health dept
he splits off turning into a building marked dept
frosted glass workstations notably circular rather than square
lincoln sits at his desk in front of a wraparound etherscreen divided into three sections a formation known as a visor
right visor shows a polymorph in fractal cycle like a permanent screen saver
mid visor shows a tomograph of a residential block tiers of apartments shown as boxes most in solid white a few blink red with the text label vacancy
left visor shows a list of names and sociographic grading sheaded residents pending
hudson four alpha profile reviewed
match to vacancy sector
request clearance to populate
left visor the name highlights then blinks out
mid visor a box labelled vacancy turns from blinking red to solid white
hey you want to know something
lincoln looks up at a face grinning over the partition mid s jovial tall and burly
his name is jones three bravo
you know that guy who won the spin in your sector
i had a bout with him last week
guess how long hes been here
you dont believe me look it up
census file two delta starkweather
what do you say now
still think the spins rigged for the long haulers
he got lucky thats all
and dont you wish it was you
out there on the island
natures own clean air zone
no screening no quotas
shut up jonesy
why dont you make me
in the ring
youre out of my weight class
they just got the new program in multi weight balancing
ill think about it
a stim unit says you wont last three rounds
c r a c k the same face recoils from a punch
jones shakes it off retreating recovering
he resets his guard as lincoln moves in
lincoln jabs at jones defenses his blowing hitting harder than wed expect from his stature
suddenly he breaks through with a left hook
jones staggers back
a strange ripple distorts his face
stranger still his skin tone takes on a grainy pallor
as the bout continues we widen to see the boxing ring is indeed a ring rather than a square and beyond the ropes is an outer ring
with lincoln in fg we now see another figure in the outer ring mirroring his moves dressed identically but for the gloves which are like gauntlets
the gauntlets are rigged to two armatures which are in turn rigged to a gantry like mechanism
it glides noiselessly to and fro shadowing the figure round the outer ring
rack focus reveals the figure is also lincoln
the real lincoln in fact
the one in fg is a derivative hologram known as a proxy
as lincoln fakes and jabs the counter weighted armatures drag and recoil duplicating the exertions of his proxy
jones moves more sluggishly his proxy now ghostly transparent
now being sent on a last offensive only to be roundhoused by another left hook
jones proxy topples and explodes into a pixellated mist
lincoln proxy and lincoln punch the air in victory
jones unlatches his gauntlets sweating galled by the defeat sure you input the right weight class
youre just too slow jonesy
youre faster cause youre lighter
they always miss something
hey you put up now pay up
rainbow light and swirling electronic music
the clientele are all male residents
round the walls poster sized etherscreens display various dancing women beckoning text supers flashing at the bar lincoln and jones freshly showered each swipe their ethercuffs over a scanner
a uniformed bartender notes the readout jones three bravo you got five units
your friend hes got an alcohol flag
so make it a beer and a vita cola
the bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the bar
scoping for onlookers lincoln steals a gulp of jones beer
you know youre going to get yourself contaminated one of these days
shut up jonesy
so you up for a rematch tomorrow
i got an interact
that blonde again
hey its an authorized interaction
were on the same meditation program
you want to get flagged for proximity
no law against friendship jonesy
give me that beer back
two census officers censors enter the bar in wireless head sets and white uniforms they seem at once clinical and military
censor carries a tablet known as an etherboard
censor more imposing carries a wide muzzle rifle known as a stopgun
their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm
as they move up the bar the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs over the etherboard
now reaching jones who swipes accordingly whats going on officer
censor checks the etherboard a headshot of jones spins in d
he offers it to lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically what happened
you lost count
i hope nobodys drinking off quota
vita cola all the way officer
lincoln sips his cola
as they move on he grimaces at the taste
lincoln stares out of the window
the red pulse of the lode poles catches a glazed look in his eyes
his pupils a little dilated
his focus returns to the interior and an etherscreen banner
the morning sun streams over the green mountains
lincoln lies sleeping his head buried under the pillow
off a beeping sound he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling accept
the etherscreen resolves esters face fresh and bright
i missed you at breakfast
i guess i overslept
i just wanted to check were still on for tonight
ill be there
ill see you then
enjoy your day
her face blinks out
lincoln gets out of bed with a smile
lincoln exits his apartment and heads up the walkway
we reveal the walkway ends at another ethergate governing residential access
lincoln swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner and a gate swings open
he heads on the gate hissing closed behind him
ravels pavane plays overhead
the plaza is emptying as residents leave for work
lincoln arrives at the service counter
he swipes his ethercuff and greets the clerk with an amiable grin
just juice today
im late for work
i gotta serve the full meal
lincoln shrugs his gaze wandering past her into the kitchens
his grin fades as he spots two censors talking to a busboy
then the view is lost as hes served an oatmeal and juice breakfast
not so crowded at this hour
halfway down the platform we see a vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers
a mouse ish resident collects a bar from the trough
his name is kleinwort nine alpha
seeing lincoln approach he preempts no no no
use your own sugar quota
he says this amicably enough but hes using his imposing presence on the smaller man
kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk
so whats up with the censors huh
theyre conducting a census check
or dont you watch the bulletins
i know what it is
ive just never seen them out in this sector before
probably just tracking a glitch
a bad scanner or maybe an userware defect
off lincolns puzzled look ethercuffs
they get damaged you get a false read
sometimes even a dropout
what are you saying
they lost someone
someone just isnt showing up where they should be
what do you care
a rush of air heralds the shuttle curtailing the conversation
beneath his tousling hair a frown plays on lincolns brow
lincoln stares at the fractal on right visor at the intricate paths of dysplasia
the glazed look has returned to his eyes his pupils a little dilated
his stare narrows at an errant thought
he shrugs it off
but the thought returns persistent
more to dispel than indulge it lincoln turns to mid visor
census file two delta starkweather
accomodation status sector
the tiered boxes resolve zooming in to isolate apartment
the box shows solid white
lincoln frowns assimilating this
remember the guy who won the spin yesterday
his apartments still showing as occupied
so you get hours to move out
maybe the system didnt update yet
it updates on the hour
if hes gone it should be showing a vacancy
appearing over the partition what
you think hes still here
the guy wins a place on the island and you think he just decided not to go
i dont know
he wasnt there to step up
and now theres a census check
and now nothing
its probably the programmers messing up
a stim unit says i can prove it
cross reference with sanitation
sanitation status sector four
they got to sweep it for the next occupant
their supervisor interrupts them an outsider efficient type if you gentlemen arent busy
perhaps i could get an update on sector six
still in the electrical phase sir
well the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog
so go over there and light some fires will you
pulls on his jacket to leave ill take care of it
arent you forgetting something
holds up a steel briefcase or do you want to get contaminated
an arc of blue light
a uniformed worker steers a plasma torch over a conduit
in the fog of smoke we see wires being spliced circuits tested
outsiders in hardhats goggles and cup masks
lincoln comes over the crosswalk starkly contrasted in dacron coveralls and a hooded gasmask
the crew foreman intercepts him drawn desiccated features a husky drawl
his name is mccord sorry chief
i cant let you get any closer
we got live wires over there
lincolns reply is muffled by the gasmask lost in the noise
whats that you said
lincoln repeats to no avail
frustrated he peels off his gasmask i said i cant hear you
m c c o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony
he y you get yourself contaminated dont come pointing the finger at me
how are you doing mac
you know how it is
gets to the end of shift crew starts draggin t h e i r feet
we l l the guys upstairs are griping about the backlog
they want to know when youll be ready for move in
i guess if we bust our backs we could be out of here by the end of the week
ill tell them two weeks
i appreciate that
got any stuff on you today
a sign reads warning
lincoln stands by as mccord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single forked pendant known as a uni key
he slots it into the top of three keyholes
a light starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss
a deep steady thrum
giant extractor fans churn above and below both directions seemingly limitless
the bleak concrete shaft is streaked with soot threaded by ladders and catwalks
on one such we isolate lincoln and mccord
b o t h smoking cigarettes
i t s too bad
what do you mean
t h a t your shifts almost over
you mean these things
well these things aint good for you anyways
the y taste good
an exchanged smile
a pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure
i like coming here
most outsiders dont like to talk
thats because we aint supposed to
they got rules about fraternization
another pause as they drag on their cigarettes
what do you do when the shifts over
m o r e of the same
they cycle us onto the disposal detail
hump n dump crew
h u m p n dump crew
d e b r i s clearance
we hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside
is it as bad as they say out there
m c c o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled
lincoln displays his gasmask
but not everywhere
not on the island
b e a t stubs his cigarette i dont know too much about that
lincoln eyes him narrowly
mccord p a u s e s then tucks his lighter into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile
he y take it from me you got a sweet deal right here
so why worry huh
lincoln shrugs accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke
we tilt up to follow the smoke plume dissipating into the fans
a i r blasts up from a giant tunnel
w i d e n i n g we see it is one of a huge ring planted in the dust backdropped b y mountainous red rocks
at the hub of the ring is a large cubic building
from its facets giant appendages of ducting plunge into its surround
these are the inlets for the processed air that feeds the underground
this is the landscape of the world outside and manifestly above
f r o m the processing plant we pull back and up raking over a large industrial complex
more cubic buildings cream colored windowless like stacks of giant playing bricks
now we see the front of the complex
the planate f a c a d e faceless but for the entrance cubed in polarized glass like a dark cyclopean eye
f r o m the entrance we follow a walkway out to a dock where the ground drops away into a broad concrete trench like the subway lined with lode
poles and buffers it is known as a lodeway
from the dock we follow the lodeway out to a perimeter wall red rock slabs twenty feet high framing a giant gateway
the gates now glide open to disclose a view of the world outside the wall the shimmering bleached wilderness of the arizona desert
o u t in the distance where the lodeway tapers into the scrub a vehicle emerges from the shimmer
a hybrid of bus and nautical craft single hulled known simply as a liner
now as the liner becomes clearer a decal on its prow is revealed a crosshatch insignia over a blocky l e g e n d the sanger institute
the polarized glass shows the liner has docked and a tour group is disembarking
the men are mostly over bloated by luxury
the women mostly under wives and girlfriends all jewels and haute couture
they filter into the entrance hall to be greeted by the courtesy staff
pretty girls in short skirts and blazers with the crosshatch insignia led by a pert redhead named lydia
l a d i e s and gentlemen my name is lydia and on behalf of our staff id like t o welcome you to the sanger institute
lydia contd before we start the tour well be serv i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center and
circulating our standard discretion agreements
i should add that today you are all very lucky because our ceo and founder dr
henry sanger is with us and will be leading the tour personally
the crosshatch emblem spins on a wall to wall screen
not a real screen but a projected flat known as a holoframe
here lydia assembles the tour group nursing wine glasses and canapes
the holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins a series of vignettes an old man shuffling on a walking frame a middle aged woman in a
bathing suit one breast flattened by a mastectomy a young woman in labor her face knotted in pain
the group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles
then i t s not a pretty sight is it
e y e s turn to a figure behind them dressed in a vestmental w h i t e labcoat s tall slightly hunched by senility eyes like quicksilver glittering
he has the hauteur of a visionary stooping to the role of a salesman
his name is dr
sanger contd m o r t a l i t y
we all know its face and yet w e look away dont we
we deny that our l i v e s are ordained to suffering
that w e are all inalterably going to die
he pauses fielding the various disconcerted looks
i t takes courage to confront mortality my friends
and i see it in each of y o u
my name is dr
henry sanger and im here to reward your courage
l y d i a applauds
the tour group dutifully follows suit
sanger whispers a question in lydias ear
she broadcasts her response t o d a y s group is from new gaza health care
theyre with the platinum plan
n e w gaza
yes very good oncology unit
m u l l i n g this he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at his passage
rallied by lydia the tour group follows him into
a hall of windows each window framing a display case each display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l
not unlike a museum
on closer inspection more like a chamber of horrors
i n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen
another magnified shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back
in another a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes
i t doesnt get any prettier does it
but this is not a freakshow my friends
this is a war museum
a history of our battles with mortality
take the stem cell for instance
a bid to cultivate human parts for transplant in rodents primates barnyard animals
its enough to make your skin crawl
in some cases literally giving rise to a new range of cross species viruses
but thats how we learn
from our mistakes
the y turn a corner
another hall of windows portals onto tanks of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde
suspended within are embryos fetuses and infants
all grotesquely mutated
c a s e in point the clone
back in the beginning the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark t o break the curse of heredity to correct congenital defect
genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science
a bright future that led to a dark age and much of the legislation we know today
but while the clone laws may have narrowed the field science marches on
only to hit the same wall over and over again the enigma of growth the alchemy that takes us from embryo to adult
a clone barely reaches infancy before its growth enzymes misfire resulting in the kind of monstrosities which are only effigies you see here
s o m e reassured sighs from the women
they turn another corner onto another hall
a hall of mirrors
simple full length mirrors
so what do we learn from our mistakes
that human parts cannot grow outside a human body
that human bodies cannot grow outside natures grand design
a fat man supporting his bulk with a walking stick grunts s o what the hell are we doing here
l e t s say one day you go to your doctor for a checkup
he discovers you have imminent renal failure and require a kidney transplant
what would you do
i wouldnt do nothing
my brotherd g i v e me one of his
e v e n if your brothers kidney is with o u t defect theres still a chance of rejection
or less if hes your twin
but what if you did have a twin
o f f the fat mans confused look sanger smiles and gently coaxes him to face a mirror
their reflections stare back at them
what if you had a genetic double whod give you not just one of his kidneys but both
in fact any organ or body part you ever had cause to need
you mean like a clone
i thought you said all that stuff was a bust
i said the problem with a clone is it doesnt survive infancy
the solution is to find a different starting point
why sow the seed when you can create the fruit
or what we like to call
l y d i a starts clapping
then s t o p s realizing this wasnt a cue
an agnate is sequenced from a point on the cellular timeclock
i t is spawned post maturate
it is created adult
sanger contd o f course its brain is still vestigial s o for the first three years we keep it i n suspension
during which time we use d a t a impression to supply a template f o r functionality a process we call f o u n d a t i
after foundation we t r a n s f e r the agnate into containment w h e r e it enters the conditioning p r o c e s
an ongoing series of quality c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain i t s functionality
after a minimum of t w o years conditioning the agnate b e c o m e s eligible for harvest
t o the fat man smiling an d you my friend get your new kidney
a hush falls among the group as they process what theyve heard
its a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified
l e t me see if i got this straight
you can create this whatever
this walking spare parts holder
but i gotta w a i t five years to get hold of em
the spare parts as you put it need to be tested for integrity
but as many of our clients leave it till late in life to take out the policy we do offer the option for early harvest
given the risks however a waiver is required
s o five years or no warranty
for the premiums youre asking
an d what if the organ you needed was a heart
ask yourself each of you
if you had to put a price on your life your very survival what would it be
a deep lull as the group considers this
sanger picks his moment
i t s a question your insurance company has already answered
for them the agnate obviates costly and ineffective treatment programs
should you decide t o take out our policy not only will they lower your existing premiums but theyll also cover the production cost
the incentive ripples across the faces
a troubled one speaks up this agnate
what happens to it
after our friend here gets his kidney
thats entirely his decision
our role is intermediary
we as the insurance provider guarantee the condition and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained
in legal terms the policy holder is defined as a sponsor
the premiums in effect becoming sponsorship payments maintaining the agnate until such time as harvest is required
at such time and where feasible the sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship retaining the agnate for secondary harvest or shall we say let the policy expire
e x p i r e
let it die
not as you and i know it at least
the associations of life and death are no more applicable to an agnate than to a cow in a field
it exists in a state of limited consciousness aware not of life but of functionality
imbued with the knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question it
and yet in many ways the end if the most humane part of the process
the agnate goes to harvest without any fore b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came
eternal or otherwise
there is mortality for an agnate
just utility and redundancy
s o it doesnt know
it doesnt know its
its p u r p o s e in life
w h o does know my friend
who among us knows our true purpose in life
s a n g e r ambles on plunged in thought
lydia picks up the slack
this month were offering a special rate for new sponsors
including a discount on the his and hers plan
she ushers the group round another corner
another holoframe and another commercial displaying the same characters as the first the old man with the walking frame is now running in a park the woman with the mastectomy
is now at a party her cocktail dress broadcasting a full cleavage the young mother is now in a waiting room smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby
would you like to close
now some of you may be thinking this commercial is staged
but these are not actors these are past customers
real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of sponsorship
what we offer here at the sanger institute is not just health insurance but indemnity
what we offer is the chance of a new lease on life
the tour group applauds this time without prompting from lydia
n o w lydia will walk you through the rest of the tour and explain the various limitations and exclusions
but i do have time for a few questions
h a n d s are raised
a waspish looking woman butts ahead of them the commercial
the girl with the baby
what is that
a fix for infertility
you mean the maternity plan
n o t endemic infertility at least
as i said the law prohibits genetic alteration so a defect endemic in a sponsor will also be present in their agnate
no what the maternity plan provides is a way round the risks and rigors of childbirth
under this plan an agnate becomes eligible for pregnancy shortly after foundation
a simple donation of sperm from the father then the agnate is fertilized and brings your baby to term
an d then what
you get it in the mail
f o r practical reasons delivery is handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r
an d the agnate what happens to it
when its you know delivered
the same rule applies
you can continue your sponsorship
and in this case theres a natural window for compliance as the agnate is routinely sedated after delivery
as to whether it wakes up from that sleep like i said the choice is yours
b e a t a shrug an y t h i n g to avoid stretch marks right
the other tour members some more guiltily than others laugh
a i r blasts up from the same giant tunnel swallowing the laughs
the acoustic hollowing as we look up from the now empty catwalk
the blast of air fading into the deep steady thrum of the fans
the thrum fading to silence
a flat measured silence as we revisit the community in soundless montage
the residential block the frosted facades
the nutrition plaza the counters the chutes
the subway the moving walkways
centerville the buildings now emitting a trickle of agnates ending their workday unwitting participants in their own greater utility
a glass wall looks down on the avenue
the furniture is trans p a r e n t ethereal
merrick sits at a console desk studying an etherboard
o f f a buzz he taps a button
the door opens and lincoln enters composing a deadpan
he doesnt like this man
you wanted to see me
please take a seat
he taps a button
the glass wall frosts over
its unnerving but lincoln stays deadpan moving the chair before taking a seat
merrick reviews the etherboard lincolns headshot s p i n n i n g in d w i t h a scroll of data
then he looks up forming a smile how s lincoln six echo today
lincoln shrugs noncommittal
merrick eyes him thoughtfully
e v e r y t h i n g going okay
i guess not
why do you say that
i f im here
im not sure i deserve such a negative association
my jobs only to see that youre happy
that everythings okay
i t sounds like you dont believe me
why wouldnt i
s i t s back smiling i t s part of your makeup
to challenge things
to question whats around you
p e r h a p s you can utilize that facility by helping me solve a little puzzle
lincoln shifts feeling uneasy
merrick consults the etherboard
youre doing well in most areas pro f i c i e n t a t work exercising rigorously your last medical puts you in excellent condition
but screenings picked up some deviations
trace levels changes in your sleep pattern
i see youve also been burning up your quotas
a r e you saying im contaminated
the n whats the problem
the r e are parameters lincoln
when someone starts straying from those parameters we need to find out why
because you not just you all of our residents are special
because people like me dont get to go to the island
lincoln stays deadpan wondering where this is going
s o tell me have you noticed any changes in yourself
what about your sleep pattern
you feel youve been sleeping properly
lincoln shrugs refractory
l e t me put it another way when you wake up do you feel
r e s t l e s s disoriented uneasy
i dont know
theyre all words in your vocabulary
i know you understand what they mean
lincoln s jaw clenches patronized
merrick notes this resumes quotas
do you feel like you want more than youre given
i dont know
do you have any difficulty staying focused
at work for instance
lincoln s jaw twitches
merrick notes this proceeds with care h a v e you been experiencing feelings sensations you dont quite understand
i dont know
do you sometimes feel agitated for no apparent reason
an g r y
you feel angry
when exactly do you feel angry
lincoln leans forward as if to assert this
merrick slowly nods like hes just revealed something
he taps the etherboard
im going to order some tests at the medical center
in the meantime id like you to stay away from stimulants protein sugar caffeine
i already burned up my quotas
but i know you can get around them
he levels a knowing look
lincoln stiffens again unsettled
im asking you to cooperate
not for my sake lincoln but for your own
is that it
the r e is one other thing
you have a female friend
your file shows youve been interacting regularly
the r e s no law against friendship
o f course not
we encourage interaction in the hope itll be of mutual benefit
but given these deviations
lets just say proximity becomes an issue
i know the rules of proximity
the rules of proximity apply to sexual contact lincoln
in this case it goes deeper than that
ester is entering h e r second trimester
a time of change and emotional confusion
further inter a c t i o n might be
unhealthy for you
lincoln patronized looks away
this pill he wont swallow
an d for ester well she has only six months left to delivery
then shell move out to the island and whatever ties she has here will be broken
merrick contd a s a friend shouldnt you make her t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible
lincoln s deadpan falters
this one a bitter pill he swallows
g o o d
now im also going to refill your pleasure quota
it may help to settle you down a little
i feel much better now
im not sure you do
but i think youll do whats right lincoln
you may not trust me
but i trust you
a theater in the round
the audience is mostly pregnant females and older residents
as the lights dim eyes turn to the stage
speakers bring up handels o m b r a m a i fu
then a glowing mist rises condensing into a huge sphere like a seed
known as a holomorph it reacts sonically germinating into stems and branches and blossoms growing and evolving with the music
the diaspora i s as spellbinding as it is pacifying
it is beautiful
the music from within is like a warm beckoning hand
the foyer is slightly vaulted to accommodate a statue
on a bench at its f o o t ester sits alone waiting patiently
as lincoln enters s h e rises to greet him smiling
he seems more sullen than usual
s o r r y im late
i t s okay
i was waiting to tell you something anyway
lincoln looks at her unsettled by her flourishing smile
m y baby i felt it move
and its the weirdest feeling too
i cant explain it
its like being more
more h e r e
lincoln returns a deadpan look
esters smile wavers a little
im all excited and were supposed to be finding peace of mind
i have to cancel ester
his voice is expressionless
ester shrugs refreshing her smile
s o ill see you at breakfast tomorrow
i dont think so
ester s smile falls
her eyes reaching trying to understand
did i do something wrong lincoln
a small word but it comes heavily
before ester can ask another question lincoln turns and leaves
his jaw clenching with the effort of self containment
ester watches him not hurt just a little confused
we widen to encompass the height of the statue
the likeness is idealized but unmistakably that of dr
b l u e light
lincoln walks up a long corridor carrying a sealed plastic bag
along the walls poster sized screens like those in the bar display images of women gyrating licking their lips
the blue light sustains
to one side is a mirrored wall known as an etherwall
it is currently pixellated t o display a grid of womens faces artificial consorts waiting to be selected
facing the etherwall i s a large aquarium like tank filled with gelatinous blue liquid
this vessel is known as a sense tank
lincoln sits at the rim naked wearing a full head oxygen mask
he couples it to a hose dangling from the ceiling
then lowers himself into the tank
on the inner facet a touchlight k e y p a d resolves
lincoln taps some keys and the etherwall a c k n o w l e d g e s lincoln looks out at the etherwall
the faces blink off to leave him staring at his reflection
just one left a pouting redhead who licks her lips in anticipation as the lights dim
a holographic mist now rises
first resolving a proxy of lincoln naked replicating his posture in the tank
then the redhead is conjured her buxom nudity glimpsed through the swirling mist
lincoln proxy reaches out to stroke redhead proxys breast
in the tank lincolns fingers caress only the gel his fingertips met by soft arcs of light neurological charges conducted by the gel creating the sense of touch
they are known as impulse arcs
redhead proxy responds dappling her lips across lincoln proxys neck
in the tank impulse arcs flicker across lincolns throat then down his chest descending to more erogenous zones
lincoln stiffens and closes his eyes yielding to the sensation
the sensation engulfing him lincolns brow starts to furrow
not with ecstasy
his eyes open his pupils fixed in a black dilated stare
resisting the artificiality his face forming a sneer tightening until
he slams h i s palm into the touchpad
the tank shakes
the proxies blink out
lincoln stands mirrored in the etherwall
his hand pressed against the glass in a posture of defiance
his reflection warped and shuddering
f r o m darkness grows a seed of light
red light pulsing to reveal the shaft lined by lode poles here in triangulated relay
the polarity cradles a dark mass towards us
an elevator in descent
merrick is at his console working late
off a buzz he taps a button
the door opens and an outsider enters s square set hollow remote eyes
his hair is damp and he wears post decon scrubs
a usmc ring is visible on his finger
his name is scheer
k a r l
s c h e e r pauses his face twitching
then sneezes violently
i forgot how much i hate the air here
j u s t a histamine reflex
your systems readjusting to the sterile environment
i t s the smell i hate
yes well i cut short your leave for a reason
i take it youve been briefed
s i t s sniffing o n e of our lab rats is missing
w i t h a dour look merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock
a proxy resolves over the console quarter scale spinning in d male african american bull neck
data etches across thin air his name is starkweather two delta
he dropped off the ether two days ago
at first we thought it was a system error
then we found this in a garbage chute
he opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff
he hands it to scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds
then d e l t a generation huh
i t was a delta the last time
t h a t was entirely different
the product suffered a head injury
what happened to this one
we dont know
he just disappeared
n o t easy to disappear
unless he figured a way through the boundary
hes a code two karl
a low functioner
i f you ask me its a mistake giving them any functions at all
the y dont function mentally they dont function physically you know that
the n perhaps if youre going to breed lab rats you should breed them tame
his look albeit from a distance throws a stone
merrick hardens i f you bothered to read the clone laws youd realize we have no choice in the matter
the virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms
all we can do is prescribe the limits
and even those are subject to regulation
scope of knowledge range of activity even their speech patterns
the law requires that what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics
you mean like fallibility
hes not going to take the bait
the ether shows no attempts on the boundary
hes here karl
but for some reason your men seem unable to find him
its your job to contain the products
id like you to do it okay
a little sensitive arent we
j u s t after starkweather went missing his sponsor placed an order
an order we cant fill
damn right im sensitive
a l r i g h t
how much time do i have
merrick taps a button
a holoframe appears beside the proxy
even in two dimensions the face is identical
just a different hairstyle and a gold earring
this is the face of the sponsor
j a m i l starkweather
last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage
in medical terms we have maybe a few weeks
in legal terms were already o n borrowed time
a s scheer rises to leave an d karl
merrick contd i dont want a godawful m e s s like the l a s t time
the green mountains cast black by the predawn glower
lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed still in yesterdays clothes sleepless
he is staring fixedly out of the window hungrily as if inviting the outer darkness to come in
his gaze lowers onto his jacket slung across the bed
he digs in the pocket
and pulls out the cigarette pack
for a moment he considers it
then slowly purposefully he opens it
he slips a cigarette between his lips
and lights up
he leans back taking a slow drag
exhaling he watches the smoke rise
his gaze rests on the etherscreen above expectant
the cursor comes to life r e f l e c t e d in the ceiling lincoln grins at his small victory
q u i e t empty at this hour
just the drum of footfalls as lincoln marches up the walkway puffing his cigarette
he stops at the ethergate regarding it as if for the first time
then he stubs out his cigarette
and swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner
a blue dot blinks in space
we widen to establish its locus on a tomograph
now building the boxes the quadrants the sectors
revealing a vast fully dimensional hologram of containment
it spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom
o v e r l o o k i n g the ether like a studio control booth
known as ethercon its also the title of the censor at the console
scheer stands over him now in a white censor uniform with black chevrons on the sleeves marking his seniority
he instructs r e v e r s e map
crop to twelve hour segments
then put up a sub grid
t o one side a miniature of the ether grid resolves
it peppers with a series of blue dots
then a blue line stems from a point of origin to start joining them
scheer leans in eyes honing watching the blue line retrace the last steps of his quarry
the glass wall reprises the predawn glower
the plaza is empty at this hour
but the service counters are staffed as breakfast is being prepared
the clerk looks surprised to see lincoln arriving so early
he seems grim latent stiffly swiping his ethercuff o v e r the scanner
she eyes the readout on her screen lincoln six echo
options are dried fruit oatmeal or anything in bran
i want some bacon
you heard the options
an d coffee
i want coffee
the clerk sighs and taps her screen
turning to the chutes she collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on lincolns tray
lincoln glances down at it then back up this isnt what i asked for
you want to get into it
look i just work here pal
i serve the meal and make sure it goes down on your record
lincoln nods slowly
then picks up the bowl
and flings i t across the plaza
then the juice can trying to outdistance the bowl
finally the tray which rotors almost to the far side before clattering into obscurity
then he turns back to the clerk p u t that on my fucking r e c o r d
the latticed wall of ethergates
the rising beat of footfalls as lincoln approaches
he swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner
the gate slowly hisses open
too slowly for lincoln who kicks it and barges his way through leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge
the walkways unmoving
the platform deserted
the echoing beat of footfalls as lincoln marches up to the vending machine
he swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner
a screen illuminates
lincoln glowers at the message
his jaw clenching twitching with anger
erupting he lashes out punching t h e machine
he winces as his knuckles crack
then grabs the machine trying to rip it off the wall
pulling straining sneering with effort until he lets go with a defeated gasp
then kicks the machine in final affront
the machine resounds with a dull boom
for a moment he stands there chest heaving
then suddenly traps his breath
the r e in the fading boom a noise
becoming discernible as the sound of a man sobbing
lincoln turns toward the platform
tracing the sound he crosses to the safety fence
his voice echoes to nothing
he leans over the fence and peers up the tunnel
in the fog of darkness a figure
a figure paused half standing like an animal on the brink of flight
the figure seems to stare at him
then pulls upright
now moving forward and into the light
his face is african american bull n e c k e d eyes wild and bloodshot
a stranger to lincoln we know him as starkweather two delta
his voice is quivering unhinged please
lincoln stands frozen by the sight of this dark dishevelled resident
as he climbs up onto the platform we see his hands the fingertips grated and bloody
he lumbers towards lincoln p l e a s e you have to help me
he rushes forward grabbing lincoln pulling him face close the strangers eyes grow darkly his pupils abysmal black with dilation
lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip backing away
w h o are you
whats wrong with you
the strangers eyes bore into him obsidian
face contorting baring his teeth like a rabid dog
suddenly he lunges a t lincoln b o o m ramming him back into the vending machine lincoln is stunned suddenly a vice like grip on his wrist swings him
round c r a c k into the etherscreen banner webbing at the impact
for a moment all is a blur
teetering lincoln props himself against the wall
then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and his fractured reflection
he releases a deep bewildered breath
then he notices his wrist
his ethercuff i s missing his skin grazed red from abrasion
confusion yielding to anger he looks for his assailant
but the platform is empty
his jaw clenches
t h e drum of footfalls as starkweather rushes up to the ethergate
h a n d shaking he swipes lincolns ethercuff o v e r the scanner
the gate hisses open and he barrels through suddenly spurred by lincoln bursting up from the well of walkways charging forward like a bull
the gate now closing lincoln races for the gap barging his way through
and the gate snaps shut with a clang
a n alarm sounds
the console flashes
ethercon responds with a flurry of keystrokes
scheer rejoins him as he pulls up a sub g r i d
this one evolving past tomograph mosaicing a n g l e s from etherscreen conjugating a d l i v e feed known as an etherview s t a r
k w e a t h e r barreling across the plaza glancing off tables sending chairs flying
some residents arriving for breakfast scatter at his onset
shocked faces looking back and forth as lincoln follows in hot pursuit vaulting the toppled furniture
a squad of censors converging called suddenly to duty looping tri keys r o u n d their necks donning headsets priming stopguns
s c h e e r leads them into the elevator coolly relaying his orders s u b j e c t headed into north quadrant
two m a n teams we block him and force him to ground
if you have a shot hook him but keep it above the belt
management doesnt want us to damage the product
the censors roll their eyes knowingly
scheer taps his headset
e t h e r c o n
sector four north code an exclusion for tri key a c c e s s
then give me a full quadrant lockdown
a vertical onto a residential block the grid of crosswalks the tiers of frosted facades quiet the residents still dormant a drum of footfalls then a figure breaking frame racing
up the walkway of an upper floor then another figure in hot pursuit t h e lockdown i n i t i a t e s the lights shifting spectrum from white to ultraviolet bathing the quadrant in a lambent purple haze s t a r k w e a t h e r his eyes bulging with panic as he races up the walkway straining for an ethergate a t the far end of the floor lincoln his eyes charged with adrenaline straining to close ground on his assailant oblivious to the building noise of t h e lockdown locks hissing lights flashing ripping up the row of frosted facades sweeping past lincoln and onward toward s t a r k w e a t h e r the ripple of hissing locks rushing up on him he pours on the pace sneering with effort as he tries to outrace t h e lockdown the ripple spearing ahead of him to the end of the floor now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the exit
s t a r k w e a t h e r stalled by the realization hes trapped he spins round looking for another avenue of escape only to find
lincoln blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong tackle both men toppling over hitting the floor with a bone jarring thud s t a r k w e a t h e r quick to recover breaking lose of entanglement now struggling to his feet stumbling onward up the walkway lincoln gets up to resume pursuit then pauses spotting his ethercuff discarded on the ground
he looks up in confusion at s t a r k w e a t h e r a short distance ahead climbing over the walkway rail launching himself off
into a seemingly suicidal plummet lincoln leaning over the rail seeing his assailant land safely on a crosswalk beneath resuming his flight on the lower floor as b o o m a gunblast r i p s the air
a keening sound builds to a wail t h u d lincoln jolts as something hits his shoulder catching him off balance a stab of pain keeling him onto the
rail clang lincoln slumps into fg two censors converging like white ghosts from the purple haze one reprimanding his recalcitrant cohort
you hooked the wrong one
he crouches to examine lincoln
blood is blossoming from a wound on his shoulder jutting from which is a projectile
the censor presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target
n o w we see the projectile more clearly
a fat metal pellet snub n o s e d finned at the tail by four metal teeth
on impact the nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward to bite into the target
this device is known as a hookhead
j u s t a flesh wound
hit his head pretty hard
i n s p e c t i n g lincolns pupils t h i n k you can walk buddy
lincoln nods slightly
the censor unloops a tri key f r o m his neck you see this
itll get you past the lockdown
youre to report to the medical center
o f f lincolns blank stare the censor presses the tri key i n t o his palm
lincoln stays where he sits still dazed from the concussion
absently he watches the censors race off up the walkway dissolving back into the purple haze as we s t a r k w e a t h e r
meeting white uniforms at every turn zig z a g g i n g o v e r crosswalks down ramps
the rat in the maze dumb to its inevitable destination
widening we see we are watching the action on etherview racking and dollying like a deific e y e
e a s t side team hold position
subject headed for the second floor crossramp
c l o a k e d in shadow scheer listens to the play by play on headset
with a tap he changes the channel whispering to his squad g i v e him some space
i have him
a n o t h e r angle starkweather hits the deck running sprinting up the avenue
in bg scheer steps forth stopgun l e v e l l e d aiming
boom the flash of the muzzle the shrill wail of the hookhead
t h u d starkweather jolts as the shot hits him square in the back arching as the hookhead b i t e s but he keeps on running b
o o m b o o m b o o m scheer unleashes his ordnance filling the air
t h u d t h u d t h u d starkweather jolts from one two three more hits hookheads b i t i n g spraying blood but
he keeps on running
a l l clear
flood the area
a n o t h e r angle floor level as between the tiles tiny red lights start blinking rippling forward in a wave
known as lode pins their small magnetic pulses accumulate into a low level stream
the hookheads c l a w e d in starkweathers back also start blinking red
the invisible stream flowing beneath his feet starkweather feels its force
the duelling polarities stealing his traction
his run reducing to a slipsliding s t a g g e r
then his feet leave the ground
he flails for a handhold
but theres nothing
the force lifts him a foot clear off the ground before balancing out to dangle him in mid air squirming about like a fish on a hook
a n o t h e r angle scheer advances to reel in his catch
the stream bows before him red lights blinking out
until all that remains is the section where starkweather hangs suspended
scheer stops at its limit looking up at him like some curious zoo exhibit
h o o d him cuff him patch the bleed
then lets get him up to level three
a n o t h e r angle looking down from high above as the censors move in on starkweather
scheer now walking away tapping his headset e t h e r c o n
send word to dispatch
starkweather two delta is secured
r e v e r s e angle lincoln in cu looking down
he has seen and heard all that has just passed
in his eyes we see his daze clearing consciousness coalescing deepening
his pupils dilating into a deep and uncanny stare
what can only be described as a dawning
n o w full but unusually quiet
residents sit in whispered anxious discourse
the news of the incident is spreading
off a series of chimes eyes turn to the glass wall now pixellating i n t o an outsiders face calm official
the community announcer begins
good morning this is a community bulletin
following an incident in sector four earlier this morning the department of sanitation is issuing an all sector contamination warning
tracking the rapt concern of the residents ester among them
the incident involved a resident found to be infected with a pathogen
while the risk is assessed residents are advised to be aware of the symptoms
should you experience aberrant levels of anxiety or witness it in others immediately contact the medical center
the proxy of starkweather spins over the desk
merrick regards i t with a frown
scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers with a demeanor of cool curiosity
underneath hes rattled
you want to tell me whats going on
theres nothing going on karl
whats your point
i checked up
in the past year three products have destabilized
all of them deltas
and theres nothing going on
youre jumping to conclusions
once i can overlook
twice i can call coincidence
three times i start giving a shit
because if these products are defective
q u a l i t y control is not your concern
s o it is a quality control issue
thats not what i said
he was in the subway tunnels for two days
in the dark no food no water
his fingers were scraped to the bone
he was trying to dig his way out
now you try to explain to me why that is
his look says he smells a rat
merrick weighs him a moment
then sighs a little depleted
he gets up and crosses to the glass wall
looks down on the avenue at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath
its not an exact science biogenesis
theres a degree of trial and error
if the agnate doesnt come together on the first pass we have to abort and start over
its like breaking inertia
the bioreactor the growth medium we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration
at which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable
we rely on foundation to provide mental stability matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters
b e a t considers the proxy when signs of instability started to show up it pointed to foundation
a hole in the wall an oversight
but it was only happening in the later generat ions
which pointed back to biogenesis
so there was a production defect
actually the opposite
we found out in the later generations the levels were so high that when we broke inertia the process kept going
specifically the neural system
it produced a condition called synesthesia
a fusion of the senses creating a component awareness
sixth sense s e c o n d sight whatever you want to call it
its emergence seems to be arbitrary
but it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters
it destabilizes them
however if we catch it early enough we can control it with re conditioning
scheer absorbs this with a slow grin
merrick looks puzzled
you find this amusing
this agnate took off just before his sponsor placed an order
maybe he got the sense his days were numbered
merrick s composure cracks a little
he hadnt thought of this
this stays between you and me karl
i trust i can rely on your cooperation
dont you mean my complicity
hardening again remind me why is it you were discharged from the military
whats your point
learn to be a team player karl
or youll find yourself out of another job
scheer rises discarding the ethercuff onto merricks desk
nobody else would take it
the deep steady thrum of the extractor fans
we are tight on the frame of an airlock
hissing it indents and opens
lincoln steps through eyes black and uncanny
the tri key g l i n t i n g dangling from his fingers
scanning around he fixes on a section of wall
he wipes off some soot
legible beneath is a number
he assimilates this
then turns his gaze up the extractor shaft
looking up an elevator shaft
the red pulse of the lode poles rippling downward as an elevator descends from the surface
a tiled chamber
draped off cubicles
the elevator doors slide open
an outsider emerges dressed in a flightsuit emblazoned medical courier
he announces himself seemingly to no one clearance code ng ds
new gaza healthcare
okay youre clear
go ahead and get undressed
the pressure door hisses heaving open
the courier steps inside naked covering his genitals some goggles slung around his neck
he takes position on two marked footpads and puts on the goggles i tell you i hate this fucking r u n
i always leave this place with sunburn
try full course decontamination
its even more fun
especially the colonics
the lights blink out
a red glow rises
twin planes of light scrape across the courier infra red searing his epidermis
a chamber like the first
the inner pressure door hisses open
the courier emerges dripping wet from a decon s h o w e r
he goes to a cubicle grabbing a towel and dries himself off
laid out within are some scrubs
beside them is a steel cooler inset with a thermostat and embossed with the crosshatch insignia
the courier strolls up the corridor now dressed in the scrubs and carrying the cooler
he turns a corner and his footsteps gradually fade out
a flat sterile silence falls in his wake
a metal squeal
a ventilation grid levers down from the ceiling
then a pair of feet drop through legs torso
dropping to the floor lincoln stands revealed
sweaty smeared black with dust
for a moment he looks around to get his bearings
suddenly he freezes hearing c h e c k in at the nurses station
up the corridor left then first right
the footsteps are now coming back
lincoln spins round
he finds a door
a lock panel
a moment of panic
then he fumbles the tri k e y f r o m his pocket hurriedly slotting it into the lock panel
lincoln waits ear to the door listening as the footsteps pass and fade out of earshot
lincoln releases his breath in relief calming a little then frowning as he registers another sound
very faint rhythmic
he turns and looks around
the room is in partial shadow
to one side is a row of seats to the other a row of windows covered by blinds light creasing through
the sound repeats
but now unmistakably the cry of a baby
a grid of bio readouts each square alive with graphs and digits
the familiar baseline of a cardiograph
a lever arm mounted with an iv r e s e r v o i r dangling tubes and wires onto the or table
we see a doctor and a midwife in whose arms a newborn baby squirms and bawls
lying on the table we see the mother her feet up in stirrups deeply flushed and puffing from exertion
marked by her crosshatch as an agnate she has just given birth may i hold her
we have to run a few tests on her first
in the meantime im going to give you something to help you relax okay
off his smile the agnate mother nods anxiously watching the midwife wrap her baby in blanket
the doctor taps a button and watches the iv reservoir misting with a pale colored fluid
the cardiograph marks the drop as the fast acting sedative takes effect
the agnate mother watches drowsily as the midwife takes her baby from the room
then the cry of the newborn is shut out
j u s t the cardiograph now the beeps evening out the scart o f peaks shallowing a s the agnate mother falls asleep
the doctor taps a button
on the grid the face of a desk nurse appears
im incubating the baby for hours prior to transport
but go ahead and contact the sponsor
tell her she has a beautiful baby girl
the nurse nods
the grid square goes blank
then the doctor taps another button
reading it he cites let the record show the sponsor has signed clause of the basic sponsor s h i p agreement
a light starts blinking
the doctor walks stiffly out of the room
the door hisses closed
the agnate mother is left alone
sleeping peacefully blind to the fluid now seeping into her iv
d e a f to the slowing beep of the cardiograph
the peaks of the baseline falling
spacing fading slowing slowing until
the cardiograph flatlines
an d a sepulchral stillness falls
our angle widens with the growing emptiness
lincoln looks down from above eyes frozen in the slatted light
his fingers are trembling rattling the blinds against the glass
lincoln tumbles out of the door
he cant breathe cant think his mind is in overload
he stumbles around like a wounded animal
his focus suddenly and searingly r e t u r n s as he hears starkweather
like the football player
a rotunda spoked by corridors
a console at its hub manned by the desk nurse we saw earlier
the courier stands over her thats right
still showing in surgery
honey i got a bird on the pad and a storm moving in
how longs it gonna be
another grid of readouts
another cardiograph beeps
a spotlamp illuminates the or table and starkweather two delta his face slack with anesthesis eyes rolling a little beneath the lids
the rest of him under a sheet cut out over the belly the flesh slit and parted by a clamp framing a window into his innards
standing over him mid operation a surgeon and surgical tech
interrupted by a chime the surgeon looks up at a screen where a panel flashes paging
he cradles his bloody gloves and elbows a button
the face of the desk nurse resolves on screen the couriers here for pickup
well hes going to have to wait a while
it took forever to put this one under
hes asking for an eta
said something about some kind of storm moving in
for christs sake is that my fault
just find a way to stall him okay
what is it
subjects heart rate is spiking
boost the anaesthetic lev
suddenly hes sprayed with blood a s the clamp springs loose from the stomach clattering to the floor
hes frozen by shock as
starkweather sits bolts upright
dazed he looks at the surgeon the tech then down at his wide open stomach
instinctively he clutches it
then his mind assimilating the horror he screams
now launching off the operating table the lever arm swinging out blindsiding t h e tech tubes and wires snapping loose instruments flying starkweather lunges for the doorway the surgeon
steps up to block him only to be hurled aside
the blare of an alarm
starkweather clumping down the corridor clutching his open stomach blood streaming down his legs
hes delirious running nowhere anywhere running blind
reaching the end of the corridor he stops suddenly seeing white uniforms
he doubles back up the corridor
kicking at doors with bare feet frantic for any means of escape
he spots a ventilator grid slightly open
he jumps reaching for it
once twice then his feet slip from under him
he hits the floor with a damp splat
two censors turn the corner ready for action
but there is starkweather face down in a starburst o f his own blood
yeah no sweat subject is secured
povceiling ventilator grid
looking down through the slits onto starkweather directly beneath
he now has a loose white hood over his head
his wrists and ankles are bound by plastic cuffs
a loop of intestine plumps out from his belly
his weight is such that the censors have to drag him away leaving a bloodsmear o n the floor
his guttural whimpers are the only sign of life
closeup lincolns face in part shadow looking down
the gleam of his eyes as starkweather disappears from view
listening now to those feeble whimpers growing fainter ever fainter until they disappear from earshot
all that remains of starkweather is a wending bloodsmear o n the floor
the green mountains in different aspect framed by a different window
the bedroom is like lincolns but with a few feminine touches
ester in her papery pajamas sits brushing her hair
with a chime etherscreen scales over her reflection
the etherscreen resolves lincolns face dishevelled urgent ester
i have to talk to you
are you okay
i was worried
what are you talking about
the contamination warning
somebody said youd been exposed
lincoln pauses to process this
hunted more cautious now i want you to meet me as soon as you can
but you cant tell anyone
is it true
were you contaminated
you know where to come
his face blinks out
ester is left frowning at her reflection
lincoln stares at his own mirror image
his eyes fraught with revelation
his clothes begrimed with dirt and blood
he rests his head against the etherscreen panel shuddering pressing his eyes tightly closed
as if he could ever forget what hes seen
the routine flow of residents up the avenue
lincoln walks head bowed trying to look inconspicuous
showered white shirt and blue slacks under his shearling he looks a little too scrubbed too clean
he spots a familiar figure up ahead
he catches up
j o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity
are you alright
i heard there was a contamination scare
i saw what happened to him
what are you talking about
what they did to him
jones huffs dismissively
lincoln grabs his shoulder ardent they cut him open jonesy
the y took him upstairs and they cut him open
jones holds his gaze a moment then shrugs off his grip
you caught that fucking p a t h o g e n didnt you
j o n e s y listen to me
but jones just backs away
lincoln makes to follow
then stops dead in his tracks
across the avenue two censors are on patrol and his best friend is now heading towards them
with a barren torn grimace lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd
r i n g s of empty seats round the empty stage
ester enters warily walking up the aisle
lincoln waits in the shadows
he checks to see she hasnt been followed
then steps forward
ester recoils please
dont come any closer
i dont want to get contaminated
ester im not contaminated
but they said
im not contaminated
his shout echoes through the empty auditorium
ester looks at him alarmed by his vehemence
lincoln calms himself a little contaminants pathogens
its just what they tell us to keep us inside
what do you mean
i saw it
why they keep us here
to use us
to take things from us
youre not making sense
theyre going to take your baby away
m y baby
why would they do that
i dont know
but i saw it
youre scaring me lincoln
i want to go back now
you cant go back
dont you get it
n o b o d y move
stay right where you are
a censor steps through stopgun l e v e l l e d
lincoln hovers mind racing
the censor moves in tightening aim on him
ester looks on anxiously as he approaches lincoln
lincoln now sees the censor pulling out some plastic cuffs
the same cuffs used on starkweather promising the same fate
triggering him lincoln lunges at the censor ramming him toppling him across the seats knocking the stopgun f r o m his grasp recoiling as the censor retaliates driving a
knee into his groin doubling him over then a knee to his head thudding into his skull dont hurt him
ester runs up grabbing at the white uniform trying to restrain him the censor swats her blindly hitting her in the stomach lincoln spins round at the sound of esters
yelp only to be roundhoused b y the censor the blow sending him to the floor ester doubled over wincing at the pain clutching her belly instinctively protectively an ominous scowl knotting her face the censor punishing lincoln kicking him down the aisle then suddenly hearing a noise from behind turning to face it as b o o m a gunblast r i p s the air
the brief wail of a hookhead
t h u d the censor recoiling lurching as the hookhead b i t e s starting to gag blood jetting from his neck a hookhead c l a w
e d into his jugular gurgling collapsing to the floor ester standing frozen holding the stopgun seeing lincoln now getting up she drops the stopgun l i k e its on fire aghast lincoln
l i k e shes asking him what she did
silence the rasp of the censor blood foaming another sound footfalls
lincoln goes to the door an imminent mass of white uniforms
he grabs ester censors bursting in led by scheer pushing through into the main hall the statue of dr
sanger looking serenely down a hiss of depressurization a pressure door swings open lincoln and ester tumbling through running up the maintenance corridor censors fanning out sweeping the hall stopguns
r e a d y scheer finds the fallen censor crouches to examine him then somebody get someone down here
a censor splits off to join him tapping his headset scheer rises again in his eyes detachment yields to cold intensity
the censors flooding through into the maintenance corridor in their white uniforms they seem like a swarm of antibodies lincoln and ester deeper in at another pressure door fumbling the
trikey i n t o the lock
a tense second
the lock hisses open scheer pushes through the opening gap of another pressure door taking the lead his censors surging up in his wake lincoln and ester meeting an intersection
veering at random running blind running deeper into the faceless labyrinth scheer catching up hitting the intersection pausing to split his squad in each direction white uniforms dispersing lincoln and ester reaching another pressure door
lincoln jams the tri key i n t o the lock
the seconds pass
but the door doesnt open
lincoln looks around for another exit
ester looks at him in mounting panic then the pressure door opens not onto a corridor but an elevator car
pulling ester inside lincoln finds an array of buttons
his fingers hovers uncertain which to press
so he punches all of them stabbing madly trying to prompt the door to close
scheer turns a corner seeing his quarry at the far end of the corridor he gathers pace
the elevator is closing but he doesnt break stride
he deftly taps his headset opening a channel to ethercon
the elevator override it
do you read me
bring it back down
ethercon is working the console keys like a madman
his gaze flitting to a subgrid o f the complex spinning the angles navigating the mesh of lines
his voice comes apologetically youre off the grid sir
give me a second
can you tell me where you are
he recoils at the blaring volume of the response
scheer stands with his censors poised watching the panel chart the elevators descent
a light flashes and the doors open
they level their stopguns o n
the elevator is empty
foundation levels all of them
lock them down
access only on my command
a dead acoustic
a corridor paved with sound proofing panels
it ends at a pressure door where lincoln and ester now arrive
lincoln looks back to the elevator at the other end
no going back
he slots the tri key into the lock
the door hisses open
the sound of slow bubbling
lincoln and ester pause to adjust to the gloom
they are in a hall of windows
ester is the first to venture forth as if drawn to the nearest window
behind the glass is a foundation tank
bubbling with viscous fluid laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro
the tubes connect to a form
a human form an adult form but curled foetally
i t is known as a nascent
in this tank is a female nascent shifting slightly causing ester to gasp
the nascent registers the noise turning its head
its eyelids are closed but its eyeballs move questioning
a slight furrow appears on its crosshatched brow
ester recoils in sudden horror perhaps remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from
spurred to action ester follows lincoln onward up the hall
still conscious of movement all around of nascents stirring at the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare
a stopgun n o s e s through the door
followed by scheer moving in silence honed
how much time has passed is unclear
he signals his censors to split off
tracking scheers advance we intercut another foundation chamber censors making their sweep
strobes of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks
it angles to project a grid across each nascents face then fires a short laser burst searing a crosshatch into the brow
another foundation chamber another contingent moves up another row of foundation tanks
the nascents within have cables plugged into their ears filaments pulsing
the nascents a r e in a posture of rigor sinews straining as they accept the data impression
returning to scheer as he reaches the end of the first chamber
no further access just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks
he pauses confused for a second
one of the censors comes up
they cant have got past this level
scheer peels off his headset giving full leash to his senses straining to concentrate
seconds of pent silence
then he hears a faint humming
his gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid
a pov looking up
the funnel mouth framing a vista of the world outside
a hostile vista of black sky maelstroms of sand
the sound of blasting air suborned to the giant howl of a duststorm
reaching over the funnel lip as lincoln pulls himself up with a mighty effort
blinking blinded by the sand he swings astride the lip
then he reaches down to pull ester up
ester gains the lip and likewise swings astride coughing blinking
t h e dusty earth as lincoln leaps down to meet it
we track up as he helps ester down from the funnel
her feet meeting the earth we are now in cu o n their faces
gaping and blinking at the prospect of the world outside
a world of darkness and storm
sudden blinding light as halogens explode the darkness
lincoln shields his eyes scanning for their source
he spots a large cubic building banks of spotlights on the roof
he pulls ester away
away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness
t h e thrum of extractor fans
scheer pacing on a catwalk
white uniforms above and below flashlights roving sliced by the blades of the extractor fans
from somewhere comes a shout sir
we got em
motion sensors just picked them up at the surface
another burst of halogens
more spotlights engage their blaze flooding across the foreview catching two figures lincoln and ester running now veering sharply away from the light
now disappearing from sight dropping into the trench of the lodeway
the rising hum of the lode poles
the elevator crammed with censors
scheer at the front staring ahead
he looks very focused bitterly so
the look of a man outwitted by lab rats
the darkness of the trench
lincoln and ester running along the lode way stumbling over the buffers
above them the dust flails in lashing tongues starkly depicted by the halogens
white uniforms in the night censors spill forth into the halogen light splitting in all directions
scheer suddenly notices the corona of light from the front of the complex
he barks something inaudible to his men launching into a run
the gateway looming above
beneath lincoln and ester on their knees clawing at the dust
like burrowing animals trying to widen the gap between the foot of the gate and the lodeway
a lone white uniform
as scheer reaches the forecourt stopping to scan the spotlit view the veils of the duststorm
his face tightening with urgency
suddenly he taps his headset barking the lodeway
light it up
the rising hum of the lode poles barely audible over the storm
lincoln and ester washed by pulsing red light
ester recoiling her arm flinging back from the pull
lincoln grabbing her his own arm straining now
the polarity tugging their ethercuffs
the red wash of light from the lodeway as scheer races up the edge eyes trawling the trench for his quarry
his pace now suddenly dropping slowing to a halt
he doubles over catching his breath
more white uniforms now appear from the dust as the censors unable to match his pace finally catch up
the first reaching him scheer pulls upright bellowing over the wind g e t me a bird
in this storm
the y got out
they got past the gate
scheer spins on his heel back towards the institute
the censor lingers confused
then he fixes on the lodeway
floating past in the red wash are the luminous blue seams of two ethercuffs
the perimeter wall silhouetted in the middle distance
lincoln and ester scramble through the scrub blinded by dust driven by momentum
as ester starts lagging behind lincoln grabs her arm ester
we have to keep going
but ester resists him breaking loose from his grasp
lincoln looks at her uncomprehending
until he sees her expression the harrowed stare in her eyes the labored heaving of her chest
ester staggers back losing balance reeling as if spun by the storm
her eyes widening senses flooding
the howling wind the swirling dustclouds the pendent gulf of black sky
her reel returning her to face lincoln ester opens her mouth to speak
but all that comes is a scream
a scream from deep within shrill and hysterical the only articulation she can find
lincoln grabs her and covers her mouth
fighting to stifle her rocking to her convulsions
but ester keeps screaming
a scream of everything
all is still
just a muted shudder of wind on glass
the room is in shadow
all we see is a canopied bed where a figure obscured lies sleeping
the still is disrupted by a chime
the figure stirs fumbling at the nightstand
a holoframe resolves the light revealing dr
sanger rumpled by sleep
he peers into the holoframe to find the face of merrick gaunt with concern merrick on holoframe he n r y
theres been a breach
a brim of dawn over the red rocks
the view is framed by the mouth of a cave
lincoln sleeps within slumped against the rock his head bowed heavily
the touch of first light opens his eyes
his brow creasing as if waking from a bad dream into a worse reality
he looks around only to find himself alone
he gets up a little shaky at first then ventures out of the cave
he emerges onto a ledge perhaps fifty feet up
he pauses eyes adjusting to the quality of light
he sees the storm has reduced to a low wind combing the floorland o f scrub
now across the ledge he sees ester
perched on an outcrop hugging her knees watching the sunrise over the desert
he crosses and lowers to a crouch beside her
ester turns to him with a confused frown w h e r e did all the green go
lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes
he answers gently the r e is no green
the windows in there
they were just pictures
ester absorbs this with difficulty
lincoln rises again and stands looking out across the desert into the barren unknown
from the massive sky grows a glinting shape
like a helicopter but sleeker aquiline
without combustion its only noise is the sibilance of blades slicing air
it is known as a whisper
the pilot jockeys with the thermals
scheer rides shotgun
now in civvies scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars
the flight console beeps
he taps a keypad
a holoframe resolves ground team checking in
the storm pretty much covered their tracks
were scanning for thermals b u t the hotter it gets the harder it is to isolate a heat signature
i dont know sir its a big desert out there
the desert sun clefts the chasm into light and shadow
lincoln trudges into view ester lagging behind
he stops to let her catch up only to watch her slump onto a rock
he allows her a moment to rest and walks to where the chasm comes to an end
he surveys the terrain
his eyes roam the carpet of scrub now narrowing on an inconsistency
a faint strip where nothing seems to grow
tracing its lineage he walks a few feet out
then drops to a crouch and starts clawing away at the dust
his fingers meet something hard
he sweeps off the dust to expose a layer of concrete
continuing revealing the ghost of a line
what we might recognize as a lane marker but a curiosity to him
continuing opening a window in the dust
now his fingers snag o n something
he tugs it and it gives a little dust crumbling to reveal a section of rusted chainlink
a corner of metal is visible
lincoln exposes the rest
a sign barely legible us government restricted area
he frowns trying to assimilate
ester comes up to join him
off her anxious look he decides i think ive found a path
w h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine
a whisper skims over the treecaps circling in on a high shelf
here remotely nestled in a clearing stands a glass villa
the flood of light the majestic view lend an air of beatitude
the decor is minimalist with native american accents kokopelli spirits in carved silhouette
sanger stands at a glass wall looking out across the green mountain valley
on the sofa sits merrick now in civvies still gaunt from worry
the air stirs as a maid ushers in a woman s all business sharp blue eyes a severe mannish coiffure
her name is ellen crowne
good morning gentlemen
bernard this is ellen crowne from our legal department
ellen this is bernard merrick director of products
thank you for coming out here
well when henry called me i got the sense it wasnt for a social visit
they settle at a table
a jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out
i understand there was an incident
first let me stress theres no way we could have anticipated what happened
were on the same team mr
just give me the facts down and dirty
uneasy clears his throat wev e lost two of our products
they escaped containment last night
crowne casts a troubled look at sanger
merrick quickly adds merrick contd however we have all available resources dedicated to the search
how exactly did this happen
wer e still piecing it together
do we expect more products to escape
dont be so alarmist ellen
im sorry henry but you asked me here to assess our liabilities
to answer your question we condition our products with a deterrent
a fear of contamination
and thereby of the outer environment
so to escape they first have to escape their conditioning
crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette
containment is one of the terms of our state health license
the fact it was compromised could put us in violation
henry it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place
theyre not going to pull our license ellen
we have a lot of friends on the commission
not to mention the goodwill we earned in dc when we took over the facility a bunker complex for a bio chemical war that never happened
we relieved them of a costly embarrassment
im not sure we can rely on that
what do you suggest
first i need you to level with me
what are our chances of finding them
well in our favor theyve never been outside containment
theyd have no coordinates no sense of direction
i dont see how thats in our favor
theyre in the middle of the desert
food and water become an issue
so they might return to the trough
and if not
how long could they last
a few days maybe
but there is another variable
we maintain the products in a sterile environment
so basically their immune systems are untested
toxins pathogens environmentals t h e rest of us overcome routinely to them
thats a little drastic
some immune systems are more adaptive than others
lets take the drastic case
the male we could cover
fast track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access
the female comes under the maternity plan
shes three months pregnant
even if we fast tracked another generation we couldnt fast track the pregnancy
wed miss the delivery date the sponsor would wonder why and there would be
crowne looks worried
sanger pours a glass of icewater
even so the worst may not happen
we havent even touched on the worst
if these products reach a populated area theres the problem of scrutiny
ellen we operate under state license on a lease from the federal government
c u t s him off harshly we slipped through a loophole in the clone laws henry
and they only let u s through because they smelt money
and they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not ours
its at the core of our license why we screen potential sponsors why we make them sign discretion agreements why containment is such a critical factor to limit the extent
of public scrutiny
e i t h e r way its unlikely theyd get that far
its at least twenty miles to the next settlement
merrick hesitates before nodding his assent
crowne pounces on it
something to add mr
i just dont think we should under estimate them
especially the male
and i dont think we should panic
he cautions merrick with a discreet look then shakes a pill from a bottle
crowne looks forward to both men
gentlemen whatever happens we need t o keep one thing clearly in mind
as far as the world at large goes we are just another medical services company
anything that alters that perception puts us at risk
and we cannot rely on the sanction of the law to protect us
whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we recover these products we have to stay beyond reproach
all it takes is one nudge to put us in the spotlight
then youll see how fast politicians can run for cover
merrick shifts uneasy
sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile i n other words we need to find them o r else
thats very astute ellen
the dust swirls and puffs across a highway of yesteryear
a dirt track but for patches of exposed concrete and angles of buckled lampposts
the empty path reaches to a blood red sunset
the dust skims over mountains of rusted scrap
nestled in the mountains is a shack
a sign creaks in the breeze osmund d e e r licensed salvage merchant
on the porch sits an old man in a greasy ballcap a n d dungarees
this is the eponymous owner ozzie
hes sitting on a lounger surveying his empire enjoying a beer and a cigarette
exhaling a drag of smoke his eyes crease to a squint
he sees something through the smoke silhouetted against the sunset
an approaching figure wary like a flighty animal
the silhouetted figure doesnt answer just stares back at him
can i help you
this seems to get a response
the figure ventures closer
we recognize lincoln
exhausted dust covered and dry throated my friend
she needs water
a mass of technology and furniture from recent and distant past
lincoln lowers ester onto a threadbare sofa
ozzie excited to have visitors bustles up with a water gallon pouring a glass
lincoln takes it and tips it to esters lips
she coughs it out at first
then takes the glass and starts drinking with vigor
ozzie sets down the water gallon in front of his visitors
then settles in an armchair and cracks open a beer
it lends the mood albeit strained of a social visit
lonely old ozzie wanting to make it so
despite which both men have an eye on each other
got stuck in that supercell didya
lincoln eyes him wary of the question
ozzie reads confusion supercellstorm thats what they call it on the news anyways
i n my day we just called em big ol h o w l e r s
ozzie chuckles to himself
it seems to put his visitor at ease
yep i heard it shut down some of the lodeways
dust in the works i guess
where were you folks headed anyways
lincoln gulps down some water deciding an answer
then ventures away
a w a y
you mean like outta s t a t e
o u t of state
the term is meaningless to lincoln but he likes the sound of it
this is starting to feel like a real social visit
n o w wheres my manners gone
osmund r e a l l y
but folks call me ozzie
an awkward lull as ozzie waits for his visitor to reciprocate
s o m e t i m e s i like to make a joke of it my last name bein d e e r
o z z i e chuckles but the pun seems lost on his visitor
he lets it drop
the awkward silence returns
lincoln drinks the water wondering if this strange old man is as harmless as he appears
we l l now looks like yer g i r l f r i e n d s made herself at home
lincoln looks at ester slumped over asleep on the sofa
ozzie puts a finger to his lips beckoning his visitor out of the room
the porch light comes on casting the scrapyard in grades of light and shadow
ozzie steps out onto the porch lighting a cigarette
his visitor hovering at the threshold he offers the pack
lincoln steps out and takes one
ozzie lights it for him yer girlfriend sure is pretty
his visitor looks at him curiously
ozzie misinterprets that hes said something out of turn
time to change the subject so whats with them tattoos huh
he taps his forehead
lincoln fingers his crosshatch suddenly aware of it now and suspicious of the question
ozzie palliates hey in the eye of the beholder right
now this place this is beautiful to me
this is my place
i own it
may not look like much but youd be surprised
cmon lemme show you
ozzie moseys into the scrapyard beckoning his visitor
lincoln hesitates then follows him sensing its better to play along
m o s t a t h i s heavy stuffs industrial scrap
comes in from all over
easy way round the recyclin l a w s
me i sell it on to the boondock b o y s for meltdown
other stuff i pick up at the scrap markets
fix it up fetches a price
the y reach a vehicle shell
a rust pocked chassis canted on its axle we might recognize it as an automobile from our own era
fossil fuel transport
this piece o junks a collectors item
all that age of the wheel nostalgia elegant era of transport bullshit
i find the parts shes as good as solid gold
ozzie pats his investment and moves to another rusted metal pile
steepled by rail tracks we see elevator sheaves tension cables
now this heres got a colorful history
came in from this ol g o v e r n m e n t bunker out in the valley
got shut down way back
then this new outfit took over stripped the place out
i guess theyre doin s o m e more remodelling cause i just had em in again the other day
a tug of smoke reflective hump n dump crew
the term is familiar
the taste of smoke a hint
but his memory has been clouded by trauma
ozzie reads his face you okay there
lincoln looks at him something breaking the clouds
a sense of danger indistinct
suddenly cautious he stubs his cigarette im going to check on my friend
a front room turned into a front office
piles of paper teeter atop junk furniture
a bankers lap we might recognize from our own era glows over a desk where ozzie is rummaging looking for something
he stops to peer through and check on his visitors
the woman still lies asleep on the sofa
the man is sitting beside her armchair head bowed seemingly plunged in thought
o z z i e resumes rummaging to find a crumpled delivery note
he reviews it for a moment
then quickly clears away some more papers to uncover a keypad device
it is known as a holocom
he taps a key and a holoframe resolves
then taps in some digits from the delivery note
the holoframe snows with static
then a crosshatch insignia appears spinning in d welcome to the sanger institute
if you know your partys extension press
what are you doing
ozzie jerks round to find his visitor suddenly standing there
he fumbles on the holocom keypad and the crosshatch blinks out
i wasnt doin nuthin
lincoln frowns the sense of danger becoming more distinct
ozzie reads his visitors troubled expression realizing i knew it
them weird tattoos
i mean i heard stories from those guys but i never
o f f his visitors frown ozzie bites his tongue
hes cornered in this cramped space with a freak of science
time to backpedal n o t that i believe em
buncha c r a z y stories
nuthin t o do with you
he chuckles feebly
but his visitor just stares back at him pupils dilated and dark somehow inhuman
time to wriggle out w h a d d y a s a y we just forget about it huh
how about i go getcha a beer
he makes a move past but his visitor doesnt budge
lincoln senses danger in this old man whose fear is now manifest what e v e r you want
just take it
whaddya w a n t
you want money
his visitor frowns
ozzie quickly unlocks a cashbox
he grabs some colored plastic cards and offers them like meat to a lion
i t s all i got
just dont hurt me
his visitor takes a blue card inspecting it like a curiosity
then steps closer
ozzie shrinks back
an ominous moment then o u t of state how do i get there
o f f ozzies cowering and confused look we f r o m darkness grows a seed of light
the whisper flies low and quiet its spotlight roving the undulant desert
now picking out metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard
now training its beam on a figure in the dust whirl beneath
ozzie his hair flying wild gesticulating madly
the whisper follows his directions nosing onwards its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks
i n the middle of nowhere a canopied platform
not unlike the sub w a y platform it borders a deeply trenched lodeway
a wave of dust rolls in swelled by the whisper landed beyond
it seems to bring scheer to the platform
he scans around for a clue a footprint perhaps
but somehow he already knows
he looks up the lodeway eyes honing
the deep black line stretches far into the night
sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea
crowne sits smoking
stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting
the still is broken as merrick emerges from an adjacent room
sanger and crowne look up expectant
merrick closes the door with slow care
then he faces them a grim tenor in his voice bad news
the whisper slices the night running lights blinking
we pan to frame it against a skyline of black towers
a glittering row of domes and spires somehow celestial touching the sky
the city bears no trace of its origins once built over indian ruins now rebuilt subsumed by urban overhaul
it has become a metropolis
a glass dome faceted insectile
a haut monde h i v e
the movers and shakers of the high tech boomtown drinking dancing
shot waitresses dose blue tequila
bass music thuds like a heartbeat
scheer looks out of place here but the crowds too self absorbed to care
he moves through them invisibly towards a corner booth
two men in suits sit with a bottle of blue tequila
the first is bald pale and dead looking hed be the grim reaper but for his fixed leer
the second is long haired bearded hulking more of a grim ploughman
he has a metal brace screwed into his forearm
which one of you is diggs
thats me slick
this heres my partner burdon
dont mind him
he gets a little shy around strangers
what happened to his arm
pursuit last week
the guy took a swing at him with a fireaxe
didnt stop burdie though
took down that fucker with one arm didnt you
burdon sips his drink
scheer underwhelmed takes a seat
you dont look like bounty hunters
well were on the job see
and it kind of helps if you bleed in
you dont look like a bondman either
im just an intermediary
now thats what people use when they dont want to get their hands dirty
he grins cannily
scheer grimaces a pro suffering an amateur
i was told you also handled civil bonds
debt runners data thieves
what we hunt depends on the bounty
its worth ten platinum
diggs pauses at this
a huge amount
he licks some salt downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime
whats the bond
the parties i represent want to limit the specific details
but lets just say industrial secrets are involved
must be big secrets
that canny grin again
it raises scheers hackles any good at keeping them
oh me and burdie were busy bees
we dont have time to file every report and we got real bad memories
but just so we understand each other slick were talking about a bag job right
scheer returns an equivocal look
then dips in his pocket for two digital slides lincoln and esters headshots spinning in d
whats up with these tattoos
they look like fucking boondock types
all im authorized to tell you is they have no records in this state
also that theyre not armed or dangerous
how about we start with their names
john and jane doe
youre kidding me right
scheers look says hes serious
but diggs is still confounded
the n with all due respect how the fuck d o you expect us to find them
because you wont have to look
they jumped an overnight shuttle
theyll be headed for the terminal trying to get out of state
its strictly a recovery job
for you it should be childsplay
the n why not do it yourself
or is the dog ring just to impress the ladies
scheer moves his hand to cover the usmc ring stiffly the parties i represent want to stay at arms length
and just so we understand each other that means no connection no papertrail no police interest
is that everything
they want these two brought in quickly and quietly and unharmed
once you have them youll contact me for further instructions
i dont know
what do you say burdie
b u r d o n looks over
then suddenly stands bolt upright diving into his jacket jerking out what looks like a pump action shotgun
f r a n k hofstetter
this is a bond recovery
step away from the bar
f a c e s turn as he swings aim across the bar hofstetter slight wide eyed looking hunted customers moving away exposing him burdon chambering a cartridge emphatic hofstetter
f r e e z e s a deer in the headlights a moment of hesitation then he runs
b o o m burdon fires but the shot misses hitting the bartender exploding on impact with a blinding electrical discharge the stunned bartender spasms and drops burdon pumps and
chambers another slug his weapon now earned the name of a thunderbolt
a stampede begins customers running scared his quarry lost in the stampede burdon vaults over the table diggs pulls out what looks like a twin barrel sawn off and launches
after him scheer stays seated watching the hunt with remote curiosity h o f s t e t t e r c l a w s through the stampede spotting burdon and the thunderbolt close behind he drops out of the firing line onto his knees crawling banged about almost at the exit almost t w i n barrels press to his head diggs looks down grinning beckoning him upright hofstetter l o o k s up bleak defeated a girl blunders into them toppling over hofstetter i n t o diggs h o f s t e t t e r t a k e s his chance to run now scrambling against the stampede diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon the stampede parting throwing themselves to the ground as b o o m diggs fires the scattershot hits hofstetter a s he flees up some steps peppering his leg sparks off metal as diggs keeps firing his weapon now earned the name of a rainmaker
h o f s t e t t e r r e a c h e s a catwalk his leg dragging numbing from t h e tranquilizer cores the
catwalk dead ends blind panic now he ducks under the rail reaching for the dome finding a precarious handhold he swings across trying to climb d i g g s comes up beneath looking up grinning the pathetic sight of hofstetter one leg useless clinging to the dome like a fly trapped under glass as burdon goes to recover him dont bother
hell drop by himself
b u r d o n pulls out some handcuffs and stands waiting
diggs returns to the booth
pouring out two tequila shots he grins at scheer n o w
where were we
s u n l i g h t blinks off a chain of carriages travelling the trench of a lodeway
the overnight shuttle slits through the desert
the sun is a muted orb behind polarized glass
lincoln stares out of the window at the bleak new world blurring past
hes wearing ozzies ballcap o v e r his crosshatch his former clothes discarded for some of the old mans ill fitting denims
perhaps a disguise or perhaps just to shed the memory
he glances across at ester dressed likewise her hair teased to cover her crosshatch
shes dozing head rested on the glass
a ticket collector comes up
lincoln looks at the man in uniform uncertain what he wants
the ticket collector shakes his head
these two look like deadbeats
a d u l t fare is forty five currency units
do you have the money sir
the word is familiar
he pulls out the blue plastic card
the man in uniform looks encouraged
he gives him the card watching him slot it into a handheld device which briefly flashes then the card is returned
lincoln sees a strip at the top is now transparent like a depleted reservoir
not so different from the transactions in the world below
then he notices ester is awake and is looking at him
her bright eyes dim and troubled somehow accusatory
i t s going to be okay ester
faint is it
we just need to get out of state
ester disconsolate looks out of the window
in her gaze the forlorn air of a hatchling fallen from the nest
lincoln watches her knowing her troubles and knowing that he cannot relieve them
the skyline stands reprised in daylight
a glimmering citadel
p a s s e n g e r s climb the steps from an underground gloom
lincoln and ester with them jostled by the more certain flow
they cross the portal onto the street and stop dazzled by the sunlight
only to be dazzled again by the sudden stunning prospect of the city
f i r s t theres the quality of light a burning white perhaps from depleted ozone depicting everything in a surreal shimmer
then theres the towers darkly crystalline facets of polarized glass rising to domes and spires like monolothic f i n g e r s reaching for the sky
the traffic flashing past the chassis identifiable as trucks taxis compacts sedans streamlined in a nautical trim hull runners in place of wheels
the sound of claxons more like fog horns than car horns
then theres the street itself a six l a n e lodeway lanes marked with buoys bobbing around on cables
the graceful arcs of pedestrian bridges at the intersections
the citizens strange hairstyles fashions all wearing sunglasses
even to us its a wondrous sight
the urbanism the grandeur as if here in the heart of southwest manhattan has met venice
he y man spare a little green
a w e interrupted lincoln and ester look around
slouched by the street exit is a hobo with a mangy dog
he grins toothlessly a i n t eaten in two days have we boy
lincoln and ester step back as the dog rises to greet them
tail wagging it noses forward sniffing
then abruptly drops its tail and backs off whining
lincoln and ester likewise back off
both sides have just discovered a new species
the hobo pets his whining canine watching the strangers walk off with curiosity
the sunlight flares off passing vehicles hypnotic
the faces of pedestrians flash past
lincoln and ester wander in thrall up the street
everywhere new sights new curiosities bombard them
the storefronts mysterious recesses behind polarized glass
the glass alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s marquees temps
new tech opportunities
manicures dermals follicle grafts
discount legal service
class actions only
h o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street huge shimmering panels like phantom jumbotrons commercials
playing on a loop a businessman in a conference room shrinking from a fierce negotiation the scene replayed with the same businessman now on his feet stabbing his finger angrily in the air a pill bottle in cu a text super combatrine
the aggression enhancer a teenager bemused by his homework his parents escorting him into a clinic the teenager hooded by an electronic dome his parents clapping the teenager smiling as
he accepts a diploma a text super intellex data impression for a new generation lincoln suddenly looks round realizing ester is gone from his side
he scans the sea of faces
then spots her stepping through a doorway
over the threshold is a holoform a pig with wings circled by the legend hog heaven
home of the true hamburger
f a s t food outlets have evidently changed little
promotional posters in d ham slam porker forkers bacon blitz
service counter seating area
ester is looking around like alice in wonderland
lincoln comes up out of breath edgy i told you to stay with me
i n n o c e n t plaintive im hungry
o k a y
he nods realizing he is too
he plants ester in a seat and looks around
people stand in line transacting receiving food trays
not unlike nutrition plaza
lincoln ventures to the counter
he offers the blue card hopefully
the service clerk looks at him a r e you gonna tell me what you want
b e a t no other reference what are my options
k n o c k yourself out buddy
he indicates a menu above
lincoln assimilates looking up at the menu
understanding now his face lifts to almost a smile
its the first time hes been given an unrestricted choice
lincoln returns to ester with a tray of food and drink
shes staring off again distant
he puts a burger and drink cup in front of her
she seems not to notice
he tries to engage her i asked the man how to get to the terminal
he said its not far
but ester just keeps staring her brow now furrowing as a little girl skips past maybe sipping a soda
now lincoln sees her too and is transfixed
now the little girl notices the strangers staring at her
she hurries onward uncomfortable
lincoln and esters eyes follow
its the first time theyve seen a child
a low rumble
a plume of smoke
a sudden eruption of fire
a bird rises from the flames and a phoenix spreads its wings
widening we reveal this is a holoform o v e r the terminal entrance
union station now looks more like grand central
a huge granite facade a covered colonnade linking to pedestrian bridges at the corners
here in the flow of figures we make out lincoln and ester resembling tourists
then a short distance behind we spot two more figures
the hobo and his timorous dog
v a u l t e d
arched windows mosaiced i n polarized glass
sunlight falls in filtered shafts
footfalls echo off polished granite
lincoln and ester scan around
ester looks daunted by the space
lincoln looks focused
he sees people in line transacting
the sign on the window reads tickets
the word is familiar
he steps up to the counter with ester
a ticket clerk female immaculately groomed greets them with a glossy smile
lincoln offers her the blue card
she seems not to notice
we l c o m e to phoenix union station
what is your date of travel sir
lincoln has to think
dates mean nothing to him
he ventures now
an d what is your destination
o u t of state
could you repeat that
we want to go out of state
could you repeat that
l i k e talking to a wall aint it
lincoln and ester turn to look
the interceder is pale bald wearing leathers
a stranger to them we recognize him as diggs h o l o s e r v e
c h e a p e r than flesh and blood but nothing between the ears
diggs demonstrates wafting his hand across the ticket counter
it cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple
f i r s t time i used one of these i asked her out on a date
he grins genially examining their faces verifying his quarry
lincoln examines the pale man
the sense of danger is welling what do you want
j u s t wanted to help thats all
d i g g s shrugs disarming trying to win them over nice and easy per the mandate
then he notices the eyes of his male quarry
the pupils black and dilating
suddenly the male jerks away like a shying horse drawing the female with him
diggs unperturbed makes no attempt to follow
turning his back on them he touches a device concealed in his ear canal a miniature two way radio b u r d i e its them
lincoln and ester emerge into the colonnade rejoining the flow of figures
lincoln presses the pace alert darting looks back
the pale man doesnt appear to be following
but the sense of danger is spurring him to gain distance
ester vicarious to the danger stays close to lincolns side scurrying to keep up
neither of them notices the grey vehicle sliding up on them kerbside
a commercial transit van known as a cutter its a common sight on the streets
the driver leans out of the window hair tied back dressed in buckskins we recognize burdon you folks need a ride
lincoln and ester turn to look
the dark giant is just another stranger cast in a demeanor of casual inquiry
hes offering an opportunity to gain distance but lincoln remains hesitant
the sense of danger turbulent hard to read
burdon sugars the way p r i v a t e cab
no state surcharge
he taps a button and the side door slips open
lincoln looks into the lightless c a v i t y wavering uncertain
ester hugging close nervous
figures passing jostling them toward the cavity
the dark giant looking on expectantly
the pause stretching then
what the fuck are you doing man
b a c k down the colonnade the hobo is gesticulating to burdon i told you
they went inside
the hobo doesnt see lincoln and ester unwitting that hes just betrayed himself as their shadow
and burdon as their predator
his dog starts barking
lincoln starts backing away with ester his eyes blackening the danger surging the dog barking the giants face dropping the elements converging
b u r d o n jams into reverse but his pursuit is cut short by a parked vehicle he swings a look back jabbing his earpiece n o r
t h corner
lincoln and ester race up the colonnade against the flow of figures darting and weaving like fish swimming upstream d i g g s bursts from the north exit launching
up the north side of the terminal thinner foot traffic here faster going lincoln and ester slowing the flow massing under the portico they peel through the holoform p h o e n i x rumbling overhead d i g g s turning the north corner pausing to touch his earpiece now launching south down the colonnade towards the portico jerking a pair of handcuffs from his belt ready for the snatch lincoln and ester gaining pace past the portico now the way opening lincolns eyes flaring a face in the distance ahead the pale man he swings ester around doubling back to find b u r d o n coming up behind the flow of figures no obstacle parting at his thunderous onset his quarry stopped and staring at him almost upon them handcuffs at the ready lincoln freezes caught between the dark giant and the pale man ester cringing to his side the dark giant charging up on them sunlight on metal the sight of the handcuffs triggering him lincoln grabs ester swinging her off the sidewalk lowering her into the lodeway leaping down to join her lode poles pulsing thrumming rivets on their denims rattling from the polarity traffic soaring past on lode stream chest high
darting out into traffic lincoln leads ester by the hand like a child across the lanes dodging weaving through the gaps claxons b l a r i n g deafening
sunflashes blinding a sudden shadow a huge freight truck bearing down no gaps ahead lincoln drags ester to the ground both flattening against the concrete lode bed the shadow engulfing them the trucks hull runners shearing narrowly over their heads the rush of air sweeping off lincolns ballcap rousing a storm of dust lincoln and ester choking crawling onward through the dust hull runners scudding overhead maybe only a foot of clearance buoy cables whipping around like cheesewire onwards crawling across the concrete fighting their way across the lode stream b u r d o n watching from the sidewalk where lincoln and ester first dropped scouring the trench for a sight of them
now he spots them climbing up onto the sidewalk the far side of the street
d i g g s now arrives at his side sweating out of breath
now seeing their quarry take off up the far side of the street he turns to his lumberous p a r t n e t fury mixed with incredulity why
the fuck d i d n t you go after them
b u r d o n just looks at him displaying the metal brace on his fore a r m
diggs out of sheer frustration gives him a pounding shove fuck
the refuge of shadow
the alley is divided by a lodeway and the walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters
lincoln and ester run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk forced into single file
a huge shape looms ahead
a garbage vehicle known as a scow
like a leviathan spreading its tentacles the scows tube arrays dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out
lincoln glances back to find ester has stopped and is cringing away from the tentacled monster
he returns to her his eyes flicking around aware that their real predators are close we have to keep going
he takes esters hand drawing her onward
but ester recoils shaking off his grip
now he looks at her more closely
shes panting shuddering fraught with trauma
her voice is haunted
p l e a s e
please i want to go back
she shrinks into the shadows shaking her head
the hatchling wanting to return to the nest
lincoln meets her eye deeply t h o s e men thats what they want too
ester holds his gaze chest heaving
then looks back towards the alley mouth
her fingers reach for her belly clawing a little
then her eyes lower assimilating reason reasserting its heavy grip
lincoln senses her turmoil
his voice is soft but sturdy we have to keep going ester
ester looks up at him again
the forlorn air seems to have faded
her eyes grimly set
her face a little haggard
she takes lincolns hand and together they head off up the alley
the alley mouth darkens as a vehicle turns off the street
the grey cutter moves through the shadows prowling and shark like
the drone of resistors
the throbbing glow of the drive console a panoply of instrumentation
burdon steers in silence diggs beside him edgy intent combing the shadows for their quarry
s u n n a v a b i t c h
what the fuck d o we do now huh
they could be anywhere
we go back to the office and run em
a s what
john and jane doe
we ask the guy
y e a h lets tell him we couldnt hack it in kindergarten
see how long him and his ten platinum stick around
he fires a barbed look
burdon absorbs this unflinched thinking
i t was blue right
the y were using a blue currency card
lincoln and ester walk up the street
wary of attention they go with the flow of figures eyes peeled for predators
the sights of the city now seem hostile
faces flash past dead eyed in sun g l a s s e s
traffic rushes like steel rapids
storefronts construct a black wall
holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom mocking half noticed a woman in a bathroom adjusting her sexy neglige a crack in the door shows
a man in bed waiting the woman closes the door and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube she arches her eyebrow f
f e m i n i n e impulse gel
because who needs him
a cemetery under a grim overcast sky suddenly a frisbee flies across frame an old woman dressed like a teenager catches it she tosses it to an old man dressed
likewise a text super death sucks
a sting new gaza healthcare your life is our life
lincoln and ester stop at the corner
they look around blindly no coordinates no frame of reference
urban canyons identical gordian a n d chasmic
p a s s i n g figures jostle
then lincoln spots something across the street
it looks like an over sized phone booth
its beacon flashes c
city information network
a flourish of music greets lincoln and ester as they enter
the fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid air
a cartoon rattlesnake benignly rendered welcomes them with a clownish fanged smile h i there
what e v e r you want to know wherever you want to go i got the answers
lets look at the menu
a set of text frames appear residential listings business listings transport listings hotel listings
the terminologies are not unfamiliar
n o w lets make a selection
b e a t venturing transport
o k a y
let me open that directory for you
ill be with you in two shakes
the snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern
then a tomographic map of the city appears
a red dot plants itself under a text flag you are here
then other red dots scatter across the map each flagging with transportation icons
b u r d o n steers calmly scanning the streets
diggs impatiently bashes the keys of a holocom on the drive console
a holoframe hovers snowed with static
then a secretarys face appears sagging older primped and painted young
her name is janeen d i g g s burdon bond agency
j a n e e n where the fuck have you been
b e a u t y therapy
i got a date tonight
o h jesus
listen i want you to punch into the currency stream for me
sweep for blue card transactions
youre kidding me right
you have any idea how long thats going to take
i want serial numbers batched a n d cross referenced
start from union station and work your way out
b e f o r e he can object he taps a key
the holoframe blinks out
a surging sound
a surface of water
a burst of spray
a dolphin leaps from the waves and hangs suspended
text scrolls around get out of state out of mind ride the grey dolphin line
this is the next incarnation of the greyhound
the blue facade crested into waves
we make out lincoln and ester now looking more like transients than tourists dirty worn and exhausted
the faces here seem less threatening the young and the low income
lincoln and ester look around
not unlike the train terminal
people standing in line transacting
lincoln and ester step up to the ticket window
a ticket clerk male immaculately groomed greets them with a polished smile
we l c o m e to grey dolphin bus lines
what is your destination please
lincoln squints at him
then wafts his hand across the counter
the ticket clerk flinches at the impact
then composes himself
a trace of camp as he smiles bashfully at the rugged customer i t s okay
i get that a lot
im sorry now where were we again
i want to get out of state
b e l i e v e me i know how you feel
so where did you want to go exactly
o u t of state
j u s t wherever the wind takes you huh
we l l if it was me out to the west coast
its perfect this time of year
lincoln nods liking the sound of this
the ticket clerk smiles enjoying the acceptance of his suggestion he ventures hopefully t r a v e l l i n g alone are we
he gestures then realizes ester is gone from his side again
he scans the faces
the clerk disappointed taps some keys
t w o adults let me see
im afraid i cant get you seats till the morning
a grill bar
a rank of vending machines
ester moves through the seating area as if drawn
now over the ambient noise we isolate the cry of a baby
ester is following the sound to its source
she finds a mexican woman shushing her infant
the woman looks up and smiles
ester just stands there awe struck
lincoln now comes up to reclaim her
hes about to ask why she wandered off when she turns to him
he sees her eyes are brimming with tears
tears of joy and sorrow
its the first time shes seen a baby
the winged pig flutters over the doors of hog heaven
the milling customers are suddenly parted by diggs bursting out through the doors
he leaps into the grey cutter parked kerbside
i t peels out with a flash of its halogen eyes
b u r d o n steers glancing inquisitively at his partner
diggs taps the holocom urgently galvanized
the holoframe resolves snowed with static
janeens face appears
less primped disgruntled d i g g s burdon bond agency
we got a positive on the serial number
punch in and pull up the transactions
start with the last hour and work back
g r e a t
so i got to park my ass in front of a screen all night
i t s a platinum bond janeen
we get this ill buy you a new ass okay
he grins at burdon
the thrill of the chase glows in his eyes
a blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot
more like a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks
liners slot in and out their nautical trim making them seem like ferries
lincoln and ester sit waiting
lincoln rigid watchful
ester gazing across at the mexican woman who as the infant cradled asleep
ester glances wistfully at lincoln
then she frowns lincoln what is that
on your face
lincoln turns touching his face
he feels stubble there
for the first time
his body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural to him
ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek
lincoln stiffens a little unused to this type of contact
but her touch is gentle and the contact is warming
their eyes slowly meet flickering something passing between them
then esters face contorts slightly
she emits a shallow cough
a r e you alright
ester clears her throat
but another cough follows
m y throat
it feels dry
o k a y
ill get you some water
e m p t y
the grill bar is closed
only the vending machines are active
lincoln considers them
not unlike those he used to know
he finds one that offers water bottles
the sign reads arctic melt
he pulls out his blue card and looks for the slot
then pauses picking up his reflection in the glass
he examines the shadowy growth on his face
then he notices his eyes
they seem to be darkening
the pupils welling open
then he feels it
the sense of danger surging up like a geyser
ester sits waiting anxious now coughing persistently
hearing footfalls she looks round
but the face that greets her is not lincoln
its the pale man the one who chased them
before she can react he forcefully pulls her upright tapping his earpiece p i e c e of cake burdie
j a n e does in the bag
keep an eye out for john boy
ester looks around in panic
faces turn but none of them are lincolns
diggs confronts the spectators flashing a badge bond recovery
he marches his female quarry towards the exit
now she starts to struggle and he jerks her back slapping a cuff onto her wrist play nice little girl
now you want to tell me where your boyfriend is
t h u d lincoln hammers his fist into the pale man as he turns dropping him flat on his ass pulling ester away from him d i g g
s jerks out the rainmaker quick to his feet more insulted than hurt targeting his quarry who suddenly duck down as b o o m diggs fires a woman screams the mexican woman her face peppered with tranquilizer core her baby starts crying ester frozen horrified by the screaming woman the bloody slack grimace the baby bawling lincoln dragging her down b o o m the blast of the thunderbolt burdon positioned behind them narrowly missing his target hitting the partition wall c r a s h the partition wall explodes in a blinding electrical discharge shattering into a sudden tempest of glass shards lincoln and ester spin round to see the pale man retargeting the dark giant reloading exit blocked they lunge towards t h e partition wall kicking through the hole in the glass esters last glimpse of the screaming woman the howling baby lincoln and ester leap out onto the embarcadero running faces blur past liners flash by with glaring halogens d i g g s leaps out after them rainmaker poised the embarcadero g l u t t e d with passengers he cant get a bead on his quarry lincoln and ester vaulting over the scattered luggage the crowd thinning the canopy opening onto the street beyond d i g g s right on their tail people screaming parting as they see his weapon the firing line clearing he levels aim and m e t r o pd
im a bond agent
i said drop the fucking w e a p o n
d i g g s sees his quarry now escaping
with a scowl he complies
he laces his fingers tapping his earpiece in the process n o r t h b o u n d on third
get em burdie and take off the fucking g l o v e s
t h e grey cutter veers round a corner burdon at the wheel his quarry visible ahead he jams the throttle revs rising lincoln and ester sprint up the sidewalk
disorientation the sudden diaspora o f lights and darkness the sharp acoustics t r a f f i c swerving claxons b l a r i n g the cutter hurtling up the street relentlessly its halogen eyes burning growing lincoln and ester racing for the end of the block towards a pedestrian bridge trying to outpace the cutter t h e grey cutter closing burdon punching a button the side window slides open he levels his thunderbolt angling a shot lincoln and ester veer left up onto the pedestrian bridge rising above the traffic claxons b l a r i n g beneath as t h e grey cutter ploughs into the intersection banking into a u t u r n vehicles braking to avoid collision lights claxons lincoln and ester turmoil raging behind them a glimpse of the cutter regaining pursuit lincoln sees an opening ahead lincoln pulls ester into the shadows the sidewalk narrowing they run onward glancing off dumpsters dull booms of metal a flood of halogens the cutter banking sharply into the alley pouring on the speed the quarry trapped in its headlights lincoln and ester nowhere to run the lights growing the rising drone of resistors lincoln sees another opening
lincoln pulls ester into the darkness a narrow access barely lit hard to see a sudden dead end they slam into a barrier a chainlink f e n c e
the links shuddering lincoln looks up and sees its scalable claws into the links starts climbing ester trying to climb rattled by coughing fighting to breathe her limbs shaking her muscles failing then lincoln at the top of the fence jolted by the sudden shock muscles in reflex falling landing the far side of the fence ester still climbing the jolt instantly toppling her back landing the near side of the fence more rattled than hurt b u r d o n running towards them thunderbolt smoking from the shot lincoln on the far side of the fence recovering from the fall ester on the near side of the fence cowering coughing b u r d o n jerks her up by the hair like a rapacious viking he looks through the fence at lincoln sniffing her almost bestial g o ahead
ill look after her
lincoln s eyes flickering darkly jaw clenching the sense of danger urging him to run but ester is in the giants grips ester clawing to break free coughing rasping her
fingers snag on the giants arm brace tugging with all her strength b u r d o n yowling at the sudden pain lashing out flinging ester into the fence dropping the thunderbolt clutching his arm lincoln leaping onto the fence scrambling up the link the dark giant momentarily off guard he vaults over the top t h u d burdon spins round takes the full brunt of lincolns impact overbalancing they crash to the ground lincoln struggles upright winded but forced to face the dark giant who is already on his feet his mighty fist swinging out t h u d lincoln takes a punch to the jaw recoils reciprocates throwing a left hook hitting hard but the giant barely flinches
thud thud burdon pounds into him a storm of punches his quarry ducking and blocking now backed up against the fence ester retrieving the thunderbolt trying to work the mechanism
coughing hands shaking accidentally touching the trigger b o o m the shot blasts into the air enough of a distraction for lincoln he lands the giant with a bone jarring left hook b u r d o n keels over into the wall cracking the back of his head his knees buckling sliding down just catching sight of lincoln and ester scrambling up over the fence and then the quarry is lost from sight in a downpour of electrical sparks
s i r e n s wailing in the distance
lincoln and ester race down the sidewalk along a construction hoarding
ester slows doubling over rasping
lincoln looks at her her l i p s blue her face pale
the sirens getting louder
he sees a gap in the hoarding lincoln and ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract
a once public park now a construction site
mounds and craters of earth
dim shapes of huge vehicles like sleeping dragons
patches of parkland as yet untouched
bowed palms dead grass a stagnant lagoon a dull mirror for the ascendant moon
on its shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse
the refuge of shadow
the collapsed roof allowing streams and puddles of moonlight
lincoln helps ester onto a rotted bench
she slumps down exhausted lincoln watches her helplessly
shes fighting for breath wheezing and coughing in deep rasps
i cant breathe
i l l find you some water
he looks around blindly
some junk in the corner
he rummages finds a rusted metal box
pries it open empties the contents
gauzes band aids evidently a first aid box then a bottle
he opens it sniffs
it smells pungent
alcohol not water
ester suddenly starts sobbing
lincoln returns to her side i t s going to be okay ester
no it isnt
i l l find you some water okay
ester looks up at him wheezing tears streaming from her eyes an d then what lincoln
i l l find another way
out of state
an d then what
what if they find us
the n well keep going
i cant run anymore
ester folds over sobbing and coughing at the same time
pitiful to watch
lincoln crouches gaining her eyeline very deliberate we l l keep going till we get there
ester traps a sob reading his eyes something reviving in her the island
you mean the island
lincoln answers with a brief smile
if this will keep her going then the truth is redundant
he eases her out of the moment n o w im going to get some water
but i want you to stay here
itll be safer
ester wipes away her tears sniffing
her breaths calming
dont go yet
stay with me lincoln
stay with me for a little while
lincoln looks puzzled by esters request
even more puzzled as she rests her head on his shoulder nestling into his neck
he feels her against him
the warmth spreading through him again
his arm reaching as if of its own accord closing around her
i t feels right somehow
and there he stays holding her looking out across the dereliction
and the moon rises over encanto p a r k
the holoform l o g o of the metro pd glows over the threshold
diggs exits with a dark glower
the cutter is waiting kerbside
diggs climbs in an burdon steers out into traffic
the thrill o f the chase is gone from them now
both seem equally grim and determined
diggs taps the holocom
a holoframe resolves snows with static
then janeens face appears dishevelled bitter what the fuck do you want now
very calm very cold punch into the currency stream close the net on downtown and keep the search active
the next time they use the card i want to be right on top of them
o f f his icy tone janeen nods without retort
diggs hits a key and her face blinks out
and the cutter prowls into the night
the winged pig flutters over the doors of hog heaven
another franchise on a more downtrodden street
lincoln emerges with a bag of food and drink
he considers the blue card
the reservoir now close to the bottom his resources almost exhausted
with a look of foreboding he pockets the card and turns the corner
an d suddenly stops in his tracks
but its not a vehicle that he sees
or a predator
his eyes are fixed on a holoframe billboard a football player in montage pummeling into a defensive line running for a touchdown gyrating in the endzone spinning in an nfl
podium shot super nobody stops the juggernaut
a team logo super come see the phoenix admirals
rulers of the afc
lincoln recognizes the players face but its not possible
he waits for the loop to restart
there it is again
the face of starkweather two delta
incredulous he stops a pedestrian the man the man up there
who is he
what planet you been living on
thats the juggernaut brother
jamil the juggernaut starkweather highest rushing total in the league
least till that injury blew out his gut
now the doctors are saying hell be back on his feet next season
those fuckers sure can work miracles huh
lincoln doesnt respond
the pedestrian shrugs and heads on writing him off
lincoln lingers staring up at the billboard
the flourish of music greets lincoln as he enters
the cartoon rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish fanged smile hi there
what e v e r you want to know wherever you want to go i got the answers
lets look at the menu
the set of text frames appears residential listings business listings transport listings hotel listings
n o w lets make a selection
a heavy pause
lincolns voice comes with a slight tremor
please give me the name
let me find that listing for you
ill be with you in two shakes
the snake rattles and coils
then a headshot a p p e a r s with the face of jamil starkweather scaled across with a red line
this listing is blocked from the directory
lincoln stands darkly intent on the face
now irrefutably the same face he saw in his life below
the snake shakes its rattle
you want me to find another listing
lincoln looks at the snake flicking its tongue coiling
a downtrodden neighborhood
the buildings look like remnants from our own era
a scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront
he slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up squealing
we widen to a vehicle parked kerbside
a familiar grey cutter
l i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop
the array of firearms a s fathomless as their purpose
the scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches inside
diggs and burdon enter on his heels
he yawns at them we aint open for another hour
y e a h well we aint in the market
e v e r y o n e s in the market pal
one end of the barrel or the other
we r e chasing up a currency record from last night
these two ring a bell
d i g g s displays two digital slides
the owner pauses suspicious
what are you
d i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker
the twin barrels aimed at his head the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little h i m i remember
came in just before closing
wanted a shooter but didnt have no id
settled for one of these
he displays a hunting knife unsheathing it showing the blade
did he give you a name
did he say where he was going
d i g g s cocks the hammer
the owner flinches
then off the knife the r e was one thing
kinda w e i r d
he wanted to know how to use it
an apartment building towers overhead vaguely ominous
lincoln approaches the entrance with ester
we now see he has a band aid covering his crosshatch
he takes ester briefly aside teasing some tresses over hers
as she gently smooths down her hair ester catches his eye
a look flickers between them
then fancy dress was it sir
a doorman is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club he wouldnt be seen dead in
off their flustered looks he gives an apologetic smile
then opens the door and holds it for them
lincoln reaches for esters hand
then stiffly leads her inside
the doors are set with small glowing orbs at peephole level
like eyeballs watching as lincoln and ester proceed up the corridor
they stop at a door
lincoln checks the number
then looks for some type of doorbell
as his eyes cross the orb it seems to blink
then comes a sound of disengaging locks
then the door swings open
lincoln flinches taken by surprise
then frowns as he sees there is no one on the other side of the door
lincoln enters wary scanning around
a living room
a sofa chairs
a coffee table empty bottles cigarette packs a full ashtray
a bureau some paperwork
no sign of life no sense of danger
lincoln moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the papers
ester ventures in through the door curious what are you looking for
i dont know
just wait there and make sure nobodys coming
as he leafs the papers ester waits dutifully by the door
her eyes wander across the framed pictures
then narrow onto a d p h o t o g r a p h
a college boxing team photo grinning cup winners
l o o k at this
lincoln returns to her
ester points to the photo
a face in the row blurred but eerily familiar
lincoln seems not to react
ester curiosity piqued scans the other pictures
she alights on a framed certificate thomas r
lincoln attorney at law
what the hell are you doing
lincoln turns to confront a man in a robe
disheveled from sleep grey from a hangover
the mans face is unmistakably his own
this is tom lincoln sponsor of lincoln six echo his bleary eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate oh jesus
lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned by the sight of his double in the flesh
sponsor and agnate stand frozen
the only movement is ester her eyes flicking between the same men fraught confused
lincoln breaks the silence who are you
lincoln steps closer eyes piercing
tom takes a step back
the y said
id never have to see you
lincoln takes another step closer
tom takes another step back
lincoln takes another step closer
tom stiffens gathers himself look if you dont get out of here right now im calling security
lincoln examines him assimilating
his double seems to be as belligerent as he is
reasoning now threat response kicking in
lincoln draws the hunting knife
unused to it he points it like a gun
but its enough of a threat for tom who swallows dryly why are you here
what do you want
i want to know
tom grimaces at the ambiguity
his f a c e
if not for the pounding headache this would be a bad dream
he lowers onto the sofa
finds a cigarette and lights up
a drag mind kicking in
the knife cautioning him
with a slow exhale he confesses one of the partners at my firm
he told me about it
gave me a referral
i thought he was joking at first
i went out there took the sales tour
even before that i knew it wasnt a joke
there was this discretion agree ment
i never saw anything like it and ive seen a lot
breathe a word and theyve got you by the balls
i dont know
theres cancer in my family
maybe it was just to keep up
all the partners were on the policy
he looks at his agnate
then realizes the level of ignorance
christ you have no idea do you
tom drags his cigarette fingers trembling
he shakes his head i cant fucking do this
what are you talking about
lincoln moves closer pointing the knife
tom flinches then insurance
youre an insurance policy
what is that
what does that mean
if i get sick
if part of me gets sick
i take a healthy part from you
how do you expect me to answer that
its just how it works thats all
tom looks at his agnate
the insistent stare
the knife pointing at him like a finger
his fear yields to a flicker of anger what do you want
a fucking apology
why do i look like you
because you are me
i dont understand
because they made you from my cells
a flare of anger thats right
you were made
cooked up in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled egg
every thought running through your head every word coming out of your mouth all of it manufactured made
lincoln frowns trying to assimilate
too much to process
youre the one who made me
who made me
i signed a contract
i can show you
he gestures to a mirror on the wall
lincoln steps back but his eyes are unremitting
tom rises cautious crossing to the wall
he opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe
his trembling fingers tap the keypad and the safe hisses open
he draws out a contract folder embossed with a crosshatch
then offers it to his agnate its all right there
lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages reading
a pendulous silence falls
tom stands watching smoking nervously
ester stands by the door trying to take all this in
look youve got what you wanted
now why dont you just get out of here
pause looks at him there are men out there looking for us
i want you to make them stop
lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again
look im a lawyer i know how it works
the contract everything its all laced with confidentiality clauses
it means they dont want this to get out
it means whatever i do theyre not going to stop
lincoln pauses assimilating
his doubles expression indicates that hes telling the truth
maybe try a more practical request do you have transport
yes parked downstairs
and then youll call security
lincoln steps closer pointing the knife
tom tries to stay dead pan
the lawyer kicking in
look them in the eye when you lie im not going to call security
im not going to call anybody okay
lincoln looks at his double reason now yielding to anger
tom looks at his agnate fear welling deadpan cracking look maybe theres something
maybe theres a way to cancel the contract
lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his doubles cheek
for christs sake
its not my fault
lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face drawing blood
the anger urging hungry for more blood
then suddenly lincoln
lincoln looks at her the anger interrupted the knife still in place
then returns to his double
the dreading eyes the trickle of blood down the face
his e y e s
his f a c e
a long foreboding moment
then suddenly lincoln lashes out
his fist sends his double flying falling in a flurry of contract pages
lincoln stands over him looking down like a dominant species
his double is unmoving unconscious
lincoln abruptly spins away
the light panel flashes
lincoln stands grimly head lowered trying to fathom the anger roiling within
ester stares at him wanly
both held in the dark tableau
and the elevator descends
the vehicle parked in bay is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed b o a t a two seater known as a skiff
lincoln and ester climb in
lincoln reviews the drive console the controls all of it meaningless
his eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel
the orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up
lincoln reviews it
a screen in front of him is flashing piloting manual auto
the interface processes then asks destination name address
o u t of state
the interface processes then reports undocking
lincoln and ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward
lode poles pulsing ahead of them the skiff moves out as if pulled by a phantom tugboat
the skiff buckets off the ramp into a street inlet
then stops rocking a little
the interface reports establishing uplink
on another screen a road map appears
a red dot plants at their point of origin then bleeds into a red line plotting a course
the autopilot scans for traffic then nudges forward on the throttle
the resistors drone the steering wheel turns and the skiff noses onto the street
finding its lane it drops to cruise speed
lincoln studies the interplay of steering wheel throttle and brake
then glances at ester
shes plunged in thought staring off
she turns to him with a haggard frown the man back there
who looked like you
does it mean i have someone too
lincoln looks at her blankly unknowing
ester stares off again her brow knotting with unanswered questions
but lincolns gaze lingers
her pale skin her limpid eyes her hair fluttering in the breeze
its the first time hes really seen esters beauty
the domes and spires glint in the sunlight
we isolate a glass steeple
a crosshatch insignia
a legend sanger industries
a corner office with a panoramic view of the city
crowne sits at a console desk reviewing some data on a holoframe screen
a knock on the door and her secretary enters looking unsettled i just thought i should warn you
i have a sponsor holding
his names thomas lincoln
the skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass
the interface flashes uplink interrupt
lincoln sits up confused
the skiff is now slowing drifting as if cut loose
he studies the controls again
positions one hand on the steering wheel the other on the throttle
then he nudges it
the skiff lurches veering out of its lane
another vehicle zips narrowly past rocking them with its invisible backwash
ester looks at lincoln suddenly alarmed
lincoln tries again firm on the wheel gentle on the throttle
and the skiff eases forward
d i s m a l
the kind of place that precedes a life on the street
we push in on a window cracked glass the drapes closed within
g l o o m y musty
a holovision plays some type of nfl recap
but scheer is not watching it
he is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling motionless
off a beeping sound he stirs
he taps a holocom on the nightstand
a holoframe appears resolving merrick on holocom k a r l theres been a complication
the sunset melts gold across the horizon as the skiff cruises westward
eight lanes of lodeway rake through the salt flats
lincoln is driving more confidently now
ester is huddled asleep beside him
suddenly the skiff starts to slow again
lincoln reviews the controls
throttle forward foot off the brake
the interface flashes remote lockdown e n g a g i n g
the skiff is steering itself onto the hard shoulder
it now pulls to a dead halt
ester is woken by the sudden inertia
she opens her eyes and looks around
theyve stopped in the middle of nowhere
the sun sinks in a slow pink haze
lincoln and ester walk across the salt flats
visible in the distance is a walled settlement
an adobe wall culminates at an arched wooden gateway
lincoln and ester approach
they havent walked far but ester is already short of breath
as they near the gateway a holoserve appears like a sentry native american buckskins feathered headdress and facepaint
his voice seems as old as the wind
welcome to salt river heritage park home to the hohokam nation for over two thousand years
the park is now closed
please come back during opening hours am t o pm monday through saturday
ester steps closer
with the sun hazing through the holoserve s e e m s angelic or ghostly
shes examining his striped facepaint he has marks on his face like us
she turns to lincoln with a flowering smile
then rushes up to the gateway suddenly galvanized squeezing through a gap
a ring of native american pueblos
pithouses a n d coursed adobes recreations and preserved ruins
ester rushes around the ring looking into the pueblos as if expecting to find them inhabited
she ducks into one of the pithouses
lincoln follows her inside
the mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs cholla branches
its cosy in here dim
the living area recreated with mats and pottery
lincoln finds ester looking around between excitement and confusion
she turns to him her voice wavering wheezing is this
is this place the island
lincoln answers with a softly negating look
esters face slowly falls the energy draining from her eyes
she lowers onto one of the mats and lies down huddling
she looks up to him wheezing im tired
let me rest for a while
silence prevails but for the faint rattle of esters breathing
lincoln sits on low stool in sentinel over her as she sleeps
in his eyes we see the weight of foreboding
he doesnt know what theyll do when she wakes
of a moaning sound he looks at ester
then realizes it isnt coming from her
the sound is far off a rhythmic moaning
now discernible as the chant of voices
a blazing fire
figures in silhouette moving around chanting
the platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park
an ancient ceremonial site stepped in ruins dusted with caliche
pima and maricopa descendants of the hohokam are congregated for a solstice ceremony
off to the side a group of horses are tethered shuffling snorting
lincoln approaches cautiously but somehow like a moth to the flame
he stops at a distance watching
the curiosity of congruent sound and movement
you look a little lost my friend
lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night
a tall man swarthy skin mist colored eyes
his tribal name is grey dove grey dove contd or did you come here for a reason
lincoln examines the tall man
the face seems as deep and gentle as the voice
his sense of danger unstirring he concedes i was looking for water
not the best place to look
it stopped working
and where were you going
out of state
lincoln sighs the destination seeming very far away
grey dove considers him
this bruised weary outsider is somehow childlike
the fire blazes across the face of a shaman
old gnarled and dry as the salt flats
with a sacred mutter he slips a peyote button onto his tongue
then flings back his head casting his eyes to the stars
when he lowers his head again we see his pupils dilating
he rises chanting moving in ceremonial steps around the fire
tribespeople s i t in a ring joining the chant
beyond the ring others are dining at a roasting pit
the food is as it might been two thousand years ago
only the sight of plastic water gallons breaks the illusion
lincoln stands apart with grey dove eating ravenously gulping from a water gallon
he looks around
what is this place
it is a sacred place
my people come here to commune with their spirits
lincoln looks at him puzzled
grey dove smiles tolerantly
not easy to understand perhaps
for us the spirit is like the shadow on the rock
sometimes close sometimes far away sometimes the sky clouds and the shadow fades
we come here to ask our spirits to return to us
gestures to the shaman he speaks to the grandfather from whom all spirits are born
the great spirit who binds every living thing
he has no name
but he is everywhere
in the sun and the moon the wind and the rain
the shamans chanting grows louder more insistent
his circuit around the fire becoming faster building in religious fervor
now he asks for the gift of vision that he may see through to the spirit shape of things
to find the spirits of the lost
to bring them into the light
the shamans chanting suddenly stops
he is looking directly at lincoln pointing
his face contorting with what might be anger or fear
he starts babbling in dialect ardently
lincoln frowns in confusion
grey dove quietly draws him away from the mound
ester stirs from slumber
on the ground beside her she finds a bowl of food and a water gallon
now through the gloom she sees lincoln sitting on the stool like he never left keeping vigil
something seems different about him as he turns registering her a r e you alright
i feel better after i sleep
lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway
ester moves closer sensing something
he speaks as if from far away
the man out there
he said everything has a spirit
every living thing
his voice cuts off
ester looks at him recognizing his pain
she doesnt understand what it is or what caused it
its pain and it evokes a response in her
a feeling taking her over
her hand reaches out and strokes his hair
lincoln looks up at her questioning
with supreme knowing ester leans down and kisses him
at the touch of her lips lincoln pauses
the first kiss for both of them but ester takes it in her stride
the calm ballet of nature
fluidly peeling off her shirt breasts steeping with moonlight
lincoln rising to face her feeling her proximity her radiant heat
his fingers touching her breasts
ester trembling her lips once more finding his
lincoln closing his eyes the rush of sensation overwhelming
he yields to it returning the kiss with hunger with passion
the sun rises in the east depicting the traffic in silhouette
a vehicle arcs from the fast lane onto the hard shoulder where the skiff sits abandoned
the grey cutter pulls to a halt
d i g g s and burdon move up on the skiff cover positions weapons levelled
burdon spins in to the driver side snapping aim with the thunderbolt
but the skiff is empty
the only sign of life is the interface flashing red remote locator transmitting
b u r d o n exchanges a look with diggs
diggs reaches in his pocket and pulls out what looks like an electronic telescope
he puts it to his eye and pans the salt flats
burdon crouches at the roadside looking for tracks
then diggs fixes on something i got thermals
the fire is now reduced to a heap of embers
the tribespeople a r e asleep around the mound wrapped in ethnic blankets
diggs and burdon move up stealthily weapons at the ready
the horses bristle and snort betraying their approach
the tribespeople stirred by the noise awake
diggs and burdon swing aim around the ring as faces rise and stare at them
none of the faces have white skin
diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering im looking for two bond runners
they ditched near here last night
diggs contd one man one woman
tattoos on the forehead
nothing just silent stares anyones seen them i got fifty green
still nothing aggravated what the fuck are you
deaf and dumb
the tribal faces just keep staring
then suddenly swings aim with the rainmaker and fires
boom hitting one of the horses in the haunch
it rears up whinnying setting off the rest of the horses
diggs turns back to the gathering somebody start talking
he scans around the ring
then fixes on one of the women
she lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby
grey dove stiffens
the sunrise depicts two silhouettes moving across the ridge
lincoln and ester clamber over the calcified rocks
ester now stops to catch her breath
she is wheezing again fighting for air
as lincoln looks on with concern she musters a brave smile i can make it
a freight barge whooshes through the canyon trailing a chain of low arched containers capacious in width rather than height
the conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider deeper known as a lode canal
at each end of the canyon it intersects with other lode canals converging to use the same passage a system of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic
high above on the south rim of the canyon we find lincoln and ester
ester is no longer wheezing but rasping
she looks down at the passing vessel daunted
lincoln offers her small comfort dont worry
the one we want goes the other way
he said it goes slower
they exchange a smile
the chain of containers tailing off the barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon
lincoln and ester descend the rocky slope toward the lode canal
ester stops having to catch her breath every few steps
lincoln tries to hide his concern looking away towards the sunrise
the westbound vessel will be coming soon
they just need to get out of state
now he frowns sensing something
faint but growing
his jaw clenches
his face tightens
his pupils start to dilate
the north ridge is evidently threaded by a lodeway as we see the grey cutter pulling up
diggs and burdon get out and look down into the canyon
diggs pulls out his scope and starts panning
burdon peels off his jacket
its early but its already getting hot
diggs now pauses handing him the scope for his opinion up there in the rocks
im not sure
it could be ambient
lincoln and ester hide in the shadow of a rock
ester is muffling her breaths as best she can
lincoln now hazards a look over the top
two figures are climbing down the far side of the canyon now pointing in their direction
he ducks back assimilating
hiding no longer an option
nor running at least for ester
his face sets in a grimace of conviction
his eyes glow darkly
diggs and burdon reach the foot of the rocks
neither speaks communicating in hand signals
diggs slips into the lode canal
burdon covers sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face
diggs emerges from the far side of the lode canal
he stays low moving up into the rocks
then from above a rock dislodges rattling down
diggs reacts instantly targeting opening fire b o o m b o o m the shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock
the thunderbolt now adding to the barrage burdon firing from the far side shots bolts kicking up a storm of dust suddenly holding fire waiting for the dust to clear
no sign of movement
just a slide of rubble
d i g g s steals onwards up the rocks into the fog of dust the sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes then suddenly lincoln bursts out of
the dust from the left tackling the pale man both of them toppling tumbling down the slope thudding to a halt at the lip of the lode canal the rainmaker lost in the fall the impact throwing up a billow of dust the dustcloud diggs and lincoln struggling clawing punching lincoln with surprise on his side gaining with the upper hand
diggs clawing fingers discover lincolns knife tugging it from his jacket lincoln grabbing his wrist fighting for control the knife moving between them diggs with better leverage the blade inching
towards lincolns face pressing into his cheek lincolns eyes welling black almost inhuman the sense of danger screaming in his ears he grabs the pale mans throat diggs eyes bulging as he strains to push the knife home oxygen draining conscious ebbing he slumps back lincoln regains the knife the pale man seems to be out cold but hes not sure he pauses holding the blade over him then burdon snaps aim for another shot beading his target moving now dropping out of the firing line into the lode canal burdon inches toward the edge thunderbolt angling downward into the trench then suddenly hes grabbed by the ankles lincoln straining to overbalance the giant feet up against the wall like trying to topple a tree finally winning some give burdon topples into the trench his ankles clamped by his quarry both men meeting the concrete with a bone shaking thud lincoln is crushed beneath the massive weight the giant already recovering from the fall now dragging him upright thud burdon throws a punch mightily hurling his quarry across the trench moving in quickly following up with a kick thud lincoln crumples as the boot smacks into him then another kick then another the world starts blurring burdon turns away his quarry disabled for now he recovers his thunderbolt turns back to administer the coup de grace lincoln looks up the giant looming the muzzle of his weapon thrumming with energy the rivets on his denims start rattling burdon spins round the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his grasp there in the distance an eastbound barge is coming lincoln scrambles up the wall of the trench muscles straining feet slipping on the concrete escaping the imminent vessel
diggs coming to now seeing his quarry a short distance away emerging from the lode canal he looks around for a weapon then diggs
get me outta here
burdon struggling to climb out of the trench with one arm its almost impossible fighting against his own weight diggs reaching the edge seeing the eastbound barge coming grabbing his
partners outreached hand pulling him upward burdons panic his other arm flinging away his metal brace snared by the lode stream the force shuddering his entire body diggs pulling with all his might feet slipping locked in a tug of war with the lodestream the barge is closing fast burdons horror now suspended between the two forces feet kicking the barge is almost upon him he screams agonized help me
the scream is instantly lost in the whoosh of the barge
diggs stunned just looks at his hands empty spattered with blood
the shadow of the rock lincoln rejoins ester casting a look back the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance d i g g s stooping at the edge of
the trench looking down all that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete lincoln and ester reaching the foot of the rocks seeing the westbound barge against the sunrise snaking into the passage diggs pulling upright spotting his quarry fire in his eyes drawing out a boot knife slipping it between his teeth the westbound barge pulling through the canyon lode poles pulsing ahead of it polarity thrumming in opposing flow lincoln and ester start running as the barge comes towards them lincoln pulling ester along struggling to match the pace a sound like a beating tympany coming towards them they look round to see a shadow running along the top of the barge d i g g s flinging himself off the barge the blade in his teeth arms spread for an instant like a vulture against the sun
lincoln is suddenly crushed by the weight of his landing ester is hurled sideways into a ditch lost in a cloud of dust d i g g s pulling himself
up astride of lincoln snatching the knife from his clenched teeth the sound like a whetstone lincoln spitting dirt suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged sideways twisted partways o n t o his back forced to look up at a black spot against the sun diggs face set in a murderous sneer he wants to see this fuckers e y e s the torment lincoln dazzled by the sunlight but suddenly knowing the face of death now catching the brief glint of the knife as d i g g s plunges the blade down slicing into his quarrys hand as he throws it up in defense his quarry yowling with pain lincoln feeling the stab his deepest instinct suddenly awoken every impulse every fiber brought into alignment survival d i g g s is hurled into the air as lincoln surges upward he tumbles backward into the dust losing hold of the boot knife lincoln pushes himself upright only makes it half way scrambling towards the pale man all fours like an animal d i g g s clawing around in the dust fingers finding metal the boot knife he brings it up slashing at his imminent quarry lincoln recoiling the blade nicking his face sudden rage grabbing the pale man by the arm swinging him round into b o o m the moving wall of freight containers as the westbound barge passes diggs bounces off stumbling to keep balance lincoln on the retreat the pale man coming at him with the knife another nick seeing a gap now shoving him backwards b o o m the moving wall resounds diggs howls snagged by a bolt hurt his fury becomes incandescent he strikes madly lincoln stumbling back the pale man coming at him the blade flashing to and fro frenzied like a threshing machine f o r c i n g him up against the rocks the knife almost upon him he grits his teeth and lunges forward charging like a bull diggs careens backward still swiping the blade digging into his quarry headlong towards the moving wall hitting with w h u m p no resonant boom no bouncing back diggs has hit a gap between the containers and his head has been lopped off
lincoln stands horrified as the headless body is spun by the moving wall dropping into the trench as the barge tails off the westbound barge gains speed leaving the canyon
but there is ester running after it vainly coughing and sputtering
its no use
we have to
its going too fast
we have to
ester staggers a few more steps then collapses to her knees rasping for breath
as lincoln reaches her she slumps back into his arms
her head lolling eyes rolled back to white a drool of blood spilling from her lips
then the blast of a claxon c u t s the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance
a ranch home in the middle of nowhere
late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust
abstract wood sculptures are visible
juniper wood carved along the bias of the grain polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth
an older woman runs a sander over a work in progress s in coveralls gray her tied back her face shielded by goggles and a bandana
she pauses to review her work shutting down the sander slipping off her goggles and bandana
her face is eerily familiar
her name is katherine
she now moves to the window catching sight of something outside
curiously she watches a vehicle coming down the long driveway
a dusty grey cutter
katherine opens the front door
the cutter is now docked in the port and a stranger is staggering towards her
in his arms is an unconscious woman
now katherine can see the face younger but unmistakable even so
her voice comes in a chilled whisper o h god
oh my god
a whisper cuts across the glistening skyline towards the sanger industries tower
it circles in to land on a rooftop helipad
crowne sits at her desk
merrick sits across from her
the air stirs as the secretary ushers dr
sanger into the office
no greetings are exchanged
sanger just lowers into a chair a little unsettled to find merrick has preceded him
i take it youve heard the news
the bond agents
pauses lights a cigarette were way past unfortunate henry
i thought wed covered ourselves
the police wont connect the bond agents to us
but thats not the problem
its the sponsor
what are you talking about
the male agnate tracked him down
his names thomas lincoln
it seems they had a genetic reunion
not a h a p p y one
it was all i could do to stop him going to the authorities
i still dont see the problem
he may not want a police involvement but hes already threatened to file suit
and hes one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city
thats why we have you ellen
thats why i asked bernard to come out here
to find out how it happened
i told her henry
s a n g e r casts a betrayed look at merrick
then returns to crowne i t was a marginal problem
and it was under control according to bernard
thats not the point
whether or not its a factor in this instance it puts us in breach of the clone laws
i t doesnt even touch their genetics
im talking about self awareness
the virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the l e v e l of functionality
but not beyond
this gives sanger pause
crowne drags her cigarette acutely
l e g a l l y we are naked on every level
federal legislature state licensing sponsorship contract
but even if we did manage to weather the legal storm wed never survive the public scrutiny
s a n g e r absorbs this calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle
ive spent my entire career facing down naysayers ellen
dont think for a second im afraid of facing them now
you remember cryogenics
at the outset people dismissed it as a rich mans folly
eccentric millionaires freezing their brains hoping to wake up in a new body
crowne contd e v e n when cloning showed signs of m a k i n g it feasible it wasnt moral a f f r o n t that
caused the backlash
it w a s the scope
the scope henry
when t h e size of the customer base was e x p o s e d it screamed inequality one m e d i c i n e for
the rich and one for the p o o r
the pressure for accessible cryo genics a s good as buried the industry
a pause for emphasis o u r graves are being dug as we speak g e n t l e m e n
every passing second they g e t deeper
if were going to survive w e have to act swiftly and decisively
a l r i g h t
what do you suggest
s a n g e r dry swallows the pill
ellen opens a contract folder
o u r security chief ive been looking at his file
ex marine served in south china do we think he still has it in him
r e a l i z i n g suddenly harsh a r e you insane
the i r eyes deadlock
crowne gives merrick a sideways glance
you ever wondered why henry takes those pills bernard
why he doesnt avail himself of his own technology
an agnate could give me a new heart but to get it to function mentally
b u l l s h i t henry
you dont want to deal with reality
only with concept
i may not have been there at the start but i heard the stories
you wanted in on every aspect of construction from environmental design right down to the classical playlists
i t wasnt enough just to make it work was it
no you wanted your own little utopia
crowne contd swanning a r o u n d in your mountain r e t r e a t like some self appointed d e i t y
but when it comes to getting y o u r hands dirty
a r e you quite finished
e v e n god has blood on his hands henry
are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it
s a n g e r crosses to the window looking down onto the city
you see that street down there
running east from the stadium
my father used to take me to church on that street
an old spanish church
whats your point
i didnt know theyd torn it down
a floral bedroom
ester lies in bed wheezing semi conscious
katherine slips a pill between her lips and tips in some water
lincoln stands watching
katherine ushers him out of the room
the kitchen is arrayed with modern technology but softened with paintings and craftwork
a r t marginally overwhelming science
katherine starts making some herb tea in the traditional manner
what did you give her
j u s t something to help her sleep
i think she has a bronchial infection
but im not sure i should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby
s o you know about the baby
katherine pauses reality sinking its claws
she looks at him
is n t that why you came here
i found your name in the listings
i wasnt sure
you dont look like her
the y have a plan
for women like me
s o youre the one who takes her baby
katherine winces at him
its uttered so matter of factly
she pauses hanging her head searching within herself
you know when youre young
how you run around thinking youre immortal
lincoln s look says he has no idea
she seems not to notice
the r e was a lodeway accident
after that i thought no man would ever want me
i was wrong
his name was john
he said he married me for my eyes
ocean eyes he called them
he always loved the ocean
up there on the wall thats johns boat
o f f her gesture lincoln glances at the wall
a watercolor of a yacht
meaningless to him but katherine gazes it at fondly but i think there was always an unspoken regret between us
when we heard about the technology it was like
forgive n e s s like a second chance
a child of our own part of both of us
sailing trips fishing trips so many plans
a flat beat j o h n got cancer a year ago
he r eyes mist distant and bittersweet talking to herself now
i r o n i c
that the same technology could have saved his life
and now the baby is the only part of him i have left
and the boat
i still have the boat
lincoln looks discomfited
theres more to this than he thought
s c h e e r opens the door
merrick stands at the threshold with an attache case
scheer seemingly unsurprised brings him inside
i told you we shouldnt have gone to outside personnel
they were cowboys
we had no choice karl
we had to keep this away from the institute
an d now
merrick lowers in a chair grim and leaden
he opens his attache and pulls out a contract folder
he hands it to scheer
your resignation papers
maybe early retirement would be more accurate
s c h e e r leans forward frowning curious
t e n platinum bounty if you sign the papers their loss becomes your gain
so theres a jump
you understand that whatever happens the institute must be able to deny it
s c h e e r says nothing
merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out a case
inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe gun
we use a chemical to dispose of waste product
its called di halcyonate
i t reacts on a molecular level to start a process of internal combustion
the subject is incinerated from the inside out
in post mortem application its done its job before rigor mortis
in a live subject well
you can imagine
you want to dispose of your products
i t s a little more complicated than that
we have to be very
if you still have it in you that is
s c h e e r gives him a sideways look
then displays the usmc ring
why do you think i still wear this
i dont know
i was discharged from the marines for insubordination
if you asked anyone i n my unit theyd call it heroism
i disobeyed an order to fall back
i took out a bunker complex single handed
s o you wear it is a badge of honor
it wasnt bravery
i wasnt afraid of dying
i just didnt care
you see i suddenly realized i was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat
life death i just couldnt see the point anymore
merrick allows a respectful pause then youll find a vehicle parked outside
its unregistered difficult to trace
i take it we have an agreement
a slant of light falls across ester writhing in her sleep rasping
katherine and lincoln peer in through the doorway checking on her
then katherine quietly closes the door
lincoln paces around feeling useless
katherine considers him what do i call you
my names lincoln
lincoln i think she needs professional help
i think she needs to see a doctor
theyll find her
theyll take her
n o t if i dont want them to
you dont understand
they dont want people to know about her
either of us
the doctor im thinking of hes an old friend
he look after john in t h e final stages
i trust him
so you can take her baby
no thats not what i want
o f f lincolns blunt look she sighs lowering into a chair
m a y b e i didnt realize shed be so
c u t s off a deep pause m a y b e i just didnt want to
either way i was wrong
i want you to know that
i was wrong
and im sorry
a heavy lull
lincoln hangs his head remembering
the y make you believe theres a place called the island
then they take you upstairs and put you to sleep
they cut you open
they take pieces of you
katherine looks at him intuiting
she allows a pause then e v e n if i had taken her baby i swear to you id never have
they give you a choice you see to extend the sponsorship after
after d e l i v e r y
i saw a lot of us go to the island
but i never saw anyone come back
even if i had extended the sponsorship theyd have
and kept taking the money
but thats inhuman
b e a t a lost look is it
i wouldnt know
a sleek low vehicle known as a straker pulls down the ramp
the orbs on the doors eyeball scheer moving up the corridor
he stops at a doorway
rings the bell
tom lincoln opens the door yes
im from the sanger institute
ive given you people enough of my time already
i t s just a formality
i need to see your sponsorship contract
t o m pauses then lets scheer inside
he crosses to the wall safe taps the keys
then pulls out the contract folder
he offers it
is this the only copy
why would i make copies
do you think i want anyone else to know about this
s c h e e r accepts the folder
as tom turns to close the safe he sets it down
and grabs tom from behind by the scalp pressing the syringe gun into his jugular
tom clutches his throat like its on fire
with a boiling gurgle he staggers forward
convulsing belching steam
then falling slack
his skin starts to smolder
scheer pauses then tosses t h e contract folder on top of him leaving it to burn with him
e s t a b l i s h i n g
a clean facade of white steel and glass
a hatch b a c k vehicle known as a corsair pulls down the parking ramp
the corsair pulls up at the er entrance lincoln at the wheel
katherine gets out of the passenger side
a doctor is waiting s caring face
his name is dr
he looks curiously at the man at the wheel
then greets katherine with a hug katherine
its good to see you
i havent seen you since johns funeral
we l l ive been keeping busy
thanks for coming down to meet me
your call was a little cryptic
what is it exactly thats wrong with you
i t s not me
she opens the rear door of the corsair
ester is lying on the back seat
abrams frowns as he notices the resemblance
the straker p u l l s up into the port
the shadow of scheer moving outside the windows looking for a point of entry
he inspects the studio door for alarms
then elbows the glass
reaching inside turning the lock
he enters the studio glancing at the sculptures
moving through the home
s i l e n t l y systematically checking the rooms
he reaches the guest bedroom looks around
something catches his eye
spots of blood of the linens
eyes honing he moves on into the kitchen
he discovers a holocom keypad on the counter
taps some keys
the holoframe flashes redialling
the holoframe snows with static
then a receptionists face appears n e w gaza hospital how may i help you
lincoln stands waiting
there are chairs but hes too tense to sit
katherine and dr
abrams now enter
lincoln looks at them expectantly
theres a pause
abrams speaks your friend
she has pneumonia
at a very advanced stage
its progress has been unchecked by her immune system
c a n you help her
we have two options
one is a super b i o t i c
but theres the risk her immune system might bow out of the fight
the other is a nodal transfusion
katherine has agreed to be the donor
but the new antibodies may not conform fully
they m a y decide to attack the baby
i dont understand any of this
he means that by trying to help her we could lose her
or lose the baby
or if we do nothing both
her immune system is
if we dont act the infection will take over
lincoln lowers into a chair
he feels a pain somewhere
he cant quite pin down where
or what caused it
or why it hurts so bad
ester lies in bed dozing looking more relaxed
her oxygen mask makes breathing easier
lincoln enters and sits beside her
she stirs meeting his eye with a faint smile
lincoln returns it he l l o stranger
you look tired lincoln
i t s okay
katherine told me
she sits up lowering her mask
her hand finding his
she told me a lot of things
about how they used a tiny part of her to make me
she said it wasnt so very different
what do you mean
t o u c h i n g her belly f r o m this
from having a baby
ester continues more troubled wheezing she told me how they use us
and i keep thinking
about the others
the ones we left behind about how theyll never know
ester s out of breath again coughing
lincoln helps her put the oxygen mask back over her mouth
ester slumps back relaxing
off lincolns worried look she smiles at him with her eyes im going to be okay lincoln
but even to his own ears the affirmation sounds hollow
the stream of water gushes into lincolns hands
he splashes his face
then looks at himself in the mirror
he looks sallow from sleeplessness
the facial hair makes him look like a shadow of his former self
for an instant he tenses at a light blinking in the glass
then he sees its just a humidifier on the far wall
tension ebbing he splashes some more water
when he looks up again he sees his pupils are dilating
the sense of danger
his voice comes in a cold whisper no
lincoln emerges from the restroom scanning for the dangers source
figures flash past in scrubs white coats
then he sees it
the figure emerging from the elevator
the face of scheer
a flurry of disturbance from the nurses as someone barges into the room
abrams is prepping katherine for the transfusion
off the ruckus he looks up
lincoln comes up to them urgently we have to go
we have to get her out
what are you talking about
hes come for her
what e v e r this is about we cant move her
shes already under sedation
lincoln look to see ester asleep on the or table beyond
how long before she wakes up
the procedure takes three hours but
t o katherine emphatic youll take care of it wont you
take her somewhere they cant find her
katherine understanding simply nods
lincoln takes a last look at ester then departs
abrams bemused turns to katherine katherine what the hells going on
lincoln moves up the corridor purpose in his stride
his black gaze fixed on scheer making an inquiry at the nurses station
lincoln doesnt even break stride
he grabs scheer from behind nurses running people shouting lincoln takes off at a run
scheer recovering seeing his quarry through the confusion no time for subtlety he leaps over the nurses station pursuing lincoln pauses at the emergency exit checking to see his enemy
is following then pushing on through the doors into lincoln hammers down the steps an alarm sounding shouting from beyond footfalls behind him deeper into the gloom s c h e e r vaulting the rail shortcutting t h e flights of steps catching sight of his quarry as he pushes through a door into lincoln bursts out into the parking lot flashes of light vehicles pulling in and out off across the parking docks s c h e e r bursts out in his wake his quarry temporarily lost now spotting him across the lot leaping into a vehicle lincoln fires up the corsair resistors droning jamming the throttle lurching out narrowly missing another vehicle s c h e e r spinning round as the corsair blurs past its heading for the exit ramp he launches towards the straker t h e corsair burns up the parking ramp smashing the gate arm plunging out into the street bouncing across the lodestream t h e straker h u r t l e s up close behind into the snarl of traffic steering expertly through picking up the tail of the corsair t h e corsair ploughs up the street traffic swerving out of its path buoys clanging as it lurches from one lane to the next lincoln jams the throttle the resistors buzzing growling with energy he has one goal draw his enemy away from ester s c h e e r coolly intent at the controls of the straker keeping a certain distance waiting for his quarry to make a mistake a metro pd officer pulls out mounted on a hybrid of motorbike and jetski k n o w n as a lode runner sounding the siren s c h e e r reacting the pd lode runner pulling ahead of him he cant allow a police intervention he slips in behind
the metro pd officer darting looks back headlamps b l i n d i n g his rear view another vehicle is coming up behind him fast c l a
n g the straker i m p a c t s glancing the pd lode runner which wobbles corrects the straker d r o p s back for a longer run up t h e metro pd officer yelling into his headset inaudible over the siren the headlamps a g a i n the vehicle coming up behind c r a s h the pd lode runner fishtails its resistors suddenly clash with the prevailing polarity a huge jolt of inertia c a t a p u l t i n g the metro pd officer through the air plummeting down into obscurity the straker w h o o s h i n g over his head t h e pd lode runner left spinning behind resistors vying with the polarity the drive system melting down fusing sparking s c h e e r watches the fireball in his rear view there will be more police soon he jams the throttle he has to end this
lincoln seeing the straker z o o m i n g up behind veering round another corner the chassis tilting a steep banking turn t h e corsair hull runners
thudding across the buffers recoil sending the chassis up against the concrete sparks flying s c h e e r turning the corner the windshield suddenly sprayed with sparks jerking back on the throttle to avoid a collision lincoln fighting to correct the steering seeing the straker d r o p p i n g back a chance to gain distance jamming the throttle a n intersection approaching lincoln cant correct his steering in time the corsair careens at full res over the intersection c r a s h i n g through a gate arm the ground dropping away into a steep ramp suddenly the corsair is flying through the air finally nose diving into an empty bay with a deafening crunch the straker p u l l s up at the smashed gate arm
in the booth a holoserve p a r k i n g attendant greets the arrival with a smile we l c o m e to holspar s t a
d i u m home of the phoenix admirals parking is fifteen currency units
scheer gets out of the straker
he looks down at the crashsite b e l o w
the parking lot like a marina is filled to capacity
a game is in progress
a corona of light coming from the stadium
hoots music the roaring crowd
over which sirens can now be heard
scheer draws the syringe gun and heads down the ramp
d u s t blooms from the crashsite
s c h e e r crouches peering down at the wrecked corsair
the burst windshield the dangling driver side door shows his quarry has escaped the wreckage
he rises and scans around
on the concrete a trail of blood is visible
the blood trail leads down a gloomy stairwell
the game is just audible overhead
lincoln stumbles down the steps clutching his bleeding arm
between pain and concussion he loses his footing and falls
he tumbles down the remaining steps to the bottom
i n the gloom we see groundskeeping e q u i p m e n t supplies edgers aerators spray rigs drums of insecticides herbicides
for a moment lincoln lies stunned
then hears a noise and rolls over
he looks up the stairwell
a shadow is descending towards him
w i t h painful effort lincoln starts crawling across the floor eyes fixed on the shadow
tensing as a handgun noses out of the darkness
then a stadium security guard steps into the light you what are you doing down here
n o w he sees lincoln more closely injured his arm bleeding
o h jesus
are you okay son
lincoln eases a little as he sees the security guard lower his weapon
then suddenly the guard is jerked back by the scalp
now suddenly the guard jettisons the handgun clutching his throat like its on fire
with a boiling gurgle he staggers forward
streaming with sweat
toppling across a herbicide drum
convulsing belching steam
then suddenly his body falls slack
s c h e e r is at the foot of the steps discarding the spent ampule from the syringe gun
now screwing a fresh ampule into place
lincoln turns to him realizing what hes just witnessed is a glimpse of his own fate
he pushes himself upright bracing
s c h e e r looks at him
clutching his bloody arm barely able to stay upright but still ready to fight for life
he half smiles
im jealous of you
you have a reason to live
i cant say ive ever had that
lincoln holds his gaze looking deep in his eyes
then as if scared by what he sees there starts inching away glancing at t h e guards body smoldering lowering melting through the drum s c h e e
r moving forward the smile leaving his face
a mask of hollowness as he moves in on his quarry the syringe gun poised
lincoln stumbling collapsing to his knees hanging his head as if in surrender
then suddenly his hand flies up b o o m a flash of light as he fires the handgun recovered from the ground an energy pulse impacting the wall fizzling
out s c h e e r keeps coming syringe gun ready blank faced unflinching t h e guards body crackling into flame the drum splitting open b o o m another flash lincoln fires again clipping his enemy s c h e e r keeps coming a charred wound in his shoulder relentless t h e guards body burning sliding into the sands of herbicide b o o m b o o m b o o m lincoln keeps firing more hits than misses s c h e e r keeps coming blank faced his body pitting with impacts a cacophony of sirens can be heard outside
a thick grey smoke gulches up from the stairwell
shadows are visible
the sound of extinguishers
a fireman climbs up emerging from the smoke he pulls off his breathing mask to address a waiting pd officer n o t h i n g
if there was anyone down there theyre a pile of ashes now
p e a c e
a bell tolling in the background
we make out katherine dressed in black standing at a grave
the headstone reads simply here lies ester her unborn son may they rest in peace
there are no dates
katherine lays down some flowers then looks across at dr
as he escorts her away we see crowne crossing towards them
she introduces herself delicately m r s
my name is ellen crowne
a celestial penthouse office
katherine enters with crowne
merrick and dr
sanger rise to greet her
m y name is henry sanger
id like to offer my deepest condolences
his insincerity is transparent
katherine just nods stiffly
this is bernard merrick our facility director
he knew ester personally
an d its a terrible loss
m o r e insincerity
katherine nods again
then settles in a chair
crowne allows a respectful pause
then begins with due delicacy l e g a l issues must seem trivial at this time
but the sponsorship agreement has certain conditions relating to confident i a l i t y
d e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of events those conditions remain binding
we want to be sure you understand that
t h a t said the institute is likewise bound by the terms of sponsorship and while we reserve every right
you can stop there
i know why im here
you wanted to know if im going to sue you for breach of contract
n o t h i n g so devious mrs
we simply wanted to find some way to heal the wounds from this incident
i dont want restitution dr
the reason i agreed to this meeting was to have the chance to talk to you
o f course
i never got to meet you when i visited the institute
it was one of your sales m e n who led the tour
i remember how h e described the agnates a s if they were some kind of mindless organisms
more like livestock than humanity
l e g a l l y human rights dont apply
dont interrupt ellen
i remember how eager i was to believe him
but when i saw w h a t id created in flesh and blood when i touched h e r it was i who felt less than human
he looks at her expressively
perhaps he really does understand
ester s life was my responsibility and her death is my cross to bear alone
so im not going to sue you dr
b e a t a sudden ominous tone but i am going to blame y o u
until the day i die i will silently curse your name
thats w h a t i wanted you to know
she drives it home with a horrible look
sanger accepts it with due gravity
theres an ugly pause
katherine gets to her feet
an d now id like to leave please
we do have other issues to discuss
n o ellen thats enough
i think mrs
ester has said all there is to say
katherine descends the steps from the entrance
she crosses to a black funeral sedan parked kerbside
abrams stands waiting i hope you know what youre doing
i dont think they suspected anything
j u s t understand that ive put a lot on the line for you katherine
but it felt good
it felt like something john would have done
c r o w n e escorts sanger and merrick to the waiting whisper
we l l i dont know about the two of you but id say we got off lightly
dont start getting maudlin henry
its a little too late in the game
she shakes their hands as they climb into the whisper
then watches it take off ascending into the blinding sunlight
a i r blasts up from the giant funnel
widening we re establish the huge ring the processing plant the giant appendages of ducting the immutable red rocks
the shot sequence reprising
from the processing plant over the main complex
from the front of the complex to the dock
following the lodeway out to the perimeter wall
the gateway now gliding open to disclose a view of the shimmering desert
out in the distance the institute liner emerging from the shimmer
the crosshatch insignia
t h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked
a tour group is disembarking
another parade of plutocracy aging bloated me and brittle young women
they filter inside to be greeted by the courtesy staff led by the ever perky lydia
l a d i e s and gentlemen my name is lydia and on behalf of our staff id like t o welcome you to the sanger institute
before we start the tour well be serv i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center and circulating our
standard discretion agreements
i should add that today you are all very lucky because our ceo and founder dr
henry sanger is with us and will be leading the tour personally
the tour group pick and mingle at a buffet
we isolate a casually dressed man lightly bearded in a phoenix admirals cap crossing to lydia
she turns to greet him with a smile yes
thomas isnt it
the man tilts up to reveal his face
we see he is lincoln
i cant find my sunglasses
i think i left them on the shuttle
we l l were about to start the tour
but i can have someone check for you
ill catch up
lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the complex
hugging the shadows scanning for onlookers
there is the processing plant and there the ring of funnels
the sight brings a sudden rush of memories painful memories horrors
lincoln steels himself then breaks from shadow and races for the nearest funnel
he makes a running lap
his fingers grab t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up
reaching the lip he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r
then he hears s i r this is a restricted area
lincoln lowers back to the ground
he finds himself facing a technician in a hardhat
his uniform reads air processing
the doors slide open and the technician enters stiffly
then suddenly topples forward pistol whipped from behind
lincoln enters the elevator a familiar handgun clenched in his fist
l o o k i n g up an elevator shaft
the red pulse of the lode poles rippling downward as the elevator descends from the surface
lincoln is now wearing the technicians uniform
he watches the panel lights flashing down
level harvest level labor decon level labor quarters
his pupils are dilating but his face is set with determination
he knows what he must do
his gaze drifts down to level twenty agnate containment
the holographic rendering of containment spins in the vaulted chamber like a giant geometrical phantom
the ether blinks with blue dots in their hundreds as the agnates g o about their day
o v e r l o o k i n g the ether ethercon sits at his console
the hiss of an opening door as someone enters
ethercon looks round
he greets the technicians arrival with an inquisitive look
then the technician takes off his hardhat
a crosshatch on his brow
ethercon reacts almost instantly reaching for the console
then instantly freezes as lincoln presses the handgun to his skull
p a l e blue light
ethercon leads the way down a silent corridor
lincoln follows him the handgun firmly levelled on his head
the pale blue light sustains
the chamber is reminiscent of the foundation chambers
the walls lined with tanks
but instead of amber fluid these contain blocks of ice
beside each tank is a grid of bio monitors
e t h e r c o n stumbles into frame prodded by lincoln
then with a trembling finger points to one of the tanks
lincoln holds aim on him and considers the glass facet
he wipes the condensation off the glass
suspended in the block of ice is a shadow
a human figure
a device is attached to his stomach
lincoln looks at the bio monitors
a screen reads lincoln looks across the ekg the cardiograph indications that starkweather is still alive
then he fixes on the rfi m o n i t o r
a resonant image of the brain
the shifting aura showing a level of consciousness
what thoughts must be going through that mind
the fate of the agnates s p a r e d from expiration
to be kept on i c e for future harvest
with a haggard look lincoln rests his hand on the glass where starkweather hangs frozen
an embryo in mutated effigy hangs suspended in the amber fluid
sanger stands at the wall of display tanks mid way through his sales pitch
he delivers it now with noticeably less gusto c a s e in point the clone
back in the beginning the mapping of the human genome was declared a historic landmark to break the curse of heredity to correct congenital defect
genetic engineering became the brave new world of medical science
a bright future that led to a dark age and much of
a n abrupt pause a frown l e g i s l a t i o n we know today
but while the clone laws may have narrowed the field science marches on
a n o t h e r abrupt pause im sorry im f
s u d d e n l y he clutches his arm emitting a guttural gasp
s a n g e r just looks at her
then jolts from a spasm clawing at his chest
his knees buckling he topples against a display case
pawing at the glass he slides dreadfully to the ground
hes having a heart attack
somebody get a doctor in here
the tour group keeps their distance unsettled by the face of mortality
sanger is now lying in contortion on the floor his gaping eyes fixed on the display tank
the embryo in mutated effigy rocking about in the amber fluid
the sight of this little human monster is one that will follow him to the grave
the glass wall looks down on the avenue and the agnates m i l l i n g beneath
merrick sits at his console
business as usual
off a buzz he taps a button
the door opens and a censor bursts in s i r ive been trying to contact you
its the ether
merrick taps another button and the glass wall frosts over
it pixellates o n t o an image of his own face
a recorded playback merrick p b o n etherscreen we l l starkweather if youre watching on etherscreen your time has come my friend
youre going to the island
s t a b s at a key on his console e t h e r c o n
ether control come in
an y o n e
somebody pick up
thats what i mean
we cant get through
the circuits are locked
how wide is this going
c o m m u n i t y w i d e sir
i n t e r c u t t i n g agnates a t workstations watching on visors
in the subway watching on platform banner
in the plaza watching on the glass wall
an agnate in an apartment watching on a wall panel
we are still in the apartment when the playback cuts out
the agnate looks around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans parency
the mirror panels the frosted walls the window which now shows no view at all
just the gleam of a holographic lens
merrick looks down from the glass wall at the agnates m a s s e d in the avenue beneath
they are all looking directly up at him
the ether grid blinking with red dots
ethercon sitting frozen at the console the handgun pressed to his head
lincoln stands over him
his face cast in a chill of vengeance
a glass facade
a noise from within
a primal guttural noise building to a roar
now warping as we drop to slow motion
the glass webbing bursting open from within the facade exploding in a glittering shower of shards
no clue of where we may be
a safehouse somewhere
the passage of time is marked on lincolns face careworn long hair a full beard
he sits in front of a data tablet his image recorded on its screen
his voice also seems older as he speaks
i t s been a year since the breakout
a year in hiding waiting for things to quiet down
i dont know how many made i t out or how many who did survived
i know there are people called politicians trying to say it never happened
thats why ive kept this journal
to keep the truth alive
ive learned what that means but it still confuses me
in functional terms ive been alive for ten years
in human terms more than thirty
im not sure about that one either
they say im not human because i have no mother or father
i guess i have more to learn
but one word i do understand is hope
so maybe this j o u r n a l will give hope to those like me who may be out there
to know t h e y r e not alone
my name is lincoln s i x e c h o and this is my testament
he sits back contemplating the screen with an air of closure
then he stirs at a sound
at first just a gurgle
then a moan
becoming the sound of a baby crying
lincoln crosses to a cot
he lifts up a baby boy months old bawling and squirming
is he hungry again
i just fed him
ester steps into the room sleep mussed her beauty deepened by maternity
the baby reaches out for her
lincoln hands him over lincoln junior huh
it still doesnt sound right
i t s the name of his father
she lovingly kisses him
lincoln smiles at her then the baby sweeping the hair from the forehead
we should finish packing
a private jetty stretches out to a pile of supply canisters
a yacht is moored
we recognized it as johns boat
and we recognize katherine holding the baby as lincoln and ester finish loading
the last canister stowed lincoln comes up to her
he smiles at the sight of her with the baby
then prompts her gently
time to go
katherine hesitates part of her unwilling to let the baby go
then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets ester take him
lincoln presents her with the data tablet youll make sure this gets out
there are people sympathetic to the cause
im going to get it to them
thank you katherine
katherine points to a canister left on the dock
dont forget that
it has the operating manuals for the boat
ive been looking at them for months
but the maps the charts
b e a t a meaningful look i dont need them either
katherine nods understanding
nothing more to say she hugs him
then turns to ester with the baby
she folds them in a yearning almost maternal embrace
tears well in her eyes
then the sorrow turns to laughter as the baby starts tugging at her gray hair
the sun rises in the east casting the coastline in silhouette
the light glows across lincolns face at the helm of the yacht staring back to the shore
he looks at ester sitting beside him the baby swaddled in a blanket at her breast
then he looks out to the west to the soft reach of dawn and the boundless horizon of sea
there never was an island
but perhaps there will be
