written by melissa rosenberg adapted from the novel by stephenie meyer dec
a full moon fills the frame luminous tinged with gold
slowly a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the moons surface darkening it from left to right
these violent delights have violent ends
until the moon is enveloped in shadow a new moon
which disappears into the darkness
over black a ruffled tulip appears isolated against the blackness
and in their triumph die like fire and powder
hold on the tulip as the background fades up around it to reveal were now in its surrounded by the dark lush greenery of the forest floor
which as they kiss consume
suddenly a foot slams down next to the tulip nearly crushing it
as the foot immediately lifts off again it grazes the tulip knocking its petals off they abruptly change direction
include bella swan desperately searching the woods short surreal cuts of her frenetic quest edward
ahead through the darkness of the thick forest she sees sunlight a clearing
she hurtles toward it edward
as bella bursts into the sunlight
its the meadow where edward revealed his skin in the sun
but hes not here now
instead bella sees across the meadow an old woman white hair framing her withered face
bellas eyes widen with surprise as she recognizes gran
gran looks as surprised as bella
bella smiles and waves as does gran
bella starts toward her but bella
she spins to the voice behind her to see edward emerge from the forest his alabaster skin in sharp contrast to the shadows
she beams at him relieved in love
until he moves to edge of the shade inches from suns rays stop shell see
but edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight
sunbeams shatter off his skin like a thousand rainbow shards as if he were made of diamonds
an awesome sight
jump cut to edward now inches from bella still glistening entrancing her
she wraps an arm around his waist then arranges her face into a calm expression
they turn to gran whose expression is calm too
grans arm is extended as if she also holds someone
jump cut to bella and edward only feet from gran now
bellas about to present edward but then sees that gran mimics bellas movement exactly
with growing horror bella reaches out to gran
and touches glass
pull back to find gran is now surrounded by a gilded frame
its a mirror mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind bella
oh my god
as she realizes thats not gran its bella sixty five years older
bella spins to her perfect eternally year old edward
he takes her now wrinkled age spotted hand
then he leans in very close to her year old face and whispers into her ear happy birthday
on bella her eyes snap open
she lies atop her bed
a book romeo and juliet lays open on her chest
bella sits up the dream still weighing on her
include her room cluttered with pictures of edward of the cullens memorabilia of all things edward
a knock on the door
chief charlie swan enters carrying two gifts one wrapped one not
happy birthday bells
dad we agreed no gifts
at least mines not wrapped
he hands it to her
its a digital camera
bellas pleased despite herself
okay this is actually kind of great
re wrapped gift goes with this one from your mom
we coordinated well she coordinated me
bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a scrapbook
to put your pictures in record your senior year man senior year
howd you get so old so fast
not that old
i dont know
is that a wrinkle
bella races to the mirror searches her face
i was kidding
so not funny dad
an aerial view of this lush green overcast landscape the rainy world that is forks
find bellas old truck as it lumbers down the two lane highway
it was just a dream
but also my worst nightmare
bella climbs out of her truck shouldering her book bag
she looks around the parking lot seeking edward wherefore art thou bella
she turns as mike eric angela and jessica approach
you finish the shakespeare assignment
he means will you finish his assignment
no i dont okay i do
i can help you with it but first pulling out her camera i need a picture
my moms expecting a scrapbook full of memories
holds up her own camera i take em i dont pose for em
you do today
she pushes angela to the others they arrange themselves youll photoshop my nose if it looks big right
dont worry im in the picture no one will be looking at you guys
jessica scoffs angela points her camera at bella mike and eric joust bella aims it freezes on them fun delightfully carefree
but when the camera lowers their playfulness has dissipated as they see someone behind bella
she turns to see edward climbing out of his silver volvo
dry oh good
the friends uncomfortable move off check ya later
but bella doesnt register their tone
shes transfixed by edward who approaches eyes never leaving hers
he reaches her washing away all her concerns happy birthday
except that one
her face falls
dont remind me
your birth is definitely a day to celebrate
not for me
eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age
its one year older than you
bella im ninety
maybe i should be creeped out that im dating such an old guy
smiles amused yes its the age thats creepy not the fact that youre dating a vampire
then he kisses her tenderly adoringly
she kisses him back
despite their restraint the passion mounts
until he pulls away
as always both are left wanting more
edward nods toward the school building class
catching their breath they start toward school
but edward stops hearing something in his mind
someone wants you
jacob black jogs up carrying a used car part long black ponytail wagging
he looks due to his tall muscular body but the gregarious jacob is a little klutzy still catching up to his growth spurt
he nods to edward who moves off to the side but eyes them
god jacob what are they feeding you on that rez steroids
wouldnt seem so drastic if you came around more
i will soon
but isnt your school like ten miles that way
re car part just here buying this for the rabbit
im almost done with the rebuild
gotta come take a ride when its done
as if remembering oh and hey happy birthday
your dad told my dad
he pulls from his coat a small woven dreamcatcher feathers dangling from it
he hands it to her
i saw it the other day and thought of you it catches bad dreams
this i need
the bells about to ring
the bell rings
jacob gives edward an amiable smile with just a hint of snark
ooh look at you all psychic
i dont have that particular gift
but i can read a watch
im clever that way
they share a tight smile
bella intercedes squeezing jacobs arm
bye jake and thank you
edward guides her away
as they walk off how come jacob black gets to give you a gift and i dont
hes just a friend
friends dont spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher
stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much
little hard to tune out
she just laughs but edward looks back at jacob with resentment
jacob holds his gaze
edward and bella enter the double doors suddenly a small wrapped gift appears in bellas face
alice presents it
alice whispers in her ear as she hugs bella birthday
over alices shoulder bella sees jasper keeping his distance
he offers her a pleasant nod
she tries to hide alices present hoping no one noticed alice didnt i say no gifts
ive already seen you open it and guess what
you love it
you had a vision about my birthday
and about the green dress youll be wearing to your party tonight
great color on you
itll be fun
beat confused i
guess i can deal hurriedly great
see ya at seven
alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her mind
which is when bella realizes wait jasper no fair with the mood control
he offers an apologetic bow before alice drags him away
you cant trust them
close on a t
monitor zeffirellis romeo and juliet plays
the suicide scene
arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
the room is dark as we pan over the class some students entertained some moved mike trying not to fall asleep
the teacher mr
berty mouths every word heres to my love
drinks o true apothecary
thy drugs are quick
find edward and bella in the back of the room desks pushed together whisper talking
i hate being
come on the last real birthday any of us had was emmetts i think bing crosby was on top of the charts
then youll be helping us feel normal for a night
bella sits back knowing shes trapped
he kisses her hand
there are worse tragedies than a birthday
look at romeo
hes responsible for his wifes death
who could live with that
looks at the screen though i do envy him one thing
blanches slightly juliets alright
if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing
not the girl the suicide
off her look nearly impossible for my kind
but humans a little poison dagger to the heart
there are so many options
appalled why would you even think about that
he turns her wrist over runs his hand over the horseshoe shaped scar on her forearm
shrugs i considered it
when james had you trapped
flashpop to twilight in the ballet studio james grabs bellas arm and bites back on edward pained
i didnt know if id find you in time
if id gotten you killed it wouldnt have been your fault
either way i had a plan
ways for us
at least one way
i would have gone to italy provoked the volturi
is there something youd like to share with the class edward
politely certainly not
but i apologize for being a distraction
perhaps you should rewind to act five scene one line twenty eight eighty nine reciting if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
berty just looks at him then moves off intimidated eyes on the screen people
bella is too concerned to be amused
lights glow from inside the beautiful house
the volturi are a very old very powerful family
on an th century oil painting depicting grecian figures in swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies
in a high balcony four calm figures look down upon the bacchanal two black haired one snowy white one golden haired
the closest thing my world has to royalty
include edward and bella now wearing a green dress
she studies the painting the largest on a wall crowded with pictures
the other walls are towering bookshelves
francesco solimena painted this he often depicted the volturi as gods
bella examines the golden haired god
he lived with them for a few decades
he describes them as very refined for killers
their features begin to fill in become real they come to life in the painting turning to leave the balcony through an archway
we follow them into its centuries old its marble cracked and weathered
the open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of light
the room is empty but for three large wooden chairs and half a dozen vampires in elegant th century attire
the volturi are also what you might call enforcers
the only rule they have to keep secret the existence of our kind
two of the volturi marcus and caius take their seats carlisle stands beside them
aro moves to the center of the room where we reveal a rogue vampire is on his knees
he looks feral compared to the others and terrified
aro puts his hands on either side of the rogues face
we dont make spectacles of ourselves or kill conspicuously unless we want to die
aro then slowly dispassionately rips the rogues head off
two volturi guards felix and demetri appear on either side holding him down as aro easily detaches the head and tosses it aside
aro calmly sits as the others tear the rogue limb from limb
carlisle has to look away
as bella spins on edward dont even talk about that
you cant let anyone hurt you
the volturi or anyone else
sees shes worried who else would hurt me
you said there were more dangerous things out there than you
and i know you have at least one enemy on all three evil vampires james victoria the dread locked laurent from twilight close on victoria fire red hair burgundy red
eyes feral vicious grin from twilight you said shed come after you for killing her mate
yes some day
but alice will see her coming
and she wont win
bella looks up at him pained
i hate that i cant protect you
he laughs amused
shes decidedly not
that was me being serious
kissing her face i know
but you do protect me
kisses her nose from boredom
kisses her lips and loneliness
in between kisses you give me a reason to stay
my job to protect you
but he stops smiles hearing something in his mind from everyone but my sister
as the door bursts open and alice dances in
its time its time its time
alice tugs bella and edward to the top of the landing then skips down the stairs
they look down into the living room hundreds of pink candles and rose filled crystal bowls
rosalie esme emmett carlisle jasper and alice look up at her all of them stunningly beautiful
bella would love to disappear but edward leads her down to the living room where esme and carlisle hug bella warmly
sorry about all this
we tried to rein alice in
like thats even possible
happy birthday bella
alice has snapped a picture of bella with them
re camera found it in your bag
emmett moves to edwards side
dating an older woman
bella caught that
edward elbows him sharply to shut up
rosalie steps up
shoves a silver package at bella
its a necklace
alice picked it out
she walks away bored
bella has to smile
she sees jasper across the room
they wave to each other
aims the camera show me the love
edward pulls bella into an embrace they look deeply into one anothers eyes
for your scrapbook
now open your presents
alice drags bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates
alice im the only one who even eats cake
that thing could feed fifty
hope youre hungry
here this ones from emmett
the others crowd around
jasper somewhat away
bella no fan of being the center of attention opens the gift to find an empty car radio box
already installed it in your truck
finally a decent sound system in that piece of
no hating on the truck
thank you emmett
alice hands her a box
bella starts to open it but ouch paper cut
close on bellas finger a single drop of deep red blood appears
bella thinks little of it but then hears a disturbing grisly snarl she looks up just as bellas pov jasper lunges toward her
teeth bared eyes beyond reason edward flings bella behind his own body causing her to crash into the table plates shattering as jasper slams into edward sounds like boulders colliding
edward pushes him hard jasper sails backward hitting the wall
but he ricochets off it and comes back at bella
emmett and carlisle tackle jasper from the side dragging him to the ground alice helps hold him down soothingly jaz
shhh but she stops her head suddenly jerking toward bella
then everybodys eyes snap toward bella as they catch the overwhelming scent on bella lying amid the shards of broken china
she looks at her arm seeing now its been slashed by plate shards bright red blood pulses out of her pooling
she looks up all of them now including edward but not carlisle stare down at her at her blood with fevered eyes
six suddenly ravenous vampires
slow motion abruptly ends as carlisle jumps to bellas side
edward though white as a bone snaps out of it and stands between her and the others
emmett get jasper out of here
no response emmett
emmett reins himself in elbows rosalie
they drag the snarling jasper out
esme holds her nose politely exits with the others
alice looks at bella apologetic im sorry i
she slips out the door
edwards still on guard as carlisle examines bellas arm
ill have to stitch this up
ill carry her to the kitchen
he moves to pick her up but his eyes dart to the blood
ill take care of her edward
edward doesnt move check on jasper
edward looks from him to bella
then steps back allowing carlisle to lift bella and carry her to the kitchen
but just before the kitchen door closes bella sees edwards agonized face
he turns away unable to meet her eyes
bella sits in a chair opposite carlisle who mops up her blood as he removes glass shards from her arm
he drops one into a bowl plink
she tries not to look at the blood
i sure can kill a party
its not your fault
jasper hasnt been away from human blood as long as the rest of us
seems like youre the only one it doesnt effect
centuries of practice
did you ever think of
i enjoy my work too much
helping people saving lives
im hoping theres a point to my existence even if i am damned
youre not damned
then you and i agree
but edward doesnt believe theres an afterlife for our kind
looking at her he thinks weve lost our souls
realizing thats why he wont
he thinks hed be damning me
if you believed as he did would you risk it
off bella no not ever
a large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard
edward drives in silence
bella studies him
finally say something
what do you want me to say
that im a klutz
that i should have been more careful you got a paper cut
normal people get paper cuts
and a normal boyfriend wouldnt have flung you into a stack of plates
a normal boyfriend wouldnt have had to fight the urge to kill you
i dont want normal i want you
edward doesnt respond just pulls the truck into the truck stops
you cant protect me from everything somethings going to separate us accident illness old age
as long as im human
appalled thats your solution
my ending your life
your giving me forever
he faces forward again jaw tight mind working tormented
she reaches for his hand carlisle told me how you feel about my soul but i dont believe that he subtly moves his hand away from hers
you should go in
he climbs out instantly hes opening the passenger side door for her
she climbs out
he looks down at her face he softens as he takes it in
puts a hand on her cheek
ill leave my window open for you
quietly i wont be coming back
can i ask for one thing
its still my birthday
off his nod kiss me
he lifts her face to his and kisses her
he begins carefully gently
but it changes he becomes urgent with an almost painful edge as if it were goodbye
abruptly he pulls away
with a last look he turns walks off into the night
on a photo as a printer spits it out
its the pic alice took of bella and edwards embrace
bella troubled puts it in her scrapbook her bandaged finger running over it
romeo and juliet lessons are on the board
everyones scribbling essays
bella glances at edwards desk empty flashpop to previous scene in truck ecu on edwards eyes hard turning away from her
bella sits with jessica angela eric and mike
they joke throw things
bellas distracted looking out for edward
flashpop to scene in the truck ecu on edwards hand moving away from hers
back on bellas worried face off which we go to pan the photos on the wall
include edward who studies them his expression grim
he looks down at bellas scrapbook to see the photo of him and bella
he pulls it out takes a closer look
on bella through the windshield of her truck as she pulls into the driveway
she climbs out heads toward the house but stops relief washing over her edward
he stands by the house
bella hurries toward him but slows when she sees his cold distant face an unreadable mask
walk with me
edward gently takes her hand
dread fills her but she lets him guide her toward the woods
edward stops by a fallen tree
turns to bella
we need to leave forks
carlisles supposed to be ten years older than he looks people will start noticing
bella reels trying to take this in
finally ill have to think of something to tell charlie but i can be ready not you
no edward what happened with jasper that was nothing
nothing compared to what could happen
you dont belong in my world
i belong with you you dont im coming i dont want you to come
bella is stung as if slapped
she steps back
trying to understand this
id like to ask one favor though
looks up hopeful anything
dont do anything stupid or reckless do you understand
adding for charlies sake
take care of yourself
he softens ever so slightly
time heals all wounds for your kind
particularly if youre not reminded
desperation wells up in her overwhelming dignity
no this is dont do this
he sees she wont let go easily
takes a breath
his face turns cold again
try to understand
every second with you is about restraint
youre too fragile
im tired of pretending to be something im not
reining myself in so i can be with a human
then take my soul
i dont care
i dont want it without you
sharply youre not good for me bella
bella looks at him
his hard face
ive let it go on too long
tears sting bellas eyes
this cant be happening
he steps forward
kisses her forehead
she closes her eyes
i promise it will be like i never existed
and here for the first time we see how truly agonizing this really is for edward
but bella doesnt see
by the time she opens her eyes hes gone
she spins wait she sees a leaf flittering to the ground where he grazed a branch the only indication of his direction
she hurries down the path then runs edward
and she keeps running going deeper into the woods
bella runs through the woods searching reminiscent of her opening dream
it gets darker and darker until were deep into night hear bellas sharp desperate breaths bella trips
falls to the damp forest floor
she looks up the trees spinning around her
she remains on the ground
curls into a ball
darkness shrouding her
devastation paralyzing her
ecu on her face numb
hear the faint sound of her name being called in the distance
a search party
shes too wrecked to respond
rain begins to pour she doesnt register it
series of scenes end on bella lying there dazed
she begins to hear an animal snuffling
it gets closer
it sounds large
then she hears a whisper move bella
she lifts her head looks for edward
but sees something else instead bellas pov a dark shape huge black
its eyes reflect light for a split second theyre inhuman savage
bella terrified manages to drag herself to a cluster of trees
she squeezes between them
she closes her eyes trying to disappear
bellas eyes open to find herself floating several feet above the ground
trees pass by
shes being carried
half the town is gathered a tired rescue party that includes mike newton and jacob black
charlie beside himself with worry pores over a map with billy black in wheelchair and quileute harry clearwater dark braids stout protruding belly kind face
ill call the cullens again
her note said she and edward went for a walk
they left town charlie
hospital said doc cullen got a big job somewhere else
harry puts a reassuring hand on charlies shoulder
well find her charlie
charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends
charlie spins to where jacob points
sam uley emerges a tall strong quileute indian with cropped hair and a fierce expression
hes carrying bella
its sam uley
he found her
charlie bolts to her hes never moved faster in his life
he wraps his arms around bella lifting her from sams arms
thank you sam
charlie carries bella to the house cradling her
harry and billy give sam a nod of praise and gratitude
but sam backs away avoiding any accolades
on jacob jogging alongside charlie peering at bella with worry
then jacob slows feeling eyes on his back
he turns to see sam uley staring at him
jacob uncomfortable quickly looks away
on charlie carrying bella up the stairs to the house what were you thinking baby
why were you out there
off her as charlie carries her inside overhead shot of the bed charlie lays bella down and wraps her in blankets
shes curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed
then at its foot
under the blankets
on top of them
in various different arrangements
a black liquid begins to flood the floor slowly swallowing everything in the room
it rises up the sides of the bed higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and begins to engulf bella
off her submerged in blackness
the leaves have turned red and orange
see a figure in the upstairs window bella sits in a rocking chair by the window
her face blank
stay on bella unchanging but through the window outside we see time lapsing behind her october costumed kids appear in the yard trick or treating
november neighbors bob marks and his wife bring charlie a turkey
they glance up at bellas window with concern
winter begins the trees branches are now bare
december charlie drags a christmas tree toward the house
worry has taken its toll on him
but bella remains unchanged
pan the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room gone are all traces of edward
edward took everything with him
including my life
he promised it would be like he never existed
land on the scrapbook which lies open the photo of bella and edwards embrace at the birthday party gone
bella at her computer typing an e mail to renee
but i need to know he did
bella sits on the couch blank as the rain pounds
charlie watches her concerned
its like a huge hole has been punched through my chest
in the darkness bella is curled up in a ball on her floor
but the pain is my only reminder that he was real
that they all were
bella sits alone staring straight ahead
see jessica eric angela and mike watching her with concern
talking about her
she doesnt notice
i miss them
a one story contemporary home surrounded by snowy barren land and woods
through a large picture window we see alice and carlisle arguing inside but im sure its better for them not having me around
alice faces off with carlisle as the others watch on
esme desolate emmett blank
he sits next to rosalie who seems almost irritated
jasper isolates himself in a corner
we promised edward
but she wont do well without us
i get flashes of her but theyre unclear forget her lets drag edward home
hell come back when hes ready
after bella moves on
when shes living her life safe from danger with self contempt you mean safe from us
alice wraps an arm around jasper soothingly
pointedly to alice and when will that be
can you see him alice
they all turn to alice
she closes her eyes trying to get a lock on edward push in on alice as the only decision hes made
visuals are jumpy unclear start high on a mountaintop in the middle of nowhere
swoop down to its peak on which we find edward
standing still face agonized
is to be alone
and suddenly he starts running like hes trying to outrun his memories faster and faster he races toward a cliff a ravine hundreds of feet below edward doesnt slow just
blasts forward faster then he leaps off the cliff floating but the pain stays with him on edwards feet landing hard on the other side of the ravine as they hit ground we as they hit computer keys time passes
every tick that goes by
include bellas computer screen as she types
like the pulse of blood behind a bruise
a beat as she stares at her own words
then she hits select all and delete on the computer a blank document
she types hi mom things are great grades are up
hanging with friends
bella presses send and the cheery e mail disappears
bella rises returns to her rocking chair staring out desolately
push past her outside
someones watching her pacing menacingly hungrily
bella exits to find charlie out by the street stuffing trash into the bins
he talks with neighbor bob marks who also attends to his trash two old beat up motorcycles
its about time you got rid of those bob
seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway
save the lecture chief
soon as the garbage truck hauls em off you and my wife can rest easy
starts off but stops oh hey whats the word on that bear problem
folks are saying theyre huge
distracted thats just
as charlie watches bella walk to her truck head down
bob sees her too how you doin there bella
bella in her own world doesnt respond
bob gives charlie an understanding shrug and heads off
on bella as she opens her truck door
suddenly it gets slammed shut again by charlie
youre going to jacksonville to live with your mother
i just dont know what to do any more
you dont act like someone left you more like someone died
she looks away
thats how it feels to her
im not leaving forks
bells the bastards not coming back
knows this all too well
its not normal this behavior
and frankly its scaring the hell outta me and your mother
gentler go to jacksonville baby
make some new friends
i like my old friends
you never even see them anymore
i do too
in fact im
jessica and i are going to port angeles tomorrow
suspicious you hate shopping
thats how good a friend i am
somewhat appeased alright
hi jessica its bella
bella drives talking on her cell hands free of course
yes bella swan
hey any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow
bella and jessica exit the theater
a marquee behind them bears the title of a zombie film
i dont get why are there so many zombie movies
its like a metaphor
for crass consumerism or something
bella glances at her
not that youd know anything about consuming
you didnt buy anything today
i bought something
socks dont count
course i was surprised you even called
ive been kind of
out of it
i mean at first i was worried
then im like okay shes still bumming
its not like i wasnt going through things too
like mike deciding he wanted to just be friends
that was really hard and how bout a ride girls
as bella looks across the street time suddenly slows four rough looking guys loiter out front next to their motorcycles
theyre in shadow we cant see their faces
flashpops bella surrounded by four guys twilight edwards volvo skidding to a stop edward staring them down back on bella a chill going down her spine freezing her as she
stares at the foursome across the street
then suddenly a pair of lips lean next to her ear move bella
she turns to find edward standing next to her
or so it seems
but hes an illusion an apparition which becomes clear when jessica steps right into him dissolving him to nothingness and come on
i know them
can we just go jessica pulls at her arm but bella shakes her off
i want to see something
much to jessicas frustration bella begins to cross the street toward the guys frightened but drawn
alright we got a taker
the apparition of edward reappears in her path this time
turn around bella
this is dangerous
but when she steps backward he fades
testing her hallucination she strides forward again edwards apparition reappears strides alongside her stop
shes almost smiling as she reaches the guys finally able to see them clearly and stops realizing youre not them
and with that
well be whoever you want honey
guy pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle
ready for a thrill ride
guy extends his hand to help her onto the bike
edwards apparition appears on the other side of the bike
bella looks at him with determination then climbs on to the back of the bike i can break promises too
the bike lurches forward going way too fast
as the wind blasts her hair back she realizes this might have been a mistake wait guy doesnt hear her guns the engine going faster edward stands in road directly
in their path more present more clear than ever
the bikes headlight illuminates him racing toward him stop stop
the bike abruptly pulls up short
hey i didnt force nothing on you
bella scrambles off stumbling in the process
edward is gone
the four guys then rev their bikes and peel out
bella watches them go as jessica storms up
what the hell is wrong with you
almost to herself i
trying to figure it out the more dangerous
the more real it was
so what youre like an adrenaline junky now
go hang gliding or bungie jumping
dont be a complete freak
an angry jessica charges off
bella watches the motorcycles disappear down the street as he wasnt real
i knew that
i didnt care
i needed to see him
if dangers what it took thats what id find
off bella determination settling into her face
bella pulls up in her truck a tarp covering something big in the back
jacob comes out of the house
a huge grin
bella hops out jacob gives her a hug
bellas surprised by his affection but doesnt mind
bout time you came by
i brought you something
bella pulls the tarp back revealing her neighbors two dilapidated rusting motorcycles
you shouldnt have
i rescued them from the dump
theyd cost more than theyre worth to fix
unless one had a mechanic type friend
me being the mechanic type friend
off her shrug since when are you into motorcycles
studying the bikes the parts alone will be pricey
i have a college fund i can dig into
charlies gonna love that
charlie wont know
lying to dad
blowing through college money
repairing dangerous machines that im guessing youll want to ride
i really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless
oh its totally stupid and reckless
leans closer grins when do we start
bella face spreads into something we havent seen in a while
a wide smile
as they pull the bikes off the truck they laugh and joke its as though jacob has brought bella back to life
but someones watching as the two of them wheel the bikes into the garage
reverse on the watcher to discover next to sam stand two others jared and paul
all three have cropped hair sleeveless shirts cut offs
its unsettling how they watch bella and jacob the ferocity in their eyes the danger
sam turns the others follow his lead
the three slink soundlessly into the darkness of the woods
two hikers nate and tim s as they tromp through the shadowy mist laden woods
tim studies his iphone gps were going the wrong way
enjoy the scenery
slapping a mosquito and the west nile virus
tim hears a rustle
you hear that
if i knew you were such a wuss id have brought my grandma
could be one of those giant bears
there are no giant rustle
then from the opposite direction another rustle
then another and another from behind from in front
its either more than one creature or its moving with extraordinary speed
the guys are terrified
what the hell is that
i dont know
the guys faced away from one another search the trees
stay on tim as suddenly theres an eerie silence
think its gone
he turns to find that nate has vanished
then the rustling starts again
close on tim tearing through the woods too scared to feel the branches smack him in the face
breath ragged he looks over his shoulder tims pov behind him something gives chase flattening foliage and bending thin trees in its path
tim runs harder a couple cars pass
tim races for it
tim bursts from the tree line hes almost to the pavement he s going to escape bam
something yanks him out of frame at an unnatural angle
his scream is abruptly choked off leaving nothing but a disturbing silence
motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets
jacob moves among them excitedly piecing them together
if were going to be working on this every day we should probably include some homework
dont want the dads to think im a bad influence on you
you influence me
i am older than you
age aint nothin but a number
and i convinced you to secretly build us two wheeled death machines
sudden mock horror god youre right youre like satan yo jake you in there
bella abruptly sits up starts to pull a tarp over the bikes
its cool its just my boys
quil ateara and embry call enter both
quil is short stocky and feisty with short hair
embry is tall thin and laid back with chin length black hair
they stop when they see bella
the two guys share a smile
this is bella
bella thats quil and embry
so the bike building story is true
taught him everything he knows
what about the part where youre his girlfriend
oh were just friends
scrambling i said shes a girl and a friend
embry you remember him making that distinction
bella rescues jacob so i guess you guys have girlfriends
laughs loudly right
quil took his cousin to prom
embry chuckles as well
yeah thats still a riot
you want funny black
ill give you funny
quil makes a run at him he dodges a playful scuffle ensues
embry amused saunters over to bella
i got five bucks on quil
the scuffle continues
off bella enjoying them
the bikes begin to take shape the parts on the blanket thin out
i never forgot my reason for doing what i was doing
jacob clowns for bellas amusement pretends to skewer himself with a pipe
but being with jacob was a bigger perk than i expected
he constantly touches her playful affectionate
its effortless in contrast to edwards intense restraint
we can see her spirits beginning to lift
bella and jacob exit make their way across the yard to her truck
bella seems lighter happier than before
quil keeps asking to come over
i think he likes you a little too much
tell him im not into the cougar thing
what is it with you and age
i mean that cullen guy was young didnt seem to
he instantly regrets saying edwards name as he sees it crush her spirits
off bella retreating into herself
not even jacob could keep away the nightmares
bella tears through the forest searching desperately
then she turns finds edward a few yards away his face cold
she steps toward him but he bolts backward suddenly twenty yards away the terror the loneliness
he rapidly retreats further until he disappears leaving bella utterly alone darkness closing in on her
bella screams in her sleep
the light turns on and charlie hurries to her side gently shaking her awake
youre alright bells
her eyes open tears streaming down her cheeks
he doesnt quite know what to do so hands her a glass of water from her bedside table
she sits up sips
he pulls the dreamcatcher from her bedpost
this things not working very well
not as bad as it was
beat i know what its like you know
when your mom left me
i had a hell of a time
imagined doing all kinds of crazy things just to stop the pain
she avoids his look
but hanging out with jacob seems to help get your mind off
hes been keeping me afloat
hes a good guy
bella drives along the la push cliffs
jacob rides shotgun
he studies a grease blackened motorcycle crankshaft
we got lucky at the dump
you know how much a new crankshaft goes for
sure i spend all my free time on crankshaft dot com
i think thats a porn site
then these bikes are gonna be rolling soon
where should we ride first
like theres any place sunny around here
i know a place above the cloud line the second she says it she regrets it off her flashpop to the meadow bella lying in the grass with edward twilight
flowers surrounding them
where is it
back on bella her face falls
too hard to get to
he brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue
so well find our sunny spot right
she smiles grateful
then she looks out the window at the cliffs
four men stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff sam jared paul and a fourth
they wear nothing but cut off shorts
they push each other rough housing
bitter and his cult
suddenly two of the guys throw a struggling jared over the cliff
bella slams on the brakes
jumps out of the truck jacob climbs out after her oh my god
bella runs toward them
but jacobs laughter slows her
theyre not really fighting bella
theyre cliff diving
what on purpose
scary as hell but a total rush
bellas pov a diver paul takes a running start and flings himself into the air twisting and cartwheeling down
bella is intrigued sees the potential for adrenaline for edward
most of us jump from lower down
think i could
man first motorcycles now cliff diving
you said it was a rush
maybe on a warmer day
and not from the top
well leave the showing off to sam and his disciples
theres that bitter edge again
she looks at him
you dont like them
they think they run this place
acting all bad ass calling themselves protectors
what are they protecting
the tribe the land their right to be jerks
embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids now look at him
bella looks closer sees the fourth guy is embry hair now shorn thin frame filled out laid back expression gone
it pains jacob to see him
i didnt recognize him
what happened to him
he missed some school then out of nowhere hes following sam around
same thing happened with paul and jared
they werent even friends now sam owns them
beat sam keeps giving me this look like hes waiting for me or something its kinda freaking me out
maybe you should just avoid them
i try but
she sees hes unnerved instinctively hugs him reassuringly
if it gets worse well go to my dad
or you can come stay with us
beat holding her if this is how youre going to react ill freak out more often
bella realizes she crossed a line and covers playfully shoving him
as they head to the truck bella looks back but now hes looking directly at her
then he turns and dives over the edge cutting a clean line into the water
bella carries her tray to an empty table but looks over at mike angela jessica and eric
bella takes a breath then casually joins them
they take note but keep talking
ill kill tyler if he gave me his flu
its going around
my sister was so sick she couldnt come on our hike this weekend
so she didnt see it
sotto ang maybe you should keep that to yourself we saw something eric
i believe you
no he doesnt
hes just trying to get lucky
suddenly hopeful is that an option
ignoring him it was jet black and huge on all fours it was still taller than a person
a bear maybe
or big foot
or an alien
lucky you didnt get probed
quietly we saw it
and a little scared
bella see that
youre not the only one
did bella just speak
my dads been getting reports at the sheriffs station
a couple hikers went missing
people are scared
now everyones chilled
i did hear some guy talking about it at the store
last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend
as they continue angela mouths thanks to bella
they share a smile and join in bella becoming part of the group
just inches apart
you look scared
pull back to see shes straddling the now completed motorcycle
jacob stands next to her holding the bike up
theres an intimacy to their proximity
the bike is aimed down a dirt road
jacob runs through the instructions brake
she taps it clutch
she squeezes it right
she grips it you ready
then kick starts the bike
release the clutch
the bike moves forward an inch jacob cautiously steps back
she moves forward another inch stop
bella turns to find the apparition of edward standing next to her
her hand slips off the clutch the bike bucks and falls on top of her
jacob quickly lifts it off her as the apparition of edward disappears
im going again
im not sure thats a good bella quickly rises and hops back on
guess were going again
now what are you going to do with the clutch
then kick starts the bike again
she releases the clutch and moves forward
slowly at first edward reappears at her side glowering
she keeps going a little faster
edward appears on her left now she passes him
he reappears ahead she passes
on bellas face as the wind flings her hair back
she gathers speed
and for a moment experiences pure freedom exhilaration
then she sees edward standing at the curve in the road ahead and realizes yelling to jacob i dont how do i turn
bank hit the brake
jacob races toward her
she reaches the turn doesnt bank goes straight
and flies right into a wall of trees
as she lies on the ground dazed jacob hurries up
what are you training for the x games
she looks around for edward
i want to go again
im revoking your motorcycle privileges
man look at your head
indeed blood drips down her forehead
he pulls off his shirt to mop it up
she shrinks away god im sorry
youre apologizing for bleeding
its just blood bella
he bends over her carefully tending her head
she finds herself looking at him
his dark eyes his bare chest and smooth skin
he glances at her
what are you staring at
just youre actually
hes surprised theres a moment between them
how hard did you hit your head
realizing oh i yeah
he offers her a hand helps her up
she holds onto it alarmed
jake youre hot
upgraded from good looking
no temperature hot
feels his forehead youre burning up
i feel fine
he takes her hand from his forehead
she tries to pull it away
i cant hold your hand
means something else to you than it does to me
one thats my problem
we have fun you think im hot good looking
i know you like me
more than anyone
because of cullen
the name stings her
he takes both her hands now
look i know what he did to you
i can see it in your face every time his name comes up
but you need to know i would never ever do that to you
i promise i will never hurt you
you can count on me
i already do
you dont know how much
youre my best friend but
i dont think my feelings will change
he takes this in its hard
a wave of something sweeps over him
he sits back
closes his eyes takes a breath
i shouldve said something right from the start no
thats not i just feel
i told you you have a fever
probably that flu everyone has
feel like flu
i dont know what it is
off jacob rattled and bella concerned
bella does homework
charlie watches a game
shes on edge
hear a beeeep hey jake
just checking to see how youre doing
and to say im sorry about you know
how i feel and
hope the flu passes fast
bella climbs out of her truck sees the empty spot where edward used to park
sees eric and angela canoodling
she puts her head down hurries to class
beeeep hi jake
your dad said you have mono
he wont let me visit but
would you call me
bella paces her room not wanting to sleep dream
she eyes the phone waiting for it to ring
beeeep me again
need to hear your voice
bellas on the phone leaving yet another message her desperation having reached its peak
in the living room charlie and harry check their fishing gear
she hangs up leans her forehead against the phone
charlie enters harry and i will be back by three he stops when he sees her
puts a hand on her shoulder
its mono bells
hes too sick to even call
you just gotta wait it out
then you know i dont have to go fishing
forcing a smile no go
ill call jess or someone
but stay here or at jesss
no hikes or anything
were issuing a warning about those bears
off bellas nod series of cuts bella tries to navigate her way to the meadow
she refers to a map a compass
i was more afraid of the hole in my chest than i was of bears
without jacob i needed edward more than ever
bella tries a trail it doesnt look familiar
i needed to know he existed
there was only one place i might find him or the feeling of him
flashpop the meadow edward and bella lie in the grass surrounded by flowers sunlight dappling them
they look lovingly into one anothers eyes
back on bella the memory and her desperation fuel her
finally she sees a clearing ahead hurries toward it bella steps into the clearing hopeful
but her face falls
in contrast to the warmth of her memory the meadow is cold gloomy cloudy
and no edward
she closes her eyes trying to force edward here
her eyes open on the empty overcast meadow
bella sinks to her knees
but then she hears a rustling noise
she turns toward it peers into the woods
another rustling noise comes from another part of the woods
she spins toward it nothing
then she turns and jumps when she finds vampire laurent standing just ten yards away
dreadlocks chiseled face
bella cant believe it
she beams realizing hes real
i must admit i didnt expect to find you here
i live here
but you i thought you were in alaska with carlisles friend
tanya i was
it was kind of him to arrange given my association with james and victoria the enemy
you tried to help us
laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her his eyes assessing her as i went to visit the cullens but their house is empty
im surprised they left you behind
werent you sort of a pet of theirs
bellas smile falters fear beginning to dawn on her
something like that
do the cullens visit often
suddenly edwards apparition appears between them
all the time
ill tell them you stopped by
edward fades throughout hell reappear when he speaks then fade again
bella tries to look relaxed
will they be able to reach you in alaska
i dont think so
tanyas vegetarian family was pleasant enough
but the dietary restrictions were difficult living on nothing but animals
suddenly hes standing inches from her
she now sees his eyes
dark blood red
conspiratorial tell me bella
do you ever feel compelled to
bella involuntarily takes a step away from him
but thats not why i left
i came back here as a favor to victoria
youre still friends
shrugs more or less
she asked me to get the lay of the land with the cullens
im afraid victoria is quite put out with you
she feels its only fair to kill edwards mate given he killed hers
eye for an eye mate for a mate
and now bella knows
terror overwhelms her
edward will know who did it
hell come after both of you
i dont think he will
after all how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected
then victoria sent me here for information
she wont be happy about my killing you
sincere no no no
dont be upset
im doing you a kindness
victoria plans on killing you slowly painfully whereas ill make it very quick
inhaling and you smell so
he faces her taking in her scent bloodlust building
her eyes dart around escape is impossible the only thing she sees is the apparition of edward looking at her with alarm
whispering barely audible edward
i love you
laurent is milliseconds from biting then abruptly his expression changes
he sees something in the forest behind bella and it terrifies him
dont believe it
he steps back
bellas confused as she realizes hes no longer focused on her
she follows his eyes slowly turning
to find behind her an enormous black wolf skulking out of the darkness of the woods
it stalks towards them a low disturbing growl in its throat sharp teeth gleaming
bella is trapped between the two killers
edward whispers in her ear dont
the wolf slinks closer to bella a mere twenty feet from where she stands then four more wolves soundlessly emerge from the trees flanking the black wolf
theyre the size of small horses all of different hues dark silver chocolate ash and russet brown
their hackles are up lips curling bodies crouched ready to spring
bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her
the russet brown wolf is the closest and looks directly at her
laurent continues to retreat then suddenly almost simultaneously laurent bolts across the meadow the wolves spring toward bella and leap right over her in pursuit of laurent
their thunderous snarls and snaps shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire surrounding him before he reaches the treeline laurent swings at the dark silver wolf smacking the
wolf half way across the meadow
another wolf lunges at laurent he kicks it and it sails into a tree splintering it
the two wolves recover lurch back to the pack which closes in on laurent
its impossible to know who will prevail bella doesnt stay to find out
she races into the woods bella runs franticly tearing down the hillside tripping quickly picking herself up running running bella dashes out of the treeline and to her truck parked
on the shoulder
she jumps in peals out bella bursts in out of breath
charlie and harry clearwater are washing their fishing gear
theyre not giant bears i saw them
up in a meadow damn it i told you not to go into the woods
what did you see bella
theyre wolves dad
we might note though they dont that harry clearwater sighs ever so slightly
five of them
the size of of cars
they went after something and i ran
charlie grabs up the phone as he dials harry can you get some men from the rez
ill just harry seems more concerned than gung ho as he slips out
into phone jerry
put a hunting party together tranq guns large caliber shotguns theres something dangerous out there
her eyes dart around the house their vulnerability spinning in on her
as charlie hangs up goes to his gun cabinet if she came after me charlie would try to protect me and hed die
ive gotta go to the station
you okay here
you want to come with
actually i need to see a friend
then knocks again
finally billy answers
i know jacobs sick but hes out with friends
taken aback oh
ill let him know you came by
billy starts to close the door but bella stops him
wait hes got mono right
thats what you told my dad
with compassion you should go on home bella
and he closes the door
off bella bella climbs in slams the door pissed
starts the truck
then turns it off
deciding she tosses the keys aside and sinks down into her seat to wait
rain now pours down
billy inside pulls the curtain back looks out at bella with sympathy
then closes the curtain
bella looks out the passenger window at billy
suddenly theres a knock at the drivers window
she spins to find jacob standing there
but his face is shockingly different
his hair is cropped short
no friendly smile
no warmth in his eyes
just a hard brooding resentment
bella is taken aback
she climbs out of the truck to find behind jacob stand sam uley jared paul and embry
theyre oblivious to the rain wear minimal clothes
you cut your hair
jacob turns away
sam leads the group toward the house
she and we note his sure footed strides his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight
she grabs his arm
what happened to you
he stops turns back
the others wait on the porch for him
theyre out of earshot but wont leave him alone with her
lowers her voice i can help
his face is hard as he shakes his head
hes not talking
sam got to you
what did he do
sams trying to help me dont blame him
bitterness seething how bout those filthy reeking bloodsuckers you love
dont know what youre you know exactly what im talking about
hes shaking almost convulsing with anger
the cullens are long gone
how are they to blame
they started all this by existing
goddamn leeches jacob
jacob glances at sam who gives him a look
jacob takes a breath trying to calm himself
i cant be friends with you anymore
jake i know i hurt you
i should have been more up front but i needed you i still do
i dont know what that means yet but if you give me time stop
its not you its not you its me
youre wrong it doesnt matter
this is over i cant take losing my best friend too
you already have dont say that you promised go home bella
dont come back
he practically runs away joining the gang who all disappear inside
off bella standing in the rain
bella enters dripping wet too listless to close the door
charlies face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness returned to her
he grabs a blanket wraps her in it
billy called said you and jacob had a fight
but hey you guys will work it out im sure of it
going to change
bella heads upstairs
charlie sags helpless
he moves to the open door it paces watching charlie slowly close the door
bella tears through the forest again searching
she turns finds edward cold distant
but his face begins to morph
and becomes jacobs
she reaches for him but he bolts backward suddenly many yards away
he too retreats further disappearing until bella is alone
blackness encroaches the moonlight becoming a tiny spotlight on her
she searches the dark then sees a pair of eyes female blood red coming toward her hear a loud bella tosses herself awake slowly realizing it was just a dream
but she hears the screeching noise again
fingernails on her window
bella bolts upright looks around for a weapon whisper shouting bella
ouch damn it open the window
bella cautiously moves to her window to find
jacob shirtless clings to the top of a tree which bends with his weight
bella opens the window whisper yelling what the hell are you doing
get out of the way
he begins to swing his legs increasing momentum
she realizes what hes about to attempt no
he launches himself through the window with great agility jacob lands on the balls of his feet
bella is stunned
he freezes listening for charlie
a bitter self satisfied grin spreads on his face
it pisses bella off
he takes in her room
i pictured your room more
why are you here
i had to talk to you
to kick me in the gut again
it was bad before but you made it so much worse
and i want to explain
he stays put
she tries to push him but hes immoveable
youre done with me remember
bella i literally cant explain
she becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular chest
the intimacy of their touch
she pulls away
i broke my promise not to hurt you i know
but im trying to keep it now
i need you to understand
even if you dont want to see me when you find out find what out
he starts to speak but cant
she sees hes in pain
i cant do it
yes you can
ill help you
we can leave
leave home leave sam
its not something i can run away from
then i would run with you though
if i could
beat realizing wait
wait i already i told you
you know this you can guess
i dont want to play games with you you have to
i cant tell you but if you remember it was that day i ran into you at the beach
i told you a story come on
i told you a story
the cold ones
you said it was a stupid tribal myth
pointedly was it
are the cold ones a myth
she doesnt answer
what else did i say
the tribe made a treaty with them
they cant come onto your land and
i dont know i dont remember
you have to give me more
tell me where to look
is there something i should see
no thats too dangerous ill take the risk
jacob show me
he looks at her doesnt want to but knows its the only way
where was the last place you saw me
the way i used to be
the motorcycles that clearing in the woods
he nods slowly then turns to go
she stops him
there are dangerous things out there more than you know
he looks at her with a wry smile
then pulls her into a hug
her cheek against his bare chest
she takes in the closeness
then he soundlessly heads out her door
a beat bella starts pulling on clothes
bella drives through the darkness
if i was going to lose someone else i needed to know why
she pulls off the road and drives into the forest
climbs out of her truck
the moon eerily illuminates the clearing
forest noises encroach
she hears a rustle amid the trees
spooked she freezes then sees jacob emerge from the trees
a moment as their eyes meet
then sam uley paul embry and jared step into the clearing as well half clothed movements almost synchronized
their expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see bella
paul spins on jacob
what the hell have you done
i didnt tell her
youd know if i did
shes here isnt she
bella theres nothing to see here
you should go home
not until i know what you did to jacob
advancing on bella what we did
jacob moves in front of bella protectively facing paul
both of you calm down sam she knows things about the bloodsuckers
shes been on the inside
she can help like a leech lovers gonna help us
watch what you call her
get a grip guys but paul and jacob are so angry their bodies begin to shake nearly convulse
it unnerves bella its alright jacob ill go paul and jacob are beyond hearing
all you care about is her commanding paul back off
and she doesnt give a crap about you jacob flashes anger pushes paul hard
paul flies backward
paul rises outraged throws his head back in a growl vibrating violently too late
bella get back
paul falls forward but halfway to the ground theres a loud ripping noise and paul explodes in silver gray fur becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring
bella horrified grabs jacobs arm pulling him run jacob
but he yanks away from her runs directly at the paul wolf jake no
jacob dives headfirst into the air with another sharp tearing sound shreds of cloth blast into the air fur bursts from jacobs skin he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet brown wolf charging the paul wolf
bella reels as the two wolves crash into each other snarling and ramming one another
the sound is deafening
their teeth flash at each others throats
bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves beyond the clearing and into the woods camera follows them as they fight deeper and deeper into the darkness
until they disappear
the horrible sounds of the fight still echo back in the clearing sam starts after them kicking off his shoes
take bella to emilys place
sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet
a long silence
guess the wolfs out of the bag
off bella stunned
bellas truck driven by embry pulls up to a tiny weathered house with a window box full of marigolds
jared in the back jumps out opens bellas door
he and embry head toward the house
she doesnt move
to jared pay up
she didnt puke
jared annoyed hands embry five bucks
told you she was tough
she does run with bloodsuckers
we should go back make sure jacobs okay
i hope paul gets some teeth in him
serve him right
jakes a natural
you see him phase on the fly
i gotta fiver says paul doesnt touch him
pauls been at it longer
bella looks at them appalled
they realize shes not following them
come on in
we wont bite
speak for yourself
bella warily climbs out of the car joins them
embry pauses at the door oh hey about emily sams fiance just try not to stare
it bugs sam
why would i stare
but the guys are already entering bella hesitantly enters behind jared and embry
she sees emily at a counter popping fresh muffins out of a tin
see only one side of emilys beautiful face draped by long black hair
you guys hungry
like i have to ask
emily looks toward them now revealing the other side of her face a scar runs from hairline to chin three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her
as jared and embry beeline for the muffins bella swan
so youre the vampire girl
and youre a
im just engaged to one
but these animals slaps embrys hand save some for your brothers
bella cautiously approaches the counter keeping an eye on the door for jacob
leave it to jacob to get around sams gag order
he didnt say anything or
thats a wolf thing
alphas orders get obeyed whether we want to or not how bout you shut up now embry
you know jacobs gonna fill her in
yeah i know every stupid thought he has
to bella wanna know what he thinks of you
like you need special powers to know that
to bella its another wolf thing
we hear each others thoughts
good for hunting
embarrassing for everything else
jared leans to bella challenging
freaking out yet
meets his look youre not the first mind reader ive met
grins jakes right
you are good with the weird
but i dont get how
because there are bad things here
she spins sam is now standing behind her the front door open behind him
and theyre getting worse
bella is chilled
sam moves past her to emily the sight of her instantly warms his face
he kisses emilys scarred face adoringly
bella has to look away
their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what she has lost
fortunately shes distracted by jacob and pauls arrival
they laugh and jab one another
bella is relieved to find jacob unscathed
jared and embry crowd them finding a scar on pauls arm ha
as jared reluctantly hands embry five bucks jacobs eyes find bellas
he nods solemnly to the door we should talk
the sun is just beginning to rise reddening the clouds overhead
bella paces by the cliffs edge trying to come to grips with this new reality
jacob keeps his distance trying to control his anger
you just have to
its not a life style choice
its in my dna
killing is in your dna
man i thought maybe you wouldnt be such a hypocrite what im not the right kind of monster for you
cant measure up to your bloodsucking friends angry as well hey they manage to survive without hurting innocent people
jacob stops a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion
you dont care that i morph into a giant dog
just that i
those hikers lives mean that little to you
he bursts out laughing
repelled turns to go oh my god
bella bella wait
he stops her were not killing hikers
were trying to protect them
the only thing we do kill vampires
stunned reels vampires
steps back bitter dont worry we cant touch your precious cullens unless they bite someone and violate the treaty thats not what i you cant fight vampires
theyre too dangerous
we took out that leech with the dreads easy enough
worried he didnt seem like a friend
no god no
its what we do why we exist
a few lucky guys in the tribe have the gene
if a bloodsucker moves to town our dna kicks in we reach the right age and the fever hits realizing mono
next thing i know theyre telling me this is your life now
that future you saw for yourself
desolation fills him
she sees this
its bad huh
i just hate feeling
out of control
like maybe sam is right you shouldnt be around me
like you could get rid of me
youve seen emily
that lands with her
sam lost it for a split second em was standing too close hes still messed up about it
beat i dont want to be that kind of nightmare
youre not like that
you save people right
you saved me from laurent
yeah didnt mind taking him out
his red headed girlfriend will be fun too
bella stops chilled to the bone
we chased her all the way to the border the other night
but she wont stay gone
keeps coming back if we knew what she was after
sees bellas face what
i know what she wants
a maserati with canadian plates blasts down the highway at a blinding speed close on victoria easily controlling the steering wheel with two fingers
she speaks to someone we dont see her words laced with longing and fury
james hated cars
he liked being close to the ground
but id steal one occasionally to throw him off the scent
see we played hide and seek sometimes
no one can hide like me grins to her passenger but no one could seek like james
include her barely conscious passenger denise s a pretty bleach blonde with expensive jewelry
shes just coming to a bump on her head where she was knocked out
what what are you
some games lasted months
but we always got hungry for each other
sly to denise so id let him find me
denise now lucid looks around to see in the back seat her husband michaels body well dressed in a turtle neck s sits upright his head tilted forward as if
denise reaches for him michael
oh my god we never could get enough of each other
seething we would have had forever to try
denise scared shakes michaels arm michael
which causes michaels head to roll to the side revealing his gouged blood soaked neck and his vacant dead eyes
denise starts screaming
james always loved a screamer
victorias hand jets out grabbing a fistful of denises hair
she yanks denise over exposing her neck just as we
if the redheads after bella weve got bait
with stunning speed jacob grabs a four pronged spading fork from some garden tools and flings it toward jareds head jared easily and amazingly catches it
she is not bait
include a picnic table in the middle of this small quaintly landscaped garden
jacob bella embry paul sam jared and emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast
i should leave town
victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her
no one can catch her
she can escape anything
she has special powers
some of them do
they all look at her
she instantly regrets saying it
the mind reader you said you knew
he was a suckhead
can they all do that
that would blow
no i shouldnt have no
shes still protecting them
i dont know why
its not like they stuck around to protect you guys back off
jacob looks apologetically at bella
she shrinks stung
jacob walks her to the door
dont worry weve got this place covered
she wont get near you or charlie
he sees shes blue
hey we should do something fun
cliff diving right
i could use the rush
after we catch her
he offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods
bella tentatively approaches the large modern glass home
she climbs the porch steps approaches the door
bella enters to find it perfectly intact lived in warm candles glowing
and the cullen family enjoying the evening carlisle esme rosalie emmett and jasper
bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them
but they ignore her
wont even look at her
she starts toward them but suddenly edward appears and yanks bella away pulling her to the door and pushing her out slamming it on her
bella runs to the window peers in at the family who continue to ignore her as they gather around edward bella awakens tears on her face
she cant take it
gets the hell out of bed anxious to leave the dream behind
but it stays with her
bella knocks on the door rain falling around her wind blowing strong
emily opens the door
are you okay
yeah i just
is jacob here
he wasnt at home
sam appears behind emily
hes with jared and embry keeping an eye on things
im heading out soon
should i tell him something
as sam wraps an arm around emily
their deep love is achingly obvious
off bellas face flashpop to bella and edward at her birthday party in a similar embrace as alice snaps their picture back on bella pained
you want to come in
but bellas already hurrying to her truck determination on her face
close on a rifle as it locks and loads
include charlie who checks it then notes the position of the six men in his hunting party all wearing rain gear
he sees harry at the end of the line pausing looking down
you got something harry
on harry he looks down at a large wolf paw print
the hunting party moves forward
harry lets them get ahead stomps out the paw print
on charlie as he passes under a huge tree whip pan up the tree to find that high above crouching on a limb is victoria
she watches charlie with a vengeful glare
she noiselessly swings down to a lower branch getting ready to pounce on charlie on harry his eye catches her movement he looks up sees the back of her red
head his breath catches she hears the sound even through the rain and wind
before harry can raise his shotgun victorias standing next to him whipping the gun out of his hands with superhuman speed
he gasps breath stuck in his chest
she grins about to bite but suddenly the russet brown jacob wolf smashes into her knocking her away
she rights herself immediately and takes off the three wolves give chase disappearing
it all happened soundlessly in seconds unbeknownst to the others
stay on harry he still cant catch his breath in slow motion he clasps his left arm intercut with lightning fast cuts of the chase the wolves are right on
victorias tail blasting through the forest back on charlie slow motion he turns to see harry clutching his chest
charlie runs to harrys side smash back to victoria escaping at breakneck speed she bursts out of the trees to victoria beelines for the choppy water dives in when she
reappears shes hundreds of yards offshore the wolves prowl the beach in frustration as we go
back on harry slow motion he falls to his knees just as charlie reaches him
off charlie beginning cpr
bellas truck comes to a stop she climbs out
ignoring the wind and rain she strides to the cliffs edge looks down bellas pov the water steely gray
bella smiles tears of relief springing to her eyes
she turns to find edwards apparition at her side
she steps back from the cliffs edge which causes him to disappear
she starts pulling off her shoes and coat adrenaline pumping edwards apparition reappears but she keeps going stop this now bella
you wont stay with me any other way
she takes a last look at him
then with a running leap flings herself over the edge on bella screaming with exhilaration as she plummets down down
then splashes into the water
no sign of bella
suddenly she pops back up
inhales deeply and laughs
she enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment
then turns to swim ashore
but her smile falters when she realizes how strong the current is
a wave crashes over her head
she gasps for breath
then another wave hits her
starts to pull her under
under the water bella struggles above water she pops up looks around in a panic sees bellas pov in the distance something orange ish bobbing on the surface of the
water bella goes down then comes up again the orange ish thing is suddenly thirty yards closer
bella struggles to stay afloat but the current smashes her into a rock the air goes out of her chest
angle on the orange ish thing its victoria floating effortlessly hungry anticipation on her face
she dips below the surface vanishing
under the water bella sinks struggling at first
edward appears in front of her his eyes full of longing and love
he reaches to her she to him hands almost touching things going dark
suddenly a hand grabs her collar close on bella barely conscious
jacob hits her on the back
she spits up water coming to
can you hear me
she focuses finally sees jacob hovering over her relieved
behind him stands sam
shell be alright
sam looks out at the water scanning it
what the hell were you thinking
the pearly gates
if we hadnt heard you scream get her home
im heading to the hospital
ill meet you there
sam jogs off
why would you jump
didnt you notice its like a hurricane out here
it was stupid realizing sam said hospital someones hurt
harry clearwater had a heart attack
oh my god does my dad know
he and my dad are both over there
will harry be okay
i dont know
ill find you something dry and drive you home
as jacob helps bella up we rack focus out to angle on the water where victoria bobs watching jacob guide bella away
then she disappears below the surface
bella wears a fleece jacket but still shivers
he pulls her close wrapping an arm around her hundred and eight degrees over here
she tucks herself into him
must be nice never getting cold
its a wolf thing
its a jacob thing
grins like the sun
meaning it like the sun
which always comes back
you can count on me
he fills it
there are other cool things about all this like i heal fast
wanna see me stab my hand
yeah cause that would be fun
the truck pulls up to the curb
its pitch black outside
jacobs still holding her close as he shuts the engine off
this wolf things not all bad
now that you know
comes so easily to me
more than the other guys
thats a good thing isnt it
or maybe it makes me less
human than the others
beat quieter sometimes im scared i might
disappear you know
who i really am
bella faces him looks directly in his eyes
i wont let that happen
their faces are close
and stay close for an intimate beat
they could kiss their lips near
but bella blinks herself back to reality and pulls away
thanks for driving for everything
as she pushes open her door
wind wafts in jacob reacts to a repugnant smell outside holy crap
he abruptly pulls bella back into the truck slams her door shut and starts the truck
theres a bloodsucker out there
how do you know
i can smell the stink
im getting you out of here
as jacob whips the truck around the headlights illuminate bellas pov the driveway a black mercedes is parked in front
bella spins to the rear window as jacob floors it stop
its not victoria forget it its carlisles car
its a trick hes still flooring it bella cracks her door open while theyre moving he slams on the brakes
she jumps out damn it bella bella hurries up the road toward her house
jacobs suddenly standing in front of her furious stop
you gotta come with me
theyre my friends dont you get it
if a cullen is back here this is their territory
the treaty says we can only defend our own lands
its not a war it is
and youll only be safe in la push
i cant protect you here anymore
i dont need you to youre about to cross a line only if you draw one
she starts to move past him but he stops her im not letting you do this
you dont have a choice
i dont belong to you
her words are a knife to the heart
she sees that but cant take them back
he hands her the keys
bye bella i hope you dont die
she flinches at the stinging remark
he disappears into the darkness leaving her alone on the dark road
shes closer to her house than her truck
she hurries forward
the night sounds start to encroach branches crackling bushes rustling
she glances behind her
nothing but darkness
she faces forward again and runs directly into a vampire
bella screams then realizes its alice
bella is stunned
so is alice
shes clearly confused but bella hugs her with tears of joy
oh my god alice
i heard voices i didnt think it was you but youre alive
you keep saying that
i saw you a vision of you you jumped off a cliff
i knew id be too late but becoming angry why the hell would you try to kill yourself
i was cliff diving
that was fun for you
until i hit the water
i have never met anyone more prone to life threatening idiocy
and what is that hideous wet dog smell
hes kind of a werewolf
off alices horrified expression
as bella makes herself hot chocolate alice paces
werewolves are not vicious
until they lose their tempers
they saved me from laurent theyre protecting me from victoria shocked victoria
i didnt see her
i didnt see you get pulled from the water either
it was jacob who saved me
more than once
i couldnt have made it without him
you have no idea what it was like
i knew leaving wouldnt be good for you
i tried to tell edward but he wouldnt listen
hesitantly does he know youre here
a dump empty but for a table and chair
on the table lie the photos that once lined bellas walls
edward stands in the center of the room stock still staring out at the rising sun
his face is as empty and desolate as bellas was after he left
a cell phone on the table rings jarringly
he doesnt move
finally he whips the receiver to his ear exasperated
wow edward finally answered the phone
i feel so honored
rosalie on the phone stands at the picture window rosalies pov ext
alaskan house emmett jasper carlisle and esme walk away from the house over the snow to the treeline on their way to hunt
none wear coats
im hanging up now
rosalie turns away from the window
you should come home
no response esmes a wreck carlisle never smiles
even emmetts depressed
youve really done a number on them
pained im sorry
but they wouldnt be happier with me around
i just miss
but the further away i am the safer bella will be
she deserves a shot at a normal life
but see you dont have to worry about that not anymore she stops realizing she may be making a mistake
but edward caught it sits up
did something happen
i uh tell me rosalie
rises fierce tell me
blurts alice had a vision
she saw bella throw herself off a cliff
shes dead edward
edward reels uncomprehending
dont believe it
alice is there now
thought she could help with the funeral or something
stay on rosalie as come home edward
shes been disconnected
off rosalie worried
bella walks charlie to his cruiser
he wears a dark ill fitting funeral suit
at the car bella adjusts his tie thanks for understanding bells
they wanted to keep the service small
dont worry about me
are you gonna be okay
but sue and those kids leahs only a year older than you
and seths what fourteen
she hugs him
he holds on a little too tightly for a beat
then he bucks up climbs into his car
therell be a reception after
i might stay late see if i can help
bella nods then waves as he drives away
she turns to head back inside but finds alice suddenly at her side
youre not going
im not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now
saddened because youre friends with me
alice hears something then looks down the road jacobs rabbit appears in the distance
didnt see them coming
didnt see him pull you out of the water maybe my visions are allergic to dogs
jogging off ill go do some hunting
angle on the rabbit as it pulls up
jacob drives embry in the passenger seat
bella approaches surprised to find quil in the back same short hair and hard look as the others
jacob climbs out
embry takes the drivers seat
shouldnt you be at the funeral
had to talk to you first
to the guys ill meet you there
but pull out
jacob follows bella into jacob enters behind bella
she turns to him
look jake im sorry i this place stinks to hell
she sees hes shut down cold
she shuts down as well
youre welcome to leave
in fact how many cullens are here and how long are they staying
snapping back just alice
and shell stay as long as she wants
are the rest coming back
not that im aware of
better go report to sam
jacob turns starts to leave
he looks back sees her anger turn to hurt
ive done it again
i keep breaking my promise not to hurt you
it doesnt have to be this way
he moves back to her looks into her eyes with sadness
yeah it does
am i gonna lose you this time jacob
he cant answer that but he presses his hand to her cheek
it was easier when we were both human wasnt it
they look at one another jacobs hand still on her face his eyes searching hers
slowly he starts to bend toward her lips
she doesnt pull away
she misses him too much needs him too badly
this time shell let it happen
a kiss is a centimeter away
suddenly the shrill ring of the phone makes them both jump
jacob the closest to it doesnt move his face just keeps looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone answers swan residence
but he instantly bristles voice going cold
hes not here
hes at a funeral
then the phone goes dead edward stares at his phone crazed enraged grief stricken he hurls it against the wall shattering it
jacob hangs up the phone
wait who was it
spitting it out dr
you should have let me talk to him
he didnt ask for you suddenly jacobs eyes go wild his body stiffens starts trembling in the way that precedes a wolf morph
step away from me bella
bella turns to see what hes reacting to alice
she stands in doorway looking empty despairing
bella immediately hurries to her side
alice whats wrong
what about him
i just saw him in a vision
thinks youre dead
realizing that was him calling not carlisle
bella hes going to italy
to the volturi
off bellas face flashpops of the circular hall the three volturi the dismembering of the rogue vampire the door slams open and bella races in shoving clothes into a bag
jacob dogs her protesting
why do you have to go
he wont believe alice
he has to see that im alive
stops her he left you bella
he didnt want you anymore remember
but i still love him and im not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt
this wounds him
but she cant stop to soothe him
she pulls away and continues packing
what about your dad
im eighteen legally free to go
ill leave a note
got the airline tickets
squaring off with alice you cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in italy dont
im well aware what the volturi are
then why are you taking bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party
right shes better off here with victoria stalking her
the one you dogs cant seem to catch
jacob growls a shudder ripping through him
bella intercedes stopping him from morphing by grabbing alice
alice flies to her car
but jacob catches bellas arm not hostile
bella sees the love in his eyes this could be last time she ever sees him
she hugs him then pulls away
he watches agonized as she races to the car climbs in
bella tries to pull on her seat belt but alice stops her maybe jacobs right
bella tries to interrupt no
you need to realize the volturi could easily see me as edwards accomplice
and youre a human who knows too much and tastes too good
they could kill us all
bellas response is to yank her seat belt into its clip
alice sees she wont change her mind
she shifts into gear and peels out
bella looks out the window for jacob hes not there
she turns toward the woods bellas pov the treeline shredded clothing flies in the air as we see the hind legs of a wolf disappear into the forest
off bella fighting tears but determined as hell
on edward walking down a seemingly endless corridor
finally he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors which open for him
he enters edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones on which sit the ancient volturi aro marcus caius
aro wears an expensive contemporary black italian suit long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist
marcus and caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes their long hair loose around them
all three have translucent onion like white skin
have you decided
it was an intriguing debate
we dont get many suicidal vampires
im afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy
but if youre unhappy with your lot join us
wed be delighted to utilize your skills
so you wont end this
not without cause
edward registers this his face setting
clearly hes going to give them cause
he strides out
such a waste
bella waits impatiently at the curb as a yellow hard top porsche with darkly tinted windows screeches to a halt in front of her
the passenger door opens alice is behind the wheel pulling off the chic white hooded coat she used for protection against the sun
as bella climbs in buckles up whered you get the car
hope youre not opposed to grand theft auto
alice floors it and the porsche peels out
aerial view the yellow porsche screams down a highway cutting lanes weaving through peugots and fiats bella grips the dashboard as alice narrowly misses a car
how much time do we have
hes waiting till noon when the suns at its highest
its jumpy uneven edward stands in shadow his shirt open eyes shut
a clock gongs as he steps into sunlight hes going to make the volturi change their minds
checking her watch its almost noon now
alice punches it as bella sees bellas pov a medieval fortified village atop a distant hill
the narrow centuries old streets are crowded with festival revellers who all wear red
they gaily head toward the town square carrying red pendants balloons scarves
the porsche weaves through them hurrying forward
why are they all wearing red
san marcos day festival
the perfect setting
the volturi wont let him get far enough to reveal himself hes counting on that
we only have five minutes alice screeches to a halt at a road block
italian police wave her back
bella jumps out wheres the square
follow that lane bellas already running hell be under the clock tower
alice watches her go
then senses something looks up overcoat leaps from building to building tracking bella
as he disappears off alice bella races down the cobble stoned alleys stumbling on the uneven stones
festival revellers head in the same direction she maneuvers around them
above bella see flashes of the figure in the overcoat as bella nears the square the alleys become more populated
she pushes past people ad libbing excuse me sorry
finally she emerges into bellas pov a sea of scarlet flags dresses and jackets
on the other side of the crowded square the clock tower it reads one minute before noon
bella battles her way through the square the crowd shoves back shouting at her in italian fare attenzione
bella charges forward to find herself blocked by a fountain suddenly gong
the clock tower bells chime
bella jumps into the fountain wades through the shallow water to the other side she jumps out and barrels through the crowd
finally she sees edward in the shadows just inches from the sunlight
bellas cry is drowned out by the booming chime
she pushes toward him fighting to reach him as close on edward in slow motion as he unbuttons his shirt exposing his bare chest on bella in slow motion calling
his name on edwards face he closes his eyes welcoming death then slowly edward takes a step into the sunlight the rays hitting his shoe but before the sun touches his skin bella slams into him its like running into a brick wall no edward
edward opens his eyes and looks at bella as the clock booms its final chime
hes amazed already dead in his mind
carlisle was right
no im here
look at me
alice was wrong
he begins to realize
she is real
please step back
im alive im he suddenly kisses her stepping back into the shade with her
they soak each other in like starved people suddenly nourished
he pulls away to look at her
they share a long look hes about to kiss her again
when suddenly he stiffens and abruptly pushes bella behind him taking a protective stance in front of her they face the dark alley that runs under the clock tower
out of the alleys shadows emerge two figures in hooded overcoats
both stunningly handsome males in their s felix huge strong and demetri slender elegant
both have unsettling burgundy red eyes
i wont be needing your services after all gentlemen
aro wants to speak with you again
no rules were broken
demetris smile suggests he doesnt agree
hes the more gracious of the two
but no less dangerous
we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue
bella why dont you stay and enjoy the festival
the girl comes with us
thats not going to happen
alice suddenly appears lightly tripping through the alley toward them pulling back the hood of her white swing coat
come on guys its a festival
she reaches edward and bella positioning herself in a protective stance as well
we wouldnt want to make a scene
there wont be any scene
and well still win
but not easily enough
a very tiny young woman appears jane
she also wears a dark overcoat her botticelli angel like face peering out from under the hood
see her crimson irises
felix and demetri are back off immediately
edward and alice step back as well
bella can see theyre afraid of this small girl
nodding to her jane
sotto to alice who is she
sotto to bella just do as she says
jane tosses edward an overcoat
he dons it
jane simply turns and heads up the alley confident theyll follow
felix smirking gestures for them to go ahead of him
edward takes bellas hand
jane leads edward bella and alice through several narrow dark alleys
felix and demetri bring up the rear
edward never loosens his grip on bellas hand
their path dead ends at a wall of brick
jane just strides forward and without breaking pace drops down into an open hole in the street its a drain
alice follows jane
bella looks down sees nothing but blackness
alice will catch you
edward takes her wrists dangles her over the hole on bella as she drops through the darkness to be caught by alice
edward lands beside them then felix and demetri
edward pulls bella close as they follow jane through the sewer
he meets bellas eyes trying to look reassuring but hes tense as hell
finally they reach a folding iron elevator door
jane easily pulls it aside
they all enter
as the door clangs shut on them close on modern elevator doors opening
they all exit into an elegantly decorated space with old world charm
theyre greeted politely by gianna an attractive human receptionist
they head through the lobby to the long corridor that edward traversed earlier
finally they reach the carved double doors which open bella edward and alice enter to face the three ancients aro marcus caius
eight volturi guards including jane felix demetri line the walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats
bellas pov the floor theres a depression in the center that leads to a drain
aro rises greets them like old friends taking edwards hand and shaking it what a happy surprise
bella is alive after all
isnt that wonderful
caius responds with a sour expression
marcus could care less
aro doesnt release edwards hand looks at him as her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty
how can you stand to be so close to her
its not without effort
laughing i can see that
off bellas look edward explains one touch and aro can see every thought ive ever had in my life
youre quite the telepath yourself edward
you cant read bellas thoughts
he releases edwards hand and turns to bella
i would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts as well
he reaches for bellas hand
she hesitates does she have a choice
aro laughs at her reluctance further extends his hand
bella finally takes it
a beat as he holds her hand
confusion sweeping over him
he releases her moves back to his chair deep in thought
i wonder if reading aros thoughts no
lets see if shes immune to all our powers shall we jane
jane turns toward bella but edward springs in front of her jane instead focuses her gaze on edward which flings him across the room where he collapses writhing in agony
jane concentrates on him with a small smile enjoying his pain
bella and alice rush to his side
as soon as jane looks away edwards pain ceases
janes gaze now turns toward bella who cringes awaiting the pain
but nothing happens
janes grin is replaced by anger
aro laughs like a child with a new toy
jane infuriated moves toward bella but aro stops her with a tiny gesture
she confounds us all
so what do we do with you now
seemingly bored you already know what youll do aro
she knows too much shes a liability
unless edward intends to give her immortality
looks at edward but thats not your intention is it
he nods to felix who moves toward bella but he only takes a step before edward tackles him
alice leaps to help but several volturi guard hold her back which is no easy job
as she struggles mightily edward is david to felixs goliath
edward will lose but hell go down fighting
edward is fast anticipating felixs moves before he makes them but felix is stronger felix grabs edward throws him into the ceiling smashing against the marble he drops like a
is then immediately kicked across the room
to aro stop this
but aro ignores her leans forward to study edward
jane is itching to step in
aro gestures her back
felix takes some hits but then lifts edward overhead cracking him like a nut then flinging him against a wall bella runs toward aro but a volturi guard flings her
away she flies hard against the wall
the guard is then occupied by the thrashing alice bella bruised but not broken makes another attempt to get to aro finally reaches him kneels in front of him do
just leave them alone
as she yanks her collar back exposing her neck to him
aro is surprised and intrigued
felix immediately releases edward who manages to look up
he sees bella kneeling in front of aro
get away from her
edward moves toward aro but is quickly immediately pinned by janes invisible powers he writhes in agony
alice can no longer bear edwards suffering
ive already seen it
through gritted teeth alice stay out of it
i know what to do
aro intrigued gestures for jane to stop edward goes limp
ah yes the clairvoyant
i saw your gift in edwards thoughts
what is it youve seen
im the one who will change bella
bella is taken aback by this
aro is surprised as well
beat then gestures please
be my guest
her father is in law enforcement
if she goes missing there will be questions
he is easily dealt with
it will happen aro
see for yourself
she thrusts out her hand
aro nods to the guards who release her
she gives him her hand
he closes his eyes edward hunts a deer
matching his pace is another vampire bella
shes pale and beautiful she and edward smile at each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill
back on aro utterly delighted
he releases alices hand
to see the things youve seen that havent happened yet
alice moves to edwards side helps him up
im so sorry
to bella your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal
go make your preparations
bella hurries to edwards side too
caius is put out
youre letting them leave
dear caius the girls disappearance will be conspicuous at best
and surely you see her potential
dispassionately let us be done with this
heidi will arrive any moment
aro gestures demetri throws open the carved double doors
caius glares at them threateningly
we will make sure she follows through
i would not delay
we do not offer second chances
edward recovered now takes bella by the arm and with alice they cautiously back toward the door demetri leads bella edward and alice out of the hall
as they make their way up the corridor they see coming toward them a group of two dozen tourists led by a beautiful vampire heidi
edward alice and bella stop to let them all pass
as heidi passes demetri he gives her a flirtatious smile
sotto nice fishing heidi save some for me
she gives bella a curious once over then continues on
to the group this way please
a husband and wife s cameras around their necks pass bella
the husband winks at bella unusual tour isnt it
bill get a picture of that bust there
as the tourists file past we hear a variety of languages german japanese english
the group is moved toward the carved double doors which swing open for them
they file into the marble hall edward pulls bella forward but she cranes her neck back as the last of the tourists disappear inside
as the large doors close
we begin to hear screaming edward and alice rush bella out push in on bellas tormented face as the screaming gets louder
and louder on bellas sleeping face as the screaming crescendos bella sits bolt upright yelling stop
she catches her breath disoriented confused
then she turns to find edward lying beside her looking at her
wasnt a dream
go back to sleep
youve been through a lot
no you might ill be here when you wake up
beat she looks at him wary
out of guilt
think i asked the volturi to kill me because i felt guilty
i went to them because i thought id lost you
you didnt even want me
now edward takes her by the shoulders
the only reason i left was to protect you
i wanted you to have a chance at a normal happy life
but it was so easy for you to leave
i had to be convincing
in my hundred years ive never had a harder time than what i just went through
shes beginning to believe him
i kept seeing you
visions of you
always protecting me
i thought i was going crazy
your own instincts were speaking to you
i wish it had been me
but youre the heroic one
you saved me
he moves to kiss her
but abruptly stops
suddenly her door swings open she spins toward it as the lights flip on and charlie enters
edward is gone
you dont have to worry
last time you said that you disappeared
you want to talk nightmares
sincere im really sorry dad
dont ever do that to me again
off her nod and youre grounded for the rest of your life
get some rest so i can keep lecturing you in the morning
he kisses her forehead
she turns to find edward sitting on the bed
he wont forgive me easily
i dont deserve it but
i hope you will
because i honestly have no idea how to live without you
bella melts in his eyes
he kisses her
you wont be able to get rid of me once alice changes me
she wont have to
there are ways to keep the volturi in the dark
pulling away theyll come after your whole family
youd risk that just to keep me human
you really dont understand what youd be giving up
i really do
they look at each other an impasse
she decides something grabs her jeans pulls them on youre not the only one with a say in it
you all know what edward wants
and you know what i want
but i wont force myself on you
include the entire cullen family who surround bella
the house has been restored to its original warmth and beauty
edward sits off to the side as bella addresses them
i think the only fair way to handle this is by vote you cant be serious firmly this is my meeting edward
edward frustrated sits back
she faces the family again
however this turns out im not letting the volturi hurt you
ill go back to italy alone
the hell you will
im not missing another fight
thats not up for a vote emmett
i dont want you involved
weve always been involved honey and were not going to stop no please i want you to seriously think about this
if i join you youll be stuck with me for a long time forever
its a huge decision
and i want i need your honesty here
they nod or otherwise communicate agreement
then lets take a vote
alice jumps up and hugs bella
like youre not already my sister
of course yes
jasper rises but keeps his distance
i vote yes
itll be a relief not to want to kill you
rosalie torn looks at edward whos stony toward her
edward im sorry for what i did
i really am
and i know youre not ready to forgive me
to bella but this isnt the life id have chosen for myself
i wish thered been someone to vote no for me
she exchanges a glance with carlisle then
bella takes it stoically
emmett bounds over and lifts bella into a bear hug
i vote hell yeah
we can pick a fight with these volturi some other way
esme approaches and embraces bella warmly
i already think of you as part of the family
thank you esme
carlisle moves not to bella but to edward you cant go along with this carlisle you know what it means
youve chosen not to live without her which leaves me no choice
i wont lose my son
turns to bella but alice has never turned anyone
itd be safer if i did it the front door suddenly slams
bella blanches but turns to the family
thank you all
pov from afar on a hilltop reveal its victoria watching the house down below
off her seething fury a ferrari has pulled over to the side of the road
victoria peers in the window
the driver a middle aged man smiles where you headed
a slow grin sounds perfect
as she climbs in
edward drives bella home
he is somber
she is resigned
just two months
itll be best for dad that way
i can pretend to be at college somewhere
carlisle suggested it
quiet emotional i wish youd be the one to change me
beat would you be willing to trade for that
hopeful name it
five more years as a human
the volturi wont wait that long
ill settle for three
sadly shakes her head i wont risk it
itll have to be carlisle
he takes her hand
why are you so willing to give up your soul
because i dont believe youve lost yours
and i want to share mine with you forever
he looks to her kisses her hand
then suddenly edward slams on the brakes someone stands in the road directly in front of them its jacob
he glares then turns and walks into the woods
what is he doing
he wants to talk to me
well he can talk to me first
she pushes out of the car edward and bella tramp through the woods to find jacob leaning against a tree
his expression is hard
youre still alive
ive been calling you
couldnt drop by
he thinks im keeping you away
spinning on him stay the hell out of my head
dad grounded me jake
were trying to get back before he wakes up
jacob doesnt buy it
bella is frustrated
but edward takes a step toward jacob
jacob i know you have something to say to me but id like to say something first
jacob leans back against the tree arms folded waiting
sincere thank you
for keeping bella alive when i
no you didnt
and it wasnt for your benefit trust me
im still grateful
then but im back now
and im not leaving bellas side till she orders me away
she looks at him
he returns the look
jacob sees the devotion between them
it wounds him
but he masks it
either way well handle victoria from here on out
shes been laying low
ever since your freaky sister showed up
guess she cant stand you cullens either
shell come back
she does shes ours
she killed on our turf
my turn to talk
im here to remind you about a key point in the treaty
reads his thoughts nods i havent forgotten
what key point
if any of them bites a human the truce is over
thats bite not kill
if i choose it its none of your business
jacob is horrified starting to shake with rage
i wont let you bella step back youre not gonna be one of them
thats not your call even more intense you know what well do to you i wont have a choice were done here edward takes bellas arm starts to pull her
jacob lunges trying to extract bella from him you dont speak for her
edward pushes jacob away he flies back ten feet in the air but mid air he phases into a wolf
the jacob wolf lands on all fours spinning to face edward in an attack stance
edward shifts stance as well readying for a fight stop
edward and jacob circle one another seconds from lunging to bella get out of here
but bella races between them forceful insistent
to both of them you do this youll be going through me
a long tense beat none of them backing down it could go either way i swear to god im not moving
both rivals see shes dead serious
edward backs off ever so slightly
the jacob wolf does the same
turning to edward give me a second
edward shakes his head
doesnt move an inch
read his thoughts
is he going to hurt me
edward does and finally reluctantly backs away
but his eyes never leave the wolfs
they glare at one another
bella carefully approaches the jacob wolf blocking his line of sight
her voice is kind pleading
jacob i love you
youre my best friend
i cant change how i feel
please dont make me choose
quietly emotionally because itll be him
its always been him
anguish sweeps through the wolfs fierce face
its even harder to take than when hes in human form but you know how important you are to suddenly the wolf bolts out of there
on bella fighting tears as she watches him disappear
there were problems ahead
edwards arms wrap around her from behind
if i didnt become a vampire the volturi would kill me
if i did my best friend would do the job himself or get killed in the attempt
she turns to face edward looking into his loving eyes
victoria was still on the loose putting everyone i loved in danger
he kisses her tenderly washing away her concerns
but id already survived the worst losing edward
so i knew i could survive anything
and she sees thats the truth believes it
he takes her hand and together they turn heading out of the woods
and soon id be like him
wed face our fate together
off them hand in hand inseparable
as we begin to hear the agonized howl of a wolf in the far distance
