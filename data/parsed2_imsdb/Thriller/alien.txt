alien early draft by dan obannon project formerly titled story by dan obannon ronald shusett screenplay by dan obannon en route back to earth from a far part of the
galaxy the crew of the starship snark intercepts a transmission in an alien language originating from a nearby storm shrouded planet
mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe they decide to land and investigate
their search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open it is dead and abandoned
inside they find among other strange things the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers
certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid the only remnant of a vanished civilization
beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb full of fantastic artifacts
lying dormant in the tomb are centuries old spores which are triggered into life by the mens presence
a parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the mens faces and cannot be removed
an examination by the ships medical computer reveals that the creature has inserted a tube down his throat which is depositing something inside him
then it is discovered that the parasites blood is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal they dare not kill it on the ship
ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship and they blast off from the hell planet
however before they can seal themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home a horrible little monster emerges from the victims body it has been growing in him deposited
there by the parasite
and now it is loose on the ship
a series of ghastly adventures follow
they trap it in an air shaft and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower it tears a mans head off and runs away with his
body a man is crushed in the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific windstorm another man is burned to death and then eaten by the creature and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the aliens bizarre life cycle
finally there is only one man left alive alone on the ship with the creature and only six hours till his air runs out which leads to a climax of
horrifying explosive jeopardy the outcome of which determines who will reach earth alive man or alien
a leader and a politician
believes that any action is better than no action
cautious but intelligent a survivor
adventurer brash glory hound
tech intellectual a romantic
high strung came along to make his fortune
the crew is unisex and all parts are interchangeable for men or women
extreme closeups of flickering instrument panels
readouts and digital displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future
wherever we are it seems to be chill dark and sterile
electronic machinery chuckles softly to itself
abruptly we hear a beeping signal and the machinery begins to awaken
circuits close lights blink on
camera angles gradually widen revealing more and more of the machinery banks of panels fluttering gauges until we reveal a stainless steel room with no windows the walls packed with
the lights are dim and the air is frigid
occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal freezer compartments looking for all the world like meat lockers
with explosions of escaping gas the lids on the freezers pop open
slowly groggily six nude men sit up
am i cold
is that you roby
i feel like shit
yeah its you all right
now they are yawning stretching and shivering
i must be alive i feel dead
you look dead
the vampires rise from their graves
this draws a few woozy chuckles
shakes his fist in the air triumphantly we made it
not fully awake is it over
its over hunter
yawning boy thats terrific
looking around with a grin well how does it feel to be rich men
this draws a laugh
lets get our pants on and get to our posts
the men begin to swing out of the freezers
somebody get the cat
roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer
this is a fantastic circular room jammed with instrumentation
there are no windows but above head level the room is ringed by viewscreens all blank for the moment
there are seats for four men
each chair faces a console and is surrounded by a dazzling array of technology
standard roby broussard and melkonis are entering and finding their seats
im going to buy a cattle ranch
putting down the cat cattle ranch
im not kidding
you can get one if you have the credit
look just like real cows too
all right tycoons lets stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand
fire up all systems
they begin to throw switches lighting up their consoles
the control room starts to come to life
all around the room colored lights flicker and chase each other across glowing screens
the room fills with the hum and chatter of machinery
sandy you want to give us some vision
feast your eyes
melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches
the strip of viewscreens flickers into life
on each screen we see blackness speckled with stars
after a pause wheres irth
sandy scan the whole sky
melkonis hits buttons
on the screens the images all begin to pan
camera moves in on one of the screens with its moving image of a starfield
close shot of a panning tv camera
this camera is remote controlled turning silently on its base
camera begins to pull back revealing that the tv camera is mounted on the hull of some kind of craft
when the pullback is finished we see the full length of the starship snark hanging in the depths of interstellar space against a background of glimmering stars
where are we
sandy contact traffic control
melkonis switches on his radio unit
this is deep space commercial vessel snark registration number e calling antarctica air traffic control
do you read me
there is only the hiss of static
staring at a screen i dont recognize that constellation
dell plot our location
broussard goes into action punching buttons lighting up all his instruments
i got it
where the hell are we
just short of zeta ii reticuli
we havent even reached the outer rim yet
what the hell
standard picks up a microphone
this is chaz speaking
sorry but we are not home
our present location seems to be only halfway to irth
remain at your posts and stand by
that is all
chaz ive got something here on my security alert
a high priority from the computer
lets hear it
punches buttons computer you have signalled a priority three message
what is the message
a mechanical voice i have interrupted the course of the voyage
why i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise
computer this is captain standard
what conditions are you talking about
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin
a voice transmission
the men exchange glances
i have recorded the transmission
play it for us please
over the speakers we hear a hum a crackle static
the bizarre voice speaks a long sentence then falls silent
the men all stare at each other in amazement
computer what language was that
what do you mean
it is none of the dialects spoken by technological man
there is a pause then everybody starts talking at the same time
silencing them just hold it hold it glares around the room computer have you attempted to analyze the transmission
there are two points of salient interest
number one it is highly systematized indicating intelligent origin
number two certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate
oh my god
well its finally happened
sandy can you home in on that beam
whats the frequency
computer whats the frequency of the transmission
melkonis punches buttons
ive got it
its coming from ascension minutes seconds declination degrees seconds
dell show me that on a screen
ill give it to you on number four
broussard punches buttons
one of the viewscreens flickers and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen
let me straighten it out
he twists a knob moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center
can you get it a little closer
thats what im going to do
he hits a button
the screen flashes and a planet appears
point eight six
we can walk on it
martin get the others up to the lounge
the entire crew standard roby broussard melkonis hunter and faust are all seated around a table with standard at the head
if its an s
were morally obligated to investigate
i dont know
seems to me we came on this trip to make some credit not to go off on some kind of side trip
excited forget the credit what we have here is a chance to be the first men to contact a nonhuman intelligence if there is some kind of alien intelligence down
on that planetoid itd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped
hell were equipped hell no
we dont know whats down there on that piece of rock
it might be dangerous
what we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities
and let them deal with it
except it will take years to get a reply back
dont forget how far we are from the colonies martin
there are no commercial lanes out here
face it were out of range
men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe
this is an opportunity which may never come again
look youre overruled martin
gentlemen lets go
the men are strapping in but this time it is with grim determination
dell i want greater magnification
more surface detail
i want to see what this place looks like
ill see what i can do
he jabs his controls
the image on the screen zooms down toward the planet but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze
its out of focus
no thats atmosphere
my god its stormy for a piece of rock that size
just a second
punches buttons those arent water vapor clouds they have no moisture content
put ship in atmospheric mode
the great dish antenna on the snark folds down against the main body of the ship and other parts flatten out until the ship has assumed an aerodynamic form
dell set a course and bring us in on that beam
the snarks engines cough into life and send it drifting toward the distant dot that is the planetoid
camera approaches the planetoid until it looms large on screen
it is turbulent completely enveloped in dun colored clouds
the snark drops down toward the surface
activate lifter quads
vertical drop checked
on tangential course now orbiting
brief pause as he studies his instruments crossing the terminator
entering night side
beneath the orbiting snark nights curtain rolls across the planet
descending at an angle the snark drops down into the thick atmosphere of the planetoid
turn on navigation lights
hydroplaning down through the pea soup atmosphere a set of brilliant lights switches on cutting through the dust but hardly improving visibility
approaching point of origin
closing at kilometers and slowing
gentlemen we are directly above the source of the transmission
whats the terrain down there
well line of sight is impossible due to dust
radar gives me noise
sonar gives me noise
lets try ultraviolet
its totally flat
is it solid
then take her down
fifteen kilometers and dropping
eight and slowing
one kilometer and slowing
lock tractor beams
there is a loud electrical hum and the ship shudders
kill drive engines
the engines fall silent
nine hundred meters and dropping
hang on gentlemen
the night shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust
the snark hovers above it on glowing beams of light dropping down slowly
landing struts unfold like insect legs
the ship touches down heavily it rocks on huge shock absorbers
the whole ship vibrates violently for an instant then all the panels in the room flash simultaneously and the lights go out
the lights come back on again
what the hell happened
hits a switch engine room what happened
over filtered just a minute hold it im checking
has the hull been breached
scans his gauges no i dont see anything
weve still got pressure
there is a beep from the communicator
then over filtered martin this is jay
the intakes are clogged with dust
we overheated and burned out a whole cell
strikes his panel damn it
how long to fix
into microphone how long to fix
over filtered hard to say
well get started
over filtered right
talk to you
lets take a look outside
turn the screens back on
melkonis hits buttons
the screens flicker but remain black
cant see a blessed thing
only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute darkness around it
kick on the floods
a ring of floodlights on the ship come to life pouring blinding light out into the night
they illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and clouds of blowing dust
the wind shrieks
not much help
standard stares at the dark screens
well we cant go anywhere in this darkness
how long till dawn
consults his instruments well
this rock rotates every two hours
the sun should be coming up in about minutes
maybe well be able to see something then
or something will be able to see us
they all look at him
the floodlights on the snark fight a losing battle against the darkness and the storm
main theme music begins extremely ominous
gradually the screen begins to lighten as the sun rises
the silhouette of the snark becomes visible like some strange insect crouching motionless on the barren plain
the floods shut off
dense clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan obscuring everything and reducing the sunlight to a dull orange
close on a screen it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange dust
pull back from screen
the men standard roby broussard and melkonis are sitting and standing around the room drinking coffee and staring at the screens which reveal only the billowing dust
there could be a whole city out there and wed never see it
not sitting on our butts in here thats for sure
just settle down
sandy you get any response yet
pulls off his earphones sorry
nothing but that same damn transmission every seconds
ive tried every frequency on the spectrum
are we just going to sit around and wait for an invitation
roby gives broussard a black look then stabs a button on his console and speaks into the mike
into mike hello faust
over filtered yeah
hows it coming on the engines
faust is seated at an electronic workbench brightly lit speaking into a wall intercom
i never saw anything as fine as this dust
these cells are all pitted on a microscopic level
i have to polish these things smooth again so its going to take a while
puts down the mike sandy
how far are we from the source of the transmission
source of transmission is to the northeast
close enough to walk to
martin would you run me an atmospheric
punches buttons and consults his panels argon nitrogen neon
and some trace elements
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter
dry as a bone
not a one
yeah rock particles
well we wont need pressure suits but breathing masks are called for
sandy can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source
i volunteer for the exploration party
i heard you
you want to break out the side arms
standard broussard and melkonis enter the lock
they all wear gloves boots jackets and pistols
broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut sealing them into the lock
they all pull on rubber full head oxygen masks
adjusting the radio on his mask im sending
do you hear me
now just remember keep away from those weapons unless i say otherwise
martin do you read me
read you chaz
open the outer door
ponderously the outer lock door slides open
orange sunlight streams into the lock and clouds of dust swirl in
we hear the moaning of the a mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway and clunks as it hits the ground
standard walks out into the storm followed by the others
the three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet
their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock
the men huddle together looking around
the wind screams and tugs at their clothes
nothing can be seen
which way sandy
melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction finder
pointing that way
melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds followed closely by the others
were on our way
roby is the sole occupant of the bridge
he is huddled over his console smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a screen
okay chaz i hear you
ive got you on my board
over filtered good
im getting you clear too
lets just keep the line open
the three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and shrieking wind
with their rubbery masks and deliberate movements they look like deep sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean
melkonis leads the column following the compass on the direction finder
cant see more than three meters in any direction out here
were walking blind on instruments
they wade on following melkonis
abruptly he halts
my signals fading
he studies the direction finder
roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios
over filtered its the dust its interfering
his concentration is so great that he does not notice hunter coming up over filtered hold it ive got it again
its over that way
standing directly behind roby hunter speaks
startled out of his wits roby gasps and whirls around to face hunter
startled silly hell
hunter stares at roby whose momentary terror dissolves into embarrassed anger
the three men push their way through the storm
melkonis stops again studies the direction finder
its close real close
we should be almost on top of it
i just cant quite
suddenly broussard grabs standards arm and points
the others stare in the direction he is pointing
through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out some kind of huge shape
as we watch the dust clears slightly revealing a grotesque ship rising from the ship like some gigantic toadstool
it is clearly of non human manufacture
they are struck dumb by the sight of the craft
finally standard finds his voice
martin uh weve found it
sharply over filtered found what
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft
were going to approach it
they start toward the alien ship
over filtered there are no signs of life
roby and hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration
over filtered were uh approaching the base
a strangely shaped door yawns open at the base of the ship
dust and sand have blown in filling the lower part of the entrance
with great caution the men approach the entrance and group around it
appears to be a door hanging open the entrance is clogged with debris
looks like a derelict
martin were going in
im going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on
the doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness spewing dust
in the darkness of the chamber are huge formless shapes
standard broussard and melkonis appear silhouetted against the doorway
they switch on flashlight like devices called datasticks and step in
carefully peering around they pick their way past the indistinct machinery
lets try and find the control room
as they move their lights around they can see that the walls ceiling and machinery are full of huge irregular holes
look at these holes
this place looks like swiss cheese
broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling
this hole goes up several decks looks like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here
they all peer up the hole into darkness
standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it
he aims it up into the hole and fires
the graplon is launched up into darkness trailing a thin wire
there is a dull clunk and the wire dangles
ill go first
no youll follow me
standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest and presses a button
with a mechanical whine he is pulled up into the hole using his feet for leverage where he can
broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit
this chamber is totally dark as broussard arrives at the top of the hole
standard stands with his flashlight camera datastick tracing a beam through the hanging dust
broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire then raises his own light
at that moment melkonis arrives at the top of the hole
their lights scan the room
the beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust
they reveal heavy odd shapes
broussard stumbles over something
he shines his light down on it
it is a large glossy urn brown in color with peculiar markings
broussard stands it upright
it has a round opening in the top and is empty
suddenly melkonis lets out a grunt of shock
their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque a huge alien skeleton they approach the skeleton their lights trained on it
it is a holy christ
standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated
he moves his light closer and peers at the panel
look at this
something has been scratched here
into the veneer
traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel as by the point of a sharp instrument is a small triangle hearing something broussard flashes his light across the room
as the beam scans the walls it briefly touches on something that moves
melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol
standard knocks his hand down
keep away from that gun
standard shoulders himself in front of the others
then slowly he begins to move toward the far side of the room
they approach a console on the wall training their lights on it
there is a machine
on the machine a small bar moves steadily back and forth sliding noiselessly in its grooves
melkonis looks down at his direction finder
thats where the transmission is coming from
he throws a switch on the direction finder with a crackle and a hum the unearthly voice fills their earphones
a damned automatic recording
sinister angle on the snark
as we watch the sunlight turns the color of blood and then the sun is down leaving murky blackness in its wake
the ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life feebly combatting the darkness and the storm
the entire crew is seated around the conference table watching holographic pictures projected onto a screen
these are photos taken by their datasticks flashlight cameras
standard is commenting on the changing slides
this is the control room
two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession showing the suited men standing against banks of machinery
some details of the control room
the skeleton appears on the screen
the men react with mutters
this is the skeleton
another view of the skeleton
the transmitting device
the triangle that was cut into the aliens console appears
this is a closeup of the triangle we found scrawled on the console in front of the skeleton
standard changes the slide
the screen goes white
and thats it
he turns off the projector and brings the lights up
weve got to go back and take a lot more pictures holograph everything and bring back as much physical evidence as possible too
the rest of the skeleton
some of the machinery
written records if there are any
roby is slumped in his chair
he has said nothing
this is the single most important discovery in history
what killed it
hell that things been dead for years
maybe hundreds of years
the whole planets dead
the way i figure it they landed here for repairs or something then they couldnt take off again
maybe the dust ruined their engines
they set up an s
beacon but nobody came
so they died
not they he they all turn to look in the direction of robys nod
camera moves there was only one skeleton
there is a moment of silence
hows it coming on the repairs
im going to have to blow the engines out
and when will you be ready to do that
oh im not near ready yet
then why the hell are you sitting around here
the men rise and begin to disperse but roby remains seated deep in thought staring at the skull
melkonis lingers in the room with him
and there sits mans first contact with intelligent life in the universe
angle on the ship its spotlights cutting into the gloom
a room throbbing with power enormous pulsing engines capable of releasing unimaginable energies
faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the engines with spotlights on it
he is wearing goggles and thin gloves
you ready up there
broussard and melkonis are seated at their consoles conversing with faust while they watch their instruments
sure were ready
im going to start the extraction procedure now
he pauses to wipe his brow
roby is alone in the room slumped into a chair watching the photographic slides on the screen
he is clicking slowly through them
he stops on an angle of the skeleton and stares at it
the aliens misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him
he picks it up holds it up to the screen for comparison and studies it
standard appears in the doorway
alas poor yorick
roby starts puts down the skull
standard sits at the table
nodding at the screen find anything we missed
shrugs i dont even know what im looking for
you know me
ive always respected your opinion martin
if something worries you it worries me
roby reaches over and changes the slide to the one of the crudely what would you say that was supposed to mean
its obviously intentional
some kind of attempt at communication
maybe its a symbol that means something to them
but why draw it on the wall
roby switches off the projector sits up and rubs his face wearily
he rises and goes to the coffee machine
picking a hair out of the coffeepot this ship is full of cat hair
tell you what martin
as soon as the engines fixed beep
the communicator interrupts standard
he leans across and presses the button
this is chaz
over filtered chaz this is dell
can you come topside for a minute
over filtered well the sun just came up again and it seems the winds died down
its as clear as a bell outside
theres something i think you ought to see
im on my way
he and roby head for the door
broussard is alone in the control room when standard and roby arrive
what is it
take a look
the dust no longer blows
the day is crisp clear and silent
i was scanning the horizon to see what i could pick up
look there on that screen
what is it i cant blip
broussard enlarges the image
the screen now shows a tapering stone pyramid on the horizon
they all stare at the image for a long moment
the silhouette of the pyramid is instantly suggestive of the scrawled triangle in the alien ship
standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille
this is chaz
all hands topside
angle on a viewscreen
it shows the pyramid on the horizon
camera pulls back to reveal all the men sitting and standing around the room
doesnt seem much doubt about it does there
that creature sure must have considered it important
using his last strength to draw it
maybe they built it
a marker for buried instrumentation
or a mass grave
maybe the rest of the crew is in there in some kind of suspended animation waiting to be rescued
it wasnt necessarily built by them
on the screens a puff of dust blows in front of the pyramid
here comes the dust again
with a shriek the dust storm returns completely obscuring the snark
well does anyone else agree with martin that we should not explore it
everyone looks around the room but no one volunteers
then the sooner we get moving the better
long shot of the stone pyramid dust blowing in front of it
it is a crumbling ancient edifice made of eroded grey stones windowless tapering toward the top
standard broussard and melkonis wearing the protective suits approach the pyramid
as they draw near it becomes clear that the pyramid is roughly feet tall
we cant make out any details or features yet
but its definitely too regular for a natural formation
roby and hunter are present
they are listening to standards voice on over filtered theres one thing i can say for sure though
standards voice is drowned out by static
now whats wrong
ive completely lost their signal
can you get them back
the three men come to the base of the massive structure
dust and sand have piled thickly around the crumbling grey stones that form the base
this looks ancient
cant tell these weather conditions could erode anything fast
they walk around the base
theres no entrance
maybe the entrance is buried
could be under our feet
maybe there is no entrance the thing may be solid
well there ought to be some way we can get through to them the intercom beeps
fausts voice is heard
over filtered sorry to interrupt but im gonna charge up the engines for a minute okay
a loud powerful throbbing begins drowning out all other sounds as the engines are tested
a light on robys panel is flashing
we can see that it is the irritably roby throws the switch
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor hold it i cant hear a damn thing
he puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computers voice over
there is a pause while roby listens to the computer
his eyes widen
youve translated it
another pause as he listens to the earphone
well come on come on
what does it say
robys face changes he looks chilled to the bone
his mouth works
abruptly the engines shut off leaving a ringing silence
looking over at roby what
what was that
the computer just translated the goddamn message
its not an s
it was a warning
maybe we can get in by the top
you want to try
broussard takes out the graplon gun and fires the hook up toward the top of the pyramid
he clips himself to the wire
you guys just wait down here till i say its okay to come up
broussard turns on the climbing device and begins to walk up the side of the pyramid
ominous angles showing broussard climbing the pyramid the dust blowing the wind shrieking
the peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair
broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged crumbling stones
theres a hole at the top
can we come up
over filtered no its too small only room enough for one person
can you see anything in the hole
broussard leans over and looks into the hole
he sees only blackness
freeing one arm he unclips his datastick from his belt switches on the flashlight function and shines it down into the hole
i can see
it just goes down like a stovepipe
i cant see the bottom light wont reach
faust comes trotting up the steps a questioning look on his face
what is it
jay weve got a problem
i was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability
quickly why whats wrong
the computers translated the alien signal and its kind of alarming
what do you mean
it couldnt translate the whole thing only three phrases
ill just read it to you the way i got it reads from a strip of paper looks up at the others and thats all it could translate
hanging from the lip of the hole broussard is unclipping gear from his belt
over filtered dell you want to come down we can figure out where to go from here
no i want to go in
standard and melkonis exchange a glance
okay dell but just for a preliminary look around
dont unhook yourself from your cable
and be out in less than ten minutes
broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole
he unspools a couple feet of wire from the device and attaches the end of it to his chest unit
he climbs over the lip and drops into the hole
he is now hanging by the wire with his head and shoulders out of the hole
okay im in the mouth of the chimney now and im starting down
over filtered take care
broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the hole
bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the depths
the beam penetrates only thirty feet or so then is lost in darkness
its noticeably warmer in here
warm air rising from below
he starts down paying out the line and moving down in short hops pushing off each time with his feet
he stops to catch his breath
his breathing rasps loudly in his helmet
a little sunlight filters down from above
looking up he can see the mouth of the hole a glowing spot of light
standards voice comes over his earphones
over filtered are you okay in there
gasping for breath yeah im okay
havent hit bottom yet
definitely a column of warm air rising it keeps the shaft clear of dust
over filtered what was that dell i lost you do you read me
yeah but this is hard work
cant talk now
he kicks off and continues down taking longer and longer hops as he gains confidence
pausing for a moment to regain his breath he shines the light on his instruments
im way below ground level
whatd he say
i couldnt make it out too much interference
roby and hunter
im getting nowhere
the whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission
i think we should go after them
what do you mean no
were not going anywhere
but they dont know about the translation
they could be in danger right now
we cant spare the personnel
weve got minimum takeoff capability right now
thats why chaz left us on board
why you chickenshit bastard just can that crap
im in command here till chaz returns
and nobodys leaving this ship
broussard resumes his downward climb
suddenly his feet lose their the tunnel has reached its end
below him is an unfathomable cavernous space
huffing and puffing tunnels gone cave or something below me feels like the tropics in here air is warm and humid
consults his instruments high oxygen content no dust its completely breathable puffing with exertion he releases his purchase on the stone walls and begins to lower himself on power
now he is dangling free in darkness spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds
finally his feet hit bottom
he grunts in surprise and almost loses his balance
broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor with a feeble column of sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above
around is solid darkness
he flashes his datastick around
the beam reveals that he is in a stone room
strange heiroglyphics are carved into the walls
they have a primitive religious appearance
row after row of pictograms stretch from floor to ceiling some epic history in an unknown language
huge religious symbols dominate one wall
spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues depicting grotesque monsters half anthropoid half octopus
its like some kind of tomb
some primitive religion
hey is anybody there
do you read me
annoyed broussard yanks off his breathing goggles and leaves them hanging around his neck
he takes a deep breath of the wet air
standard and melkonis are standing around nervously
if we dont hear from him soon i think we better go in after him
sun will be down in a minute
face bare broussard approaches the center of the room which is dominated by a large broad pedestal
on the pedestal are rows of he walks around the urns studying them
they all have sealed lids
he shines his light on one of them then he lays his gloved hand on it
he lifts his mask radio to his lips
i dont know if you can hear me but the place is full of large bottles or jars just like the one we found on the other ship except these
are all sealed
also theyre soft to the touch
he peers more closely at the leathery object
another funny thing i just put my hand on it and now there are these raised areas appearing where my fingertips were
the sun drops below the horizon throwing the landscape into gloom
standard and melkonis switch on their lights
he attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up
broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the wall
they depict stylized drawings of strange monsters
he pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick then he turns back to the urn he was examining but now there is a hole in he shines
his light on the floor at the base of the urn
there lies the lid the stopper that had filled the hole
he picks it up and studies it
it appears more organic than artificial the inside surface is spongy and irregular
then he turns the light to the now open urn
he bends over the mouth of the urn shining the light in and with with a muffled scream he launches himself backward tearing at the thing with his hands
the dust blows and howls as standard and melkonis arrive at the top lights bobbing in the darkness
puffing with exertion heres his line
we can haul him out of there if we have to
itll yank him right off his feet if hes not expecting it
the line could get tangled in something
but what can we do
hes out of radio contact
maybe we should just wait a few more minutes
standard hesitates clinging to the lip of the hole
making up his mind no i told him to be out in ten minutes
its been much longer
lets get him out of there
standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel
he begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which broussards line dangles
the lines slack
christ do you think the idiot unhooked himself
he switches on the winch motor
with a whine it begins to reel the line in
after a moment the line tightens with a jerk and the motor slows down laboring under the added weight
there it caught
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something
no its coming
can you see anything
standard shines his light down into the hole
no i cant see far enough
the lines moving though
for a moment the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid saving their strength while the line reels in and the wind howls
then standard shines his light back down in
i can see him
here he comes
the winch begins to labor heavily
get ready to grab him
broussard appears at the top of the pit dangling limply from the wire
standard reaches for him then recoils sharply
look out theres something on his face melkonis attempts to come to his aid
what is it dont touch him watch it in their panic and confusion the men teeter momentarily finally regain their balance
they shine their lights on broussard
he appears to be completely unconscious and the octopus thing is oh god oh god no
help me im going to try to get it off
with his gloved hands standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to pull it from broussards head
it wont come its stuck
what is it
how the hell should i know
come on give me a hand lets get him out of there
the two men grapple with broussards limp body lifting him from the hole
roby and hunter are sitting moodily silent
there is a long moment while nothing is said then ive got em
theyre back on my screens
leaps to his feet how many
theyre coming this way
roby grabs a microphone
into mike hey can you guys hear me
over filtered yeah we hear you
were coming back
we lost you
listen theres been a new development over filtered cant talk now broussards injured
well need some help getting him into the ship
roby collapses into a chair suddenly limp with apprehension
hes feared something like this all along and now it has begun to happen
to himself oh no
into intercom jay this is cleave
meet me at the main air lock
hunter dashes from the room
roby remains where he is seated at his console
he is stunned his mind racing
camera moves in on his face
hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock door
he presses the wall intercom
into intercom martin im by the inner lock door
ill wait here for you to let them in
strangely quiet right
faust comes running up covered with grime
what the hells going on
dont know broussard got hurt somehow
dont know maybe well be real lucky and he just broke his neck
a beat i knew we shouldnt of come down here
roby is seated alone in the room listening to the transmission from standard and melkonis
over filtered martin are you there
roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone
over filtered were coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz what happened to broussard
over filtered its some kind of organism its attached itself to him
let us in
roby does not reply
over filtered you hear me martin
open the outer door
chaz if its an organism and we let it in the ship will be infected
over filtered we cant leave him out here open the door
urgently chaz listen to me weve broken every rule of quarantine
if we bring an organism on board we wont have a single layer of defense left
over filtered martin this is an order
open the door
hating it roby leans forward and throws the switch
a red light goes on on a console on the wall
the whine of a large servo is heard followed by a solid metallic clunk
outer doors open
after a moment they hear the motor sound again followed by another clunk
the outer door has closed again
the red light goes off
the inner door slides open and standard and melkonis stagger through carrying the sagging body of broussard
a cloud of choking dust follows them out of the lock
pulling off his mask you men stay clear theres a parasite on him
hunter and faust recoil
oh god oh is it alive
i dont know but dont touch it
give us a hand here lets get him up to the autodoc
hunter and faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden
one of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room carrying broussard
revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery
the principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall
help me come on lets get him up here
they slide the man onto the bunk
that thing god almighty didnt you try to get it off him
it wouldnt come
standard yanks off his gloves
they pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall and pull them on
gingerly they approach broussard
standard places his hands on the octopus thing that is slowly pulsing on broussards face
he grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free
its really on there tight
here let me try
faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack and carefully grasps the tip of one of the tentacles
squeezing tightly he leans back with all his weight
grabbing fausts hands stop it youre tearing his face
a trickle of blood begins to ooze down broussards cheek
its not coming off not without his whole face coming off too
lets let the machine work on him
efficiently they strip broussard naked then standard presses a couple of switches on the wall
the machine lights up and broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall
he is visible inside
the machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light
a bank of video monitors pops on revealing x ray images of different parts of his body
sensors begin to scan relays chatter
standard turns and looks at him
for a long moment the two men regard each other then standard steps forward and slaps roby across the the others are shocked
hey now what is this
slowly puts his hand to his cheek i understand why you did that
he wouldnt open the lock he was going to leave us out there
well maybe he should have
i mean you brought the goddamn thing in here
maybe you deserve to get slapped
embarrassed excuse me ive got work to do
i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i dont like hitting
to standard i guess i had it coming
lets call it settled
after a hard stare at roby standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery
slowly would somebody fill me in
he went into the pyramid alone
we lost radio contact with him
when we pulled him out it was on his face
it wont come off not without injuring him
where did it come from
hes the only one that knows that
how does he breathe
they study the monitors
bloods thoroughly oxygenated
yeah but how
his nose and mouth are blocked
lets look inside his head
standard punches some buttons and on the monitors a kind of x ray image in vivid colors appears depicting broussards head and upper the parasite is clearly visible on broussards
in x ray the creature is a maze of complicated biology
but the shocking thing is that in x ray we can see that broussards jaws are forced wide open and the parasite has extruded some kind of long tube which
is stuffed into his mouth and down his throat ending near his stomach
look at that
what is it i cant tell anything its some kind of organ its inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
turning sick oh
hunter bends over and retches
i think thats how its getting oxygen to him
it doesnt make any sense
it paralyzes him
puts him into a coma
then keeps him alive
we cant expect to understand a life form like this
were out of our back yard
things are different here
well cant we kill it
i mean we cant leave the damn thing on him
we dont know what might happen if we tried to kill it
at least right now its keeping him alive
how about cutting it off
we cant pull it loose but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer where its stuck to his face
we cant stand here and do nothing
standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head
then he pulls back on his bulky gloves
finally he presses a switch and broussard slides back out of the booth
muffled in his mask somebody give me a scalpel
melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall and carefully passes it to standard
clumsily because of the gloves standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it
then he flicks a little button with his thumb
the scalpel begins to hum
standard advances on the parasite
the others draw back nervously
roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack and holds it inconspicuously at his side
standard bends over the parasite
carefully he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles where it curves toward the back of broussards head
effortlessly the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue
immediately a urine like fluid begins to flow from the wound
muffled ive made an incision
its not reacting
but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound
the noxious looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to broussards head
instantly it starts to hiss and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain
muffled hold it this stuffs smoking
the others react nervously
by now the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below
the metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle and more smoke rises
the men start to cough
god that smokes poisonous
pointing its eating a hole in the floor
abruptly the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside coughing their lungs out
standard who is masked remains
frantically he attempts to put a bandage on the wound but the fluid instantly melts the bandage and in the process some of the stuff gets on standards gloves
they begin to smoke
frantically standard leaps back pulling off the smouldering gloves
then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask
that stuffs eating right through the metal
its going to eat through the decks and right out through the hull
by this time standard has started to run for the stairs
followed by the others standard frantically clangs down the stairs to the level below
a droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling
it oozes down and drips to the floor
it bubbles on the floor
jesus what can we put under it
standard and hunter charge down the stairs to the level below
standard and hunter move cautiously down the corridor looking up at the ceiling
should be coming through about there
careful dont get under it
roby and melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid sizzles
christ that stinks
roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the floor
seems to have stopped penetrating
hunter comes charging up the steps
whats happening up here
i think its fizzled out
hunter approaches and looks
roby straightens up starts to put the pen back in his pocket then changes his mind and stands holding it by the end
i never saw anything like that in my life
except molecular acid
but this thing uses it for blood hell of a defense mechanism
you dont dare kill it
standard comes up the stairs
yes thank heaven
were just plain lucky
that could have gone right through the hull taken weeks to patch it
reminded me of when i was a kid and the roof leaked everybody running for the pots and pans
my god what about broussard
they turn and run up the stairs
they all come into the room roby carrying the partially melted pen
broussard is still motionless on the bunk with the thing on his face
did it get on him
standard approaches and peers at broussards head
no thank god
just missed him
is it still dripping
examining it it appears to have healed itself
it makes me sick to see him like that
isnt there some way we can get it off him
i dont see how
but lets do what we can for him
standard presses a button and broussard slides back into the diagnostic coffin
he presses more buttons and the displays light up again showing different parts of broussards body
i think wed better get some intravenous feeding started
god knows what that thing is leaching out of him
standard operates some controls and the machine begins to invade broussards body sliding needles into him
studying the screens look there whats that stain on his lungs
the x ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of broussards chest
in the center the stain is completely opaque
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort
it blocks the x rays
that tube must be depositing it in him
could be some kind of venom or poison
this is horrible
what about the film
broussard had film in his datastick didnt he
we can see what happened to him
again we are watching slides in the darkened room
this time standard roby melkonis and hunter are watching the sequence of photographs taken automatically by broussards datastick as he probed the tomb
the camera reveals the urns
the climax of the sequence of stills comes when the creature leaps out of the urn toward the camera and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and
proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs
then the reel ends
that must have been when he got it
the same thing mustve happened to the creatures on the other ship
except they took one of those jars on board and opened it there
clicks back through the slides to a picture of one of the urns at first i thought they were jars too or artifacts anyway
but theyre not
theyre eggs or spore casings
lets go back to the heiroglyphics
clicketyclicketyclick melkonis accelerates through the slides in a blur stopping at the one he wants which shows a strip of heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb
i personally cant make any sense out of it
melkonis is changing the slides as they talk showing different angles on the glyphs
its a crude symbolic language looks primitive
you cant tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits
that sounds a little fanciful
primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment and this can be used as a starting point for translation
what common objects
listen hadnt somebody better check on broussard
rising ill do it
the rest of you continue
rising ill come with you
standard and hunter come down the passageway
you know its fantastic the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form and now we run into a veritable zoo
what do you mean
well those things out there arent the same you know the spaceship and the pyramid
theyre from different cultures and different races
that ship just landed here crashed like we did
the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid
maybe it wasnt always dead
they arrive at the infirmary
the door slides open and they step into the room
hunter activates the bed and it slides out of the wall
they rush to broussards prone form
the parasite is gone from his broussard is still unconscious but he is breathing
his face is now were in for it
the door was closed
it must still be in here
they immediately grow very tense
hunter starts edging toward the door
standard grabs his arm
no dont open the door
we dont want it escaping
very nervous well what the hell good can we do in here
we cant grab it it might jump on us maybe we can catch it
standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid
as long as were careful not to damage it
tray in one hand lid in the other standard begins moving slowly around the room
there are very few places to hide
he bends down and peers under the bunk
as he is down on his hands and knees we see one tentacle of the he rises and his shoulder brushes the tentacle
the parasite drops to leaping back shit
but the thing is not moving
it lies motionless on the floor its tentacles curled up
its color has faded to a dead looking grey
without taking his eyes off the thing standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall
he prods the thing it does not respond
i think its dead
with great care he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray
then he quickly closes the lid
standard roby and melkonis have the parasite spread eagled on a stainless steel table with a bright light on it
it is belly side up
wearing gloves standard probes at the thing with an instrument
look at these suckers no wonder we couldnt get it off him
is that its mouth
more likely that organ the tube like thing fits up in there
with a pair of needle nosed pliers standard fishes in the fleshy aperture
carefully he extracts the end of the tube organ
suddenly it starts to fall apart in the pliers
quick its decomposing gimme something to grab it with
it begins to smoke and bubble
roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at standard who throws down the pliers snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs
it is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor
lets get it out of here
carrying the thing he heads for the door
the men run down the passageways standard carrying the dripping thing in the tongs
it leaves little smoking droplets on the floor
they come running up to the airlock
roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open
by the time standard is in the lock roby is already on the intercom shouts into intercom for chrissake open the main lock
roby stumbles in as the inner door closes and with a heavy whine the thick surface door rumbles open
orange sunlight billows in followed by the inevitable dust
standard hurls the carcass out tongs and all
the parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust smouldering and fuming
the outer door rolls shut
slumping against the wall my god its lethal even when its dead
melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn holes in the floor
standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor
there he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination
over intercom filtered yes
over filtered hes running a fever
over filtered yes
can you do anything for him
over filtered the machine will bring his temperature down
his vital functions are strong
he switches off the intercom
suddenly exhausted i need some coffee
he turns and walks away
the cat is strolling around as roby and melkonis drop into seats standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine
these day and night cycles are totally disorienting
i feel like weve been here for days but its only been how long
stroking the cat about four hours
staring into his coffee cup im sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place martin
we never should have landed here
look im not trying to rub anybodys nose in anything
the important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible
i cant lean on faust any harder hes been working non stop on the engines
if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship we do know that
they never made it off the planet
the parasites won
this brings a chilly silence
where did the parasites come from
they seem native to the planet
its got an atmosphere and a dense gravity
its dead now but once it must have been fertile
its just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites
if there were a native ecology it would have to be microscopic
couldnt the pyramid have been built here by space travellers
its a pre technological construction
that slab was engineered by an iron age culture at best
theyre from a dead civilization theyre spores from a tomb
god knows how long theyve been here
i think we better take another look at those heiroglyphs
suddenly the door opens and faust sticks his head in
he is covered with dirt and grime
hey guess what
the engines are fixed
the snarks engines cough and then with a roar begin to belch out streams of superheated air cutting through the tulgy dust
the ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast capable of unlimited power
they are all at their posts
switch on tractor beams
there is a hair tingling electrical hum which permeates the whole ship and it begins to float like a cork in water
lock tractor beams
the pitch of the hum changes and the ship levels itself
retract landing struts
the ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force
the landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship
take us up
into intercom up one kilometer jay
the snark begins to levitate up into the sky on the beams of light
switch on lifter quads
the hovering snark begins to accelerate through the choking atmosphere
engage artificial gravity
roby throws a switch and the ship lurches
lets take her into an escape orbit
the men get busy with switches
im altering our vector now should give us an easy escape velocity in concert what was that
in answer the communicator beeps
over filtered this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again
just hold us together till were in space thats all
the pitch of the engines changes deepens
the snark swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds
visibility is zero
faust is pulling on a gasmask because the engine chamber is beginning to fill with dust
he turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to suck up some of the dust
on the screens nothing but clouds
then another tremor shudders through the ship
the men no longer speak their expressions are grim set and sweating they are watching their instruments
periodically they mutter technical instructions to each other
abruptly the ship clears the top of the cloud layer and bursts out into star sprinkled space trailing a wake of dust behind it
they all cheer
pounds his panel we made it
damn we made it
you bet we made it
martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
with great pleasure
roby begins to punch buttons
i feel like an escapee from hell
the ships speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the universe all around
there is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching the ship to appear blue and the receding ones to be red
this is redshift made visible because of their incredible velocity
they are unstrapping
thats the part that always makes me feel like im gonna puke when we accelerate into light speed
quit complaining were in space
they rise and head out of the room
as they walk along
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is
itll arrest the progress of his disease and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies
well have to go into quarantine maybe for quite a while
thats okay he can remain in hypersleep until theyre ready to treat him
they enter the infirmary
as they enter the room they are shocked to see broussard sitting up in bed awake
hoarsely mouths so dry
can i have some water
instantly roby brings him a plastic cup of water
broussard gulps it down in a swallow
roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to broussard who greedily consumes the entire thing
then he sags panting on the bunk
softly how do you feel dell
what happened to me
dont you remember
dont remember nothing
cant hardly remember my name
are you in pain
not exactly just feel like somebodys been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years
melkonis laughs at this remark
broussard smiles faintly at him
hell youre in great shape youve got your sense of humor back
god im hungry
dell whats the last thing you can remember
i dont know
do you remember the pyramid
just some horrible dreams about smothering
where are we
were going home
were in hyperspace
were going into the freezers now
im really starving can we get some food before we go into the freezers
laughs i think thats a pretty reasonable request
the entire crew is seated around the table eating huge portions greedily
the cat eats from a dish on the table
boy do i feel a lot better
its a straight shot back to the colonies and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt
any bets on the top bid
chewing well we should at least be able to each buy our own planet
they all chuckle
im going to write a book about this expedition
im going to call it the snark log
stiffly the commander normally has first publication rights
maybe we could write it together
first thing im going to do when we get back is eat some biological food
whats the matter you dont like this stuff
tastes like something youd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs
oh its okay
ive had better cag than this but ive had worse too if you know what i mean
i kind of like it
you like this shit
it grows on you
you know what they make this stuff out of
annoyed yes i know what they make it out of so what
its food now
youre eating it
i didnt say it was bad for you its just kind of sickening thats all
do we have to talk about this kind of crap at the dinner table
suddenly unexpectedly broussard grimaces and groans
his voice straining i dont know
im getting these the others stare at him in alarm
another groan is torn from his lips
he clutches the edge of the table with his hands his knuckles whitening
screaming what dell what broussards face is screwed up into a mask of agony and he is trembling violently from head to foot
incoherent shriek ohmygooaaaa everybody screams and leaps back from the table
the cat spits and bolts
the disgusting little head lunges comes spurting out of broussards chest trailing a thick wormlike tail splattering fluids and blood lands in the middle of the dishes and food on
the table and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground
when they finally regain control of themselves it has escaped
broussard lies slumped in his chair a huge hole in his chest spouting blood
the dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime
what was that
what the christ was that
it was growing in him the whole time and he didnt even know it
slowly they gather around broussards gutted corpse
that thing used him for an incubator
a hatch slides open on the side of the ship and broussards wrapped body tumbles silently out
an electronic bass drum beats a dirge as broussard drifts into eternity
the entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge
we cant go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose
wed be sitting ducks in the freezers
but we cant kill it
if we kill it it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space
well have to catch it and eject it from the ship
sighs well i kind of hate to point it out but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation
and as you know we used up most of that time in harvesting
weve got about a week left right
and then we run out of food and oxygen
the water will still recycle
we wont need it then
all right so thats what weve got
its plenty of time
but if we havent caught it in a week then we have to go into the freezers anyway
they enter the bridge
so does anybody have any suggestions
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship
that would kill it
no we cant afford to lose that much oxygen
were going to have to flush it out
room by room corridor by corridor
no one likes this thought
and what do we do when we find it
well have to trap it somehow
if we had a really strong piece of net we could bag it
we could cut a section out of that metallite netting
it wont hold up to that acid but aside from that its pretty strong
we have to avoid injuring it
what we really need is some electric animal prods
i think i could cobble something together
a long metal rod with a battery in it
give it a hell of a shock
get on it
but first im issuing a standing order from this moment forth every one of us will wear protective garments including helmets
lets get down to the locker and change
they start for the exit
the snark continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace
standard is walking purposefully along the corridor alone
he is garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot policeman including clear plastic helmet
he reaches a corner and turns
but this new passageway has a different gravity orientation standard seems to be walking down a vertical wall
he makes yet another disorienting turn and now he is walking upside down
he reaches a set of steps and climbs up them or rather down them
melkonis is seated in the dome upside down peering down into space
he also wears the protective suit
standard upside down climbs into the dome
it is dark and eerie here under the stars of interstellar space
a few glowing panels provide the only illumination
i thought id find you here
i was thinking of a line from an old poem water water everywhere but not a drop to drink
all that space out there and were trapped in this ship
thats the one about the albatross right
we cant even radio for help the carrier wave wouldnt reach its destination till long after wed died and turned to dust
we are utterly absolutely alone
can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances
halfway across creation
we came out there well go back
a long time by the clock but a short time to us
time and space have no meaning out here
were living in einsteinian equation
i can see youre putting your spare time to good use
leans forward and taps him on the knee let me tell you something you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough theyll be peeling you off a wall
ive seen it happen
smiles at him were the new pioneers chaz
we even have our own special diseases
come on lets go above and see how theyre coming with the gear
the whole crew has assembled
faust is unfolding several yards of shimmering metallic netting
hunter hands out five thin rods like metal broom handles
these have portable generators in them
theyre insulated down to here just be careful not to touch the end
he demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal object
a blue spark leaps
might even incinerate the damn thing
sharply i hope not
dont worry it wont damage it itll just give it a little incentive
how do we locate the creature
he picks up a small portable unit
you set it to search for a moving object
it hasnt got much range but when you get within a certain distance it starts beeping
standard takes the device and studies it
these will be very useful
at least we wont have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands
all right heres the battle plan were going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship
whoever finds it first catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock
standard shoots him a vicious look then continues for starters lets make sure the bridge is safe
faust takes the device and turns it on
he scans it around the room
all right roby and melkonis will go with faust
hunter and i will make up the second team
they start doling out the equipment
well all carry communicators
we want to keep in constant touch
melkonis and roby carry the net while faust walks directly behind it carrying the tracking device
he continually scans it from side to side
we can move pretty fast as long as theres nothing on the tracker
standard and hunter move silently along
standard is forced to serve a double function carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well
robys team is moving at a fairly brisk pace when hold it
fausts tracker is beeping and a small light flashes
ive got something
immediately they grow very tense and start looking around
wheres it coming from
peers closely at tracker and frowns machines screwed up i cant tell
needles spinning all over the dial
is it malfunctioning
faust turns the tracker on its side and the needle stabilizes
no just confused
its coming from below us
they all look down at their feet
roby melkonis and faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs into a drab functional section of the ship
the corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling
the effect is ugly and confining
they stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position spreading the net across the corridor
looking at tracker and nodding down the passageway that way
they begin to walk down the passageway footsteps clanging on the raw metal flooring
it is extremely dark
what happened to the lights
bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace em
they switch on the helmet lights
they all stop quickly almost stumbling
whispering its within meters
roby and melkonis heft the net each keeping his prod in hand
faust prod in one hand and tracker in the other has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal
he moves with great care in a half crouch ready to leap back at any second prod extended constantly glancing at the tracker
the tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall
behind his plastic mask sweat is pouring down fausts face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door
he raises the prod grasps the door handle yanks it open and jams the electric prod inside
instinctively they throw the net over it but very annoyed oh hold it
they open the net and release the creature
it is the cat
hissing and spitting it scampers away
were making fools of ourselves
robys communicator beeps
into communicator yes
over filtered weve got it up here
get up here fast
where are you
over filtered food storage room
they dash for the stairs
roby faust and melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive at standard and hunter are waiting for them in hysterics
we saw it inside and slammed the door on it
its in there now
on the other side of the door crashing and banging can be heard
whats it doing having a seizure
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
i guess we open the door and net it
i hate to open that door
again the thing can be heard crashing around inside
it looks completely different from the first one its more like a worm with legs
well we better do something
maybe we dont have to
its trapped in there
we could just leave it in there all the way back to irth
snaps dont be an idiot
i know what we can do
we can pump poison gas into the room and kill it
through those ventilator slots there
he indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door
hey wait a minute
thats all our food supplies in there
we cant pump poison gas all over them
once we kill the thing we wont need the food any more we can go straight into hypersleep
also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies it may be fouling them all
somebody gimme a hand ill get the stuff
camera pulls back to reveal that they are fastening a large funnel shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door
this funnel is attached to a thick hose which runs back to a large metal tank with pressure gauges
get those masks on
they pull on gas masks
this stuffs deadly i hope we know what were doing
go ahead jay
faust turns on the machine
it begins to throb as it pumps the gas through the hose and into the room
immediately the crashing noises rise in crescendo and the thing can then the sounds stop altogether
shut it off
faust shuts off the pump
what do you think
now we go in
standard steps to the door and opens it
a thick cloud of gas billows out
the room is thick with the poison gas
the men look like insects in their gasmasks
the food packages are ripped to shreds and foodstuffs are scattered all over the floor
looks like he helped himself
carefully the men poke through the garbage net and prods raised
then hunter points
god damn it
they all look where he is pointing
in the wall a ventilator grill it escaped
they move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it
where does that go
all over the ship well have to check the charts to know for sure
then lets go and do it
they head for the door
have we got any food at all left in the ship
they slam the door shut and seal it
the screens are showing them a schematic of the ships system of ventilator shafts
that one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets you notice
the food storage room on one end and the cooling unit on the other
so its trapped in between now we have to drive it out
we cant pump poison gas down into the cooling unit
itll flood the whole ship
the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out
are you crazy the man would need protection obviously as well as some way to drive the thing before him
how about a flamethrower
that wouldnt poison the air
so one of us goes into the airshaft and drives the thing along while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net
sounds like a rough one
got a better idea
so the only question left is who gets to crawl down the airshaft
lets be democratic
he tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console
on one of them he draws a large x
then he wads each piece of paper into a tiny little ball
he rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table like dice
martin take one
roby picks one up and unfolds it
it is blank
melkonis picks up another and opens it
faust picks up a ball and standard immediately picks his own up
they are both blank
they all look at hunter who has not yet unfolded his
open it up cleave
hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower
faust is helping him
finally faust hands him a tracking device
i hope you wont need me but if you do im here
hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening which is just large enough to crawl through
it is completely dark in the shaft
hunter reaches up and turns on his helmet light
then he switches on his radio
hey do you guys read me down there
standard melkonis and roby are spreading out the net
we hear the hum of huge cooling plants and their hair ruffles
large airshafts run off in different directions
yeah were getting into position
okay im starting now
he begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel
he turns a corner
after a couple more tight turns the tracker suddenly beeps
he raises his flamethrower and fires a blast into the darkness
it roars loudly in the confined tube and the air instantly heats up
smoke drifts back into his face
he begins to sweat
roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall
thats where its got to come out
he throws a switch and a large metal panel rises and seals off the opening
thats a flip flop gate to channel the air but we can use it to trap the thing
right now lets keep it closed
melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it
the screen shows a section of the ships schematic
ive got hunter
and something else as well in front of him
are they close
theyre on the next level up
lets get moving with this net
they lift the net up holding it in front of the opening
hunter is still crawling on hands and knees
up ahead he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn
he crawls toward the down angle then fires another blast from his flamethrower
then he starts crawling down head first
when he is nearly upside down the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position almost immobilized
then the tracker starts beeping like crazy
frantically he fumbles the flamethrower around but the space is narrow it is difficult maneuvering
he hears a hissing cry up ahead and claws scrambling on metal
then he has the weapon into position and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound
melkonis is staring at his screen
theyre getting pretty close now
all right then when it gets to the other side of the door you sing out then drop the door
to roby and you and i will bag it and then well take it to the ventral air lock got it
tensely uh huh
hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft clutching the flamethrower
whispers hey you guys
into communicator yes
whispering i dont think this shaft goes on too much farther
anyway its getting pretty hot in here
into communicator okay our screens show you as being near to the opening
well open it up then well cue you and you can start blasting
thatll drive it right out
you dont have to go any farther
he readies the flamethrower
okay get ready
he and roby heft their respective ends of the net crouched to catch the small creature when it darts out
melkonis picks up his electric prod
open the vent sandy
melkonis reaches over and throws the switch
the metal gate drops down opening up the shaft
melkonis lets out a horrible shriek and the thing grabs his head in one claw and twists it off like a man pulling the head off a chicken standard and
roby are left standing in shock
after a moment hunter climbs out of the shaft
where is it
they break from their paralysis and run toward the opening the creature just leaped into
it is another shaft going down into darkness
awed how did it get so big by eating our food supplies
faust is still waiting
into his communicator hey are you guys still there
whats going on
over filtered meet us on the bridge
be careful its huge now
faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks the door behind him
standard roby and hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge
you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him
it was horrible horrible
like a chicken
standard roby and hunter enter and drop into chairs
faust follows shortly
they all look blank stunned
its monstrous it grew like some horrible tapeworm
we were completely unprepared
its still in the ship
wed better seal off the lower maintenance level at least trap it there
throws a switch circuitry lights up at least it cant get up here now
two down four to go
angrily whats that supposed to mean
listen it sure didnt like this flamethrower
thats right we cant kill it on the ship but we can at least keep it at bay and maybe drive it into the air lock
thing is im about out of fuel
theres some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge
rises ill go get it
no i dont want us separated
you just sealed it off it cant get to that section
dont count on it
we sure need this flamethrower
but do not go below decks
heads for the door and be right back
i think its time we took a hard look at those heiroglyphs
roby begins to punch buttons the photographs of the heiroglyphics appear on some of the screens
can you make out any pattern in all that
theres a pattern
but its meaningless to me
i know it looks like a senseless jumble but if you look closely there are recognizable forms
in symbolic form
but if you stare at it you can see some of the different creatures weve been dealing with
i suppose that star shaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard
is that what you mean
and right next to it that oval design with the markings its a dead ringer for the spore casings
that next thing there six legs tentacles thats the thing we saw in the food locker
so the next step should be the big one
and there it is
out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall it has become possible to recognize each stage in the aliens life cycle
this is all the same creature
were seeing the different stages in its life cycle
then that tomb
must have been some kind of fertility temple
where they stored their eggs and maybe held mating rituals
and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle
you will notice though that there are no more phases
only four forms are shown
after that the pattern repeats
which presumably means
more spores coming
faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt halt when he notices that a door leading to the lower decks has been he hesitates uncertain
what to do then there is a sound from the faust hesitates and peers into the lock
the creature is squatting in the middle of the floor gnawing on a bloody thigh bone
it does not see faust
stealthfully dropping back into the shadows faust presses the wall intercom and speaks into it
whispering its in the lock blow the main lock
standard roby and hunter are staring at the pictures
the call from faust catches standard in mid sentence
into intercom what
whispering its in the main air lock
blow the lock
standard hesitates starts to frame a reply then changes his mind and runs to his console and throws the switch
with a mechanical whine the inner door starts to close
the creature hears it and instantaneously leaps out of the lock
the creature comes flying out of the lock and deals faust a back crushing him to a thickness of about three inches
on the wall a green light goes on despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches by fausts squashed body the outer door begins
to slide open
in dead silence a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock door
this is the ships atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into the vacuum under pressure
instantly a tremendous windstorm starts up as the ships air is sucked out toward the lock
after a moment of panic and confusion roby bolts out of the control room
loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways as roby hurries toward the rock partly running partly sucked along by the air current
a huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it
whipped by the hurricane wind roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall
as he hesitates there trying to regain his balance ignoring the monster he pushes off from the wall and starts running again
roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock
here the wind is really terrific his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by the sound is a deafening whistle
instantly roby starts turning a large wheel which begins to close a sliding hatch door closing off the air lock corridor
as the hatch closes the current decreases then is finally cut off as he seals it
done in he collapses to the floor
then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath
because of the thinness of the air the sound level in the ship is very odd thin distant almost inaudible
roby is gasping loudly but we can barely hear him and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater
clutching his throat he comes across the others standard and hunter and they are all choking clawing at their throats gasping like fishes out of water
they are sweating heavily and their noses bleed
they try to speak to each other but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks
standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall
the others follow him
the door bursts open and standard reels in his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring
we see several rows of large oxygen tanks all connected by hoses to a few petcocks
standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles opening them
there is a piercing hiss of escaping air and the sound level gradually returns to normal as standard and the others sink to the floor gasping in the oxygen gratefully
finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up
how much oxygen did we lose
standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges
weve got six hours left
groans oh my god
does anybody know what happened
i saw it
faust got himself jammed in the air lock door
his body held it open
can we get to him
no i had to seal off a whole section
wed lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door
fausts body crushed in the inner door floats weightlessly in the vacuum
his nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood
the three survivors standard roby and hunter slump into chairs
the cat emerges from a hiding place yowling with fear
picking up the cat poor kitty puss puss puss
at least were rid of the damn monster
it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship
no such luck
i saw it running down one of the corridors
groans oh no
we cant fight this thing
theres only six hours of air left were dead men
i dont buy that
theres still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers
how its time for drastic remedies
it was time for that a couple days ago
that kind of remark is pointless
now come on i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with no matter how wild
we cant kill it on board
its huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body
ive got an idea but youre not going to like it
lets hear it
first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
thatll blow the ship up
but itll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core
in the meantime we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship
blow the ship up
and the creature with it
we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat
but the lifeboat cant accelerate to light speed
doesnt matter were already at light speed
and when we get back to the colonies theyll pick us up in the network
what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold
thats the only reason we came out here
wed have to abandon them all
wed be broke
our lives are more important
anyway we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat
no it wont work and i just realized why
theres only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat
only one of us could survive
but the ideas good if we could just turn it around somehow
if we could just get the creature into the lifeboat we could launch it into space and blow it up
we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely once the lifeboat is in space
i think its going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat
we can use the flamethrower
its not going to work
you cant say that i think its a good plan
the flamethrower needs more fuel
weve got a lot to accomplish
lets get moving
the three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship
a lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around
each container is well packed and labelled
which explosive should we use
id suggest the n sticks
theyre portable and they can be radio detonated
hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long red sticks like broomhandles with tiny printing on them
meanwhile roby is staring at the rows of metal cannisters
he touches one of them
you know its funny this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up this treasure the paydirt itll make it back to irth just fine even if were
not with it
here carry these
hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks and stumbles
grabbing at him hey watch it grinning its stable it doesnt hurt to drop it
they begin to carry the explosives up the steps
the three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway when hunters tracker suddenly beeps
they all stop
the tracker beeps again
hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around
nodding up some steps up there
they all look at each other
standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower
so what do we do
do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat or do we flush it out now
if we can get it into the boat we wont have to blow it up we can just eject it into space
standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps
standards face is tense as he advances up the circular steps
suddenly a metallic tapping sound is heard
then he continues up
the view of interstellar space is spectacular
as standard comes up the steps the metallic tapping is heard again
standard looks around
then he sees it broussards corpse floats outside the glass of the dome
it is tangled in some rigging and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically
shouts you can come up
the others come up the steps
spying the corpse oh jesus broussards corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose
bumping against the glass he looks like he wants to come in
the ships gravitational attraction must have drawn him back
horrified should we go outside and bring him in
the risk is too great
perhaps after weve destroyed the thing
glancing back the men retreat from the observation dome
broussard remains against the glass peering in with dead eyes
the floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl way
this passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat
the three men come up to the entrance to the passageway carrying the equipment
they duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat
the passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat
it is an extremely simple stripped down vehicle even the metal struts and beams are exposed
a single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space
it is an escape craft nothing more
pointing along the base of the walls there
they begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat and to wire them into position tightly
this should do it
i should hope so
and wed better make sure its pretty far from the ship when we blow it
it will be
surveys the craft uneasily what we really need is some red meat in here for bait
well if we had some id eat it
im starting to get hungry
by this time they are exiting
now we have to herd that thing up here
nervously whoevers doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full
i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once its inside and to serve as
searches for a word isnt bait the word you used
hey look somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat
yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too
if the others are injured
who gets the privilege
insert three crumpled pieces of paper
three hands pick them up
angle on roby
he unfolds his paper turns it so the others can see it
it has a big x on it
another angle shortly later
hunter is showing roby a small device like a transistor radio
just keep your finger off the button till shes way away from the ship thats all
is it armed
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
thanks for the thought
puts detonator in his breast pocket all right martin well be in touch with you on the communicator
and youll let me know when youve got it coming this way
and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and kablooey
hunters face twitches nervously at this
come on we havent much time air is a factor
they leave the nose of the ship standard carrying the flamethrower hunter the tracker
roby settles himself at the controls runs through them briefly to familiarize himself
using a switch he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times
it slams open and shut quite rapidly
he presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to ready
then standards voice comes from the communicator over filtered weve got something on the tracker
got to be it its too big for the cat
this is a very spooky scene roby alone by the lifeboat listening to over filtered its coming from down there
roby hears various tinny sound effects rustlings clunkings breathing etc
standard has the flamethrower at the ready and hunter is staring at the tracker
it must have stopped moving
im not getting anything
let me go first you stay behind me
carefully standard advances down the corridor
then the creature pops standard whirls around sees the thing clutching hunter
it holds him off to one side as though to keep standard from getting at him
standard doesnt know what to do
i cant the acid will pour out
at that moment the creature takes a bite out of hunter who screams in standard can take it no longer he raises the flamethrower and fires standard instantly stops firing
but now hunter is a kicking ball of flame held out at arms length by the monster
roby is listening to all this on the communicator
he can hear the shrieks and crashing noises
then the communicator goes dead and all he hears is a rush of static
he waits quite a while for a response but we can see from his expression that he expects none
he drops his face into his hands
when he lifts his head again he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve
roby walks along watching the tracker carrying a pistol in the other hand
he comes across standards flamethrower lying on the floor
he picks it up substituting it for the pistol
then he continues to follow the tracker it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level
roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet
looking down he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate
getting down on his hands and knees he removes the heavy plate revealing a black opening with a ladder going down
substituting the tracker for a flashlight but still carrying the flamethrower roby starts down the ladder
shining the light around into the darkness roby descends the metal ladder to the floor
something moves in the darkness roby turns his light on it
hanging from the ceiling is a huge cocoon
it appears to be woven from some fine white silk like material and it is slowly undulating
flamethrower ready roby approaches the cocoon
as he gets close enough he sees that the cocoon is semi transparent and the body of unexpectedly standards eyes open and focus on roby who jumps violently
a feeble whisper kill me
sickened what did it do to you
moves his head slightly look
roby turns his light where standard indicates
another cocoon dangles from the ceiling but this one looks a little different
it is smaller and darker with a harder shell
in fact it looks almost exactly like whispering that was melkonis
it ate hunter
looking around for a tool ill get you out of there
but i can save you get you to the autodoc
its eaten too much of me
in horror what can i do
roby stares at him in horror then bends down and takes a closer look at him
reacting he straightens back up raises the flamethrower and sprays a molten blast
when the entire room is in flames he turns and scrambles back up the ladder
roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath trying not to throw up
at length he regains control of himself
the snark appears to hang motionless with planets and star clusters rolling past in the infinite distance
roby is putting the cat into a metal vacuum sealed catbox with a little oxygen tank on it
kitty go bye bye
he seals the catbox then turns on the oxygen
there is a faint hiss of pressurized air
wild eyed the cat peers out of a little window in front
he picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge
carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag and of course the flamethrower roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal cannisters
reading from labels whatll it be kitty
here how about some tacitum ten kilos of it
thisll buy us an island on some nice planet
putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag he hurries back up the steps
catbox in one hand flamethrower in the other roby enters the engine room containing the massive stardrive engines
he puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the engines
studying the instructions he begins to close switches one by one
the cooling units for the stardrive engines are not functioning
engines will overload in minutes seconds
finally roby closes the last switch
shaking with nervousness he hurriedly picks up catbox bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the engine room
roby hurries on listening to the siren
engines will overheat and main core will melt in minutes seconds
roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed
hands full he starts to enter the connecting passageway
it hisses and starts toward him
roby leaps out of the passageway bounds to the controls and throws the switch
the hatch door slams shut locking the thing in the lifeboat
engines will overload in minutes
indecisive roby stares at the lifeboat launch button
the thing can be heard fumbling around in the passageway
finally he turns and bolts back toward the engine room
like a maniac roby runs through the ship level after level pounding down stairwells his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the ship as he sprints for the engine room
engines will overload in minutes seconds
the door crashes open and roby comes running in
the room is full of smoke and the engines are whining dangerously
it is extremely hot in the room roby instantly breaks out in sweat
he runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit switches
still the siren continues
engines will overload in minutes
roby pushes a button and speaks into it
ive turned all the cooling units back on
the reaction has proceeded too far
the core has begun to melt
engines will overload in minutes seconds
a look of terror comes onto robys face
he turns and runs from the engine room
again roby must run through all the levels of the ship this time up the stairs exhausted stumbling while the computer counts down attention
engines will overload in minutes
reeling gasping for breath roby staggers into the vestibule where the lifeboat is berthed
he grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward the passageway
it is then he realizes that the lifeboat door is open again
quickly he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him
then he advances on the passageway
dripping with sweat his face a mask of fear roby enters the passageway flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands
he is goaded on by the siren and the computer attention
engines will explode in seconds
he makes it all the way to the end of the passageway then sticks his head into the lifeboat
his point of view as he quickly scans the lifeboat reveals that it is immediately he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway
there he grabs the catbox and bag then runs back into the lifeboat
engines will explode in seconds
he comes in on the run hurls the catbox and bag toward the front and does a dive over the back of the control chair
he is no sooner in the seat than he hits the launch button
the retainer clips drop away and with a blast of ramjets the roby is frantically strapping himself in as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship
the tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the snark
the scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances
roby finishes strapping himself in then he reaches and grabs the catbox
the cat is yowling
roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it
the snark drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind until it is barely a point of light
the shockwave hits the escape craft jolting it and rattling everything inside
then all is quiet
roby unhooks himself from his straps rises and goes to the back of the lifeboat
he stares out through the porthole
his face is bathed in orange light
what he sees is the boiling fireball now fading and fizzling away into nothingness and a couple of pieces of debris floating past
robys expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends
the cat screeches
roby whirls and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat
it squats then pulls out its trophy a mans arm
it begins to eat the arm watching roby
his first thought is for the flamethrower unfortunately it lies on the floor right next to the monster
next he glances around for any place to hide
his eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit with the door standing open
he begins to edge toward the locker
the creature rises
it throws down the arm
with that roby dives for the open locker door hurls himself inside and slams the door shut
there is a clear glass panel in the door and the thing puts its face right up to the glass peering in at roby
the locker is so small that robys face is only inches away from the creatures
the sight is disgusting
it turns its head looking at him in curiosity
then the moaning of the cat distracts it
the creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits
it bends down and peers inside
the cat yowls louder
it picks up the catbox in its tentacles
trying to distract the monster away from the cat roby taps on the but the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass startling the
hell out of roby
getting no more interference from him the thing returns to the catbox
roby looks around
he spies the spacesuit
quickly he begins to pull it on
the creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside
the cat moans
roby is halfway into the pressure suit
the creature throws the catbox down
it clangs and bounces
the thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall
then it jams it into a crevice in the wall
with one tentacle it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice
the cat has gone beyond hysterics
roby pulls on the helmet latches it into place then turns on the oxygen
with a hiss the suit fills itself
in a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip
roby peels the rubber off revealing a sharp steel point
again he raps on the glass
the creature turns
it faces the locker peers at him
try a little of this you fucking bastard
the creature rises but just in time to catch the steel shaft right it makes a horrible noise and clutches at the spur
the yellow acid begins to flow from the wound
before the acid can touch the floor roby reaches back and pulls a switch blowing the rear hatch
in a poof the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into space and the bleeding creature along with it
roby grabs a steel strut to keep from being sucked out but as the creature passes him it roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat with the thing
clinging to his leg
he kicks at it with his free foot but it wont let go
looking for any salvation roby grabs the hatch control lever and yanks it
the hatch slams shut closing roby safely inside but trapping the end it instantly releases roby who staggers back
the creature is now outside the lifeboat in the vacuum squirming the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch
where the tentacle is caught in the hatch it is wounded and is starting to foam with acid eating away at the metal
roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled the jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft right where the creature is wriggling
the engines belch flame for a few seconds then roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing
the burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space a writhing smoking foaming mass
as it tumbles into the distance pieces drop off it it bloats then bursts soggily sending a spray of particles off in all directions
the last we see of it is a few smouldering rags dwindling into infinity
the boat is re pressurized and roby is seated in the control chair
he seems calm and composed almost cheerful
the cat purrs in his lap
dictating so it looks like ill make it back to the colonies on schedule after all
i should be to the frontier in another years or so and then with a little luck the network will pick me up
im not as rich as i was a couple days ago but im not exactly broke either
incidentally i did manage to salvage one souvenir out of this whole mess
he reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board and pulls out the alien skull
poor yorick here should go at least partway toward proving im not a crank
i wish it was him wed met in the first place things might have turned out different
he puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it
this is martin roby executive officer last survivor of the commercial vessel snark signing off
come on cat lets go to sleep
roby leans forward and switches off the recorder
then he rises and carrying the cat walks to the hypersleep freezer which stands open
he climbs in and stretches out on his back holding the cat against his chest
with one hand he presses a switch and the lid closes over close up of the alien skull watching sentinel over the slumbering roby like some dead melancholy pixie
the lifeboat snark sails away toward its rendezvous with irth years from now
