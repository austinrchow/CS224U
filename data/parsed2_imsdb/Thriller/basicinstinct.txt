b if window
href b b basic instinct by joe eszterhas by it is dark we dont see clearly
a man and woman make love on a brass bed
there are mirrors on the walls and ceiling
on a side table atop a small mirror lines of cocaine
a tape deck plays the stones sympathy for the devil
she straddles his chest
her breasts in his face
he cups her breasts
she leans down kisses him
johnny boz is in his late s slim good looking
we dont see the womans face
she has long blonde hair
the camera stays behind and to the side of them
she leans close over his face her tongue in his mouth
she kisses him
she moves her hands up holds both of his arms above his head
she moves higher atop him
she reaches to the side of the bed
a white silk scarf is in her hand
her hips above his face now moving
slightly oh so slightly
his face strains towards her
the scarf in her hand
she ties his hands with it
to the brass bed
his eyes are closed
lowering hips into his face
over his chest
the song plays
he is inside her
his head arches back
his throat white
she arches her back
her hips grind
her breasts are high
her back arches back
her head tilts back
she extends her arms
the right arm comes down suddenly
the steel flashes
his throat is white
he bucks writhes bucks convulses
it flashes up
it flashes down
winter in san francisco cold foggy
cop cars everywhere
the lights play through the thick fog
two homicide detectives get out of the car walk into the house
nick curran is
trim good looking a nice suit a face urban edged shadowed
gus moran is
crew cut silver beard a suit rumpled and shiny a hat out of the sa face worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher
theres money here deco clean hip that looks like a picasso on the wall

i never heard of him
grins before your time pop
a beat mid sixties
five or six hits
hes got a club down in the fillmore now

past the uniformed guys
past the forensic men
past the coroners investigators
they get to the bedroom

this is sensitive
boz was a major contributor to the mayors campaign
he was chairman of the board of the palace of fine arts to nick i thought you said he was a rock and roll star
he was a retired rock and roll star
a civic minded very respectable rock and roll star

what are they nervous about
theyre nervous about everything
he stops turns sees walker behind them
walker comes up to them

gus moran gets up from his desk as soon as he sees him

no priors no convictions
double major magnum cum laude berkeley
literature and psychology
daughter sole survivor marvin and elaine tramell killed in a boating accident catherine tramell sole heir
estimated assets million
it hangs there
are you kidding me
continues formerly engaged to roberto vasquez deceased bobby vasquez
bobby vasquez former middleweight contender killed in the ring atlantic city

shes got a hundred million bucks
she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars
and shes got a degree in screwing with peoples heads
you forgot her degree in literature
shes a writer
she published a novel last year under a pen name
do you want to know what its about
they just stare at him
its about a retired rock and roll star who is murdered by his girlfriend
it hangs there a long beat
his apartment is very bare very few things with wide open spaces
there is a lot of chrome
he sits on the couch reading a book
it is a paperback
we see the title love hurts by catherine adams
he puts the book down a beat then picks the phone up dials
do you know how she does the boyfriend
with an icepick in bed his hands tied with a white silk scarf
nick gus lt
walker harrigan andrews captain talcott and beth gardner
with them is an older white haired man dr
there are copies of love hurts around the table
ive asked dr
lamott to consult with us
this isnt really my turf
lamott teaches the psycho pathology of psychopathic behavior at stanford and is also a member of the justice departments psychological profile team
there are two possibilities
the person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic literal detail
someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer
after a long beat what if the writer did it
what are we dealing with
youre dealing with a devious diabolical mind
this book must have been written at least six months maybe years before it was published
that means the writer planned the crime at least in the subconscious back then
the fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism
a long beat
most times i cant tell shit from shinola doc
what was all that you just said
some grins titters
she anticipates the book to be her best alibi
shes going to say do you think id be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way ive described in my book
i wouldnt do that because id know id be a suspect
a long beat as they think about it
what if its not the writer
what if its someone who read the book
youre dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this
we are talking about deep seated obsessional hatred an utter lack of sense of proportion or perspective
weve got a top of the line once in a lifetime loony tune either way you cut it thats what youre saying right doc
youre dealing with someone very dangerous and very ill
prosecutor john corrigan a big man in his s with captain talcott lt
walker nick and gus
corrigan is reading a file
he gets up yawns goes to his window looks out
come on you know theres no case here
theres no physical evidence okay she doesnt have an alibi but theres no motive
her defense would just beat us to death with the copycat thing
anybody who read the book could have done it
a long beat no one says anything
so what do we do nothing
after a beat we bring her in for questioning
shes got enough money to burn this whole department down
she was the last person seen with the guy ill take the responsibility
it wont do any good
shell come in with lee bailey and mel belli trailing behind her on a solid gold chain from tiffanys
yes she will
after a beat no she wont
they look at him
smiles i dont think shes going to hide behind anybody
i dont think shes going to hide at all
after a beat i think youre as crazy as she probably is curran
nicks says nothing
you know what they say it takes one to know one
nick looks a gus grins
they walk from the car to the door of the big beach house
they ring the bell
they hear typing inside
the typing stops
she comes to the door in jeans and a tight fitting sweatshirt
tramell wed like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us
are you arresting me
if thats the way you want to play it
they look at each other a beat
smiles can i change into something more appropriate
itll just take a minute
it is beautifully done in a santa fe motif
she goes to a bedroom of the living room
nick sits down on a couch facing the bedroom shes walked into
gus sits across from him his back to the bedroom
there is a coffee table between them
she leaves the bedroom door halfway open
an old newspaper is on the coffee table
nick reaches for it
the headline says vice cop cleared in tourist shootings
a headline underneath says grand jury says shootings accidental
there is a photograph of nick
he stares at the paper
how long will this take
nick puts the paper down on the coffee table
he is lost in his thoughts
gus picks the paper up
looks up i dont know
nick facing the half open bedroom door sees a mirror near the wall of the bedroom
the mirror reflects her in the other corner of the bedroom
she is taking her clothes off
she strips down
he sees her back
she has a beautiful body
naked she puts a dress on
she doesnt put any underwear on
do you always keep old newspapers around
only when they make interesting reading
and she is suddenly out of the bedroom
she stands there smiles
they look at each other a long beat
finally im ready
they get up head out
you have the right to an attorney
why would i need an attorney
they sit in the front she is in the back
the car goes over the winding two lane mt
the fog is heavy
its starting to rain
we see the beach far below
do you have a cigarette
i dont smoke
yes you do
she smiles looks at him
a beat and he turns away
another beat and she lights a cigarette up
i thought you were out of cigarettes
i found some in my purse would you like one
he turns back to her
i told you i quit
it wont last
a beat as she looks at him and then he turns away
you workin on another book
yes i am
it must really be somehtin makin stuff up all the time
he watches her in the rearview mirror
it teaches you to lie
you make it up but it has to be believable
they call it suspension of disbelief
i like that
suspension of disbelief
he smiles at her in the mirror
whats your new book about
he falls for the wrong woman
he turns back to her
what happens to him
she looks right into his eye
she kills him
a beat as they look at each other and then he turns away from her
gus watcher her in the rearview mirror
it is large fluorescent lighted antiseptic
she walks in with nick and gus
in the room are prosecutor john corrigan lt
walker captain talcott harrigan and andrews
there is a police stenographer a plain young woman in her s
as soon as she comes in im john corrigan
im an assistant district attorney ms
can we get you anything
would you like some coffee
no thank you
are your attorneys hiding a smile ms
tramell waived her right to an attorney
corrigan and talcott glance at nick
she sees the look
smiles did i miss something
i told them you wouldnt want an attorney present
why have you waived your right to an attorney ms
to nick why did you think i wouldnt want one
i told them you wouldnt want to hide
i have nothing to hide
the two of them keep their eyes on each other
she sits down
they sit around her
nick sits directly across from her
she lights up a cigarette
they watch her
she is poised cool in complete command of herself
there is no smoking in this building ms
what are you going to do
charge me with smoking
ever so casually she blows her smoke across at nick
would you tell us the nature of your relationship with mr
i had sex with him for about a year and a half
i liked having sex with him
she has control of the room she looks from one man to the other as she speaks
he wasnt afraid of experimenting
i like men like that
i like men who give me pleasure
he gave me a lot of pleasure
a beat as they watch her
she is so matter of fact
did you ever engage in sado masochistic activity with him
smiles exactly what do you have in mind mr
after a beat little flustered did you ever tie him up
you never tied him up
johnny liked to use his hands too much
i like hands and fingers
they stare at her
you describe a white silk scarf in your book
ive always had a fondness for white silk scarves
she smiles i have a very vivid imagination
but you said you liked men to use their hands
i said i liked johnny to use his hands
she smiles i dont give any rules nick
i go with the flow
they have their eyes on each other
did you kill mr
id have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book
id be announcing myself as the killer
im not stupid
we know youre not stupid ms
maybe thats what youre counting on to get you off the hook
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him
yes it does doesnt it
she holds his eyes a second then the answer is no
i didnt kill him
do you use drugs ms
did you ever do drugs with mr
what kind of drugs
she looks directly at nick
have you ever fucked on cocaine
she smiles its nice
he watches her
you like playing games dont you
smiles ive got a degree in psych
it goes with the turf
games are fun
they are holding each others eyes
how about boxing
thats a game
was that fun for you
they dont take their eyes off each other for a second
i think thats irrelevant to this inquiry
to nick yes it was
how did you feel when he died
i loved him
their eyes are still on each other
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died that day at the beach
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game
but you didnt hurt no
because you didnt love him thats right
their eyes are digging into each other
even though you were fucking him
after a beat you still get the pleasure
didnt you ever fuck anybody else while you were married nick
a beat he stares at her expressionless
how did you know he was married
watching nick maybe i was guessing
what difference does it make
she lights a cigarette
he stares at her
would you like a cigarette nick
he just stares at her expressionless
do you two know each other
how did you meet mr
i wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star
i went down to his club and picked him up
then i had sex with him
you didnt feel anything for him
you just had sex with him for your book
she looks at nick
in the beginning
then i got to like what he did for me
thats pretty cold aint it lady
im a writer i use people for what i write
you write what you know
let the world beware
she and nick have their eyes on each other then to corrigan smiles would you like me to take a lie detector test
we see her in a glass enclosed cubicle with a polygraph examiner
nick stands outside watching her with gus and lt
her back is to them
the examiner shuts the machine down gathers rolls of papers and comes out of the cubicle
no blips no blood pressure variations no pulse variance
either shes telling the truth or ive never met anyone like her
a long beat then well i guess thats it
a long beat nick watches her as she sits inside
how does somebody beat this machine
ninety nine point nine percent of the cases they dont
youd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system your circulatory system your adrenal glands
in my opinion this woman is telling the truth
the examiner walks away
they stand there
catherine stands at the door of the cubicle behind them can i go now
after a beat yes
thanks for coming in ms
im sorry to inconvenience you
she says nothing has a thin smile
can i ask one of you for a ride
they look at her a beat
and he and catherine walk away
gus and walker watch them
it is an old mint condition silver porsche
it is pouring rain the wind is blowing a san francisco winter storm
nothing is said a long beat as he drives
he looks at her
smiles im tired
its got to be tiring to beat that machine
she looks at him and looks away
if i were guilty and if i wanted to beat that machine it wouldnt be tiring
it wouldnt be tiring at all
because im a professional liar
i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies
a beat for my writing
he looks at her
smiles i love the rain dont you
he says nothing doesnt look at her
you took a polygraph after you shot those two people didnt you
he looks at her now
were both innocent nick
he pulls up in front of her house on divisadero stops
he sees the white ferrari in the driveway
how do you know all this stuff about me
you know all about me
i dont know anything that isnt police business
after a beat you know i dont like to wear any underwear dont you nick
they look at each other a beat
smiles thanks for the ride
and shes out of the car
he watches her as she hurries in the rain his eyes on her until the moment she opens the door and is inside
it is a police bar san francisco style
ferns joe montana and will clark posters
the jukebox has a lot of tony bennett
he walks in
he sees lt
walker at a back booth with gus goes to them sits down
what is all this nick stuff nick would you like a cigarette
nick can you give me a ride
she didnt ask me for the ride
she asked anybody
and you volunteered
a bartender stays behind the bar but yells to him

walker she doesnt know me
i never saw her before gus and i talked to her
here you go nick

thats why she asked to take it
how the fuck do you know
what is it with you and this broad anyway
come on phil
youre not gonna let this slide
what about her parents
what about what else shes published
at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else thats an amazing real life coincidence
her parents died in an accident
i dont care what else shes written
what are you a book critic
how did they die
was there an investigation
how youre saying she killed her parents
did she kill bobby vasquez too
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch
maybe she did gus
maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face
lets polygraph her again and ask her about it
casually fuck you phil
fuck you too nick
a beat then calls to the bartender can you get me another double black jack harry
gus looks at him with concern
a man in his s lt
martin nilsen is suddenly there
he is overweight florid
to nick hey shooter you back on the black jack shooter
nick doesnt look at him

walker and gus get up and hold nick back
beth gardner the police psychologist is suddenly there

after a beat smiles he aint that way

he is kissing her hard rough
he forces her against the wall

he kisses her harder we hear her panties rip
he gets the dress off pushes his hands under her bra please dont dont he puts his mouth to her shoulder bites it as they move down to the floor
it is dark
the are still partially dressed
they are on the floor
he lies on his back staring at the ceiling
she lies next to him the torn dress wound around her
there is a bite mark on her shoulder
a long beat silence then what was she like
after a beat she said what you said shed say
she sits up looks away
he looks at her puts his finger on the bite mark idly gently
a beat and he kisses her shoulder gently then lies back down
i met her at berkeley

to nick go stick your head in a tub of ice water
a beat then seriously see where she leads
the black ferrari is in the driveway
he sits in an unmarked police car on a hillside above the house watching
it is a bleak leaden gray day
catherine comes out of the house
she is dressed casually
she gets into the ferrari
he stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic highway a two lane mountain road which leads from stinson beach into marin county
she suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road cutting in and out passing cars very fast
he has to start cutting around cars to keep up
this woman really drives
he cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a grey lines tour bus head on
close call sheer drops on either side
he looks frazzled
he is behind her at a distance on a hilly mill valley road little streets terraced hillsides sharp turns
he goes slowly looks around thinks hes lost her
and then he sees the black ferrari parked in front of a house obscured by hedges
he parks the car a distance behind the ferrari sits there a long beat
he gets out goes carefully up to the hedges looks
a small nondescript house
he cant see anything inside the house
a beat he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it
he takes an envelope out looks at the name hazel dobkins
he watches as she comes out of the house
a frail old woman in her s is with her
she hugs the old woman gets into the ferrari starts it up
he waits a beat and then starts after her
he stays behind her at a distance she is going slowly
and then she suddenly guns it cuts her lights her wheels screech
he guns his car after her
he makes a turn
she is gone
there is a fork in the road
he turns one way goes a few hundred feet
he pulls his car up to her house at stinson beach
the black ferrari is in the driveway
a light goes on in an upstairs bedroom
the curtain is drawn
he sees the outline of her body now
she starts to take her clothes off there in the window behind the curtain
he watches her body as she does an almost languorous strip
his eyes are intense
he is alone nobody else in the big room
he sits in front of a computer
we see the screen
he has punched in he is waiting for a response
we see it come on screen a long beat as he stares at the screen and then we see these words we see him type in the words a long
beat and then it comes up he stares at the screen a long beat
behind him aint you go nothin better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine
after a beat lost in his thoughts what are you doing here pop
grins i came in here to jack off the damn machine
a beat one dead psychology professor
and guess what
he was her counselor
nick looks at him a beat
was she ever suspect
they never even got a statement from her
nick sits back a long beat his eyes off somewhere
slowly do you remember a case hazel dobkins
grins hell yes

nice little kids nice husband wasnt porkin around no financial problems
one day outta the clear blue sky she does em
all of em

he got for a wedding present
didnt even deny it
sweet as honey
said she didnt know why she done it
nick just stares at him
he pulls up to the house gets out of his unmarked police car
he stands there a beat thinking
he walks down to the beach entrance of the house
he hears a rolling stones song playing inside
he stands there
the door suddenly opens
catherine stands there smiles
she wears very tight fitting spandex leotards
he looks at her a beat then am i
they have their eyes on each other
a beat and she turns to go in
she goes in ahead of him he follows her inside
he watches her body
his movements are tentative off balance
she turns the stones down
on a table by the window he sees a word processor

he grabs her blocks her
they look at each other a long beat and then he lets her go
the emotion of the moment is gone now they turn away from each other

martin nilsen lies against the front seat

after a beat quietly i know what thats like
it is dark cavernous there are a thousand people in here
the music is ear splitting pulsing
the floor is huge
at one time this club was a church
he walks around the sides a drink in his hand looking for her
he doesnt see her
the he catches a glimpse of roxy
she is dancing with another woman
he watches her
she is wearing pants and a jacket her hair off to the side
she looks very masculine tonight
roxy laughs at the other woman leaves her on the floor starts moving through the sea of dancers
he follows her through the press of bodies
she goes towards the mens room
she walks in
it is large dark shadowy it was once the sacristy
a crowd scene men and women
roxy presses through them
a haze of crack smoke we see people doing poppers
she opens the door to a toilet stall walks in
nick is behind her
as the door opens he sees catherine
she wears a black motorcycle jacket a very short skirt stiletto heels
her hair is up
he make up is severe in the darkness in the shadows she looks about
a hot flash trash
she is in there with two men one of them is a big body built black guy
she has a vial of something near her face
she sees nick watching her
she whispers something to the tall black guy
he looks at nick smiles a condescending smile
the door to the stall closes he is walking along the side watching the floor a drink in his hand
the song ends and it seques right into the stoness miss you
he sees her
her black leather jacket is off
she wears a very tight flimsy top the short skirt the heels
she is dancing with roxy and the black guy
he watches her move
watches her body
she turns sees him dances watches him
gets between roxy and the black guy
they sandwich her with their bodies
keeps moving turning
eyes on him
playing to him with her body
a long beat and he goes up to them
his movements are almost trance like
they look at each other
a long beat
catherine stops dancing
he reaches for her
she moves away
a beat their eyes are on each other
she moves a step towards her
a beat as they look at each other
and they start to move together
their eyes are on each other as they move the eyes burning
the movements tighter hotter
and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her
as they keep moving
the song seques into the stoness gimme shelter
she is melting into him now kissing him
tex watches expressionless
the black guy is gone
he holds her by the back of the neck kissing her
their bodies pressed into each other
his hands are on her butt now pulling her into him now almost holding her up now
and then under her skirt under her panties
as he kisses her neck
people around them stare
he moves his hands under her top as she keeps moving with the song her head back her back almost arching
cups her breasts now
she keeps moving
the song sweeping them into its rhythm its just a shot away its just a kiss away a kiss away
they devour each other
right there on the floor
barely able to hold it back
as tex watches expressionless
as people stop dancing and stare
it is dark
we cant see clearly
a side table lines of cocaine on a small mirror
a cd player the stones play love in vain
there are mirrors all over the walls and ceiling
they are in bed
the bed is big and brass
he kisses her neck
his hands under her raising her
he moves down kisses her breasts
puts his mouth around a breast
she arches moves
he kisses her shoulder
biting into it
she opens her mouth
we hear no cry
we hear the stones
the stones play monkey man
she kisses his chest licks it lowers her head
he arches his back
her mouth comes up
her mouth on his lips again
he turns her
he moves her legs apart
the camera is behind them
she holds his back
digs in her nails
rakes his back with them
digs in again
his back bleeds
he moves inside her
the nails dig
blood trickles down his back
the stones play wild horses
he is behind her
she is on her stomach
he rises her by her hips
kisses her back
races her spine with his tongue
traces her lower back
moves into her
kisses her neck
his fingers are in her mouth
as he moves
the stones play sympathy for the devil
she leans close over his face her tongue in his mouth
kneeling over him
she moves his arms above his head
moves higher atop him
her breasts in his face
she reaches over to the side
a white silk scarf is in her hand
she moves higher above him
kneeling over his face
moving oh so slightly
his face strains towards her
the scarf in both hands now
she starts to tie his hands with it
his eyes are open watching her
she ties it loosely gently
it isnt tight
but his hands are tied to the brass bed
she kisses him
moving her hips lower now
over his chest
and he is inside her
her arms above him
his eyes open
she kisses his neck
bites but not hard
grinding hard against him now
she is on her knees
head arches back
her breasts high
her back arches strains
he strains toward her
she holds her arms high
she comes out of the arch
falling over him
the scarf loosens
his arms come forward and hold her close
as she moves with slight
it is dark quiet
he is sitting on the side of the bed his head down
his back a line tracing of dried blood
she is asleep nest to him naked
he looks around the room
the white scarf around the bedpost
the coke on the side table
clothes all over the floor
he gets up walks into the bathroom
the light is too bright
he looks at himself in the mirror
he pours the water lowers his head puts cold water on his face
a long beat he comes back up opens his eyes
roxy is in the mirror behind him
she startles him
he looks at her in the mirror a long beat doesnt turn
she is expressionless she wears the same thing she wore at the club
he lowers down into the basin again puts more water on his face comes back up uses a towel this time finishes with the towel
she is still looking at him in the mirror the same way
he looks at her in the mirror doesnt turn

she doesnt look at him he smiles slowly
she doesnt smile and she doesnt seem to like his smile either
she walks along the beach

nick looks at him and smiles a thin smile hes not there hes completely preoccupied
someone is watching as he and gus come out of the diner

and he steps on the gas and roars out of there forcing nick to get out of the way
nick looks after him a long beat shakes his head
someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street
he turns a corner walks down the alley towards his porsche parked behind the country and western bar
the car suddenly speeds up roars down on him from the back full bore
he hurls himself across the porsches hood
barely avoiding the car
he sees the car at the end of the alley turning out it is a black ferrari
he guns it down the alley makes a wild turn in the direction the ferrari turned
the porsche dodges around cars very fast almost side swiping them looking almost out of control its motor screaming
he sees the ferrari turn ahead
when he gets to where it turned he turns wildly
the ferrari is making fast wild turns into little streets in north beach its motor screaming the porsche is gaining ground behind it making turns
the ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a road going up a hillside
he yanks the wheel hard
the porsche rockets up the steps bouncing high into the air almost out of control
as it crests the steps and gets to the street
nick guns it and it looks like it flies high down the hill side into blackness
but it lands on more steps heading downward bucking almost spinning it bounces onto the next street
another set of steps leading up he guns it it rockets up roars bucking and lands on the next street
nick makes a wild right turn onto the street
and the black ferrari appears from around a curve to the right heading right for him
nick steps on the gas and heads head on for the ferrari
the ferrari screams head on for him
and at the last moment in the game of chicken the ferrari tries to swerve around him on this narrow road goes out of control and over the side turning
over and over as it rolls down the hillside
the ferrari has landed right side up
he runs down the hillside and gets to it
a beat and he opens the car door
roxy lies hunched over the wheel her eyes open
her neck is broken
she is dead
police lights have been set up
he stands there with lt
walker and several of the internal affairs men
tell me again

nick looks at him expressionless
he parks his car
it is dark
he starts heading inside
he goes in
he starts to walk up the dark stairway we see him walking up several flights of steps
he opens his door with his key
he walks in
the apartment is dark
behind him hi
it is a whisper almost a hiss
he spins fast
catherine stands there pressing herself against a wall
they look at each other a long beat
she looks like she is almost in a trance
i heard about it
he looks at her expressionless
a long beat their eyes are into each other
she looks like she is almost shivering
i cant allow myself to care about you i cant allow myself to care i cant i cant she looks very emotional
he moves towards her puts his arms around her holds her very close
in a whisper i dont want to do this please i dont want to do this i lose everybody i dont want to lose you i dont want to he
presses her closer and closer to himself holds her
it is dark we cant see clearly
he makes love to her
hardly moving inside her
there are tears in her eyes
she is on her knees straddling him
he is on his back his eyes are closed
her head arches back
her breasts high
he strains toward her with his body
she holds her arms high
her right hand is in a fist
we only see the back of her hand and arm
it comes down suddenly
then her whole body falls on top of him
a very long beat
we cant see him
her body completely covers him
and then finally he moves
turns her to the side
the stones play sympathy for the devil in the b
the music is low
they lie next to each other on the bed
the camera faces them
he lies staring at the ceiling on the left side of the bed smoking a cigarette
she is curled away from him toward the right side of the bed
a long beat then what do we do now nick
after a long beat we fuck like minks
we raise rugrats
we live happily ever after
we see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over
he stares at the ceiling
i hate rugrats
after a long beat we fuck like minks
we forget the rugrats
we live happily ever after
we see from an angle to the left side of the bed now her face is expressionless
her right arm dangles over the right side of the bed
her right hand is clenched
is she holding something in it against her arm
we see them from an angle to the left side of the bed now he turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette
we see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the camera
a beat and he turns towards her
they look at each other
a long beat as the song gets louder
we see them in closeup
we dont see her right arm
in a whisper i love you
a beat and he kisses her
the camera backs away from them slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss and we a long beat as the song keeps playing
we see them from the right side of the bedroom
and then the camera lowers slowly as they kiss with more and more passion
it keeps going lower
there is something under the bed
the camera moves closer towards it as sympathy for the devil plays louder
we see it now in closeup as the bed rustles above
it is a thin steel handled icepick
