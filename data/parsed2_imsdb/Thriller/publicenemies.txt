written by ronan bennett michael mann ann eiderman november is parked at the curb
looks at his watch
with his meticulously parted red hair he might be a bank president
thirty year old john herbert dillinger is in the backseat
his arms are behind him
we dont know why
red starts the car and drives forward
convicts uniforms are broadly striped and frayed
this is a line of hard men branded by prison shorn hair broken nose eyes with a cold ferocity
and their aggression has a nihilistic edge their spirits never surrender
theres nothing beaten down about these men
like alcatraz leavenworth and sing sing this is the end of the line
in visored black caps black shirts black patent leather sam browne belts with three foot long billy clubs watch the line poised to unleash violence
harry pete pierpont foot with eerie blue eyes
brilliant violent he hates all authority
charles makley squat with an anvil jaw facial scars and as calm as pierpont is volatile
homer van meter tall an incorrigible clown and an unemotional killer
he has continued to ridicule guards even when it cost him months in the hole
with an older man walter dietrich wait for the lam
work call to the prison shirt factory
watches through a window as a pontiac pulls into the parking area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks
hamilton jerks a handcuffed dillinger out of the backseat
dillinger is shoved forward
hamiltons wearing a star
opening up afternoon
hamilton flashes the badge
he shoves dillinger inside
in an adjacent room five guards play poker
next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard
as the cage door locks behind him this is the last place dillinger wants to have entered
and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts
a klaxon sounds
walter dietrich goes right to the stacks and pulls a box with an x crayoned on the side
its labeled thread
dietrich was mentored by herbert k
lamm an ex prussian soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying military tactics and who rode with butch sundanc s hole in the wall gang in utah in
in prison dietrich passed on lamms techniques
his brightest student in is

examines dillinger a second time

but my friends call me johnnie
you gotta address me as mister dillinger
dillingers insubordination puzzles turnkey so he doesnt see hamilton bat a thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the two guards
against the wall
dillingers cuffs fell away
now his thompson covers the stunned pokeraplayers
hamilton and dillinger are as tight as they come
they share their food money liquor ammunition and women
id right now
is keyed open by dainard followed by pierpont and makley and the others
pierpont kicks over the poker table
escapees throw all the guards against the wall
to the guards undress
at the window checks the escape route to the pontiac
hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out
he crosses the front lawn the street car tracks
so far so good
one takes his time
this guard gives shouse an insolent look
shouse slams the guards head with a length of steel pipe
guard goes down
shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and again caving it in
cut it out shouse
turns from open door shouse
i dainard thinks that once the killings begun he will die
so he grabs for homer van meters
van meter shoots dainard
dainards knocked to the floor
a siren screams
caught in the open turns
he scans the guard towers on the east and west corners
he backs towards his pontiac
reds pov tower guards look into the prison interior where the shots came from
arrives takes reds position
red goes for the pon

half dressed in gua ds uniforms they crash outside
sprint for the street in all directions
crack crack crack
jim leslie falls the top of his head taken off
fires at the tower forcing the guards to cover
hamiltons in the pontiac starting it
running with the older dietrich across the grass firing his
dillinger and van meter outside fire at the west tower
dillingers on the running board
his thompson roars covering pierpont whos hauling dietrich into the backseat
dietrich is hit in the neck by rifle fire from the east tower
dillinger falls away
dillinger and pierpont grab walters arms
hes paralyzed now
they try to pull him onto the running boafd of the moving car
dietrichs hcpeful eyes look up at them
then his eyes glaze over
his feet drag down the street
hes dead and they know it
they let go
body remains in the center of the street
the pontiac picks up speed
drives like he has no nerves
hamilton is the best getaway or git driver in the country
thompson empty he grabs reds shotgun
he shoves it into shouses chest in the backseat
walters dead cause you screwed it up you son of a bitch
the bastard wouldnt do what he was told johnny
let him have it
dietrich was your pal up to you
dillinger sees the abject fear in shouses eyes
and dillingers mood swings
he lowers the shotgun
then he snaps the butt across shouses face
breaks shouses cheekbone
dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead center smashing shouses nose and orbital socket
dillinger opens the door and kicks shouse out of the moving car

grateful norris goes inside dillinger passes viola and the struggling toddler on the way to the pontiac take me with you mister
she puts a hand on his forearm

pierpont homer and makley head towards the plymouth
as the pontiac pulls away looks back to see viola wistfully watching them leave
the toddler reaches for violas hand
she pushes the child away
dellinger hates seeing the kid rejected

i have missed you like nobodys business
john dillinger seems like a romantic husband with his little wife betty
and it feels a little out of place
to hoover why do we need this
because of the new breed of mobile outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against whom this government must wage a war on crime
edgar hoover is a physically short man but has a dynamic presence
he is a dapper patrician who believes in elites
he is completely free from self doubt
he is youthful and years old
suydam and tolson sit next to him
mckellar ii chairman of the senate appropriations sub committee
hes an avuncular man of
and so in the middle of a great depression youre looking for a budget increase to build up your department
but by my tally your department of investigation spends more taxpayers dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place
the bureaus apprehended kidnappers bank robbers who have stolen up to
looking at document how many criminals you apprehended
weve arrested and arraigned wanted felons
i mean you
as director ive administered
how many have you arrested
ive never arrested anybody
you never arrested anybody
im an administrator
with no field experience
for once hoover is silent
in fact you are shockingly unqualified arent you sir
you have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life others in the room stare at hoover
mckellar leans back
i think you are a front
i think your prowess as a lawman is a myth created from a hoopla of headlines by mr
suydam your publicist there
you are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as its czar
that is runnin wild in my estimation
crime is what runs wild in this country mr
and if the country required an expanded bureau i question you are the person most fit to run it while
i wont be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians
while outlaws like dillinger clyde barrow the barkers and nelson flourish unabated
your appropriation request is denied
the hearings over
walks fast through the corridor of congressmen
he talks over his left shoulder to suydam and tolson
they struggle to hear him
to suydam find out was he soft on the reds in
does he use prostitutes
peppy tuf f like that
and feed this to walter
riiazinchell mckellars a neanderthal
hes o a personal vendetta to destroy me
well fight him on the front page
not in his damn committee room
to tolson wheres dillinger

purvis is imbued
henry suydam enters
to hoover theyre ready for him
this is henry suydam
he is our expert in congressional and press relations
bureau of investigation w hoover escorts purvis through tolson suydam follow
its like the corporate office of the future designed by albrecht speer
agents are at grey metal desks dressed identically in dark suits white shirts dark ties
no personal effects
the individual is reduced to a component in a gleaming machine
hurry down the staircase
why are you sure youre up to this task mr
we have two weapons that cannot be defeated
what are they
the bureaus modern techniques of investigation and your visionary leadership
you let mr
tolson here know if you need anything melvin anything at all thank you

theres a mob of photographers and newsmen and microphones to interview him
hes imbued with purpose
hes been anointed hoovers crimebuster
he claimed he was up to the task
he asks himself right now
and he didnt expect to be overcome by doubt
he struggles with anxiety
then he pushes that aside and forces himself to take the step forward into the lights and flashbulbs
quietly to tolson our own clark gable
in a long overcoat and a hat with a tommy gun crosses a bank interior to a thin man behind a large desk grover weyla nd
grover stands and flattens against the back wall as if trying to permeate the masonry and disappear into the back alley
dillinger peels him off the wall and steers him towards the vault

pierpont behind him slams the butt of the thompson into the back of his head knocking him flat and disarms him
pete doesnt like authority
pete hits him again
blood pools onto the floor
a woman faints collapsing

he looks over the half painted windows
the growing crowd on the sidewalk is getting too large
at the glass
people scramble for cover as it crashes onto main street

he drives evenly out of the alley
is approached by the cop who thinks hes a pedestrian
to homer hey you

angry cop rushes him
homer slams him in the gut with his rifle disarms him and uses him as a shield
he backs to the front door
cops draw down
they cannot shoot without homer blowing off the cops head

she looks dillinger straight in the eye
clear skin dark eyes with humor playing about the edges
he unexpectedly starts to feel nervous
he gives her his best grin
i dont know what you said to your friend but i sure am glad you did
billie looks him over a well made man in a good suit with a great smile
and paradoxes he easily talks to women but hes not a hustler
hes young but theres a world of experience in his face
open but hes holding something back

he follows her with little difficulty
he can smell the perfume in her black hair
azpack up all my cares and woe here i go singing low bye bye blackbird my but you are pretty
they look into each others eyes
he pulls her closer wants to kiss her long smooth neck
he almost cant resist
their lips are an inch apart

he nods courteously to her girlfriends grabs her coat puts a hand around billies waist and steers her out
so make my bed and light the light cause ill be home late tonight bye bye blackbird
in their coats on the street
pulls her close
then he turns and he kisses her hard on the lips
she didnt expect that
her eyes are wide
he opens and wraps her in his overcoat their bodies close to each other
she kisses him back long and deep
and she didnt expect to do that either
at last they separate
and look at each other for a beat
dillinger slips him bills
he and billie are shown to a table
the clientele is north shore old money and businessmen
some of the women are in dazzling dresses even though its mid depression
a few stare at billie
shes out of her class

a blonde woman elegant and ice cold stares at billie a depression era child in her dress
but theyre looking at me because theyre not used to having a menominee indian girl in their restaurant in a three dollar dress

from nittis table a man gets up and walks straight towards dillinger
he is phil dandrea
two heavy duty bodyguards are with him
dillinger unbuttons his jacket

dandrea continues to the mens room
good luck johnnie
comes out onto the sidewalk
billie isnt there
he searches the street
the night suddenly cold and lonely wraps around johnny
an engineer places headphones on purvis ears
acetate disks on turntables mounted within giant carrying cases record phone calls
cloth insulated wires are strung everywhere
stenographers sit with black bakelite headphones
that noise on the line
thats called swing
nothing we can do about it
some words get dropped
were listening in on a car dealer
rice plays back a recording
when you drop it leave the keys on the floorboard
i got a desoto
the interiors no good
its a work
we think thats dillingers voice
how did we find berman
dillingers coat was bought in cicero illinois a few doors from bermans dealership
berman supplies cars to the syndicate
dillinger must have been at bermans switching cars when he bought that coat
soon as they call to switch out the next car we will tail them

billie checks their hats and coats

dillinger has eyes only for billie

the lethally cold eyes tells the customer everything he needs to know
dillinger swings him to the counter grabs the mans ticket slams thru the half door finds the mans coat tosses it at him

dillinger is an uninhibited and enthusiastic lover
he falls over onto his back and pulls her onto his chest and they look up out the window through the upside down elm trees to the chicago moon in
the cold sky
she gets up and wanders around the room
he thinks shes the most beautiful creature hes ever seen
shes looking at his stuff
she sees suitcases that are packed ready to leave in a heartbeat
everythings so neat
she touches his folded shirt
smooth egyptian cotton
since we been out i go for the finest stuff

he was too handy with his fists
she stares at dillinger

only mistake i made was marrying him in the first place
he got caught mugging a mailman
a criminal mastermind
she turns over and puts her mouth next to his ear

well baby youre going to start a new and exciting kind of life from right now
and as theyre pulled to each other and start making love again she stops

thats not what she meant but gently he rolls her over on the bed
a smile spreads slowly across her lips
baum in his shirtsleeves in front of the recorders is talking to purvis as he puts on his coat

then he hears movement from apt
objects being hurriedly shifted
he starts back down the hallway
halfway between it and the elevator
behind him the elevator doors open
barton turns hi

hes caught between and the elevator
a flat nosed ex con enters
he looks curiously at barton

runs to the corner of the building where he has a visual on the building front entrance and the desoto down the alley
in the final moments of his life
barton looks up into purvis eyes help me
purvis does not know what to do
then bartons eyes drift away
purvis impels himself to action
he kicks in the door to apt
where is he
sees quickly cross the alley from the back stairs to the desoto
and nelson immediately lays down rounds in careful short blasts of full auto
tommy carroll calmly smoothly starts the desoto
nelsons barrage punches into the wall drives daum to cover
slams open a window
the desoto accelerates out of the alley
purvis fires a few rounds
baum fires his pistol
both are useless at that range
the desoto has turned left and is gone
races in from the front door
rice and madala drive up in the bureaus armor plated ford v
they headed north
the sheridan road car
we heard gunfire
gets it came here
was it dillinger
it was lester gillis
the man we let get away wasnt john dillinger

dillinger and pierpont carrying canvas bags cross through the foreground as

homer jumps on the running board
dillinger looks over his shoulder
from the other end of main street no pursuit

from outside the bureau
i thought you understood what i am doing
ing a department of professional investigators
young college men with law or accounting degrees from good families

hoover is backed against the wall
he does not like it
dead cold mr
tolson will call you agent purvis
hoover hung up on him
has pulled into track
three men stand out among passengers
ones face is obscured by a wide brirmdd hat
they are stiff from the journey they stretch take in the crowd
winstead is in his mid s foot body out of steel cable
hurt is in his late s
these men are ex texas rangers
unlike flashier texan lawmen of the period they do not wear western wear unless theyre on a horse
thats for drugstore cowboys out to impress easterners
they wear dark suits and ties and hats
they have special qualifications
whatd he say he looked like
their suitcases have been set on the platform
a porter approaches
gentlemen need a hand
winstead gestures at their bags and one case
the porter goes to lift the case
it is so heavy he can barely raise it
campbell picks up the other end
they toss it on the cartaz hardware salesmen
his terse reply makes the garrulous porter stop talking
the neoclassical hall is enormous
still no purvis
im going to the mens room
winstead spots a shoe shine stand
winstead sits nods and the shoe shine man begins to polish his western boots
hes startled bi the knife in a sheath built into the right boot
wcrk around it
from under the brim of his hat winstead glances at big city life in union station
hes an ominous presence
hear the excited roar of a crowd and we zips along an inside railing under the flawless miami sky
race in a pack after it under cumulous clouds and palm trees
streamline deco stands are almost filled
by the railing watches the race with phil dan
as they begin to walk

she didnt think his interest in her to be more than passing
you want to leave
but im no fool
ill be back checking coats at the steuben club
well i dont want you to leave

homer and his damn joke
i dont want to be around to see any of that
thats what its about
dillinger gets it
i am not going anywhere
i am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes
so what do you say about that
now is the first time she allows herself to have any prospect about a future with him
its a shock
she hikes up her skirt and sits on his lap and smothers him with a kiss
her hat falls off
patrons nearby glance and look away
dillinger doesnt give a damn
a new pack of dogs are about to take flight
a fresh and tanned dillinger and billie are in a strikingly modern gas station on route
billie helps out a family by taking their picture with a kodak brownie in front of a saguaro cactus
snow capped rincon mountains are behind them
she leans down to play with the round baby
she looks over at johnnie and smiles
it breaks his heart
writing into a register

old bellhop takes billies bag to the elevator
dillinger carries his own case
dillinger tips the bellhop a dollar

you want company
in the tub
dillinger enters first time you ever put me off

she stretches out and wets her hair
she sits up to reach for the shampoo
dillingers got it and rubs it into her hair
dillinger hears something in the street
he goes to the window and sees a car parked irregularly
two men get out
he turns and runs into
hes pulling a tommy gun out of his case when three men burst in
one is the clerk
he cracks dillinger across the head with the stock of his shotgun
dillinger falls to his knees
clerk hits him twice more
billie rushes into the room
the two men from the street haul dillinger bloody and semi conscious to his feet and throw him against the wall and cuff him

purvis is brought to the cell
the cop who brought him goes back to his card game with four or five tucson deputies
we see winstead and hurt in their suits and ties are there too
they lounge at ease
a tucson deputy gives them coffee
eye contact with dillinger
but dillinger reacts to purvis
well the man who killed pretty boy floyd
he might have been pretty cause he sure was not whiz kid floyd
deputies stifle laughter
dillinger comes up close to purvis
they are eyeball to eyeball
only the bars separate them
loud for the cops benefit now these arizona boys here
they pulled on us right out
didnt ask washington for permission
didnt make mistakes
arizona deputies enjoy the flattery
dillinger studies purvis
sorry about that fellow barton
one who got killed at the sherone apartments

newspaper said you found him alive
its the eyes aint it
they look at you right before they go
then they drift into nothing

doesnt answer you act like a confident man purvis
bu i dont see it

youre probably okay when theres a groupa of you got the other guy outnumbered
but death and mayhem up close
i am used to that and you are not are you
when its toe to toe one of us will die right here right now i dont think you got the get up and go
purvis has nothing to say
he stares at dillinger
then he turns to leave
ill see you down the road
from ten feet away
no you wont
the only way youll leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you
we will see about that
go get yourself another line of work melvin
purvis gestures for the guards to let him out dillinger lays back down on his cot
the tucson deputies stare after purvis one laughs
after a moment
to tucson deputies i was joking about the well see about that
ill let you boys keep me in this jail awhile
wed like that johnny but dont get too comfortable
theyre moving you
i have absolutely nothing i want to do in indiana
its pm on a snowy tuesday evening january th
below are dim jeweled street lights in the dark white snow of the city
an assembly of photographers chicago p
officers and a crowd have come to greet the biggest celebrity in america
lake county indiana prosecutor robert estill puts dillingers jacket over him to guard against the cold
two huge chicago cops put dillinger into the back of a car
with outrider motorcycles the caravan takes off out of the airport into the snowy night
crane to see the dillinger convoy as they hear approaching sirens
it heads east towards the indiana border and the town of crowne point
at her desk when
a diminutive woman sheriff holley goes to greet the massive cops who bring john dillinger into her reception area and its crowd of reporters
to reporters back up over there
dellinger looks at the crowd
per the chicago daily news his diction was amazing better in many instances than that of his interviewers his poise no less so
there was no hint of hardness about him no evidence save in the alert presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative years in a penitentiary
he had none of the sneer of the criminal
looking at him for the first time
heiates as the most amazing specimen of his kind ever seen outside of wildly imaginative moving picture
you can take the manacles off of him now
johnny are you glad to see indiana again
dillingers slow charismatic smile
about as glad as indiana is to see me
did you smuggle the guns into indiana state penitentiary for the big break of september th
howd you get them in
right there youre too inquistive
to prosecutor robert estill put your arm around dellinger
they fluster estill
dillinger props his elbow on the prosecutors shoulder and cracks a broad grin
the prosecutor complies
they look like old pals
when was the last time you were in mooresville
ten years ago
i was a boy and foolish
i held up a grocery store which i never shoulda done cause mr
morgan was a good man
and they sentenced me to years in the state penitentiary for a dollar theft
in prison i met a lot of good t las
i helped fix up the break at f chigan city
i stick to my friends and they stick to me
see him work the reporters
he knows that they are sympathetic
he plays them like a champ
the new york times called this moment
a modern version of the return of the prodigal son
how long does it take you to go through a bank
one minute and seconds flat
dillinger nods and turns away

why is this clown estill fraternizing with the man he is scheduled to prosecute

louis piquett a former bartender and chicago ganglands melodramatic mouthpiece is escorted to the cellblock by jailor lewis baker
dillingers waiting for him
dillinger holds piquetts business card
they shake hands
you come highly recommended by alvin karpis
what can you do for me
whats on your mind
the electric chair
theres none of dil lingers cocky joie de vivre
thaw s for reporters
is on the bench
dillinger is shackled to his chair
the courtroom is packed
walls are lined with deputies holding rifles
the gavel quiets the crowd
on his feet your honor
are we to have a hearing in accord with the laws of this nation or is the state to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice
the very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice
the clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the czars not the flag bedecked liberty of an american courtroom
i request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith
this is a very dangerous man your honor
lillian holleys nephew and im responsible for the safeguarding of the prisoner
who are you
are you a lawyer
what right have you to address this court
alright remove the handcuffs from the prisoner
your honor wed like to relocate the prisoner
only indiana state prison in michigan city can guarantee dillinger will not escape
i concur your honor
sheriff holley i think its a very nice jail you have right here
what makes you think theres anything wrong with it
there isnt anything wrong with my jail
its the strongest jail in indiana
thats what i thought
but of course i dont want to embarrass mrs
i appreciate that shes a woman and if shes afraid of an escape
im not afraid of an escape
i can take care of john dillinger or any other prisoner
okay dillinger will stay here
dillingers staying in crown point
thank you your honor
the defense will need four months to prepare itself
it should take days
to go on trial in days would be a legal lynching of this lad
theres a law against lynching
theres a law against murder
then observe the law part
or just stand dillinger against the wall and shoot him
then theres no need to throw away the states money on this mockery
to both lawyers calm down
i apologize to the court
indicating estill bob and i respect each other very much
warns estill watch out or hell be putting his arm around you too
the trial starts in one month on march th

warden lew baker emerges from the office
dillinger raises the gun

dillinger grabs two tommy guns
youngblood starts tying up their prisoners
baker stares at dillingers pistol
i was right wasnt i

billie clutches the phone to her ear

baum is listening intently to john dellinger
an acetate disc turns

dillinger ends the call
hamilton waits in a hudson at the curb
madala shakes his head no trace
she knows were watching and he knows were listening

next to him now is red hamilton
the ford drives into the backyard
johnnys out and approaching the rear door his jacket over his right arm partially hiding the thompson

the smile falls off dillingers face
makes himself visible in the doorway
unseen are two big cops with shotguns who stay hidden inside
moves into doorway sports only following orders

he demonstrates that his palms are empty
hes smart enough not to be armed
they thought you might come here
zarkovich is nervous
dillinger reaches for his front pocket
your money is no good
i dont get it
you go talk to your pal gilbert
talk to gilbert catena
dillinger not taking his eyes off windows and doors backs away
he knows there are more men
zarkovich is nervous and frozen because
front sight rests on zarkovichs heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped up winchester
now dillinger pulls the ford out of the backyard with red still on the running board
zarkovich almost faints in relief
pulls to the curb
vestiges of prairie
an old house sits at the back of a lot
a workshop is near the road

red throws two customers outside closes the door flips the sign to closed
dillinger confronts gilbert catena with a pulled from one of two shoulder holsters and dead centered on gilberts forehead
i went to east chicago to lay low
the welcome mat was not out

the deadly look in dillingers eyes leaves no mistake
i am going to ask you once

he hangs up
he gestures to a doorway and stairs leading to the second floor
johnny and red throw gilbert up the stairs first
they see office remodeling in progress
five technicians run wires installing phones
eight clerks with shades on and ledgers man phones
other men are looking over blueprints
they look up
they are jake guzik and his brother phil dandrea and seven or eight assorted syndicate soldiers
come forward to frisk johnny red
they gesture for them to open their coats to allow the search

dillinger turns the man slams a knee into his kidney pulls him back off balance holds him up with one under his jaw as he draws the second and sweeps
wanna know if were armed
he dumps this guy on his ass his heavy shoe an ounce from crushing his larynx
reds two thompsons concealed on shoulder straps are out from under his coat
phil dandrea sits on the corner of a table
only he stays relaxed
k around johnny
what do you see
a lot of telephones

before last month there were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third race at sportmans park
now theres only one
on october you robbed the bank in green castle indiana
you got away with
split ways thats
you probably thought that was a big score
dillinger stares at him
wheres this going
indicates the room this room makes that much every day
that is how money gets made
and it keeps getting made day after day after day
it is a river of money
flowing right to us
and it gets deeper and it gets wider
unless the cops come through that door
but they wont
we pay them not to
unless they know youre here
then they come through the door no matter what
what does that tell you
youre bad for business
what this is is called obsolescence
so the syndicate got a new policy johnny
guys like you
we aint laundering your money or bonds no more
you aint holing up in our whorehouses anymore
thats the way it is
dandrea comes closer to him

dillinger and reds looks say it all
they start out

his voice is clipped and rapid fire
they call crown point clown point

the president of the united states said dillinger is making a mockery of the system of justice in this country
that means i am allowing dillinger to make a mockery of the system of justice in this country
it is a dark cloud
there is a silver lining in that cloud
by escaping john dillinger has given us a second chance to get john dillinger
hamilton has a year old sister in detroit
dump her in the tank
pick up all known dillinger associates
question family members
pierponts mother in indianapolis
dillingers family in mooresville
we suspect all of them of harboring
hamiltons family hasnt had word from him in years
thats the point
motivate them to get word
create informants agent purvis
i want suspects interrogated vigorously
no misplaced sentimentality
as they say in italy and elsewhere these days
take off the white gloves
by this point theyre down the justice department staircase
purvis is dismissed
hoover steps in front of a
where boys aged have been waiting in a line
high voltage enthusiasm suddenly imbues hoover

employees and customers panic
everyone on the floor
this is a hold up
passing nelson youre turning it into a circus
what the hell are you doing
meanwhile a terrified clerk presses a button and the alarm rings loudly outside
id like to know who set that alarm off
who the hell did it
dillinger and red get to the bank president and shove him towards the vault
nelson is working himself into a frenzy
he points his gun at one terrified customer after another
if you want to get killed make a move
what about you

its a lot less than
where in the hells all the big money
a traffic cop roger powers runs up
van meter surprises and disarms him in classical fashion but
through the window carroll sees a motorcycle cop hale keith arrive outside
nelson scrambles onto a desk and fires a burst through the plate glass
i got one i got one

dillinger and hamilton emerge with the bank president four tellers for a scrum of hostages
carroll and nelson
have a ragtag bunch
theyre almost at the car
nelson turns to the onlookers
what are you looking at
nelson fires over their heads
hostages scream and try to break loose
nelson advances on the crowd
out of a jewelry store harry berg emerges and fires at baby face nelson who is wearing a bullet proof vest
nelson sprays the area

with a winchester gets a bead on
he squeezes off a round
the shot hits dillinger in the back of the left shoulder and exits his upper arm
son of a bitch
the second shot hits carroll in the head knocking off his hat
dillinger fires up at the deputy tries to lift carroll blood gushes from his head
he appears to be dead
dillinger leaves him
sixteen year old joe pawlowski fueled by adrenaline runs across the street and jumps onto nelsons back
nelson screaming with rage throws him through a plate glass window fires two rounds and runs to join the others pure chaos
dillinger throws nelson in the car
the car proceeds to an intersection and stops
shouse cant find his place on the
as shouse makes the turn
grimaces with pain
hamilton helps him off with his overcoat
its a tourist lodge a two story log cabin with a bar kitchen and dance floor downstairs and bedrooms above
emil wanatka comes out trailed by his two collies and nelsons girlfriend vi scott
howd you find this place
dillinger looks at wanetka
he trusts nothing about it
couple of chicago guys told tommy
dont worry nobodys gonna find us
he thinks were salesmen
nobody wants to answer
hamilton meanwhile uses atropine sulphate to clean dillingers wound
that would be less than right
still more than a man
leave my money and get out
van meter nelson and shouse exit
we gotta cut loose from nelson
you need to rest up awhile
we dont get out of here in the morning were going to wind up dead
we could head to reno
dillinger lies back in bed looks around the room angry and frustrated
hamilton gets up to leave
i need two more guns red
over we hear the sound of someone screaming and calling out
in the bed his head swathed in bandages
he lapses in and out of consciousness thrashes with pain shouting out
uncomfortable purvis stands apart from the others
agents rorer and clegg are by the bedside
gimme the shot doc
im begging you
not until you tell us
as the pressure inside his skull becomes unbearable oh mother
he begins to scream
it is harrowing
a doctor hurries into the room purvis blocks him from the patient
he shoves him back out the door and follows him
spits it out fury t h e bullet entered the back of his head
it is resting over his right eye
his brain is swelling
he will be dead soon
he is suffering and i need to sedate him
if you interfere ill arrest you
where is he
give me a shot
then you get the shot
where is he
the doctor looks at purvis
purvis remains steadfast
but we see purvis struggling with this
maybe his soul has just gone to hell
rorer hovers over tommy carroll
he blocks our view but his hands press down onto carrolls skull
the doctor walks away
he will not be a witness to torture
close on purvis looks up to see rorer looking at him
rorer is sweating
he has an answer
urgent activity purvis baum and winstead are racing
in the background rorer is on the phone
hurt is checking weapons and ammo
a charter ford trimotors engines rev
into phone place is called little bohemia in manitowish wisconsin
whats the nearest airport to manitowish
agents are throwing on coats grabbing greiades steel vests tommy guns
our group will fly down in the plane
to cowley sam you drive up
looks at fifteen feet below which is lit up
dillinger positions a winchester
autoloader next to the window
moves stiffly across the room to the other window
dillinger positions a thompson on the window sill
then he turns on the radio and tries to sleep
approach the lodge and stop yards away
winstead hurt and agents rice and rorer get out and whisper if you can get dillinger alive do it
if not then you put him down
rice rorer take the back
carter you cut through the woods and come up on the front from the northwest
get up close enough to see if theyre in the barroom
if he is
we know where he is
we go in
if he isnt
o in anyway
too much real estate out here
too many ways forem to get out
and too few of us to blockade em in
we need road blocks
an assault plan
this aint how to do it
we gotta wait for cowleys group
i will not risk them escaping and humiliating us
take the southwest corner
cover that and the front
to hurt block the road we came up winstead has to accept this
he is not happy
baum moves off through the woods
as winstead and hurt start to move off
enter from the barroom
they seem relieved to be away from the garrulous nelson
they get into the chevrolet and start the engine
turn on the radio
collies begin to bark
hears the dogs barking
engages first gear
stop that car
the three men inside cannot hear them
their radio is blaring
appears in the front doorway gun in hand
in the woods sees the armed man framed in the doorwa shouts out bureau of investigation nobody move
chevrolet slowly starts towards purvis and the others police
purvis and from the woods baum open up
agents madala and clegg fire as well
takes hits from the agents tommy guns
glass shatters tires explode
it stops dead
deeper in the woods cover the side windows from where they know gunfire will soon erupt
it does as
and the others inside are firing out windows killing lights
fire only on windows from which they see muzzle flashes
at dillingers window exchange furious fire with rice and rorer at the side of the lodge forcing them back behind out buildings
gunsmoke is thick
fire back forcing purvis to cover
where the hell is cowley
purvis low runs to the chevrolet opens the door
the driver and one passenger are dead
a middle aged unarmed man steps out
bullets zing around him
he promptly sits down on the ground
these are not public enemies
unload only on real targets
bullets cut through the trees
darts from a side door and leaps over the porch firing a tommy gun
bullets strike the trees around purvis
someone got out
is it dillinger
i think so
see if you can head him off
purvis runs into the woods after the fleeing figure
carter baum races off in a car
runs hard glimpses the figure
he fires but misses keeps running desperate
bullets tear into the wooden walls
two men jump out of a back window not clear who they are
sprint down wooden steps to the beach turn left and run along the lake behind the lodge trading shots with rorer and rice
rice is hit in the leg and cartwheels forward
rorer stays with him
running but impeded by his shoulder wound
hamilton helps him
in the background we see van meter and shouse have also bailed out of the house for the beach but disappear into woods to the right
run along the line of the lake but in woods now
runs through trees parallel to them but further away from the water
he catches sight of two figures through the trees playing against the water from yards away
not much brush to slow them
dillinger senses reacts
from yards fires his pump action gauge shotgun four in a burst of speed cover behind heavier trees which are cratered by the heavy shot
and dillinger never stopping out the other side is firing his thompson at winstead as
rolls forward under the two shot bursts from dillinger and
while rolling feed three gauge rounds into the loading port of his shotgun
and he rolls right up onto one knee bringing the gauge onto the fast moving glimpses thru trees and hes firing at
because dillinger and red are beneath the brow of the bank moving fast now and dillinger reloads as
signals above and behind him
who crossed at a higher point on the contoured landscape giving the texans cross fire possibilities and
fires whrthe banks cut by a ravine exactly where winstead should be
and dillinger knows the level of play has been raised by the addition of whoever these men are
as he and red race across the ravine for the high ground advantage
hamiltons legs give way
dillinger hauls him up still on run
you hit red
i dont think so
dillinger looks at reds shirt
a blood stain blooms just above his belt
come on red
we can make it
on the high ground past rock outcroppings towards a house
runs desperately after the shadowy figure
now we see its
who turns and fires at purvis who drops behind a
ahead nelson sees car lights through the trees and
tumbles down the bank onto the road
nelson flags it down an approaching car
it screeches to a stop
its a bureau car
did they think nelsons an agent
is at the wheel
he realizes its nelson
nelson aiming his tommy gun
i know you bastards wear bulletproof vests so ill give it to you high and low
nelson opens up
baum hit manages to fall out of te passenger door and run
hears distant shooting
he races for the road
twists turns fires a handgun misses
nelson fires again
three slugs tear into baums neck
baum topples over a white fence lands on his face
nelson shoots baum again
in pulls out
purvis spills down through trees
he fires ineffectually at the disappearing car
he rushes to baum
a sick gurgling sound is coming from his throat
baums eyes flicker
who was it
was it dellinger
baum shakes his head a fraction
barely audible whisper nelson
baums eyes roll back in his head
purvis runs after the car
he dives through the woods to cut it off at a turn in the road
a mans on the porch having reacted to gunshots
gimme the keys to that car
he tosses them
dellinger already has red inside starts it and blastsr
away from the house
winstead cjim bing out of the ravine sees the car pulling away
he and hurt run for the shoreline to get back to
tear gas billows out the windows
the shooting stops
there is no return fire from the lodge
winstead puts a handkerchief over his nose and mouth and coughing their lungs out and cowering behind the furniture
no one else is there
speeding sees two men step into the road raised weapons
he slams on the brakes
the two men run up shouting get out of the car
nelson bursts out laughing
you dumb bastards
streaked with mud jump in
nelson takes off
tumbles out of the woods onto the road just in time to see nelson in the stolen bureau car disappear around the next corner
he keeps running desperately futilely
madala is next to him reading a map
clegg and smith are in back
they see an oncoming car
the other car doesnt
ahead cowley slams on the breaks
somebodys on the road
running towards them jumps in the packard
turn it around
who was in it
baby face nelson
he killed carter
cowley u turns and accelerates
sees the packard gaining on them
who are these birds
he pulls the wheel to the right
the stolen bureau car is on the shoulder past a blind curve
blasts around the curve tires screaming passes the stolen bureau car
now nelson pulls out behind them
accelerates closing in on the packard
he assaults the fbi
letem have it
becomes twbjanes of blacktop separated by a median with trees
trees are between them
sees homer van meter steady his thompson
cowley hits the brakes locks the wheels
nelsons car surges past spoiling van meters aim purvis fires
packards coming up on them
nelson stomps on the gas
hit the engine
nelson spins the wheel to veer off the highway onto a
hits a berm bounces high and rolls over
struggles to free himself from under shouse
shouses neck has been broken
he is dead
van meter is clear and running
come back here help me you son of a bitch
the packard hurtles towards him screeches skids sideways stops
is cut down right away hit times
opens up with the tommy gun ripping across the chest
as gauge fires
nelson slammed in the chest drops to his knees fights on as
thompson and madalas second round hit at the same time
the s and double odd shot tear into nelsons chest and slam him back
purvis rushes to cowley
moving towards him rest quiet and you will be alright sam
call my wife and tell her
is in agony
dillinger gets in back beside him
hes bought medical supplies from a drug store and whisky
he helps hamilton to a slug and
not like you aint seen a man die before
he puts his bloody hand in dillingers
reading dillingers mind you gotta let
grimacing with pain you gotta let me go john
and you gotta let billie go too
flash of anger in dillingers eyes
never let no one down you care about
you gotta let go
hamilton desperately searches dillinger s eyes for a response
hamilton squeezes dillingers hand and grimaces in pain
he lets out a gasp
his grip relaxes
dillinger looks away
a car pulls in next to his
as the driver gets out he happens tc
giance at dillingers car
in the back of a car
one lying motionless covered in blood the other looking dishevelled and distraught
the driver turns restarts his car and pulls quickly away
bleak and desolate
dillinger is digging
even a shallow grave takes time
he drags hamiltons body to the grave
streaks of dawn light the sky
im sorry to do this to you red
dillinger empties boxes of lye bought from the pharmacy on reds face and starts shovelling earth on his friends body
dillinger sitting on a rock by the grave whisky bottle in hand sweaty and cold at the same time
his stomach is empty and his spirits are rock bottom
he gets up throws away the empty bottle takes a last look at the grave and walks to his car
drives west on troy
the neighborhood streets are cold and empty
but ahead dillinger sees
parked at the curb
two men are inside
silhouettes against steamed windows
theyre waiting watching
he knows exactly who they are
he cruises past without glancing and continues west
the men inside are agents reinecke and rorer
reinep wipes the condensation from the windshield
across the sty et he sees billie through her second story window
he makes a notation
rorer is asleep
checks her watch
rises past her window to turn on the radio
paul whitemans band signs off followed by a geritol commercial telling radiol
and to stay tuned for the will rogers commentary
also a dark haired woman
billie slips her
she made her a sandwich
neighbor takes billies place in front of the window by the radio
in a mans overcoat and hat crosses the alley to the rear of the buildings opposite
watch the rear of billies building
agents ignore a man crossing the alley in the cold night
whats she doing
listening to the radio
emerges from the passageway between buildings in mens clothes looks over her shoulder and crosses into the street
she just stands there
nothing moves under the skeletal elms in the white snow
they stab at her
she cant see in the glare
opens the door
she jumps in
hes already pulling away
madala clegg and the other agents are waiting for a briefing to begin
agent cowley died this morning at am
grim reactions among the men
their lost colleagues and friends
right now all of dillingers friends are dead
hes out there alone
there wont be a better chance to run him down
he could be anywhere california florida
he could be anywhere but he is not
what he wants is right here
purvis looks up and sees the open door
reinecke stands there
a desolate look of failure
purvis knows whats happened
they lost billie
smokes a cigarette in front of a ribbon microphone
the smoke curls into the air
his commentary is intimate and folksy
into ribbon microphone well they said they were going to get public enemy
and they had john dillinger surrounded
they was all ready to shoot him as soon as he came out
but a bunch of folks came out ahead so they shot all them instead
radio audience laughter drive carefully south on clark st
sidewalks are filled with revelers and crowds
they will get dillinger someday
probably when hes with a group of innocent bystanders theyre shooting down and hell get killed by accident
meanwhile president roosevelt got congress to pass a second crime bill
listening to will rogers
which the example of public enemy number one has helped push through congress
it will make all criminal enterprise across state lines a federal crime
nittis hand picks up a telephone and dials
he puts the earpiece next to his ear
and he blows up
to dandrea okie inbred sonsabitches
they did this
that syphilitic idiot babyface nelson
all of them
another interstate crime bill
what do we care
we dont rob banks
everything is interstate
thats the point of being nationwide
v so after they missed all the public enemies at little bohemia the bureau axrrested their girlfriends
the fbi may bat get their man but they always get his woman
radio audience laughs j
edgar hoover does not
head south out of downtown on michigan blvd
a blast of horns declares the death of and the birth of
theyve got recorders now
its a rats nest of cloth insulated wiring
most of the listening stations are abandoned
with headphones noting a conversation on a steno pad
two stenographers are still around
each machine is labeled
madala listens to probasco
next to him is austin state
cant hear agent madala
headphones come off its new years eve roger
go home to your family
thank you sir
lets himself in
auld lang syne is heard in the streets below
the apartment is dark
he stands for a moment letting the darkness wash over him
he allows himself one shot of bourbon
he moves to the large window overlooking the city
he goes out onto the balcony in the cold air
he sees the sparkling lights the traffic the couples the revelers the relaxed celebration
cheering can be heard across the city
he is alone
it is in chicago
he downs the shot of bourbon
drive across the southern tip of lake michigan in te indiana dunes
dunes are lit by the silver moonlight
her head is on his shoulder
she loosely holds his arm
she drifted asleep
now she wakes
she realizes it is new years day
happy new year doll
happy new year baby
he looks at her
its a concerned look
she reads his mind
id rather live on the run with you than live any other way
that says it all
they are both quiet for a long beat
for how long
alvin said this wasnt gonna last
he was right
the world has turned
and theres a sweet score
enough money to go away and stay away for a long time
so whattya say we lit out of here
lit out of here altogether
glows to the prospect
for the first time theres a tangible future
how about we fly to caracas and then to rio on pan am
then an oanliner to manila or singapore
we are f reign looking to them
so they will have no idea who the hell we are
we can go out dancing all night and have a lotta laughs anytime we want
i think thats a great idea
they drive on into the pre dawn of the year
sits in plain view on a chair
his thompson rests against the wall
his sister audrey is giving him a haircut
his father john wilson dillinger drinks coffee next to him
the january sunlight is so direct its like spring
not too short on the sides
comes out the door
dillingers niece comes up with a kodak brownie
can we take a picture
to nephew approaching you got an eye on those federal boys
theyre over having breakfast at myras diner
theyve been hanging around here doing nothing for so long they just know this is the last place youre going to show
this is who he would be if he had not had the troubles in this life a charismatic young man
walk through winter wheat
that how he was when he was a boy
carefree and laughing
not right when his mother died
but afteraz awhile yes
you love him dont you
she touches his arm
he looks back at the house
he grew up a motherless child
after he was there he never had a womans comfort
so i loved him but didnt know how to raise him
and thats the truth
when he come out of that prison he had so many worries
he had a desire to get even
a covey of quail flush out of the wheat
well now he has gotten even
and he has seen the country
and he has you
so he is carefree
but what is next for you and johnnie
to try to live somewhere else
knows more well if it goes okay good
whatever happens he has been my boy
and i have loved him in my heart always
right or wrong no matter what
he is as straight and truthful as the land is flat
she takes his hand and they walk through the fields
in the black hudson
weve entered mid scene
eartenders name is larry streng
w re s the apartment
oakley and potomac
hell give you the keys
they drive north over the clark street bridge
dillinger gives her an envelope
it buys us a month but were not staying that long
pulls to the curb on the east side of the street
billie gets out walks through the crowds down the sidewalk and crosses the street to the bar
move in on the sign
this is the location we saw being tapped at the telephone exchange
watching the distant front of the tavern into which billie disappeared
run right past dillingers hudson
they join more agents flooding into the austin state tavern from the other side
roughly handcuffs billie
who brought you
howd you get here
i took a taxi
theres of them now
shes totally surrounded
races around the block
comes up on the same side of the street as the tavern behind the federal cars
in his lap
he checks his
there she is
wheres an opening
his eyes dart
its now a sea of blue
men surround her
hauled towards a bureau car by reinecke
he tips her off balance
he bounces her off the door pillar on purpose
dillinger sees all this
can do nothing
tears of frustrated rage stream down his face
later he would say he cried like a baby
are waved away irritatedly by uniformed chicago police trying to clear traffic
dillingers hudson drives off into the distance
under a bare lightbulb
if you tell us all about him maybe youll get a break
maybe you end up doing a couple of months on a work farm
like a girls home or something
where is he
where were you meeting
where were you hiding out
or we drop you in a black hole
and you et to shit and piss on the floor and then lie in it all night in the dark with the bugs and the rats
billies evelids fall
she drifts off
reinecke kicks her awake
where is he
closer on her chair
i have to
he kicks the chair again
shes being denied a toilet
the humiliation is part of the pressure
billie urinates on the chair now and the floor
another agent makes a face
what was that movie squaw girl
reinecke has gone out to get water for himself
drinks from a water cooler
in the background are a dozen agents with tommy guns in every corner as if public enemy number will assault at any moment
lady youre stinking up my office
where were you supposed to meet him
he slaps her
billies shoulders collapse
i cant hear you
nods very low
we were supposed to meet
at our apartment
its shot off its hinges
a half dozen agents invac e
one gun goes off
everybody is about to open up until they realize its one of theirs
it is dead empty
reinecke looks at the dust on the floor
no ones been here for a month
walks past holding cell with assorted informants hookers family members
as he passes one we hold on
in a metal chair hands at his side handcuffed to the floor
a large man slams him across the abdomen with a lead filled sap
another agent waits indifferently
enters and crosses through
he cant help but see
hamiltons sister stares vacantly from the corner
bruised filthy dress ripped shes among a sordid group of older women tough hookers drunks a couple of tough dykes in mens lace up boots
liane catches purvis eyes
he walks on
he walks up to billie handcuffed and slaps her across the face two three times
her ear her nose bleeds
he almost knocks her out
where is he
low voice well
rising strength hes way the hell away from here by tow isnt he
she looks up at him
and she drops the little girl act
she sent them on a wild goose chase to give her man time to get away
you wanted to know where he is you dumb flatfoot
you were too scared to look around
you walked right past him on state street
he was at the curb in that black hudson
you asked me how i got there
i told you i took a taxi
and you believed me
he dropped me off and was waiting for me
and you walked right past him
her native american beauty doesnt soften reinecke
he visualizes smashing the bones in her face with his fist
dolores rushes up
purvis you have to stop this
those men cannot abuse a woman in that way
purvis with winstead following moves to the interrogation room
to reinecke and when my johnny finds out how you slapped around his girl
you know what will happen to you fatboy
she looks reinecke square in the eye
grabs his wrist turns him reinecke resists winstead nearly breaks his wrist
reinecke tries to pull away
the smaller man is built of steel cable
rorer uncuffs billie
restrooms down the hall
billie tries to rise
i cant stand utp
purvis doesnt hesitate
he picks her up in his arms and carries her through the office to the restroom in the corridor
she puts her hand over her eyes in embarrassment
doris rogers follows them
in the kitchen waits

rear door opens

take the street car downtown to get my waitressing license
ill take you
its too hot in here
i get us some butter and make fried chicken for dinner
we slide onto dillinger with his wrists under the water
he turns off the tap and starts out
purvis snatches it up
we go tonight
i dont know if to marbro or to biograph
hangs up miss sage
she hung up
it is tonight marbro
or the biograph
biographs on lincoln north of fullerton
pull to the curb and stop
surprised dillinger looks out the window with an ironic expression
be right back
reveal he is parked right in front of the chicago police station on th and state
sunlight cuts through the gaps between downtowns skyscrapers and illuminates dillinger
ill go in with you
strolls into the police station like he owns the place
polly chatters away
he doesnt hear her we see what johnny sees
licenses examination is on the th floor
detective bureau is on the th
here in the belly of the beast
the lopsided grin behind the dark glasses over the moustache
how long will you be
it might take ten minutes
ill meet you back here
he waits as she boards an elevator
as her doors close dillinger follows a group of police bail bondsmen and civilian workers into a second elevator
entering the detective bureau and we move with him past desks and detectives in the open plan office
he walks with cocky assurance
now he turns down an aisle between desks because hes spotted on one of the glass dividers a sign that exerts a magnetic pull on him
it designates the elite
heads right for it
brushes under his jacket his
enters this section of desks
shafts of light illuminate papers
a detective we may have seen at midway airport right past him
wall charts crime photos from crown point the american bank other banks billie mug shots of all his crew are posted on walls
photos of dillinger are on desks
its as if it was a shrine to him
listen to the ninth inning of a white sox game
three others work through reports in shirt sleeves
one glances his way
detective nods back
crosses thr gh it all strolls in the lions den walks in the belly ofthe beast among the hunters
his audacity elevates h it is triumph
with all their resources modern technology
and organization they cannot lay a glove on him
he is better than they are
his gratification is internal
he leaves behind as he exits a wake of absurdity
he passed through and they didnt even know
history was made
like a ghost has gone
enters from the station and jumps in
as dellinger drives off
i have to go back
they needed a blood test
we see the east chicago cops and the ex texas rangers winstead campbell and hurt
twenty other agents are in the small office
is it the marbro or the biograph
we will be deployed at both
whichever one he shows at i will be outside that theater when dillinger exits
i will give the signal to move in by lighting a cigar
anna sage will wear a white blouse over an orange skirt
thats how were gonna know its him
whats playin at the marbro
whats playin at the biograph
it hadnt occurred to anybody to find that out
from newspaper marbro
a shirley temple movie called moptop
biograph is playing a gangster picture starring clark gable
john dillinger aint going to a shirley temple movie
sergeant zarkovich and special agent winstead will be at the biograph
as will i and special agent madala
virgil peterson coordinate the marbro
the rest of you will wait here until its determined which theater
looks between zarkovich and capt
they have to insure dillinger is killed not captured
his watch is open in front of him
in the inside of the case is a picture of billie
he washes the soap from his face
he looks at her
from it dillinger pockets a colt automatic and loads into a moneybelt from rubber banded bundles and puts it around his waist
on a pay phone
patrons buy tickets
puts down the pay phone
mouths not yet to
down the street in a parked car
in the drivers seat is reinecke
hes tense trying to stay calm
on his upper lip sweat beads
does he remember the words of billie about what dillinger would do to him
watches the crowds thin as showtime nears
he gets out of the car
is dillinger a no show
another eviscerating memo from hoover
three figures brush past him
a womans orange skirt
its anna sage polly hamilton and john dillinger
they sweep to the ticket booth pay and join latecomers rushing inside so that they dont miss the start of the movie
dillinger passed three feet from him
anna sage had to sit separately on the aisle some rows back
johnny and polly sit three rows from the screen
manhattan melodrama starring clark gable william powell and myrna loy begins
is quizzed by purvis
the movie runs an hour and minutes and it started about minutes ago so that means it will all be over in an hour
purvis turns away
agent brown whispers in his ear
theyre on their way over here from the marbro
absorbed in the movie
on screen district attorney william powell listens to his secretary
she is against her boss inviting gangster blackie gallagher clark gable his childhood friend to his wedding
remember what happened to that district attorney in the midwest
just for having his picture taken with some gangster
the movie is referring to john di
llingers crown point photo session with his arm around prosecutor robert estill
laughs out loud
the irony is that the gangster who inspired this hollywood moment is sitting right here watching this movie
arrive and purvis deploys them out
except after little bohemia he doesnt tell winstead what to do
clarence and i are going to be in that doorway
feet south of the theater entrance
gerry you get in that car at the curb about feet north
in case he walks north
he aint gonna head north
hes gonna walk south and cut through that alley back to her place
gerry when you spot him through your rearview you come up on him from behind
the cowboys are the only men not deployed by purvis
they call their own shots
take up positions near a rear exit
another two go further down
from the basfement opens
a trash can is put out by a janitor
he sees the two groups of men in the alley and quickly closes the door
managks office janitor enters
theyre comin to stick us up again
hes talking to charlie shapiro the essaness theater manager
in the alley
approaches the ticket seller
theres a sweaty little man that keeps asking when the movies gonna end
across the street theres three four men and theres two more around the corner why are they wearing suitcoats on such a hot night
pretend like nothings going on
he leaves the booth taking the cash receipts
on the phone
district sheffield avenue
get some detectives over here this is charlie shapiro at the biograph
theyre gonna stick us up again
how do you know charlie
i see them getting in position like theyre waiting til the movies over
the alley suddenly is illuminated by headlights from two directions
a rear door opens and before the car stops a chicago p
detective has stepped off the running board with his sawed off shotgun in agent surans face
before you shoot him get his i
who the hell are you
department of justice
bureau of investigation
what do you think youre doing here
were on a federal stakeout
put that gun down and back those cars out of the alley
but stay close because we may need you
you may need us
fuck you college boy
lets see your goddamn badge
surans looking down both barrels
i love you more than anything blackie you know
mesmerized her eyes and soft skin
we see in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen
myrna loys insouciance like billies speaks to him
empty their pockets trying to identify themselves to two huge chicago p
detective whove drawn down on them
zarkovich starts arguing not believing this is happening
more chicago pd arrive
starts across the street to straighten out the chicago p
walks the long walk through the cell block
the actual public enemy watches the celluloid gangster walk to the electric chair
see ya blackie
stops at the cell
die the way you lived
all of a sudden
startle is this a message
dont drag it out
speaking these important words
that doesnt count for anything
theres no more point to it
he sees inwards
and he knows it wont happen
them e no mexico with billie
theres no freighter to manila
he will die
this day this month next month
he knows that in this instant
in this hollywood version of life the power of cause and effect operates on the end as inescapably as gravity
its a core truth
this is the only end for blackie gallagher
and its as true for john dillinger in his life as it is for gallagher
actions and historical forces have made his time be up
dillinger slows the flickering images
his concentration slices time into component parts
gable exchanges last good byes
he warns his d
friend ronald coleman not to commute his sentence
the images play on dillingers face
they take him over alone in the packed theater while federal agents and five east chicago cops wait outside
enters the execution chamber
glances at his watch
he rips a match from the matchbook ready to light the cigar
the lobby is empty
the dim music of the finale leaks out
winstead coolly watches purvis
right hand shakes
he cant control it
he grips the steering wheel to make it stop
ignores the chicago detectives
looks at the backs of heads in the rows in front of her
she doesnt want to miss dillinger if he leaves
the cellblock lights dim a convict says
there he goes
theyre giving it to him now
end title music
the house lights come up
johnny doesnt move
he seems liberated
people in front and behind him start to exit
he sits there holding onto his thoughts for a moment
anxiously scans faces emerging from the theater
are alert in case dillinger exits a rear door
polly takes his arm
anna is behind him and off to the side
theyre in a loose knot of people
he lights his cigar
its the signal to move in
dont see the signal because the chicago p
detective is now shouting at zarkovich
lights a second match
and as he lights his cigar he looks up to see
look right at him
but dillinger does not recognize purvis
saw the signal
hes out of his car
turn left at the sidewalk heading south like winst ad said
they pass doorways
reinecke approaches from feet behind
sees dillinger walking away
if dillingers taken alive hes dead
the chicago cop puts a hand on zarkovich s chest
down the sidewalk past shadowed doorways
hurt crosses the sidewalk in front of dillinger and walks north
hell turn and position himself behind dillinger on the right
these guys are pros
shoves the chicago sergeant out of his way and races across the street
approaches dillinger from the rear
hes steps behind him
purvis is ten steps behind dillinger on the left close to the wall
now purvis reaches for his gun
draws his weapon
he stares at the back of dillingers head
has getting closer
sweat runs into reineckes eyes
this isnt the firing range with a paper target
this isnt theory
this is the beast
the beast is a gunfighter
the beast is better than you
you beat up his girl
your shot will miss
now passerwinstead in the doorway
purvis is raising his mm browning
he doesnt want to be first
steps out f the doorway now and falls in up the center of the sidewalk
reineckes eyes are riveted on dillinger
subconsciously his brain processes what his peripheral vision took in that his intuitive defenses dont like about this landscape
reineckes hand holding the gun is frozen in the air
he lacks the power to pull the trigger
theres the man who slammed billie into that car
dillingers lethal intent focuses on this one target
turning towards reinecke
reinecke has hijacked his attention
dillinger hasnt picked up the others
pulls the trigger
he left the safety on
he fumbles with it
sees all of them right now
he pushes the
in slowed time towards purvis
and bumps into a pedestrian named ella natasky
starts to fall
dillinger turns his attention to her for a millisecond
hes a gentleman
his impulse is to reach for her to steady her
shoves aside the paralyzed reinecke pushes past purvis leans forward and shoots john dillinger in the back of the head
the heavy round punches through dillingers brain stem and exits underneath his right eye
john dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to fall
a second shot from winstead and two more from clarence hurt hit him now
they dont matter
falls through the air
crashes into the frame
one lens of his eyeglasses breaks
the brim of his straw hat snaps
the hat falls away
he struggles but cant move
he tries to speak
stands over him
purvis snatches the
automatic out of dillingers hand
sees dillingers trying to say something
try to form speech and winsteads ear is next to his mouth
we and winstead hear
only charles winstead hears the rest
unloads dillingers gun
his gun handling of dillingers gun is a lot better than his gun handling of his own under stress
what did he say
i couldnt hear him
you look after this
i need to call washington
zarkovich houlders through the gathering crowd of s and newsmen sees the head wound the glazing over of diflingers eyes
he knows hes safe
get dreamy then they seem to focus far away
then they seem to focus not at all
cover his face and keep the damn photographers away
purvis starts away and we see the biograph marquee the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street the alley and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the dead
watches tolson who is at the window
tolson gets a sign
hoover straightens his collar
he brushes lint off his pants leg
alvin karpis comes out
in the hot humid new orleans air his suit coat is off
he carries it under his arm
he crosses the street towards his lincoln coupe
his eyes land on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a newspaper
and while crossing the street alvin slows down
the newspaper hides a sawn off gauge winchester lever action shotgun
leans on a lamp post
his body hides a winchester rifle
he doesnt hesitate
he opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket fall to the ground
he knows instantly who they are and that
they intend to kill him
karpis eyes dart to the roofto isa
snipers on both
in this instant karpis knows he is done
one objective races into his mind stay alive
stretches out his arms wide
winstead has dropped the newspaper
the sawed off gauge is aimed squarely at alvins chest
karpis is displaying he is unarmed
winstead approaches warily step by step
his weapon would cut alvin in half
clarence the rifle at his shoulder inches forward
the ex texas ranger gunfighters with real trigger time have taken alvin karpis
i am unarmed
dont even breathe sudden
are feet from him
clarence pats him down
karpis is clean
the texans cover alvin and move him to the sidewalk near his car
put your hands on the roof of that lincoln
he does other agents come running in
someones yelling we got him
we got him
bring him in
while they wait
where you from
canada but mostly chicago
to both you
fort worth thereabouts
clarence is from tyler
youre a sly old dog
if youd a even had that jacket on
a ring ofc tints with their revolvers out now converge around karpis
to agent any handcuffs around here
they dont have any
they had not planned on needing them
one agent is excited
his gun pointed at karpis shakes
mind asking that man to
to agent put that down
the agent drops his gun
in his white suit and tolson rush in from the dry cleaners where they were stashed
the agents part
they suddenly stand in front of alvin karpis
hoovers chief special is at his side
you are under
you are under arrest for the
wahpeton south dakota bank robbery
tolson waves to an agent across the street
are now released and rush towards us
regains his composure
i heard of your fishing prowess
i myself always wanted to catch a marlin
youre thinking of my partner harry campbell
are you relieved its over
im sure you are
you know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest
why dont you tell me where harry campbell is
after a moment
who do you think youre talking to
hoover is silent
to winstead theres no handcuffs
give me your tie
hoover separates from karpis
karpis said hed never be taken alive but i took him without firing a shot
that marks him as a yellow rat
he was scared to death when i arrested him
thats all i got to say
suydam and the special publicist courtney cooper address the reporters
ill answer any questions
hoover captured karpis
hoover personally placed alvin karpis eier arrest today
karpis reached for a rzf le but the director was too fast
it looks like hes been waiting for awhile
people who pass act as if he is invisible
they look right through him
the director will see you now
purvis stands in front of the desk
on the right of the desk is a plaster death mask of john dillinger
without looking up agent purvis
sees purvis stare at death
a medical student in the morgue made that cast of dillingers face
its a reminder of the war we continue to wage against the punks and hoodlums
purvis looks at hoover
this was the golden boy who hoover came to despise
one thing i learned was that john dillinger was an outlaw and my adversary
but he was no punk
and he was no hoodlum
another is that i have no future in your bureau
and i dont desire one
purvis tosses his badge on hoovers desk and walks out
hoover couldnt care less
pan left and fall extremely closely onto the face of charles winstead
is in an interview cell
in prison issue shoes down the cellblock corridor
it is billie frechette
she walks with two guards behind her
shes surprised to see winstead
how are you doing billie
if you come here to ask me more damned questions
wheres this one or that one
did i know vern miller
who did what
winstead shakes his head no
i didnt come here for you to tell me something
i came here to tell you something
she sees in winsteads face the look of people she grew up with
billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer special agents shes been dealing with
she leans forward indicates a cigarette out of winsteads pocket
he hands her one and lights it
what do you got to tell me
winstead leans forward
they say youre the man who shot him
one of them
why are you coming here to see me
to see the damage you done
because he asked me to
this gets billies attention and she looks more closely at winstead
when he went down he said something
and i put my ear next to his mouth and what i think he said was this
tell billie for me
bye bye blackbird
billie has to rise and turn away from winstead so that he doesnt see her overcome with emotion
winstead knows this
it is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy of john dillingers message and only told her
