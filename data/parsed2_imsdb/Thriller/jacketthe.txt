written by massy tadjedin based on a screenplay by marc rocco april a pure white screen
all of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to
after some seconds of calm water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a mans p
then suddenly the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man
i was years old the first time i died
one more tug on the sheet and we see and suddenly hear from william starks p
the chaos of the hospital around him as doctors and nurses tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers
our glimpse of starks reveals a red stretcher soaked in blood and the severe head wound where a bullets minced his skull
then slowly steadily a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and as his pulse quickens so does the pace of the world around him
i remember there was so much white everywhere
and i felt peace
even though there was war around me
and i felt alive even though i knew i was dead
come on come on lets tag these guys and get them out of here
an intern clipboard in hand stands above starks unmoving body with another intern beside him
intern pulls the rest of the sheet off of starks as the other searches for his dog tags and gently closes his eyes with her hand
intern reading from the tags starks william
wait so how old
searching through records here he is
born in vermont
he hasnt got a family listed
the naval hospitalll figure out what to do with him
as the intern puts the tags back down she meets starks wide open eyes now filled with surfacing tears sadness and life
she stares at them curiously and after some seconds starks blinks and a tear runs down his cheek jarring her
intern calling out oh my god
this soldier is alive
this man just blinked
hes been tagged already
worry about the others
then seeing starks blink oh shit
we need a doctor
get a doctor over here now
as the medical staff rush over to starks preparing needles and oxygen masks starks merely closes his eyes and we follow the now bloodied white sheet as it falls to
a newsanchor interviews captain robert medley s a particularly photogenic and affable participant
the level of arms on the ground really depends
answering a question but no id have to say we havent had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected
have you lost any men today captain
one of my corporals took a bullet to the head but it looks like he might make it
looks that way
we see only the hand and not the man to whom it belongs enter the frame and pull the trigger on a gun
the sound pierces the air and the bullet hits the side of starks head in a flash shaving the skin around it right off
starks convalesces in a navy hospital bed his head heavily bandaged and his arms suited with i
s and dressings as a major a lieutenant and a doctor stand above him
starks face now cleaned of the blood that masked it before is alert and striking
even with the bandages he remains well built and strong like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down
sergeant starks was very lucky
a little more to the right and it wouldnt have wanted to come out
but hes never gonna be able to remember what happened
its hard to say
sergeant starks could have retrograde amnesia or
lowering his voice any form of psychological suppression
its very common with traumas like this
starks cutting him off sergeant starks is in the room beat and i want to know when im going home
when he speaks starks maintains the sharp steady gaze of a man assured of himself even if he is lost among his surroundings
sergeant you have no surviving family in the states
im sure you have friends or distant relatives but unfortunately we have no record of them yet
captain medley has recommended you for the purple heart sergeant
starks lets the tribute roll right off him
he spots the cigarettes in the lieutenants pocket
can i have one of those
the lieutenant lights one for him
there is help for you sergeant
of course there is
their voices start to fade as starks smokes his cigarette blowing the smoke upwards and following it with his eyes
hes finished with these men and everything they stand for
i didnt know where my home was
i just knew i didnt want to be there anymore
starks recovered now walks by himself along a long highway
he seems to be walking away from things even if he cant remember what they are yet
jean price s a hippie who happens to be a mother and her daughter jackie tremble in the cold next to their stalled car
jean sits next to the car holding her knees to her chest more like a child than her daughter
jackie runs her little gloved hand over her moms ski hatted head as she cautiously watches starks approach them
he cuts an arresting figure against the empty landscape
come on mom
dont fall asleep
you two ok
our car wont start
starks looking at jean whats your moms name
jackie cautiously jean
starks takes off his backpack and kneels down
jean can you hear me
i need you to try to wake up jean
jean opens her eyes stone red
your mom take anything before this happened
yeah but i dont know what
beat whats your name
jackie decidedly sticks out her gloved hand
starks smiles and briefly shakes it
starks rubs a hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks of what to do
nice to meet you jackie
why dont you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while i take a look at your car
as starks works on their engine jackie anxiously watches her mother throw up in the distance
starks sees her watching and tries to distract her
what do you think of all this snow
jackie looks at him curiously
starks looks at her and smiles at her honest answer jackie turns her head back towards her mother
but i like it i guess
hey can you reach the gas pedal
jackie gets behind the wheel crouching down in the seat just enough so her foot reaches the pedal
go ahead turn it on
keep pushing it
jackie revs up the engine and a few coughs and sputters later the car settles into a nice working hum
jackie smiling it works
jackie steps down
she looks like she could hug starks and unexpectedly decides to
as starks awkwardly returns it he sees jean lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter
get your fucking hands off my daughter
mom he just fixed our car
jackie get in the car
jean reaches for a rifle in the back of the truck but stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up
look i dont want any trouble so
neither do i maam
ill be on my way
mom youve got it wrong
starks motions for jackie to stop as he collects his bags
youre just gonna walk
yeah ill hitch a ride or something
beat let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel
starks dog tags are tied to the zipper of one of his bags
off her blank look theyve got your name and date of birth for identification
beat in case you get lost or cant remember who you are
jackie still looking at them hm
starks unties them and gives them to her
she reads them
i think i can remember whats on them
starks faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic blackness about him and a confused look on his face as a menacing voice questions him
jackie and jean are the only things you know for certain about that day
are you aware we have no last name no place of residence and no record of any physical presence for these friends of yours
hows that possible in this day and age
starks nods as a muffled objection flickers away in the background
i may need to actually hear that answer mr
with starks answer the background of the courtroom is suddenly illuminated and we see that this is starks own trial
the voice belongs to a satisfied prosecution who turns to face a medium sized crowd watching on
there are three key witnesses called to the stand captain medley starks commanding officer in the persian gulf dr
hale a psychiatrist and officer nash the cop who first came upon the crime scene
their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against starks quickly and confusingly just like it appears to himself
officer nash emotional eddie correcting himself officer harrison was lying in a pool of his own blood on his back
william starks could be blocking the incident
it would explain his well systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother
a delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this
officer nash contd officer harrisond been shot three times
he was long dead by the time we got there
i have heard of gulf war syndrome
the medical community is only beginning to gather information about it
gulf war syndrome
why dont we start diagnosing hard life syndrome while were at it
ive gotten a lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic
sergeant starks was awarded the purple heart
that award doesnt applaud violence or murder
beat it applauds honor
hale contd his subconscious is blocking it the same way it began to in the gulf particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then
the following summations are punctuated by the black fades between them and the simulated black around them as they speak like starks at the beginning of his own testimony
prosecution disdainfully its not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it
he absolutely was
three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another
captain medley incensed war isnt a cnn special
half the shit that went on couldnt be tidied into a top of the hour headline either cause it couldnt be said neatly or cause it couldnt be said at
it was ugly
and they dont put ugly on tv
looking at starks if starks did kill that officer beat you cant hold a man responsible for a damaged mind
for gods sake my client said he thinks hes already died once
he doesnt know whats going on
starks lies bleeding eyes half open by officer harrisons dead bloodied body as falling snow slowly whitens them both and covers any footprints that may have been left behind
we hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment
nearly whispered i dont know how it happened
starks eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness
the judge nods as he hands the jury foreman back the verdict
on the count of first degree murder we find the defendant william starks not guilty by reason of insanity
in his mind starks is walking out of the woods as the sun sets and bounces off the snow all around him
we see jackie watching him walk away into the woods
i hereby sentence you to be committed to a facility for the criminally insane where i hope that doctors and the proper treatment can help you
the judge sentences starks who stares back vacantly like a man who checked out of his life long before this judge decided he had to
a white van pulls up to alpine grove psychiatric hospital a bleak dated facility embellished only by the barbed wire that seems to be everywhere around it
starks anatomy instantly and intensely separates him from the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who might be in it
two members of that staff lead him in
starks i hope that someday you might be well so that we will have lost only one life in this tragedy
thomas becker overworked dogmatic disenchanted dr
beth lorenson s unassuming perceptive and dr
gries s green are convened with other staff at a routine hospital meeting
these doctors deal in the currency of madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on their faces
id certainly say he should be considered violent just given his case
howd he dodge a conviction
his defense argued post traumatic stress and delusional disorder
he evidently couldnt account for a similar incident during his service in desert storm
beat so why isnt he just in the psych ward of the county jail
apparently hes a decorated vet
and had another one testify for him
becker tom do you mind taking him
becker shrugs a nod as the chief moves on to the next order of business
starks is shown to his room by nurse harding stern senior and her henchman damon a burly orderly who relishes his command however diluted it may be
damon unceremoniously puts starks uniform on the bed
he and nurse harding wait at the door for starks to change into it
damon looks at starks his eyes inadvertently conceding that starks is more threatening than the common senile he marshals starks stares him back deliberately conceding that hes right
starks turns around only then looking stunned in the sterile cotton white room wondering where his life disappeared to
starks sits opposite dr
becker in a harsh tiled office
starks wears his blue uniform and becker wears a doubtful expression
from starks p
the drugs theyve already started giving him blur his vision of becker
william can you hear me
starks nods groggily
ive given you some drugs to help with your adjustment
starks cutting him off what kind of drugs
beat cause these seem pretty
well your conditions pretty serious
beat so they say
off beckers steady gaze what
im just looking at you
does that make you uncomfortable
depends on what youre seeing
becker eyes starks mistrustfully
you said you couldnt remember killing officer harrison
beat you dont believe me do you
its not my job to believe you
starks squinting to better see youre a doctor
i would think
becker cutting him off firmly its not my job to believe you or to understand you
its my job to try to cure you and if thats a no go then to
take some kind of care of you
starks flatly lucky me
becker looks at starks his eyes casting shame upon the alleged murderer that sits before him
becker stupefied you shot a man three times first in his heart then in his stomach and then
point blank in the back of his head
and then you just
forgot all about it
a whole life erased with three easy little words i
what would it be if we could all not know what we didnt want to have to face
becker glances at his watch and gets up still blurred in starks p
its only as hes walking off that starks notices he has a limp
from starks p
we follow him walk down the hospital halls even hazier from the medication than before
forms blur into one another and on either side of him is a crazy world with crazy patients whove lost their way in it
starks reaches for the wall and runs his hand over it trying to keep his balance
hes walking towards becker who stands at the end of the hall talking to other patients
starks softly i dont belong here
starks falters but stays up
he turns to see a shell of an old man looking right through him with wooden eyes
starks eyes stay so completely fixed on the old mans haunting sight that he doesnt see whats ahead of him
he bumps right into a hysterical patient whose sudden earsplitting screams peal interminably through the air
starks mumbling im sorry
i didnt mean
i didnt mean it
starks fumbled efforts to help the patient only feed his hysteria more
the screaming is intolerable
starks forced to yell will you listen to me
im not going to hurt you
i didnt mean to bump
orderlies and nurses followed by dr
becker surround them now violently pulling starks off the patient
becker familiar with the patient harold tries to calm him
its ok harold
starks searches their blurred faces and stops on beckers as they restrain him and give him more drugs
starks to becker i dont belong here
becker angrily to the orderlies get him to his room
starks is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears disquieting footsteps in the hall coming closer and closer
what follows happens too quickly for starks to react
gries nurse harding and damon enter starks room
they close the door and deftly administer a tranquilizer and a gag
starks has no idea whats happening to him as they drag him out and his stifled cries ensure no one else does either
come on army boy
time for some therapy
the first face starks sees as the world comes into focus is nurse hardings
around it loom those of dr
gries and damon
a shot of the room shows a constraint ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall
it is the jacket an apparatus designed to encase a mans body
made of coarse sickly stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe then forever burn the skin theyre wrapped around the jacket looks medieval
its appearance suggests its purpose to slowly strangle the life out of a man
starks has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement
even under the tranquilizers starks formidably resists them as the orderlies wrestle to strap him in
then starks sensing as anyone would that something bad is being done to him wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them
wait a minute
becker motions for them to stop with his hand
starks blinks trying to bring the faces above him into focus
i i dont belong here
becker looks into starks eyes
sanity stares back
i dont think you do either
beat but neither of us can do anything about that
becker barely nods and starks is trussed in the jacket with metal clamps
becker writes some details down presumably about starks treatment
a cadaver drawer just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose is slid open and starks already dreadfully sheathed in the jacket
is crammed inside
the orderlies slam the cadaver drawer into the wall
starks is literally entombed alive
they bolt the drawer and the clang echoes through his body
the blackness and closeness of the space choke him as his heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle
we see only the whites of a pair of petrified eyes on a man whos losing it hyperventilating suffocating
for all intents and purposes dying the worst kind of a death
combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of whats happening to him starks sees a single white dot almost like a fleck of dust flitting between undecided shapes
in the blackness until slowly it grows bigger and bigger
its now a pattern of white dots that changes the more starks stares at it
beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that starks tries to discern before they change into something else
only after starks blinks does he start to see the white of the dots is snow from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following glimpses
each hardly longer than the time between blinks
a little river of red marring the snow around it spilling from
officer harrisons mouth just seconds before his last breath
his eyes close and starks sees and hears a flash
from the barrel of a gun fired near him
blood sprays starks hands as he looks down at them and realizes hes in the scene and not just watching it
he looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes
the snow beneath the blood changing to dirt as starks stares at it
this time the little river of red comes from
the bodies of iraqi villagers all still except one
that of a iraqi woman
she unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a corpse and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead content to be
one of them
the only sounds during these dreadful images have been a trapped mans anxious breaths and the beats of a heart pumping so fast it could be a drum
the screen goes black and quivers as starks clenches his eyes shut
just then as the muscle beneath his eyes starts to vibrate something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the drawer
right on his eye
the drop of water is enough to send this man right over the edge
starks eyes roll back into his head and start to flutter shaking the screen right along them until
starks stands outside his body looking at the wall of drawers he is in
he bends down to look more closely at a stain on the floor dried blood and as he runs his hand over it and stands back up he is back
images race past him too fast for him to catch anything but fleeting clips of them
the images are his memory and no matter how badly he wants to slow them down he cant
starks sees jackie sitting by a window in the diner
she turns her head towards the entrance and as she looks there so does starks
that is when he first lays eyes on a woman a waitress worn but still lovely leaving the diner
he is taken with her and for the first time since hes been in the jacket seems calm
just then however the reverie is shattered
the drawer is yanked open to reveal starks still drenched face
becker gries and the orderlies stand above him
take him out of it
the orderlies unstrap the jacket from his body
blood from his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab
starks eyes remain closed
william can you hear me
we hear beckers voice as it sounds to starks
starks eyes open only enough for him to see the peoples faces morph chillingly into one anothers
gries less muffled pulse is temp just a hair under
bout right for three hours of psychosis
thats not enough is it
becker looks at starks battered body
becker wearily indifferently its enough for now
take him to the infirmary and let him recover there
starks sits totally disoriented in the ward with the other more vocally insane patients
he runs his hand uncertainly over the scars on his arm from the jacket and looks around not knowing where his paranoia ends and reality begins
the old man from the previous day is moving slowly with the aid of his walker
he is far less threatening to starks today
just a senile man about to walk into a wall
starks getting up to help him lets get you a destination other than this wall
rudy mackenzie s smart eyes fidgety with an innocent face watches starks help turn the old man around
old bastard hears us im sure
he just doesnt want to bother answering so he makes us think he cant talk
i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue
beat youre the cop killer right
yeah guess so
howd you know
helps numb makes a crazy gesture any active mind
sticking out a jittery hand rudy mackenzie
mackenzie contd welcome to the village william starks
starks doesnt offer his hand just looks back at mackenzie
starks looking away im not really in the mood to talk
thats too bad
i dont believe in disposable language either you know the small talk the little talk
the games something else though
think about it what can we trade with each other in the air between us
running his hand through the air is our court
beat so eager its sad im ready to throw the ball
starks looks at mackenzie and sees that the constant flow of words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his eyes
a dead arm hangs limply by his side like a weight
starks relenting what are you in here for
i tried to kill my wife
dont you go to jail for that
i tried something like times
there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to that
shes bigger than me and shes stronger than me
and i never planned on doing it
it was always in the heat of the moment
i didnt beat her or anything
hell she beat me
but when wed start fighting id go for the knife
then she kept threatening to have me put away and looking around she finally did
as he talks mackenzie notes the scars on starks arms
lorenson observes starks and mackenzie talking and starts walking towards them
yeah well times probably would make you seem crazy
or just plain stupid
youd think by the twentieth time id have found an alternative method
maybe a more effective one if you know what i mean
how are you doing today
mackenzie winks discreetly at starks before he replies
its a hard one for me dr
finally turns to face her grimly the world around me its shrinking
theres not even room for light to make its way in
beat da da bum
da da bum
i feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me doc
only today hes not carrying flowers
lorenson reprimands mackenzie by turning to starks
its better than fine
and you mr
starks already on the defense im fine
mackenzie do you think i could talk to mr
of course you can doc
william it was an absolute pleasure
thanks for playing
just before he walks away mackenzie turns around nervously and uncharacteristically looks starks right in the eye
when they talk you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves dance with them
beat they dont eat you when theres music playing
starks looks at mackenzie briskly wondering if his words were directed or just the meandering of a nut
but mackenzie just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away dead arm in tow
so youre ok
starks still distracted what
i asked you if youre ok
starks suspiciously i dont know
you tell me doc
you think theres anything wrong with me
i dont know
youre not my patient
starks looks away
lorenson gives him a once over
you look like youve lost some weight
are you eating
one of the few things i remember doing is eating
so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams
starks looks at lorenson seeing if hell respond
lorenson looks back curiously at starks pointed stare
you done with your small talk
starks walks away slowly and weakly a fact that doesnt escape lorensons observation
starks walks into the bathroom keenly eyeing the thin slit of windows at the top of the wall
he walks closer to them when he suddenly hears some strained breathing from inside one of the stalls
he checks the first stall pushing it open
it swings both ways since it doesnt have a lock
the sound continues
starks walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then
the door swings all the way towards starks
he falls backwards his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink
damon the orderly walks out
im sorry starks
must have not seen you coming there
starks writhes in pain straining for his own breath now
damon leaning down close to him were you worried about me
smiling thats so sweet
with that damon walks out leaving starks on the floor
starks sits in his room listening to the silence of the night interrupted by first faint then approaching footsteps
closer and closer
then harmfully near until damon and harding enter his room
they pause awaiting a reaction
starks doesnt give them one
you gonna get the fuck up
starks walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own torture flanked by harding and damon on either side
theyre all in the room
starks seems pretty calm
only in a c
do we see his eyes register the jacket
im glad to see youre cooperating this time mr
starks looks at the wide sturdy restraints on it
they would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them
they might even knock someone out
damon and harding move to undress him when starks makes a move to do it himself
they look to dr
becker who nods that its all right
damon begrudgingly lets go of starks but not before he steps on one of starks bare feet
starks doesnt flinch
he merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants
on his way up he grabs the jacket off its hook and using it like a weapon aims to smack it across damons face
damon deftly ducks and the jacket hits becker instead
the force of the blow sends becker down and as he falls against the wall damon and harding leap to restrain starks
becker opens and closes his eyes trying to get them into focus
his right cheek is cut pretty bad
gries helps becker to his feet and picks his broken glasses up off the floor
becker puts them on
hold him while i get the tranquilizer
fuck the tranquilizer
i got a foot
damon kicks starks hard in the back nearly sending him down
thats not necessary
becker looks down and sees his own blood fall on the floor
he looks up at starks who even in his pain looks shocked at the force he just used
let him go
more firmly i said let him go
as soon as they let him go starks lunges for becker pushing him up against the wall
starks stops presumably about to harm becker but unsure even to himself of what hes capable of doing
becker looks fearlessly into starks eyes
becker an inch away from his face what starks
what are you going to do
end me just because im an inconvenience to you
beat just like you did with officer harrison
starks face registers the meaning in beckers words and a look of self doubt crosses his face
the only thing your mind is missing is a conscience
starks lets go of him and as soon as he does damon and harding restrain him
becker calmly wipes the blood from his face looks at his hand shakes his head and walks out
becker how long do you want us to leave him in for
becker doesnt answer
he doesnt even turn around
gries goes after him
just strap him in for now
and damon and harding start to
becker turns around from the window and we see that his cheek is bandaged
he opens a drawer takes out some scotch and pours himself a shot
he swallows some pills with it
after he drinks it he looks up to see gries standing opposite him watching
beat listen i hate to bother you
what about starks
what about starks
should we be
should we be what
trying to change him any way we can
but the jacket
should we be leaving him in like that
becker as if stunned by the question leaving him in
beat the medication im given him is intended to adjust maybe even reset his violent proclivities
you know peel away some of those layers of hate
the jackets merely a safe place for that to happen
the grounds and the halls where i cant monitor side effects i cant predict arent
gries still doubtful but but
becker mocking gries but
but what about the gun
i mean should he have been firing away like that
shaking his head at gries you cant fuck up a life thats already been fucked up
turning away there theres the insurance youre looking for
im not looking for anything
becker shakes his head laughing inside at the worlds stupidity
beat its christmas eve justin
dont you have somewhere to be
becker doesnt wait for an answer just turns back towards the window and takes another sip of his drink
nurse harding turns on the television as damon sits in one of the lounge chairs
ah man look its a wonderful life
you got any booze
harding takes out a flask from her backpack
course i do
smiling and it is the season for giving so lets get to it
damon smiles and rubs his hands together eagerly
a shot of the wall of drawers with no one in the room just someone in the wall
starks finds himself in the physically wrenching place once more
but nothing happens for some seconds
he breathes anxiously not knowing what to expect
his heart beats steadily thump
thump until finally with each beat a small white fleck becomes two flecks
then two dots
then two circles
then the whites of a pair of eyes with a terrific meanness in them
the eyes blink then disappear like they were never there
the pace of starks heart quickens and the inexplicable madness surrounds him once more
the sounds of bombs rage around him but hes in the middle of the murder scene watching officer harrison lie on the floor
he turns to look over his shoulder and sees
through a phosphorescent green night vision camera we see fire flesh and ruin littering the sand
slowly the terrifying images shift to a naturalistic real time documentation of the action the ruin as its occurring
as starks blinks tears fall and he hears over it all a counseling voice
when they take you out to the woods tonight and invite the wolves dance with them
the terrible sounds become less terrible as they fade away
they dont eat you when theres music playing
the scene morphs slowly and the following images appear vaguely forming the walls of the tunnel around him
a womans neck and a small childs hand c
a black and white photograph ext
creek a shot of clear water not too deep
desert iraq a sublime sunset
starks walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the images
they move like theyre liquid and when they settle the whole wall is replaced with one large image of a beautiful woman a waitress standing at the counter of a
coffee shop moving a strand of hair out of her face with her hand
starks blinks slowly struck by this dream of her
he reaches out and closes his palm around her like he might catch hold of the moment with this simple gesture
the whole wall of images twinkles marvelously as we
the waitress early s tired with kind eyes soft skin and a beautiful mouth that hasnt smiled in a long time emerges from the diner
even with no effort she is remarkably pretty
from her uniform we know that her day was spent there
starks simply stares at this woman who seems markedly removed from the world around her
the only fact she wears on her is that shes tired
she spots starks and cant help but do a double take
both are momentarily taken with each other though she tries to hide any indication that she is
she gets in her old car and starts it
as it warms up she looks for starks in her rearview mirror and sees hes still there
he starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car
the waitress treads angrily towards starks
where do you think youre going
starks looks at her
he doesnt know anymore than she does
you gonna answer me
starks just stares
if youre deaf read my lips
i dont need a psycho following me today
beat im not deaf
she turns and gets back in her car slamming the door shut
she starts to drive and starks stares after her
after a few hundred yards she slams on the brakes and turns the car round coming back
then she jumps out of the car and heads back in the diner without looking over at starks
she comes out this time purse in hand and sighs at starks
as if she owes him an explanation i forgot my purse
starks nods slowly
the waitress gets in her car and looks again at starks in her rearview mirror
he has hardly any winter gear on him no gloves no hat no coat just jeans and a flannel
he looks lost among his surroundings as much because he doesnt know where he is as because he doesnt look like he belongs there
she reverses towards him
in case you hadnt figured its christmas eve
youre never gonna get a cab here
she looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel
beat you got somewhere you need to go mister
im not sure
let me ask you that again
this time look around and consider your options
being cold and freezing are his options
beat you got somewhere you need to go mister
starks nodding slowly yeah i do
great get in
so where do you want me to drop you
starks rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it over
she watches him curiously
im not sure
you dont have anywhere to stay
i dont think so
the waitress takes out a flask and a sizable swig from it she swallows it smoothly like someone used to doing so
well where are you from
im not sure
beat i dont really know
of course you dont know
why of course
because in my life it wouldnt make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where hes from and a place where hes going to
itd be too simple
i probably wouldnt know how to handle a situation like that
well you definitely didnt pick normal or simple this time either
she looks over at him momentarily suspicious
he looks back innocuously theres something innately safe about him
at least youre honest
thats some kind of start
starks sees her take another drink from the flask
she pulls out a cigarette and starks lights it for her with some thats great
youre not sure where youre from or where youre going but at least youve got manners
she laughs noticeably more relaxed now after the drink
well you got a coat or something
starks looking down at his clothes no
doesnt look like it
well howd you get here
beat i was dropped off
do you have a motel or something
starks feels his pockets
well dont you somewhere
beat not around here
she casts a long sideward glance at starks taking him and her circumstances in for herself
he looks back gently
all right well get to my place and call around see where i can take you
beat just dont think of trying anything
waitress contd i have the biggest defense for gun control living upstairs from me
shes armed and angry even when shes asleep
she is on the phone calling various shelters
her apartment has some pieces of mismatched furniture along with a string of lopsided christmas lights strewn around the windows in the room
they more than anything else light the place
waitress pleading tone i could have him there in minutes
beat disappointed hmm
merry christmas to you too
she hangs up the phone
that was our last option
what am i going to do with you
getting up thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going
youll freeze out there
you dont even have a coat
no you wont
youll die of cold out there and then ill have to feel guilty
and ive already got more guilt than i know what to do with
beat do you want something to drink
no im ok
she leaves to the kitchen to fix herself a drink and starks stares after her
suddenly a smashing sound is heard as something falls in the kitchen
starks whole body tenses up as he wonders whether hes being taken out of the jacket
that was one of my good glasses
as she presumably cleans it up we stay on starks who slowly gains hold of himself
she comes back drink in hand and pushes the strand of hair in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel
even through her weariness she looks radiant under the christmas lights
she takes a long sip
waitress noticing hes shaken hey you ok
beat yeah im fine
you know what
its christmas eve
and you look clean i mean youre normal looking
resolutely for her own benefit its christmas eve and i have a couch
and sadly no plans for the evening anyway
she looks back her eyes even more tired from the liquor
im not gonna hurt you
waitress softly i know
clearing her throat im gonna go take a bath
make yourself at home
you know fix yourself something to eat if youre hungry or anything
theres nothing to steal but dont be a jerk and take something anyway
and dont snoop ok
beat my names william by the way
waitress shakes her head no no
lets not do the name stuff cause you see i dont want to meet you
i may want to help you tonight but i dont want to know you
starks nods as she walks out
starks still without a coat collects some wood
starks looks in her fridge
theres not much to work with just some jars and plenty of vodka
starks has lit a fire and set out a feeble dinner for them when the waitress comes out of the bedroom in sweats
the best i could do with what was in your fridge
she looks and sees a sandwich on a bun in one plate and a sandwich on two different colors of toast on the other
then she looks over at the fire its obvious from the way she looks at it that its been years if ever since someones done something like this for her
i only lit it because it was so cold in here
im sorry if
no its fine
beat swallow thanks
she turns and goes in the kitchen calling out to him
you want a drink
as she makes their drinks a curious look crosses her face just for a second
theyve sat down to eat under the blinking christmas lights
this is pretty good
they eat quietly for a second
starks looks at her then down at his food still subtly stunned by it all
so youre a waitress right
from the uniform you were wearing
you like it
beat i do it
have you always been a waitress
waitress remembering sadly no
i used to be a nurse
beat whyd you stop
shit happens and your life changes
bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen
beat so how come you dont know where youre coming from
i dont know but i think part of its
starks looks around as he decides to be honest with her
that i dont really know whats real
she stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on her lips
well good for you
beat real is overrated
starks smiles back uncertainly
you dont think thats crazy
beat maybe not
she holds up her glass somewhat sadly
sometimes i dont know the difference myself
and you know something
i think i like it better that way
finishes her drink you want another one
she goes to the kitchen and starks clears their plates
starks goes in the kitchen as she comes out with their drinks
he hears her turn on the radio
she lands on an oldies station thats playing girl of north country by bob dylan
starks smiles a little then realizes he remembers and likes the song
its the first familiar thing for him in days
he walks out slowly to the living room where the waitress sits on the couch drinking
starks moves closer to the radio leaning into it listening and forgetting for a short while only as long as a piece of song everything else
if you go when the snow flakes storm when the rivers freeze and summer ends
please see she has a coat so warm to keep her from the howlin winds
starks listens close smiling a small sad smile
over the harmonica we pull back and see two very lonely people passing time together the way people sometimes need to be able to
this is a great song
you remember it
starks nodding slowly its like i feel like
i know who i am
i just cant remember anything that made me this person
when starks looks at her then hes so close to a meltdown that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it
but hey who can forget those words
the man just wants simple and good things for his woman that she be warm and happy
how hard can that be to remember
may be easy to remember but not easy to get
being warm maybe but look you dont even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire
beat and being happy
you tell me if thats simple
the christmas lights flash drowsily to their own tempo
waitress re the lights why dont i try to get them to stop blinking
she is visibly drained after the day and the drinks
they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen
thats when my father died and before that it was apparently just me and him since i was born cause my mom split
so you never knew your mother
i guess not
but as of now i never knew either
beat how about you
never knew my father
i grew up with my mother
actually i grew up around my mother
she was great though
i mean the way she was with her friends
she was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us
beat she died young
she fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette
beat i came home from work and she was gone
the tears still run after all these years
yeah me too
softly every day for the last ten years
that when you stopped being a nurse
she is surprised that he gleaned the connection and that hed been listening so closely
waitress exhausted yeah thats when i stopped being a nurse
i never thought i could stop being one i wanted it for so long but
you just cant do it anymore when you lose someone like that
you cant take care of other people
she closes her eyes and finally passes out
starks watches her face lit serenely by the fire and the christmas lights
it bears her grief even in sleep
he covers her with a blanket then looks around and spots the only personal effects in the room on her mantle
he walks towards them tripping slightly on a cord from the lights
he stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall
as he pulls himself up he spots what is only inches away from where his hand landed on the wall his own dog tags given to jackie only a couple
weeks ago hanging from a single nail tacked into the wall
stunned he stares at his name and birth date scored on the metal
he looks back at the waitress and then to the few pictures on the mantle they are of jackie and her mother jean
starks runs his hand through his hair trying to swallow the improbability and inexplicability of the situation
starks eyes search the room for anything that could help him figure out whats happening
on the console is an old paper and some mail
totally disoriented starks nearly stumbles on his way to the pile
the label on the first bill reads jackie price
on the second the same
and the third
until at the bottom of the pile starks spots an old newspaper with the answer on its date december
starks is absolutely stunned
starks looks over at jackie and just then the harsh sound of the drawer being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and the image of her starts to dissolve at
this worst moment
he is being taken out of the jacket
gries racked with guilt who pulls starks out
he winces at the sight of the blood and sweat streaked across starks face
gries checks his pulse and cleans his face as best as he can with a wet towel
william can you hear me
his voice echoes in the morgue sounding to starks as it does to us faint and distant
gries drips some water in starks mouth
as some of it trickles out it runs into the jacket burning starks chafed skin
starks eyes flutter and dr
gries pushes the drawer back in afraid of what theyve done to this man
starks clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes
five seconds of total blackness and silence and hes back in
only now hes kneeling beside her sleeping face just looking at it
starks doesnt know whats going on but her serene sleeping face steadies him
he can only call out the name he thinks she might respond to
sure enough she answers with a stir in her sleep
we see in starks eyes the unbelievable connection she is the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in
starks swallowing softly jackie
beat what year is it
jackie in a drunken slumber what
what year is it
jackie barely opening her eyes
starks looks around as jackie moves in her sleep almost falling off the couch
starks picks her up and in her sleep she wraps her arms around his neck
starks tenderly lays her down on the bed
starks picks up his dog tags from the console looks around spots the television and fumbles a bit as he figures out how to turn it on
starks sits down throws back the rest of jackies drink and another shot and looks around nervously unable to explain whats happening to him
jackie sits in her sleep as she wakes up clearly hung over
as jackie closes the medicine cabinet she sees her hungover reflection in it
she puts her face under the water and lets it restore some color and life in her
as she comes up thats when she remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in her sleep
echoing distantly jackie
beat what year is it
she shoots up from the sink staring at her reflection
jackie spots starks asleep on the couch newspaper strewn all around him and the tv still on
hes holding the tags
she kneels down close to his face and stares at him for awhile before starks is jarred
he defensively grabs her wrist as his eyes burst open startling her
jackie desperately who are you
starks lets his grip loosen
beat im william starks
a short look of shock cross her face before she leaps up
get the hell out of my house
jackie grabs the nearest object the iron fork from the fireplace set and holds it shaking against starks
starks stays calm he hardly expected a different reaction
whatd you do
snoop all over the place
you had no right
you had no right to go through anything
beat i know it doesnt make sense
it doesnt even make sense to me
if you dont get out of my house right now ill call the police
starks remembering your mom was passed out on the side of the road when i found you
her name was jean
beat she was dizzy the whole time
jackie trembling why would you do something like this
i tried to help you
jackie im william starks
i can prove it
now youre gonna show me some kind of drivers license
no i dont have anything to show you
im here from a mental hospital
well you belong in one
starks solemnly beat you and your mom were in a truck and she kept a rifle in the back of it
jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes
starks eyes plead right back
im sorry for upsetting you beat but im not lying to you
you cant be william starks
william starks is dead
beat ive been to his grave
his body was found new years day
starks finishing for her alpine grove
thats the mental hospital
how do you know that
i looked it up
then he remembers understanding with a chill that what she is saying could entirely be true
i gave you my dog tags
no you didnt
they found william starks body dead in the snow
howd he die
i dont know
but he did die
starks falters under the news
jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment
she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up
i know what this is
i picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought im just fucked up enough to fall for this
but the thing is i know what im doing when i drink
i just usually dont care
right now i do though
and i want you out
its december th today
no its not
beat its december th
starks desperate that cant be
just i mean
youre telling me i died in less than a week in the time im in
im telling you i dont care what time you think youre in
youre not william starks
beat i dont believe in many things but i believe in death
and it doesnt give back what it takes
so whoever you are
i did a nice thing youve made me regret it enough already so please just leave
but look at me
look at my face jackie
im not lying
i met you and your mother
i told you then that id lost my memory
beat there was no one for miles around so i know you know theres no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying
starks looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave
jackie a little calmer looks at the door like hes still on the other side of it and calls out softly and sadly
starks looks around him and we see from bottom up the exterior around jackies house melt away as starks suddenly faces the massacred village in iraq
shocked at whats happening to his body he looks up petrified
his body is wound as tightly as a knot
again were glimpsing the scene through phosphorescent green night vision intermittently negotiated with real time images
opposite starks stands a crazed iraqi soldier seething in anger and pointing his gun at a little boy presumably belonging to the man not five feet away
next to starks is an angry captain medley ordering starks to follow him
starks is watching himself in the scene
you walk on
they pick up their guns and fire at you you stay
they pick up and fire at each other and you walk on
hes got his gun pointed at a kid
that is not our problem
yeah well none of this is our fuckin problem
starks turns and aims his gun at a crazed iraqi soldier threatening to shoot a child
we hear him yelling in arabic
what starks doesnt see is another iraqi soldier aiming his gun at starks
we are leaving this site right now
starks doesnt hear him hes busy perfecting his aim
starks to the first iraqi soldier hey
at the force of the word the soldier lowers his gun and the little boy flees
starks who is now in the scene himself lowers his gun slightly as he approaches the soldier
neither speaks the others language but theyre both saying everything with their eyes
neither moves his off the other
just then though we see the second iraqi soldier get a clear aim at starks
he takes his shot before anyone else does
starks goes down as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off
he falls to the ground
as the rest of the picture fades to black all that is left is previously mysterious still haunting pair of eyes that we now see belonged to the and over
it all is the now more distant clank of metal as the drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended
becker damon and nurse harding enter the room
you left him in all night
shit hes probably dead
gries defensively i tried to ask you if we should leave him in yesterday
dont get all worked up justin
i expected some common sense on your part and clearly i was expecting too much
beat just open the drawer
we never should have done this to him
well what are we gonna do about it now
nothing is gries answer
still becker seems to share the concern
becker motions for them to open the drawer
they pull him out
starks looks cold and wrecked
impatiently is he dead
becker feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one
to harding and damon get him upstairs
lorenson walks into the ward to check on starks
the attending nurse is walking around the ward
wheres william starks
im not sure
becker had him moved
lorenson walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital peering into every room looking for starks
lorenson spots becker walking out the doors of the hospital and runs after him in only his white coat
lorenson calling out after him dr
becker stops walking and waits a moment registering the voice before he turns around to face dr
lorenson out of breath wheres william starks
hes recovering on the third floor
are you kidding me
hes not psychotic
then how would you describe him beth
hell be a zombie in a few days tom
his behaviors hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics
and you know that from what a couple two minute stares across a room
lorenson firmly he didnt need anti psychotics if thats even all youre giving him
becker ignores lorensons insinuation and merely turns his cheek all the way round towards lorenson so he can see the bandage from the cut starks gave him
becker steadily after he slashed me with a hospital instrument i determined in my professional opinion that mr
starks needed a little placating
beat you sure he wasnt provoked
you sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation
beat i took five stitches during a routine therapy session
im sure he took some too
becker smirking unphased happens sometimes when youve got to restrain them
you watch the rest of us work
you know that
lorenson appealing to him our patients are sick
yes they are
lorenson looks at becker he knows hes hiding something
hes not gonna end up like casey tom
whatever happened to him is not going to happen to starks
i dont know what youre trying to do here but hes not a lab animal tom
you cant reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment
jesus you really dont let up do you
just because you failed your patient doesnt necessarily mean the rest of us did too
beat sorry to tarnish your war heros image but he is psychotic
lorenson looks back starting to grasp beckers misshapen beliefs
now if youll excuse me its christmas and i have a family id like to see
starks iv in arm lies asleep in bed recovering
jackie walks in a hospital with many aspects parallel to the mental hospital
white on white and for jackie particularly the presence of painful memories
lorenson walks closer to starks and carefully examines the bruises and burns on a body thats been badly beaten
his eyes bear his guilt
jackie waits until a nurse claire greets her perfunctorily
claire not looking up how can i help you
claire looks up astonished to see her
she smiles warmly
how are you honey
beat i need a favor
starks is asleep when a dark figure walks like a ghost past the windowed door of his room
starks opens his eyes and snaps his neck in its direction fearful of everything at this point
when he looks theres nothing there hes not sure there ever was
the room starts to blue as he looks around it not knowing if he is crazy
jackie peruses headlines and abstracts pulled up on the web alpine grove investigation into the mysterious death of william starks
the body of william starks the former war hero who was charged with the murder of officer edward harrison was found on the grounds of alpine grove on january
starks was believed to have died from a wound to the head
the words and phrases that confirm starks story rise from their couched places on the computer screen
local doctor charged with medical malpractice
thomas becker resigns
it involved the recreation of a womb like environment
former patients testify to being put in instrument known as the jacket
patient rudy mackenzie testifies
william starks laurelled war hero
as jackie keeps scrolling her face wears her disbelief that what starks was saying may have been true
then she sees archived in a state newspaper a mention of dr
lorenson and a particular patient eugene yazdi
local boy eugene yazdi overcomes absence seizure syndrome to win mathematic decathlon
with the aid of local doctor dr
panelists for national epilepsy conference include dr
lorenson alpine grove hospital
a nurse is checking on starks as he slowly wakes up
what the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me
starks is asking the nurse but its beckers voice that answers though starks cant see him
just something to help you sleep
starks panics when he hears the voice
he looks around nervously but the bright sunlight pouring into the room is blinding
he swallows as he looks at the nurses face as she continues adjusting his pillows
starks swallowing nervously did you say something
the nurse shakes her head lightly and just then becker steps out of the light
i said the drugs were to help you sleep
beat did you sleep well
becker is remarkably calm further confusing starks sense of reality
starks doubtfully but i wasnt asleep
you were asleep for nearly a whole day
its december th william
starks sits up groggily remembering what happened to him and wondering how much if any of it was real
its december th
starks examines himself looking at his arms spotting the bruises on them
thats right william
starks slowly figuring it out
starks sits up his predicament and the room slowly coming into focus
caustically and thats the sun and youre on earth
beat and i know you know better
starks begins to piece if together
becker as we begin to see is right
it is in alpine grove
i dont know better
all i know is that you left me in there
uncertainly in that thing
the nurse gives becker a knowing look suggesting starks really is delusional
becker doesnt even flinch as starks tries to get a better look at beckers face
we were forced to use restrains if thats what youre referring to
that wasnt a fucking restraint
actually thats exactly what our equipment is
starks eyes widen with alarm as becker reaches for the i
in his arm lingering on it long enough that starks braces himself for an attack of some sort
but becker just looks back innocently as he adjusts it
dont act like i dont know whats real
beat im not the one thats crazy here
pointedly of course youre not
then he clarifies wryly enough for starks to catch it
youre just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition
dont give me that
i know whats real goddamnit
you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer
becker nods diagnostically
the nurses nonchalance about it as she leaves the room further disquiets starks
i didnt dream it
i may have been asleep but it wasnt a dream
becker sits down in a chair half shrouded in the light
i had a patient a few years ago
his name was ted casey
i dont give a shit about your patient
i wasnt pausing to see if you did
beat but incidentally you should because youre birds of a feather
starks squints as he searches out beckers face
ted raped and sodomized a seven year old girl
beat his lawyers asked me to have a look at him because after his deeds were done
he climbed into the trees of the forest where he killed her and woofed like a dog
he couldnt even remember his name when i spoke to him but curiously enough he could speak back
beat ted never went to prison because everyone including me was convinced he was sick
so he came here
becker leans into starks view to make sure hes listening
then one day a little girl came with her mother to visit a relative and i caught ted stealing looks at her the kind you really have to steal if
you know what i mean
beat i asked ted then if he could remember what the little girl who he had
slain was wearing
beat he gave me a look ill never forget and when he answered it wasnt with a color or any sort of physical description id expect
oh yes he said
i remember it
i remember it well
beat those were actually his last words i think
beckers expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and remorse as he recounts teds tale
we are not birds of a feather
beat but i do think youre in a tree
woofing like a dog
and im just trying to help you the only way i can think of
becker gets up and as he moves out of the light starks sees his bandaged cheek reinforcing his memory of what happened
starks provokingly what happened to your cheek dr
i was careless
starks looks out on the snow covered grounds from his room on the third floor
he seems pacified for the moment
everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad mechanics of managing madness
catatonic patients and dated equipment litter the hall and as we follow a nurse who walks among them we spot starks arms suspended in air and glazed eyes fixed on
the ceiling pretending to be one of them
his arms fall and he wipes his dried mouth as soon as she passes
starks has successfully made it out of his room
she turns one corner as starks hustles to turn another
starks is almost there
as random orderlies pass him starks lets his posture collapse as he despondently hangs his head down so low they cant see his face
they pass and starks starts scuttling towards the door to the outside
as soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold with only his blue patient uniform starks walks normally like he no longer remembers the risks
instead he remembers what jackie told him
they found william starks body dead in the snow
howd he die
i dont know
but he did die
starks leans down seemingly oblivious to the cold and lifts some snow to his mouth tasting it like a man who needs to affirm he is still alive
hes so rapt that lorensons voice takes him by surprise
youre not supposed to be out here
starks stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where his body was found
the terrible question asks itself on his face is this when starks is killed
starks turning around sharply what are you going to do to me
as lorenson reaches into his pocket for something starks anxiously holds his breath
its black when it comes out and
a ski hat when it opens up
starks lets out his breath relieved
lorenson nonchalantly i thought id just ask you to come back inside with me
and if i didnt want to come
i guess id ask you why
because i dont think im crazy
youre not crazy
starks is surprised by lorensons agreement
you suffer from delusional disorder
that doesnt mean youre
it just means youre confused
and youre here instead of in jail because that was determined to have played a role in your killing of a police officer
starks correcting him alleged killing of a police officer
you were convicted of the crime
that conviction doesnt convince me of anything
until i know that i did it im not going to accept that i did
you may never remember at all
beat your minds grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up
not my mind
lorenson seems to realize at least for an instant that he is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively and cogently staring back at him
beat william id like to ask you something if i can
since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything
lorenson suspiciously hows your treatment progressing with dr
starks still doesnt know how much lorenson knows and if he should trust him
beat why made you ask
lorenson answers first with his eyes looking over starks body
starks merely stares back tersely
lorenson carefully i just hope youd let me know if that wasnt the case
why what would you do
i could try to
make it stop
i dont want it to
so its helping
starks choosing his words carefully beat its making me feel like a different person
lorenson sensing shes not going to get any more from starks turns around to go back inside
its only as she turns her face away from starks that we see how nervous she is
but youd never guess it from her tone
lorenson casually you comin
starks looks towards the fences locking him in from every direction
lorenson waits until she hears starks footsteps following her
she waits until starks has reached her
you should be careful
you could be killed if they found you out here
believe me i know
starks and mackenzie are eating opposite each other
what were you talking about the other day
i wasnt talking about anything
yeah you were
what you said about them taking me out to the woods
mackenzie clams up slightly at the mention of it
what do you know about the jacket
mackenzies eyes start to twitch nervously
i know you need one when its really cold
cutting in mackenzie listen to me
im going to die
mortalitys actually a great thing to be familiar with
it means youre sane on some level
gravely no i mean in four days im supposed to die
beat how do you know
mackenzie grows visibly more nervous at this second mention of it
oh no youre pretty young
your bodyll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think
beat i mean i found out while i was in it that my bodys gonna be found in four days
just then nurse harding is upon them
she carries a rod in her hand which she taps menacingly on the floor as she walks towards them
what are you two yappin about
starks tenses up as he sees only the rod which could inflict a gash if hit across a mans head the right way
nearly every object could be a threat to his life as this point
mackenzie spoken like a nut beat were talking about our ability to go forward in time to go into the future
to starks that is what were talking about here right
starks is startled mackenzie gets it
yeah it is
you know something
youre two fucking freaks is what you are
starks smiling well no shit einstein
what do you think were doing in this place
mackenzie tries not to laugh but a chuckle slips out
i want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food
harding walks away with a final stare that starks returns
starks under his breath i gotta get back in it mackenzie
its gonna be sticky
mackenzies body betrays his discomfort talking about it in its sudden jerks accompanying every word
cause lorensons got her claws in it now
when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me
so what am i supposed to do
you could still always give becker an itch
course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me youre saying thats about to happen anyway
beat just be careful not to walk yourself right into something
lorenson and dr
gries are walking briskly to a meeting
i wish theyd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget
our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we dont have
maybe its not such a waste
lorenson looks at gries askance before she sets the record straight
its the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about
they dont care about all the things we do right
beat but they might they might care about what were doing wrong
beat thats what they should come here to look for
lorenson can see gries is trying to tell her something
what should they be looking for
they should just be looking harder
lorenson grabs gries arm sensing the import of her words
beat its becker isnt it
hes doing stuff isnt he
ill tell you about it later
we got a session to catch now
starks is in a different ward with patients who appear more threatening and disturbed
as he is anxiously looking around presumably for a way out starks hears one of the patients humming an eerily discordant melody
looking to see who it comes from starks happens to spot one patient a young fierce looking guy eyeing a young nurse sally administering medication from a dated cart
starks looks around the room and notes there are no doctors or orderlies around
the young nurse meanwhile is focused on the medicine oblivious to the brute eyeing her
the brutes not that far away when he starts walking towards the young nurse
starks starts in their direction picking up speed maneuvering through various incoherent patients as the brute reaches the nurse
he throws her tray down and pushes her against the wall
she starts screaming as he pushes up against her
starks picks up the tray and strikes the brute across the head with it
the brute holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his balance
its clear hes impaired
but its also clear he understands pain
starks to sally you ok
as she nods her eyes dart above to the hand about to strike him
off her look he ducks and turns around punching the brute in the stomach hard but not before the piece of glass he held from one of the broken medicine
bottles comes perilously close to starks head
the brute bowls over and starks looks at the glass terrified
is this when he dies
the brute incensed more than ever lunges at him a final time
starks gets him by the neck expertly applying pressure points and after only a few seconds subdues him
starks himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them
he lets out a suspended breath instinctively touching his forehead to make sure hes not cut
he looks back at sally
are you ok
yeah why are you in this ward alone
where is everyone
sally defensively theres a state rep visiting so theyve moved everyone around
but ive been alone before
where are the other orderlies
in the therapy session downstairs
thats what the reps sitting in on
i want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you
ill go get some doctors
sally looks at starks wondering whether she can trust him
her eyes shift to the brute on the floor and she remembers that she can
the state rep s disgruntled even drowsy is recognizable among a group that includes the chief of staff dr
williams becker lorenson and gries
they are presiding over a group therapy session when starks enters
starks calling out sorry im late dr
becker is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response
starks this session is for our civil patients
damon please take mr
starks back to his ward
starks cuts him off and threatens with his gaze
starks derisively no
you can strap me in a jacket or even gag me but please dont leave me out of therapy
this is where i feel like i make the most progress
becker relents seeing starks has the upper hand an audience deranged but eager no less
you can pull up a chair for yourself
as starks walks across the room its obvious to everyone as they turn their heads to watch him that he is a physically ailing man
using all his strength he walks up slowly to the group dragging a chair behind him because he doesnt have the strength to lift it
starks sits down
jensen please continue
jensen a twitchy schizophrenic surveys the group seriously determining whether its safe to say what hes about to
well beat ive been approached by the federal trade organization
beckers not listening to a word jensen says
but starks is
becker calm as ever and what have they approached you about mr
they want me to head the organization for the organized
the other patients look at him in wonder as the state rep listens limply
for the organized
have you heard of them
i have not
thats because there is no such organization you idiot
that is categorically not true
bl bl blatantly and manifestly not true
ive been asked to lead them
but if youd heard of them then they wouldnt be hush hush would they
becker wearily what do the rest of you think
the group stares at one another silently
starks loud and emphatic well beat i know they exist
and how is that
starks looks at jensen who looks back avidly
mackenzie eyes starks nervously like he senses what he is about to do
when i was in the gulf the organization was recruiting the organized
becker incensed is that a fact mr
because if its not it doesnt help mr
starks looking right at jensen it is a fact
bona fide and classified
lorenson and mackenzie watch starks curiously
i knew it
i knew it
those little fuckers are everywhere
they recruit only the best mr
beat i didnt want to have to say this
not even the doctors dare disrupt the silence
but these people pointing to the doctors know about it
in fact when presidents of this country and heads of state leave office they come here to alpine grove
theyre among us right now
looking right at becker isnt that right dr
and jensen im proud they picked you
jensen looks on nobly
theyre always ordering us to stay calm but how can we be calm
starks suddenly turns right at becker wrapping his message to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut
looking suddenly directly at becker all they do is give orders
thats all they have to do
and no one will ever know
all it comes down to is an order
beat theyve got hands everywhere
starks stands up ready to salute mr
the observers look to becker for order
long live the organization for the organized
sit down mr
sit down mr
but at that jensens completely lost it
his excitement erupts in the form of him jumping out of his chair and eagerly and elatedly hitting himself in the head
sit down mr
other patients are on their feet hands jubilantly up in the air
and in the midst of the havoc the speechless order is soundly delivered in beckers nod to damon
damon and harding grab starks while the other members of the staff slowly calm the other patients
lorenson is too busy to notice them taking starks out
starks winks at mackenzie who smiles somewhat sadly back
harding and damon stand above starks who lies on the brutal slab already hemmed in the jacket
starks youre like a mule
youre real stubborn
but theres ways of fixin that
all you need is a good stick
beat heres your stick
damon slams him in the drawer
starks eyes dart about him it sounds like something is in there with him
the sound stops momentarily and then out of nowhere a drop falls on his eye
he clenches his face not knowing when the next drop will fall
his heart starts to beat more and more madly punctuated by the drips making a score fit only for hell
he closes his eyes and begins to die
starks and tenny s shifty a total stranger sit in silence in tennys car
we recognize the murder scene
red police lights flash in the rearview mirror though starks doesnt see them yet
starks and tenny are talking to one another
tennys voice takes a dangerous tone
you ever been to jail
tenny nods distracting starks long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the gun hes hidden there
its worse than war
its worse than anywhere youve ever been
i doubt it
beat i dont think prisons so bad you dont want to remember it
tenny carefully pulls over to the side of the road assured and cautious with each word each move
well ive never been to war but im sure as hell not going back to prison
starks finally spotting harrison whats he pulling us over for
tenny still preparing himself recreation
officer harrison walks up to their car
gentlemen im gonna need you to step out of the car with your hands at your side please
officer harrison sternly step out of the car
i was just asking what for
this is a stolen vehicle youre driving
now put your hands in the air out where i can see em
thats the second when officer harrison sees where tennys hand is
as he reaches for his own gun the situation explodes as two flashes eclipse all else
officer harrison goes down still holding his own gun and starks jumps out of the car to check on him
jesus christ whatd you do that for
tenny looks around still holding the gun
starks swallows assessing whether to back away or not
tenny waves his gun as he half points it in harrisons direction
then gun still in hand he smirks nervously and looks at starks
man if youre so deaf and dumb you aint even worth a fucking bullet
tenny raises the gun then aims it away from starks and shoots officer harrison once more
from the ground officer harrison fires back and starks now lunging at tenny takes starks falls clearly unable to get up let alone pursue anyone
tenny smiles sardonically and slowly puts the gun in his back pocket as he turns to leave
this smile was one of the eerie flashes that haunted starks in the jacket
starks struggles but cant move
thats when he passes out looking at officer harrison from the ground as he did in the scene before
starks stands in the lighted tunnel which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that hes back in there
then he sees an image of a womans forehead that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the light gradually dims
starks enters the diner calming down even more as he spots jackie
she looks up holding plates in her hand
shes understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she sees him
she greets him with a small smile
she drops off her orders and then walks up to him
ill be off in minutes
can you wait till then
starks and jackie smoke in the cold standing next to the hood of her car
thats what they call it right
it was banned you know
and it led to an investigation of dr
beckers mistreatment of some of his patients
thats when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients
starks starting to make sense so he was giving me all kinds of drugs
jackie nodding apparently
he was taking a lot of them too
it said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the s womb treatment is the name he gave to what he did to you
starks cutting in womb
a fuckin womb
what kind of animal did he come out of
but no one knew until after
beat you bled to death
i dont know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it
starks digesting and youre sure my body was found on january st
do you really believe me
i dont know
beat i thought i was crazy after you left that day
i still think i could be crazy
but then i replayed that night in my head the parts of it i could remember and it was like
i dont care if i was or am
i havent felt that way in a room with someone my whole life
beat and when you left all i wanted was
jackie looks around her coupled with the cold her sobriety is obvious
starks takes hold of her and holds her face close to his so that their foreheads touch
softly i want to trust you
should i trust you
then we need to figure out what happened to you
its the only thing we can do
alpine grove still exists
i looked it up on the net
we should go there and see if theres still anyone around who might have known what happened to you
if they dont take me out before then
as an afterthought whats the net
jackie looks at him and laughs
they are driving through vermont to alpine grove
starks looks out the window and watches her drive
i didnt kill officer harrison
did they figure it out after i died
they never figured it out
most murderers dont stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road
not without hurting them
starks and jackie sit opposite dr
morgan the current young face of the hospital
morgan has a boyish face and a matching gullibility
im sorry i cant tell you more about your fathers death mr
our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine groves staff changed and im
afraid we didnt have the best record system before then
his body was found on january but do you know if that was long after he had died
no i dont
i wish i knew more
what about dr
thomas becker or dr
there was also a dr
gries i think
lorenson is still here at the hospital
if she was here at the time your father was then im sure shed be of more help to you
what about dr
becker and mr
unfortunately im not familiar with dr
becker and dr
gries passed away three four years ago
do you have any kind of forwarding address for dr
your father was here years ago
i doubt the hospital would have that if dr
becker is still even alive
beat a little suspiciously is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died
starks doesnt waver when he answers
he was the only family i remember
morgan nodding ill see what i can find out about dr
and maybe dr
lorenson will know something
morgan leads jackie and starks through a ward
starks looks around in disbelief its more like a hospital now than it ever was in
as they arrive outside lorensons office morgan turns to them
let me just tell her were here
morgan goes inside and jackie takes starks hand as they wait
its hardly more than a couple seconds when lorenson appears in the doorway
she looks at starks curiously and the two share a very lengthy intense stare
lorenson now in her s walks closer to starks suspiciously
for his part starks doesnt look as unfamiliar with lorenson as he should this doesnt escape lorenson
im beth lorenson
she puts out a hand that is trembling slightly
its nice to meet you mr
starks hesitates before he takes lorensons hand
there is something very eerie about the exchange
starks quickly lets go and lorenson turns to jackie
and you are
jackie looks back uncomfortably
im just williams friend
lorenson looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to dr
i think well be fine from here
lorenson leans against her desk while starks and jackie sit in the chairs
as they talk each seems cautious in his exchange not knowing what the other one does or doesnt know
my god you look exactly like him
i never knew my father
yeah i did
beat he was my most memorable patient
lorenson considers her answer
at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things
you thought my father was crazy
i dont think he was crazy
he needed help
but he wasnt crazy
beat your father actually helped me with a case of mine
lorenson waits to see if starks knows what she is talking about
i was working with a boy named eugene
starks shows no recognition but jackie does
who was eugene
lorenson peaked he was a friends son
beat are you familiar with the case
just a little when we were looking up information about williams father
how did he help
its complicated but looking at starks in a way your father let me know how id get through to him
he just said
that id shock eugene and then things would change for him
i dont understand
i still dont either even after all these years
do you know how my father died
lorenson unconvincingly i dont know how much i remember but i seem to think it was from a
cut or blow of some sort or another
howd he get it
beat i dont know
morgan said you were around when my father was
but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows
im sorry i dont know more about your fathers
sincerely i didnt know about everything that went on here
lorenson says it like shes hiding something
well do you think dr
becker would have any idea
how do you know about dr
my dad wrote some things down before he died
lorenson looks like shes suddenly remembering something
starks looks at lorenson curiously he doesnt know what lorenson is talking about
so maybe dr
becker would know
beat but as im sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities
why would we do that
starks just stares at lorenson not knowing if he died by this mans hands or not not knowing who he can trust
because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups
i see youve done your homework
beat alpine groves undergone a lot of changes since then
at the time we didnt have the
resources to help our patients the way we needed to
beat now we do
and things are different
i wouldnt be so sure
like you said about back then you might not know everything going on around here
lorenson looks right at starks
its important for you to know who your father was isnt it
beat yeah it is
lorenson eerily its almost as if your life depended on it
beat let me know how your search turns out
beat we will
starks and jackie walk briskly down it away from lorensons office
i dont believe a thing she just said
who was the boy she was talking about eugene
i have no idea
you think lorenson kills you
i dont know
seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
lets see if they have an address for becker
i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with
because thats the part i believe is true
you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugenes name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled
beat theres one more thing i want to see
starks determined now leads jackie
as they reach the end of the hall we see damon now in his s look after them curiously before he goes back to his work with a patient
jackie watches starks ignore the authorized personnel only sign as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause
the morgue looks exactly as before
starks is momentarily jarred in the room
he looks to the wall on which the jacket hung and sees only the bare hooks that used to hold it up
this was the room
they used to hang the jacket there
turning to jackie this is where it happened
this is the room im actually in right now
jackie isnt doubtful but its also hard to be convinced
i can show you
its probably in there
starks walks to the cadaver drawers and rests his hands on the one they put him in
then with great difficulty physical and emotional he opens it to see if there is anything left
he pulls it out and theres nothing in there
maybe this wasnt such a good idea
starks leans closer locating all the proof he needs the stained metal still reddened and browned with dried blood and the part of the morgue slab he clawed his nails
into when he was in it
jackie looks at it in disbelief
yes it was
softly my fingers were the only things i could move
beat dead bodies dont bleed
and they certainly cant claw so hard they dent metal
starks and jackie are leaving the morgue when starks spots damon now hardly a hair of the bully he was before
damon stares at him curiously starks glares back furiously
you folks aint supposed to be down here
we were just leaving
damon doesnt take his eyes off starks
do i know you from somewhere
you may have known my father william starks
damon smiles remembering
goddamn youre the spitting image
i didnt know he had a son
he didnt either
damon with a dirty laugh ill be damned
he musta been when he had you
beat you could be his ghost
did you know my father
oh yeah sure
he killed a cop right
starks looms strangely over damon in this exchange
you wouldnt happen to know how he died would you
damon slightly apprehensive no i dont
i just remember them finding his body
you dont know any more damon
damon shocked howd you know my name
my father used to talk about you
oh yeah whatd he say
damons eyes betray his unease
he said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail
damon is shocked and cowed
so much that he shakes as he looks for his bearings
look here i dont like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
thats too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
beat did you have anything to do with his death
i dont know what youre talking about man
this is some weird shit youre telling me
and i dont know how come youre doing it
starks starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and distraught before him
he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head
someone had to have given him it
i never touched your father
damons eyes are filled with dishonesty tears and a craven fear
starks leans in closer to damon as he remembers
you know something damon
youre like a mule
youre real stubborn
but theres ways of fixin that
all you need is a good stick
beat heres your stick
live with it
starks looks like he could easily bash damons head against the wall but instead he lets it go and walks away
starks is standing above his own headstone william starks december january
next to his grave is that of rudy mackenzie
starks looks down sadly at both
jackie comes up behind him
how long do we have
i dont know
they told me beckers in shelbourne now
i looked him up and he was listed
starks looks scared and lost like its all catching up to him
and like he might be being taken out of the jacket
how far away is that
jackie kisses his scars from the war and the jacket and starks lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make love for the first time
jackie is lying in starks arms running her fingers over one of the scars on his chest
starks strokes her hair
what about captain medley
he never told them what happened to you over there
that coward wanted them to think you were crazy
it was perfect
beat erase my sanity and you erase anything ill ever say
jackie frustrated well doesnt what he did to you make you mad
of course it makes me mad
it makes me more than mad
just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him
but whats it gonna do for me to find them now
i cant fix everything in three days
youve got to get yourself out of that place
theyre going to kill you if you dont
i might not be able to
its not a prison its a hospital
theres got to be some way out of there and youve got to find it
she doesnt finish because its too hard to
starks nods wiping her tears and kissing her
the sore sound of the drawer being opened stirs jackie awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep
she reaches across the bed but starks is no longer there
she runs her hands over the bed like hes alive in the sheets
lorenson is administering medicine to a patient in the ward when she sees almost like a shadow a stretcher being wheeled down the hall
she finishes with the patient and runs to the end of the hall in search of it
starks lies recovering under a small light above his hospital bed
his body bears marks of the brutalization
as we pull back we see dr
lorenson standing guard over him at the foot of his bed
starks sits by a window i
s in his arm smoking feebly still severely weak from the jacket while dr
lorenson observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside
youll die if you keep smoking those in your condition
ill die either way
lorenson pulls up a chair and sits opposite him
i cant try to help you unless you let me
beat i know about the jacket
starks waits to see what this means
im sorry for what you were put through and im sorry i couldnt stop it earlier
but i promise you that i will from now on
starks cutting him off i dont want you to
lorenson doesnt understand
what do you mean
you have no idea whats going on
no i do
thats what im saying to you
listen to me
the jacket is my only chance in this place
lorenson just thinks its another delusion
how can you say that in your physical condition
do you realize that its because you were put in it that youre as
weak as you are now
beckers a man whos not well himself
starks searches for words that wont sound as crazy as he knows he appears
they dont exist
you dont understand
then help me understand
you know youre not alone
a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms
what you have might well be a syndrome and if so its not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously
this has nothing to do with that
lorenson exasperated then what
beat i cant guess it
you have to help me
starks fixes his eyes on lorenson
he has nothing to lose but still he treads carefully
the words that follow come almost unwittingly
what you do not know is the only thing you know
starks contd beat and what you own is what you do not own
and where you are is where you are not
beat where is that from
its as though starks hears his words for the first time
i dont know
tell me what you do know
beat ive seen a time thats not this time
and im only able to see it when im in the jacket
well what time is it
lorenson nods trying to mask his dismay but failing
you dont believe me
lorenson testing him well what year do you think it is now
starks exasperated im not delusional
i know its
same as every sane person
tell me about it
tell me about the future
what does it look like
it doesnt look all that different
the future doesnt look different
not for people like me
beat not in the places i come from
what about the world
i didnt see that much of it same as now
i only saw it as part of my own life
lorenson looks at starks unintentionally patronizing
do you think youre traveling in time
is that it
starks shakes his head and momentarily challenges lorenson simply with his air of calm resolve
not everyone in here is crazy doc
lorenson searches for another approach
beat like who
like mackenzie maybe
lorenson matter of factly did he tell you he tried to kill his wife
mackenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here
all because his wife left him for another man
starks moves to put his cigarette out and his i
almost falls out of his arm
lorenson makes a move to adjust it and starks flinches perceptibly startling lorenson
starks adjusting it himself maybe that just makes him weak not crazy
or maybe he is crazy
beat still doesnt make me think i am
starks adjusting it himself and judging by the fact that you just told me about another patient it doesnt even make you think i am so what dont you work
on persuading yourself first
why dont you help me
because i dont have time
im about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that
because of the future
i know whats going to happen
william that is just another facet of my delusions
then starks remembers the only thing that might help him
he pauses trying to recall as much of it as he can
and what about your work with eugene the kid
is that another facet of my delusions
lorenson having prepared to continue is bowled over at the mention of her patient
she loses all color and calm in her features
how do you know about eugene
you told me about him
i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him
so you told me
lorenson doesnt know what to say
lorenson somewhat angrily how do you know about eugene
starks shaking his head in disbelief you told me
its like two parts of you talking through me
look judging from your reaction theres no other way i could know about him
there obviously is so what dont you just tell me how you found out about him
starks looks at her convincingly
some part of you suspects even if you dont know for sure that what im saying is true
i dont know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
theyre not my delusions
look just leave my business with becker to me
one things got nothing to do with the other
ones got everything to do with the other
so unless you want my blood on your hands
leave whats between me and becker between me and becker
lorenson backs off jarred by starks assertions and fearful of his debilitating vehemence
mackenzie sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the hallway is clear of the staff
then he scuttles quickly all the time close to the wall to starks room
mackenzie gets inside ducks as a nurse passes and then taps lightly on the wall announcing himself gladly
hey i brought you some smokes
starks doesnt waste any time
lorenson said your wife left you for another man and thats when you lost it
mackenzie almost imperceptibly winces confirming the truth for starks before he has to sit down
geez hows that for a fucking thank you
is it true
mackenzie tosses him the cigarettes and lights himself one
she left me i tried to kill her i tried to kill myself
she was mean i was weak i was cruel so she left i didnt plan it didnt see it
mackenzie suddenly stops distraught
when he resumes its in an oddly more normal tone than hes ever used before
mackenzie softly i didnt want to see it
im in here because they say i have a nervous condition
beat well heres my question who wouldnt be nervous if they really looked at their life
beat whose life is that good
starks doesnt have an answer
not this luckless little mammals
what difference is it to them
beat slows down you believe what you want to believe
one version is easier than another so you make it your own
as mackenzie runs his hand over his forehead he looks hurt and sad but strangely not a bit crazy
ill tell you this though
however nuts i am i wasnt nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human being in something like that
mackenzies twitching continues as he recollects it
mackenzie beat what if we are crazy
shrugging what if we are
therere crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself
beat everyone does it dont they
that roller coaster car pops more pills than all of ward
are you sure
ive been here for years
its my neighborhood
course im sure
hes as drugged up as the rest of us
i guess he has to be to put up with all this
starks nods and mackenzie puts his head down suddenly vulnerable and embarrassed
starks lights two cigarettes
thanks for the cigarettes
you still got a lot of problems mackenzie but youre ok
mackenzie and starks smoke together quietly
starks room alpine grove december th starks is trying to see if the windows open through the bars covering them
its especially hard with the i
still connected to one of his arms
at least its some kind of bars weve got you behind
starks turns startled
i understand youve been asking for me almost every hour
i wouldve been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about
thats too bad
but when it comes down to it you just have to patient with them
theyd rather have their vacation too so they just push dealing with our practices off to the new year
they make it hard for you to get away with your business huh
starks lights a cigarette and with that gesture adopts the unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears little resemblance to his usual demeanor
makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine
becker looks at starks seriously
and whats that
getting away with things
like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison
you killed him
starks simply delivers one slow nod
and wound up in a better cage
beat but i still want to make a deal
becker looks understandably disgusted and starks proceeds with the calculation of someone who is guilty
see the deluxe lab animal treatment ive been receiving well i dont think its worked
i woke up today and realized
eerily lowering his voice
i dont think im cured
so really what was the point
i think thats still sort of illegal in some states though well have to check on vermont
and hows this for the cherry on top it seems my physician is a pill popping freak
beat last time i checked that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows
humbly deftly i dont remember everything they did to me
i just remember the worst parts
i think i should be sitting down when i say it dont you think
it takes becker some seconds to swallow this
i have to think about it
becker cocks his head to one side as he does
then he slowly makes his way over to starks and leans in closer to him
starks instinctively raises his hand to his head prepared to be defensive if he has to be
if this is the moment when hes killed
but becker only yanks the i
angrily out of starks arm tearing his skin with it
i think your story needs a little fleshing out before its ready to go
becker turns to leave as starks bleeds onto the floor
ill say a prayer for you in church today starks
maybe the gods can pick up where the medicine left off
you sure you know where to find one
ive managed to every sunday of my life
beat some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean
means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didnt at least try to
starks smirks at the hypocrisy he sees
becker how do you sleep at night
you in here
beat works like a drug
becker leaves without looking back and starks closes his eyes breathing a sigh of relief that its over
lorenson dressed to leave stops to talk to nina one of the evening nurses
nina william starks is to stay in icu all night
if anything is supposed to change i want to be called about it
lorenson comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a thin young mother talia yazdi and her eleven year old mute and seemingly retarded son eugene waiting for her outside
beat sorry im late
to eugene hi eugene
eugene returns her greeting with a blank stare
lorenson sets her things down on the kitchen table as talia starts to tidy things around the apartment
talia i need to ask you something
talia looks at lorenson
what is it
have you told anyone about my sessions with eugene
talia with an accent of course not
off lorensons still doubtful look i swear i havent
i wouldnt do that to eugene or you
you know that
has anyone been asking about him
i would have told you
she believes her
starks spots damon standing cautiously in the hall
we see but dont hear harding speak to nina as damon slips into starks room
nina seems sufficiently distracted
damon flashes a knife at starks
no funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you
one look at the knife and the same question burns once more
weakly no funny business
damon hustles starks down the hall as fast as they can before the nurse or any other staff member spots them
eugene sits opposite lorenson who quietly observes him jotting some notes down on her pad
she is intermittently holding up pictures for eugene asking him to repeat their names as if she were teaching him to read
eugene this is a train
eugene starts to pronounce the word when abruptly and without any warning he looks like hes unconscious only with a blank stare
lorenson quickly moves beside eugene and watches him from up close apparently not altogether surprised at whats happening
eugene doesnt even blink
the only sounds we hear from him are a couple barely audible guttural noises
lorenson exhausted takes off her glasses wearily and gently addresses the boy
come on back down here
wherever you are
try to come on back
youll like it i promise
just then talia walks in with tea juice and cookies for eugene and lorenson
she spots her son in his absent staring state and forces her face into a small sad smile to avoid tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies
talia gently touches lorensons hand
lorenson looks at her warmly
talia knows how hard shes trying
becker soundlessly watches as harding and damon finish strapping starks in the jacket
damon slams the drawer shut sending starks back in
what starks lacks in strength he counteracts with his overwhelming will
the screen trembles with it
one terrific white light and we
starks sits by himself in jackies car parked in a gas station
he looks around trying to make sure it really is her car
he looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and an empty bottle of vodka
he looks outside and sees a few people walking into the food mart of the gas station
he trembles with cold as he looks down at his plaid shirt
then jackie unexpectedly appears outside the drivers window opening the car door and nearly spilling her coffee when she spots starks next to her
seeing its him though she smiles warmly
you just scared me thats all
she leans over to him and gives him a kiss handing him the coffee
here drink this
ill get the heat going
jackie speeds through the streets of shelbourne presumably on their way to beckers house
theyve slowed down a little
jackie reads from some directions on a paper as their car slows down on one particular street towards one particular house
i think this is his house
starks looks at the house bedecked with a lopsided snow man on the front lawn
i called the number yesterday to make sure
thomas becker retired starks gets out of the car
starks knocks on the door
jackie tries to look through the windows to see if anyones there
no one is
it looks small and dark inside
starks knocks again looking down anxiously at his feet
jackie walks up to him from around the side of the house
they dont have the time to wait
theyre not here
beat lost no
jackie notices how cold starks looks
maybe theyre out
starks rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows and sees no cars or people on the street
jackie watches him despairingly
how much time do we have
starks distracted i dont know
what are you thinking
therere no cars on this street
jackie looks around there really arent
yeah youre right
but wait how can that be
starks turns to jackie thinking
i dont know
maybe thats because this whole thing is a dream
how can you have a street with no cars on it
i dont know
but this isnt a dream
im real and so is where we are
then why isnt there anyone around
beat i dont know
starks runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in desperation
what are you doing
starks doesnt answer
starks opens his eyes
she sighs in relief
maybe hes gone somewhere
hell have to come back
starks starts to shake his head in disbelief when suddenly he realizes
of course he will
beat what day of the week is it
starks nodding its sunday
starks looks ecstatic with hope
look where these people live
a small beautiful removed place
theyve got lives to be grateful for
william youre not making sense
beat theyre at church
and i bet thats where becker is
jackie and starks head back to the only main street in the town
as they approach the town church they start to see a row of cars parallel parked on the street
jackie pulls up to the entrance of the church
starks watches jackie get out of the car and walk up to the doors of the church
jackie boldly opens the church door
jackie sees the town seated in the church
the priest looks up at her briefly and some people turn around but she closes the door before she causes a major interruption
we move to the third or fourth row where from behind we see a head of grey hair
he slowly turns around casting a look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face
though its aged slightly it hasnt softened
jackie and starks watch as the people file out of church
they are leaning against her car when starks spots him
becker walks beside a small child presumably his grandson
jackie registers his formidableness with some surprise beckers maintained a strong physique and is hardly a shade less intimidating than he was before
only his hand has a permanent shake now
starks doesnt waste any time
he heads straight for him
almost sensing him becker looks in his direction
the casual look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of disbelief
you still go to church
hows that work
your god just doesnt notice
beat serious how you doin dr
becker stops walking and looks at starks
his grandson looks at him
becker still looking at starks sean why dont you wait for me by the car
ill be there in a minute
turning to the kid ok
his grandson momentarily appeased heads for the car
becker to starks can i help you
i dont know dr
thats enough to confirm for becker who starks is
all around them people leaving church socialize routinely unaware of the haunted history being made between them
who are you
i think you know
your eyes say you do
beat youre his son
im not his son
you look like youve seen a ghost
you can come here and touch me old man
im the real thing
how are you here
starks looks at becker each a terrifying reminder of the others past
you died starks
years ago in the hospital
beat you killed me didnt you
i swear i didnt
i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i didnt do it
i didnt kill myself
i died from a blow to the head
howd it happen
i have to know
becker looks at him nearly too stunned to speak
i dont know how you died
the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer
i didnt say i remembered killing him
i just repeated some words to get myself back in there
beat i knew that when you came out
because you came out and said something you couldnt have possibly have known
you came back and repeated three names
becker falters as he recalls his offenses
of people like you
people i was just trying to help
they couldnt get worse so i thought with medication they might get
what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer
it was part of the treatment i intended
i didnt know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out
the three of you werent regular patients
you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
no we were patients
becker concedes after all this time
you and the others didnt seem that way then
starks is quiet as he comes to understand how its about to work out if becker tells him those names now he essentially indicts himself
who were the others
becker remembers with a hint of remorse
becker racked with remorse nathan piechowski jackson macgregor and ted casey
beat i didnt ask for you for any of you
you were all sent to me
starks looks at becker in astonishment
what is it
starks just stares at becker waiting for the realization to hit him too
how did you come to know their names
you just told me
the last time i was with you was when i was in the jacket
im in it right now dr
i dont understand
im in it as we speak
beat youre haunting yourself right now
beat i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does
you didnt make history like you wanted to huh dr
it turned out different didnt it
i didnt put you in alpine grove
beat you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket
becker stoically i was sorry when i heard you died
i was but
how was i to know you didnt shoot that police officer
the same way you just said i didnt without my ever telling you
beat and that still doesnt excuse what you did
just because you had keys to a cage didnt mean you had animals inside
beat youve earned your guilt becker
starks shares a last look with becker before he walks away towards the car
jackie and starks sit inside the parked car as starks touches his head
thats all you got from him
that bastard helped take your life away from you
no he didnt
how can you say that
hes the one that put you in that goddamn medieval
hes probably the one who killed you
and with those words jackie starts to break down
no ones killing anyone
starks takes her hand and runs it over his head
starks looks at her with love understanding and for the first time a sense of peace
he strokes her hair to calm her down
if everything hadnt happened the way it has then i wouldnt be here right now sitting in a car with you touching your face
why are you saying that
beat we dont have long do we
starks looks at her without answering
jackie wipes her eyes fastens starks seat belt and seeing that starks eyes have started to flutter starts driving
in the distance the barely audible sound of the drawer opening and their time ending is heard
where are we going
to the hospital
jackie and starks speed on the highway
as starks sleeps jackie keeps looking over at him like its a way to make sure he stays with her
jackie helps starks whos severely weakened at this point to the nurses station
claire is there
claire i need help
claire helps jackie and they take him into a room
from afar we hear claire asking about him
whats happening to me
why am i getting so much weaker
because your body can only take so much of what theyre putting you through
jesus whats happened to him
jackie helps claire do for starks what they can it doesnt seem like much at this point
lorensons the only one that could let me out of there
i need something to persuade her that i was there
get me something to take to her
jackie stands above a printer as it prints the information shes looked up about dr
the paper gets jammed and thats when jackie completely loses it
she wrestles with the printer as if it were responsible for whats happening
then she realizes shes not alone
she looks back and sees claire watching from the doorway with a sympathetic look in her eyes
jackie in a panic hes not
beat not yet
but he doesnt have long
are you sure you dont want a doctor to look at him
it wont do any good
beat please claire
they wont understand
claire acquiesces with her eyes
starks is trapped back on the day when officer harrison was murdered
contd from the scene after starks left jean and jackies place
starks is walking back on the same highway just after the sun has set and just after he helped jean and jackie on that fateful day
this time we see a car stop for him from a much closer distance
tenny pulls up towards starks and rolls down the window on the passenger side
starks bends down to be able to see the driver
hey mister you need a ride
where are you going
im going to canada but i can let you ride with me up to the border
starks considers this
can you drive
great get in
well switch off in a bit
we pull back and see the same shot from a distance of starks putting his bag in the back and getting in
as he opens the car door we hear the music playing inside
as they drive off the music fades further and further in the distance as we
its the night that they slept together and the departure we never saw
we see from starks pov jackie sleeping serenely in the bed
we catch one glimpse of starks in the moonlight standing naked in the doorway before he turns and then
disappears having been taken out of the jacket at that point
jackie is by starks side lying on the hospital bed next to him smoothing his sweating head
william please honey wake up
starks eyes flutter open
can you hear me
starks nods jackie tries to continue without choking up
i found out about eugene
the little boy
hes the key
thats who you have to tell her about when you get back there
its the only way to prove this to her
jackies voice fades as we
lorenson watches eugene continue to look unresponsively in the distance
starks is awake watching jackie sleep wearily on his chest
he sees the toll this has taken on her just as he senses he is about to be taken out of the jacket
he nudges her gently
jackie stirs her eyes to look at him
starks somewhat urgently where do you live
when we first met when you were where was the house you lived in with your mother
do you remember your address
realizing in a whisper youre not coming back are you
starks faint struggles to get out of the bed
you gotta stop thinking like that
then where are you going
beat i just think im gonna be sick
starks moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room
jackie moves to help him and he motions for her to stop
starks falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at jackie like it might be for the last time
jackie in a whisper you come back to me
starks nods then goes in and closes the door behind him
jackie stares after him alone in the total silence of the room
she listens for the slightest noise and thats when she actually hears the sound of the drawer being opened for herself
she realizes hes gone
she rushes after him opens the door in a fit and then sees what she feared most no sign of starks
jackie falls to her knees right there on the bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to realize how unfathomably deep her heart is
starks is suddenly in the waiting area outside lorensons office still severely weakened
he walks slowly to the office door and feebly knocks
lorenson answers and starks falls into her arms
lorenson stunned oh dear god
lorenson has laid starks down on the couch in her office
starks can barely talk
he spews as much of it as he can out in his feverish state
im william starks
im not his son
and the kid you work with
your friends son
lorenson is stilled by the words starks just spoke
i know it all
save your strength
i already know everything youre going to say
beat youre in the jacket right now arent you
how do you know
you told me this was how it happened
starks clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him out
who kills me
you have nothing to fear william
but when we look to see starks reaction hes not there
becker is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly decides not to
he takes off his coat and his gloves but not his scarf and walks out of his office with a decided urgency
becker pulls starks out of the drawer and looks down ruefully at starks scathed face
starks drenched in blood and sweat seeks the outline of beckers face in the light
starks whispering becker i know about you
beat i know what you did to your patients
becker looses the straps around starks neck to help him speak
beat jackson macgregor
beat you didnt cure them
you killed them
becker momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien
after some seconds starks passes out and becker hands trembling looks as though he might stick him back in when instead he starts to remove him from the jacket himself
he silently and carefully unties each of the straps taking unusual care for starks flesh as he prepares to put him on a stretcher
as the sun starts to rise we see starks now cleaned up recovering in his bed
he is unconscious
from his window we look down and see dr
lorensons car pulling into the lot
lorenson still wearing her winter gear walks into starks room anxiously checking his vitals
her anxious expression reveals starks frailty
she looks to the window then and sees an empty chair with only beckers scarf on it
lorenson goes to the window in time to see becker getting into his car
starks lies unconscious in the bed
the nurse sally stops by the room to check on dr
would you like anything dr
a cup of coffee would be great sally
is he gonna be ok
i hope so
lorenson looks after her as she leaves
lorenson wakes up as starks stirs in his sleep slowly waking up
youre going to be ok william
we just need to get your fever down and well be able to hopefully stabilize you
who are you kidding doc
you or me
lorenson doesnt answer
can i get some paper and something to write with
starks solemnly im starting to think im really gonna die soon
so id like to write some things down
im not gonna let that happen
you still dont believe me do you
i do believe you
listen to me
the kid eugene
lorenson still gets taken aback by starks knowledge of eugene
no one knows youre working with him so how would i have found out
hes your friends son right
its true no one could have known about lorensons private life
starks coughs clearly in great pain
william i cant indulge these delusions even when youre in this state
listen to me
thats all i ask
lorenson has no choice
hes having absence pronounced absance seizures when he stares off into space like he does
he has them so often that thats why he hasnt learned to speak properly
who told you this
you did in the future
you figured it out because a part of you already knows this
thats how it works
beat im just telling you something you already know even if you havent realized it
starks closes his eyes gathering what strength he can
i dont know when itll happen but soon i think youll shock the boy and itll wake him up
what are you talking about
youll figure it out and youll do good by him
thats all starks can manage before lorenson sees hes about to pass out again
lorenson answers the knock at her door
its eugene and hey
what is it
lorenson finding it hard to explain nothing
beat i dont know
i thought of something i could try
lorenson looks at talia helplessly
talia nods and leads eugene inside
lorenson cant help but look down the hall to make sure no ones there
lorenson sits across from eugene holding up a picture of a dog
between them is a tray of milk and cookies
come on eugene try to say it with me
this is a dog
d d d
but eugene cant hold the sound of the letter long enough to make the word
an absence seizure takes hold of him as he looks out unconsciously into space
lorenson moves closer to him
lorenson softly whats happening to you
lorenson checks eugenes pulse and leans in close to the boys unconscious face like the answer is there if she just looks hard enough
are you having a seizure
is that really whats going on
lorenson spots a corner of eugenes eye twitching slightly and rushing to get a better look takes the shade off of the nearby lamp and holds it above his head
so she can get a better look at him
just then talia opens the door startling lorenson
she knocks over the milk and as it spills on the lamp cord now on eugenes lap it causes an electric shock
eugene catches it
talia gasps and lorenson watches the boy in fear
the moment passes and eugene more responsive than he has ever been before looks at his mother and lorenson
he doesnt know whats happened but he is aware and awake like never before
eugene picks right up where he and lorenson left off
to talia hi
talia and lorenson look at him and each other at shock
distantly youre going to
shock the boy and then things will change for him
you ok eugene
eugene holds lorensons gaze steadily for a few moments
lorenson stunned himself yeah you are ok
lorenson putting the pieces together he got a little shock
to himself and its reset him
not permanently probably
but at least for a little while
they use it on epileptic patients sometimes
but hes not epileptic
no but he is having seizures
talia looks at lorenson
shes still confused
lorensons merely surprised
starks looks up from his paper now covered in words to see dr
lorenson in the doorway
starks still looks weak but much better than before
it worked didnt it
this is really happening isnt it
beat what do you need me to do
beat thank you
starks folds the letter
i need to get this letter to someone
i cant take you out of here in your condition
and i cant stay here in my condition
i am going to die tonight
its already been decided
no it hasnt
beat it has
everything up till today is done
everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs
lorenson helps starks into the parking lot as it snows
lorenson and starks are driving on the same now familiar highway
you know how to get there
its an easy address
a little far out there but easy enough
bob dylan plays on the radio
starks smiles as he hears him and turns the music up the act is sad because as lorenson notices it belongs to someone with an interest to live
lorenson and starks drive up to jean and jackies house
you want me to come with you
no ill be ok
starks slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can
the sound however is still understandably soft
starks waits and then reaches for the knob on the door
he opens it and looks inside
we first see his face and the devastation on it as we guess the sight hes laid eyes on
jackie is sitting at the kitchen table still only years old
though starks expected it he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved
as she looks up at him its all he can do not to break down
jackie surprised hey
beat i remember you
i remember you too
starks shakes his head looking at her
she looks beautiful and still hopeful
her life lays ahead of her and her fate when he found her in remains as distant as possible from this innocent still promising image
jackie how have you been
jackie smiles she doesnt get asked that often
ive been ok
hows your mom
ok i guess
its all he can do not to crumble
do you think i could see her
she looks at him and senses like kids do the desperation in his eyes
jackie calls out for jean then runs up the stairs to get her
lorenson has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch
starks remains in the doorway
some seconds later jean appears gaunt but in a slightly better state than we saw her before
can i help you
nice to see you
jean looks a little confused
your face looks awfully familiar i just cant quite place it
mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway
the guy you yelled at for no good reason
she gives him a once over and seeing how weakened he looks decides intuitively he cant be much harm
she also notices lorenson waiting by the car
there something you need
you could say that
starks looks at jackie hesitating because of her
sensing this jean asks jackie to leave
jackie go play in the snow
just do it
jackie leaves and walks to the yard
i cant stay long
motioning to lorenson thats my doctor and i gotta get back to the hospital
everything i want to say is in this letter
beat you can check as much of it as you can
starks hands her the letter
i wont be around when you read it
but i hope you believe it
itd be a real shame if you didnt
jean looks baffled but seeming to grasp his urgency nods
beat i should be on my way
jackie has been watching this exchange from the shed
when he looks over there he catches her eye and calls out with what strength he has left
these are the hardest words starks has probably ever had to say
jackie just stares after him as does jean as he shows himself out
happy new year to both of you
as starks is walking away we see his eyes begin to tear in the cold but not from it
jackie abruptly runs after him
starks stops in his tracks he clears as much sadness from his face as he can before he turns around to face her
beat you be good to yourself jackie
then suddenly she sticks her hand for him to shake as she did that day on the roadside only now it trembles slightly in the cold
starks takes jackies hand and holds it in his own softly and affectionately
jean and dr
lorenson look on curiously as starks looks in her face at her hand in his and then to the heavens for the means to get through this
as starks lets go at last jackie looks back at him sensing the connection even if she doesnt know it yet
starks turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car
lorenson moves to help him but starks tells her not to with his eyes
he makes his way to the car on his own
jean sits down and starts to open the letter
starks voice as we hear it now is presumably from parts of the letter hes written to her
lorenson looks over to starks who stares painfully out the window
they drive on in silence
i was years old the first time i died
it didnt end anything though
beat sometimes i think we live through things only to be able to tell them to bear witness to say this happened
starks walks back through the gates of the hospital despondently returning inside with lorenson at his side
and it wasnt to someone else
it was to me
and i lived despite it
sometimes i think we live to beat the odds
and sometimes i agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death
that it can all end even when you least want it to
mackenzie looks up from his game of solitaire as lorenson helps starks down the hall
he holds up his hand in the gesture of hello or goodbye
starks raises his hand back with an earnest smile
im telling you my story because its the only way i can try to help your daughter and you have a better one of your own
we see becker taking his drugs
in his dark den on his worn desk is a bottle of whiskey
he closes his eyes as he administers to himself whatever aid he can
jean is reading each page avidly affected by this mans last words
how much we can forget
scary because we think the past gives us our bearing and lucky because in those moments im talking about you realize it doesnt
and it never had to
tenny officer harrisons murderer is at the bar ordering a drink from the bartender
as he gets his drink he slaps a bill down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar
jackie rummages in a box of her personal belongings looking for something specific in them
she stops finally when she finds starks dog tags
she takes them out slowly and puts them around her neck
i am not a crazy man even though they mistook me for one
i live in the same world as the rest of you
only i saw more of it
then after a moment of staring down at them she tucks them under her sweater
captain medley holds a beer as he stares blankly at a tv broadcasting news about mike tysons rape conviction
medleys barely watching the footage
lorenson helps starks back to bed
starks looks up at lorenson thanking her without words but with his eyes
lorenson smiles as she looks back sadly at starks even more weakened self
and the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying you can always start believing in things you dont already believing in
and while youre alive its never too late
then he turns and walks out closing the door so that starks room and the screen darken at the same time
two pairs of legs walk down a corridor darkened by the night through the now familiar passage to the basement
starks is not restrained this time though we dont see who is walking down the hall with him
he runs his hand over his forehead and looks at it when hes done
still no cut
they slow down their pace as they round the corner as starks appears dizzier and dizzier
he doesnt stop and the person beside him doesnt see how weak he is
until starks trips
in slow motion we hear a distant garbled voice call out
but starks head hits the glass case of the fire extinguisher on the wall as it was destined to
in the terrific shower of glass one piece cuts a neat deep fatal gash in starks head
blood starts to flow
as starks eyes struggle to regain their focus we see the blurred indiscernible face of the person leaning over him to see if hes all right
the details start to make sense even to starks
this is the wound they said he died from
starks collapses on the familiar slab ready to be strapped into the jacket one final time
blood pours from his head onto the floor
the person with him struggles to get all of starks weight onto the metal slab
shes doing it as carefully and gently as she can taking observable care with every strap of the jacket almost as if the act itself is a humane one
when the hands finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed starks smiles kindly and thankfully into the single overhead light in
the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in
as the drawer is pushed in one of the straps gets caught on the side cutting starks arm
we hear a small cry in the room
then the hands adjust the strap and slowly push starks in
its more beautiful and serene inside than its ever been before
this time as he travels through the tunnel its as though hes traveling in a heaven of his own
the images he sees are the best moments of his past connected in a tranquil fluid narrative that suggest starks has finally retrieved his memory without it haunting him
i promise you jean
no matter how bad the days and things around you look they look better awake than they do asleep
i can offer you some proof when you die theres only one thing you want to have happen
sometimes so badly it comes true i guess
beat you want to come back
the panels we saw briefly are completed further now
a womans neck as a small childs hand touches it
aged running up the stairs knocking a picture on the wall with his elbow
a black and white photograph of starks father a much older version of himself
creek a shot of clear water thats not to deep and on its surface the reflection of a teenage boys face before he touches it and sends it rippling
a new england beach starks s dressed in a black suit holding an urn letting the ashes fly into the water
desert a sandstorm whirls round before its replaced with
vermont a field of snow
we see now that it was dr
lorenson who put starks in
exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there she stares at the closed drawer like looking at it is one way to look after starks
jean puts down starks letter and walks out of the kitchen and watches jackie sitting absently on the couch looking past the tv
jean kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her daughter in the eye
jackie looks back curiously as jean wraps her arms around jackies legs and rests her head in her lap holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly missed a
over the sounds of cars slushing in the snow an image fades up slowly on the screen until we see its starks standing in the parking lot outside the diner
this time he seems situated and hopeful
after a slightly longer wait than the first time jackie walks out in the same way as before except that she wears a nurses uniform and an unmistakable air of
jackie looks directly at starks and we see the same attraction between them teeming even more than before
even as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel with a bleeding cut on his head and no coat in the cold starks is someone we see she
wants to be near
then we see jackie as starks does she looks beautiful alive happy and just like the woman he never wanted to leave
she approaches starks warmly less suspicious of the world and less devastated by it than we remember her being
beat you ok
starks revels in the moment
in their reunion
i think so
youre bleeding pretty bad there
starks touches his forehead in a panic and seeing the blood on his hands looks up at her terrified
sensing this she moves closer to calm him
its just a cut
we can get it fixed
jackie contd but we need to get you to the hospital now
howd you get that
i fell down
beat but im alive
starks looks at her immensely relieved and grateful
jackie laughing a little yes you are alive
but listen its new years day
youre not going to get a cab
especially not here
and youre gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer
im on my way back to my shift at the hospital
you work there
jackie gesturing to her uniform yeah im a nurse
why dont you let me give you a ride
starks falters slightly as he walks
jackie helps him make it to the car much like before
starks can hardly keep his eyes off her when her cell phone suddenly rings
sorry one sec
jackie answers it smiling
how are you
i was just thinking about you too
starks listens nervously to her conversation and the affection in her voice
listen i gotta go mom cause im late
happy new year to you too
ill call you later
beat ok bye
jackie hangs up and looks at starks feeling a little awkward after the call
sorry about that
it was my mom
starks smiles back warmly at her he gets it more than she knows
nothin to worry about there
jackies car pulls onto the highway alongside the other more modern cars on the highway
how you doin
im doing fine
the happy sound of their engine on the highway continues uninterrupted for some seconds before first faintly then louder we hear a racking all too familiar sound the drawer creaking
as its opened once more
