by bruce joel rubin a swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army of men over a vietnamese hillside
the soldiers scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection of the jungle
falling into coulmns like strands of soldier ants seventy five men at combat readiness assemble on the edge of a sweltering wilderness
it is dusk
the mood is lazy soporific
members of one platoon huddle close to the ground smoking a joint
to jacob a soldier squatting several yards away hey professor how many times can you shit in an hour
dont bug im
where are those gooks already
i dont even think theyre out there
jesus this grass is something else
jacob singer returns to the group pulling up his pants
why even bother to pull em up
you jackin off out there again huh jake
hey get off his back
its called philosophizing right professor
jacob gives them the finger
up yours you adolescent scum
mount your bayonets
frightened oh shit
gimme that joint
hey somethings wrong
what is it
take another toke
george reaches out extending a joint
suddenly he gasps and falls to the ground his body convulsing uncontrollably
the others stand back startled
jacob grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his chattering teeth
whats going on
before anyone can answer jerry grabs his head screaming
he turns frantically in all directions
what the hell
in seconds jerry is spinning wildly out of control his head shaking into a terrific blur
he crashes into frank with the force of a truck
frank slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs
he begins gasping and hyperventilating
his eyes grow wide and frenzied as he gulps for air
fear and confusion sweep across his face
the men watch horrified as franks terror escalates beyond reason into all out panic
suddenly frank begins howling
he lunges for his bayonet and without warning attacks the men around him
paul spins out of the way as franks bayonet impales the ground
jacob jumps on top of frank and wrestles him into the tall grass
paul rushes to his assistance
jacob stares at franks face as frank struggles beneath him
it is the face of a madman
the sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting behind them
guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening sky
this is it
the men spin around
paul panics and jumps to his feet leaving jacob alone with frank
franks eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers his strength
dont leave me
dark figures silhouetted by the setting sun are storming at them
soldiers squint to see
it is a horrifying vision
gunfire explodes on all sides
suddenly paul flips out
he begins screaming uncontrollably ripping at his clothes and skin
frank is struggling like four men and jacob is weakening in his effort to restrain him
bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire
more bodies keep coming
the first wave is upon them
rod shoots into the air
shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like banshees
rod squinting jabs with his bayonet piercing the belly of his attacker
agonizing cries accompany his fall
rod yanks the bayonet out and stabs again
in the midst of this madness frank shoots to his feet and slams the butt of his rifle into jacobs back
there is a cracking sound
jacobs eyes freeze with pain
his hands rush for his spine
as he spins around one of the attackers jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into jacobs stomach
it is a loud and piercing wail
cut on the sound of the scream to a sudden rush through a long dark tunnel
there is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a brilliant light
the rush suggests a passage between life and death but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through a subway station far below the city
of new york
the wheels of an express train screech through the station
jacob singer sitting alone in the last car wakes up
the sounds of the scream and the grating wheels merge
he is dazed and confused not certain where he is
jacob glances around the empty car
his eyes gravitate to overhead advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks
gradually his confusion subsides
shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book out of his back pocket the stranger by albert camus
he begins reading
another station blurs by
jacob is a good looking man of obvious intelligence
he is in his mid thirties
it is surprising that he is wearing a mailmans uniform
he doesnt look like one
the subway ride seems to go on interminably
jacob is restless and concerned
he glances at his watch
it is a
putting his book in his back pocket jacob stands up and makes his way through the deserted car
jacob enters the rumbling passageway between the cars
the wheels spark against the rails
the dark tunnel walls flash by
he pulls the handle on the door to the next car
it is stuck
he struggles with it
a lady sitting alone inside turns to look at him
she seems threatened by his effort
he motions for her to help
she turns away
a look of disgust crosses jacobs face
he kicks the door
it slides open
the woman seems frightened as he approaches her
excuse me do you know if weve passed nostrand avenue yet
she doesnt answer excuse me
she does not acknowledge his existence look im asking a simple question
have we hit nostrand avenue
i fell asleep
speaking with a puerto rican accent i no from around here
glad for a response yeah you and everyone else
jacob walks to the other end of the car and sits down
the only other passenger is an old man lying asleep on the fiberglass bench
occasionally his body shudders
it is the only sign of life in him
the train begins to slow down
jacob peers out of the window
nostrand avenue signs appear
he is relieved
he gets up and grabs hold of the overhead bar
the old man shudders and stretches out on the seat
as he adjusts his position tugging at his coat jacob catches a brief glimpse of something protruding from beneath the coats hem
his eyes fixate on the spot waiting for another look
there is a slight movement and it appears a long red fleshy protuberance
the sight of it sends shivers up jacobs spine
it looks strangely like a tail
only the stopping of the train breaks jacobs stare
jacob is the only passenger getting off
the doors close quickly behind him
he glances at the lady sitting by the window
there is a fearful expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark tunnel out of his sight
jacob reaches the exit a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor to ceiling gates
he is about to push when he notices a chain locking it shut
he stares at it in disbelief
he turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform
as he approaches the far exit his eyes widen
the gate there is also locked
his hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation
cut to jacob stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the tracks
a rat scampers by and he gasps
he starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere else to go
he juts out his jaw and steps back down
jacob is not comfortable on the tracks
he cannot see where he is stepping
his shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace
the steel girders are coated in subway grime
the oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for support
goddam fucking city
he wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center track
he reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate
two pinpoints of light hurl toward him
then the noise arrives confirming his fear
a train is bearing down on him
jacob looks frightened not sure which way to go
he steps forward up to his ankle in slime
he cannot tell which track the train is on
it is moving at phenomenal speed
the station is spinning
the trains lights merge into one brilliant intensity
in near panic jacob jumps across the track as the train spins by
its velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end
he clings to a pillar for support gasping in short breaths
a few people are staring at jacob from the train
their faces pressed up against the glass seem deformed
a lone figure waves at him from the rear window
the train bears them all away
then it is quiet again
for a moment jacob is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure
he continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder to the uptown platform
the smile however is one of irony not amusement
this exit too is locked
a heavy chain is wrapped through the bars
jacob stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment
a sudden muffled scream alerts jacob that he is not alone
his head turns but sees no one
he hears the scream again
he senses its direction and walks toward the mens room
a crack of light appears under the door
he can hear someone moaning inside
jacob knocks softly and the moaning stops
the lights click off
hey is someone in there
there is no answer
jacob stands silently for a moment not sure what to do
he can hear whispering
he chews his lower lip nervously and then reaches for the door
it pushes open
the light from the station penetrates the darkness
he sees a man tied naked to the stall with another naked man grabbing quickly for his clothes
the bound man screams
mind your own business
a third man spins out of the shadows pointing a kinfe at jacobs throat
get outta here
the mans face is barely human
before jacob can even react the door slams shut
the lock engages
the crack of light reappears
jacob can hear laughter coming from inside followed by a scream
he backs away from the door
his face is white
jacob turns with full fury and storms the gate
the chain gives wayto his anger
it flies apart and the gate flings open
he stands in amazement observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete below
the gate squeaks loudly as jacob pushes it aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut
jacob walks toward the towering shadows of a massive public housing project
it is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic structures
jacob passes through a vast courtyard dominated by the imposing shapes
aside from his moving body everything is still
jacob steps off a graffiti festooned elevator into a long impersonal hallway
he uses three keys to unlock the door to his apartment
jacob enters the darkness without turning on the light
he tries to navigate his way to the bathroom illuminated by a tiny nightlight in the distance
his effort is unsuccessful
he bangs loudly into a table
a woman s voice calls out
jake is that you
what the hell did you do move all the furniture
why didnt you turn on the light
i didnt want to wake you
sleepy but pleasant gee thanks a lot
where is the lamp
where are you
if i knew i wouldnt have to ask
what did you do
i was happy the way it was
i moved the couch
jacob crashes into it
a light suddenly goes on
jezebel jezzie pipkin is standing in the bedroom door tying a mans terrycloth bathrobe around her waist
although sleepy disheveled and not looking her best it is obvious that jezzie is a beefy woman juicy and sensual
nearly sprawled over the couch thanks
he pushes himself up
what do you think
what do you mean
oh god jezzie ask me tomorrow
it is tomorrow
how come youre so late
roberts didnt show up
what could i say
besides its double time
seeing the grease on his uniform what happened to you
unbuttoning his shirt as he walks to the dont ask
jacob steps into the bathroom and pulls at his clothes leaving them in a pile on the floor
he reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub
jezzie enjoys jacobs nakedness
she reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples
his body tenses slightly
jezzie drops her robe
they enter the shower together
a dense rain falls on a dark night filling puddles of water
jacob is crawling through the underbrush in the vietnamese jungle
his shirt is bloodsoaked
he moves slowly creeping on his right forearm
his left arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass
suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance
it dances around the bamboo trees and draws closer to jacob
it is impossible to see who is carrying it
the light darts near the ground where jacob is lying and then bursts directly into his eyes
sunlight pours through the bedroom window
jacob is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face
his hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done
he is awake
jacob lies in bed for a few moments dazed
slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed searching for his glasses
he has trouble finding them
as his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor
he sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out of focus shelf behind him
suddenly jezzie enters
have you seen my glasses
shaking her head whered you leave em
i dont know
did you look around the headboard
wearily jezzie i cant see
she scans the shelf maybe you left em in the bathroom
she leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag
she tosses them both onto the bed
he puts on his glasses and notices the bag whats that
your kid dropped it off
stooping to pick up the phone no
the little one
why cant you remember their names
theyre weird names
they were prophets
well personally i never went for church names
and where do you think jezebel comes from
i dont let anybody call me that
shaking his head youre a real heathen you know that jezzie
jesus how did i ever get involved with such a ninny
you sold your soul remember
thats what you told me
yeah but for what
a good lay
and look what i got
i must have been out of my head
jake you are never out of your head
ignoring the criticism and reaching for the paper bag whats in here
your wife was gonna toss em so whats his name brought em over on his way to school
jacob lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed
there are hundreds of them
he examines them with growing delight
look at these will ya
i dont believe it
jesus these are fantastic
look heres my dad
and heres my brother when we were down in florida
rummaging excitedly through the pile here
this is me and sarah when i was still at city college
looking closely thats sarah
she studies the photo i can see what you mean
why you left
what do you mean you can see
look at her face
a real bitch
she looked good then
not to me
well you didnt marry her
he digs through more photos
suddenly he stops
to jezzies surprise and his own tears well up in his eyes
for a moment jacob is unable to speak
he just stares at one of the photos
jezzie looks at the picture
it is an image of jacob carrying a small child on his shoulders
is that the one who died
jezzie is silent
jacob grabs a kleenex and blows his nose
it just took me by surprise
i didnt expect to see him this morning god what i wouldnt
he was the cutest little guy
like an angel you know
he had this smile
choking up again fuck i dont even remember this picture
hiding his emotions jacob scrambles over the bed and reaches for a pair of pants
he pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the photo of gabe inside
it joins photos of his two other boys
jezzie begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag
i dont like things that make you cry
i just want to look
he reaches into the pile for other snapshots
we see an array of frozen moments happy unfocused obscure
suddenly he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot
god this is me
he holds up a baby photo look
its dated right after i was born
he stares at it intently what a kid
so much promise
jezzie surveys the scene
its amazing huh jake
your whole life
right in front of you
she pauses before making her final pronouncement what a mess
jezzie carries the garbage to an incinerator room down the hall
she is carrying several bags
two of them are tossed instantly down the chute
she hesitates with the third
after a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful of photos
they are pictures of jacob and sarah
with cool deliberation she drops them down the chute
an apartment door slams shut
quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand
jacob opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the fire below
just gettin rid of the garbage
jacob and jezzie both wearing postal uniforms head for the elevator
they are surprised that it has arrived promptly
jezzie reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into jacobs ear
he pulls her into the elevator
they disappear laughing behind its closing doors
jacob is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown manhattan
as he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of al jolsons sonny boy
jacob stops his truck in front of a laundry on west th street
he opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him
he lifts them with effort and slams the door with his foot
it doesnt close
he considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy
he turns instead and waddles toward the store
a heavyset woman with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered with laundry
a picture of richard nixon is still stapled to the wall
she looks at jacob
where do you expect me to put those
i dont have any room
she tries clearing the counter but it doesnt help
continuing how bout over there
she points to a table no wait
do me a favor
bring em to the back room
theyre awfully heavy
thats why im asking
jacob waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store
chinese launderers are hovering over piles of clothes
steam from the pressing machines shoots into the air
huffing and puffing wheres wong
thats what id like to know
if you see him on the street somewhere tell him hes fired
jacob stoops to put the boxes on the shelf
there is a snapping sound and he winces in pain
massaging his back jacob unfolds some papers for the womans signature
how was palm springs
where do i sign
pointing to the line you got a nice tan though
it faded on the airplane
id try to get my money back but who do you ask
she looks heavenward two hundred dollars a night for what
she hands jacob the wrong sheet
ill take the other one
he takes it right
well its good to have you back
see you tomorrow probably
if youre lucky
jacob smiles to himself as he leaves the store
he walks carefully
his back is out
angle on the mail truck stuck in traffic
nothing is moving
horns are blaring and drivers are agitated
jacob reaches for a newspaper lying on top of his mail bags
to his shock one of the bags appears to move
curious jacob pokes at it
instantly a terrifying figure pops out from beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare
jacob jumps back stunned
it is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at an old wino who has been sleeping in the truck
the mans face is covered in strange bumps
what the hell
pleading i didnt take nothin
i was just napping
dont hit me
i was cold
lifting the man up what the hell do you think youre doing
you cant do this
this is government property
he begins opening the door
the wino begs
dont throw me out
theyre gonna get me
theyll tear me to pieces
he holds on to jacobs leg
jacob tries to pull away
you cant stay here
i never hurt anybody when i was alive
i dont belong here
jacob gives the wino a strange look and then escorts him from the truck
a hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he leads the wino to the sidewalk
jacob pulls a dollar bill from his pocket and places it in the winos hand
the old man crumples it into a ball and turns away
he has a frightened look on his face
jacob returns to the truck shaking his head
he climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror
he notices the wino edging fearfully along the side of a building
a horn honks and traffic begins moving
when jacob looks back the wino is no longer there
jacob drives his mail truck into the huge post office parking garage on th street
his mind seems distracted
he has difficulty parking
we see a vast room filled with hundreds of people sorting and moving mail
jacob carrying a bag of mcdonalds hamburgers walks stiffly through the aisles his left hand rubbing his back
several workers greet him and grab for his french fries
he offers them around
angle on a conveyor belt sorting mail
a hand reaches in correcting mistakes
suddenly a hamburger passes by
jezzie looks up and smiles
hows it going
she takes the hamburger and shrugs
continuing im going home
i dont know
one of these days im gonna see louis
my backs killing me
what about the boss
hes not gonna like it
continuing well ill miss riding home with you
i was looking forward to it
ill be glad to avoid the crush
i enjoy crushing into you
she grabs him and hugs him tightly
jezzie ignores him and squeezes again
cut on a scream to jacob in a chiropractors office
he is lying on a long leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture
louis the chiropractor is a giant of a man pounds
he is adjusting jacobs spine
come on jake
that didnt hurt
how do you know
i know you
how come youre so tense today
what can i tell you
i saw sarah the other day
her knee acting up
what did she have to say
turn on your right side
he turns on his left how about the other right
jacob turns back i dont understand you philosphers
youve got the whole world figured out but you cant remember the difference between right and left
i was absent the day they taught that in school
what did she say
shes like you that way
no wonder your marriage didnt last
put your hand under your head
take a breath and then let it out
he makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on jacobs thigh
continuing ah good
now turn to your left
she talk about the boys
she says she cant get them new coats because you havent sent the alimony for three months
she told you that
he shakes his head did she tell you about the im still paying for the orthodontist
ill bet she didnt mention that
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you
i thought you said she didnt say much
thats about all she said
put your hand up
i think she still loves you
take a breath and let it out
he makes an adjustment
she hasnt said a kind word about me in years
she doesnt stop talking about you
youre always on her mind
thats love jake
she hates me louis
you should go back to her
she threw me out remember
she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn
only we didnt make it
she cant forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office
what can i tell you louis
after nam i didnt want to think anymore
i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos
looking at jacob with affection if it was any other brain but yours i might agree
relax this is going to be strong
i cant relax
wiggle your toes
jacob wiggles his toes
at that instant louis twists jacobs neck rapidly
there is a loud cracking sound
there is a flash of light
a man rushes at the camera yelling
i found one
he shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos
suddenly louis reappears a halo effect still visible behind his head
what did you do to me
i had to get in there
a deep adjustment
rest a moment and let it set a bit
i had this weird flash just then
i dont know
ive been having them recently
he thinks a moment then changes the subject you know you look like an angel louis an overgrown cherub
anyone ever tell you that
every time i see you
no more errol flynn okay
your back wont take it
you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows whats good for you
louis youre a life saver
jacob is walking down nostrand avenue
he is singing to himself and imitating al jolson
when there are gray skies i dont mind the gray skies as long as theres you
it is near dusk and lights are just coming on
the shop windows have a particularly garish look about them
the mannequins are dressed in inexpensive almost tawdry clothes and have a pathetic appearance
a few shops have set up their christmas decorations
the ornamentation seems strangely out of place almost blasphemous
jacob passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug store
they chortle and make taunting sounds
shaking her tits singing hey mr
jacob stops and stares at them
to their surprise he begins to sing with them
he knows the words
they like that
it is a sweet moment
jacob continues walking
he comes to a cross street
the light is green
he is still singing to himself and does not notice a black car sharging around the corner
the car is moving at full speed heading straight toward him
a young man walking a few steps behind yells out
jacob turns and sees the car
he scoots out of the way but it swerves in his direction
the young man calls out again
with a huge thrust jacob hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots by
two men are peering at him from the back seat
they are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads
they do not look human
jacob yells and waves his fist to no effect
after a moment he turns to thank the young man whose scream had saved him but he is gone
jacob and jezzie are lying in bed
they are a sensual couple and even in quiet reflective moments such as this their positioning is erotic and stimulating
both of them are nude
jacobs hands are clasped behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling
jezzie is lying on her side her left leg draped across jacobs pelvis
her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on jacobs stomach
neither are talking
suddenly out of the blue jezzie speaks
maybe its all the pressure jake
things like that
or your wife
why do you bring her up
cause shes always on your mind
when was the last time i said a word
it has nothin to do with talkin
she pauses for a while long enough to suppose that the conversation is over
then she continues
continuing or maybe its the war
jacob closes his eyes
continuing its still there jake
she points to his brain even if you never say a word about it
you cant spend two years in vietnam
annoyed what does that have to do with anything
does it explain the barricaded subway stations
does it explain those godforsaken creatures
new york is filled with creatures
and lots of stations are closed
theyre like demons jez
theyre winos and bag ladies
thats all they are
the streets are crawling with em
dont make em into somethin theyre not
she rubs his forehead its the pressure honey
thats all it is
those guys tried to kill me tonight
they were aiming right at me
kids on a joy ride
happens all the time
they werent human
what were they jake
jacob doesnt answer
he turns over on his stomach
jezzie stares at his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks
scratch marks follow in their wake
you still love me
he does not respond
jacob and jezzie are sitting at the breakfast table
jezzie is reading the national enquirer and chewing at her lip
suddenly a drop of blood forms and falls onto the formica table top
staring at it for a moment she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue
jacob is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the housing project across the way
the toaster pops
she gets up butters her toast and returns to her paper
says here the worlds comin to an end
the battle of heaven and hell they call it
should be quite a show fireworks h bombs and everything
you believe them jake
jacob doesnt answer
continuing me neither
god look at this
only lived two days
a day for each head
could you imagine me with two heads
wed probably keep each other up all night arguing and whatnot
you wanna see the picture
he does not respond
jezzie gets up and walks over to jacob
standing in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart
she is naked underneath it
sensuously she leans forward unbuttons his shirt and strokes his chest
she waits for a response from him but there is none
he sits silently disinterested
furious jezzie turns away
grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on
breasts flash from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the floor
continuing goddamn you son of a bitch
my uncles dogs used to treat me better than you do
at least theyd lick my toes once in a while
at least they showed some fucking interest
a neighbor bangs on the wall shouting
jacob peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the patterns of early morning movement
tiny figures drift purposefully over the concrete
suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off
in the silence jacob realizes that jezzie is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen table
he walks to her side and strokes her hair
jezzie begins to sob
after a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes
you love me
he nods his head yes
she smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a kitten against his crotch
after a few moments she speaks
continuing dellas partys tonight
why dont we go
itll take your minf offa things
and i wont make you dance
he nods his head in consent
jezzie hugs him you still love me jake
he nods his head again only heavily as though the question exhausts him
jacob is in the mental health clinic at bellvue hospital walking through the psychiatric emergency room
it is overflowing with people
some are handcuffed to their chairs
policemen are with them
jacob approaches the main reception desk
he speaks nervously
id like to speak to dr
is he new here
hes been here for years
she shrugs and looks at a log book
not according to my charts
do you have an appointment
shaking his head look i need to see him
i know where his room is
just give me a pass
i wont be long
our doctors are seen by appointment only
i was in the veterans out patient program
he knows me
not happy whats your name
she walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times before coming back over to jacob
im sorry but theres no record of a jacob singer in our files
whataya mean no record
you want me to spell it out
theres nothing here
ive been coming here for years
listen to me
im going out of my fucking mind here
i need to see him
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers
theres about an hours wait
ill be glad to take your name
why dont you just fill out this form
i dont want a social worker
carlson knows me
jacob pounds the desk rattling a tiny african violet and knocking the receptionists forms to the floor
she grunts angrily and stoops to retrieve them
standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off
two knuckle like horns protrude from her skull where the cap had been
jacobs eyes lock on them like radar
he backs away
she immediately replaces her cap and breaks the spell but her eyes glare at him with demonic intensity
jacob freaked angry turns and runs toward the in patient door
you cant go in there
jacob doesnt stop
a policeman guarding the entrance runs after him
jacob charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution
a line of mental patients all holding hands is moving down the hall
they break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream
their attendant tries to calm them down but the sight of the policeman increases their hysteria
they grab hold of him as he tries to get by
jacob dashes out of view
he runs down another corridor wildly searching for a specific room
he finds it and rushes inside
he is surprised to find a group of men and women seated in a circle
they all look up at him
can i help you
im looking for dr
isnt this his office
the leader stares at him uncomfortably
after a moment he gets up and takes jacob into a corner of the room
everyone is watching them
the leader speaks quietly
im so sorry
obviously you havent dr
a car accident
last month before thanksgiving
how did it happen
no one knows
they say it blew up
growing pale blew up
what do you mean it blew up
the leader shrugs and tries to put his arm around jacob but he pulls away
do you want me to get someone
he backs quickly to the door
as he turns to leave he realizes that all of the people in the group are watching him intently
unsettled jacob hurries back into the hallway
he is frightened and confused
suddenly a voice calls out
jacob turns and sees the policeman waiting for him
his gun is drawn
just hold it
where the hell do you think you are
this is bellevue for gods sake
people running around here get shot
the group leader pokes his head out of the door and motions to the its alright
nodding reholstering his gun come on get out of here
i wouldnt want to interfere with the u
he leads jacob toward the lobby
jacob does not look back
we hear loud dance music
sly and the family stone
jacob is with some post office employees at a crowded party in a small apartment
a drunk is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same time
it is constantly on the verge of spilling
jacob is fixated on it
in the background we see jezzie dancing and motioning for jacob to join her
he nods no
the drunk who keeps asking people if they get it takes jacobs head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying to re explain the joke
jacob hears a strange noise and looks around
it seems to be coming from a covered bird cage
he goes over to it and lifts the cover
the bird is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out
the sound loud and insistent startles him
he lowers the cover
in the dining room several people are gathered around elsa an attractive black woman who is reading palms
she sees jacob and calls over the music
let me look at your hand
della dancing nearby calls out
go on jake
she reads em like a book
cut to a close up of jacobs hand
elsa is squeezing the mounds and examining the lines
what begins as a playful expression on her face turns suddenly serious
she reaches for his other hand and compares the two of them
jezzie looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene jealously
you have an unusual hand
i could have told you that
you see this line here
its your life line
heres where you were born
and this is where you got married
youre a married man huh
see this split
she studies his life line with growing concern
jezzie tries to get jacobs attention
he ignores her
continuing you know you got a strange line here
examining it its short huh
laughing oh terrific
its not funny
according to this
youre already dead
smiling just my luck
their movements are loose and getting looser
the music is strong and insistent
the smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and gives them a strange distorted appearance
suddenly jezzie breaks from the crowd and reaches for jacob
he pulls away
some of the male dancers call out to him
come on man show your stuff
jacob is easily intimidated
relenting he glares at jezzie and nods apologetically to elsa
it is obvious that he is embarrassed at his inadequacy on the dance floor
come on professor
you got feet too
jacob tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing
jezzie is playing with him mimicking his movement
a number of dancers notice and laugh which only increases his discomfort
jezzies taunting has a strange effect on jacob
he grows distant and withdrawn even though his body is still going through the motions of the dance
a man taps jezzie on the shoulder
she spins around smiling and begins dancing with him
jacob is left alone dancing by himself
he looks away uncomfortable
in the shadows a woman kneels close to the floor
she seems to be urinating on the carpet
jacob is shocked
several dancers obscure his view
he turns around
a pregnant woman stands half naked in the kitchen
jacob cannot believe what he sees
in the next room past jezzie jacob glimpses a terrifying image a man whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has lost all definition
something about the image compels and frightens jacob
slowly he approaches it
as he draws nearer to it the tortured image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that jacob backs away
a woman laughing grabs jacob spins him around and begins dancing with him
he is totally disoriented
hold me baby
she takes jacobs arm and guides it to her back
the camera follows his hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy loose fitting dress
he runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades
then suddenly he recoils
her back is a mass of shoulder blades hundreds of strange bony protrusions
out of the blue jezzie leans into him and wiggles her tongue in his ear
jacob startled jerks his head and his glasses go flying to the floor
he stoops down blindly to pick them up
shoes just miss his fingers as he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them
miraculously he grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back on
instantly his world comes back into focus
as he stands jacob is surprised to find jezzie facing him gyrating in wild abandon
there is a huge satisfied smile on her face
she grabs his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is dancing to her own rhythm
jacob stares at her confused
it takes him a moment to realize that her smile is not for him
standing behind jezzie is another dancer his hands around her waist
they are moving together locked in erotic embrace
it appears that he is mounting her from behind
looking down we see that the dancers feet are deformed
they have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much like hooves
they skid and careen amidst the dancing feet
something horrible and winglike flaps behind jezzies back
we cannot make out what it is but it elicits a primal terror
before jacob can react jezzie opens her mouth
with a roaring sound a spiked horn erupts from her throat
it juts menacingly from between her teeth and thrusts into the air
a circle of dancers scream out in excited approval
cut to jacobs face as it registers terror and disbelief
he stares at the dancers who are crowding around him
they have become perverse corrupt aspects of their normal selves
jacob grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head but it wont go away
the music throbs
his actions become spastic almost delirious
jacob is out of control
his frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind
we move in on him as his eyes pass beyond pain
the dark walls of the apartment fade away
strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud
the faces are looking down and voices are speaking
hes burning up
thats some gash
his guts keep spilling out
push em back
his eyes focus on the moon
rings of light emenate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance
the rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed
the rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling almost sensual surge of color
the display is spectacular and compelling
music can be heard in the distance growing hard and insistent like a heart beat
heavy breathing accompanies the sound
the stroboscopic flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light
the music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo
the apartment reappears in all its normalcy
the neon sign is still flashing outside the window
dancers are smiling and sweating
cheers and applause ring out for jacob and jezzie but jacob barely hears them
jezzie hugs him tightly
people smack him on the back
you are out of your mind man
out of your fuckin mind
jake you little devil
you never told me you could dance like that
jezzie what did you put in his drink
jezzie smiles while pulling jacob to a corner chair
he plops down
his chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach
hie face is frightened and distorted
i wanna leave
get me out of here
oh come on
pulling jezzie close to him his voice filled with paranoia where are we
surprised by the question were at dellas
what do you mean
where do you think
bring her here
show me della
confused hey im here
jacob eyes her with a pleading look
annoyed jezzie leaves jacob and crosses the room
he watches her as she goes
jacob is holding his stomach and rocking painfully
moments later jezzie returns with della
that was some dance
staring at her closely della
feeling the strangeness you want to see me
well here i am
what do you want
just to see you
a bit uncomfortable well how do i look
suddenly jacob breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking
his entire body is convulsive
are you feeling all right
shit youre burning up
feel his forehead
checking his forehead and cheeks damn thats hot
maybe from dancing
i think you should lie down
jacob is shaking uncontrollably
people are gathering around
continuing cant you stop it
if i could stop it id stop it
is he sick
hes on fire
let me help you
she reaches out to jacob
unexpectedly he recoils jumping to his feet like a wild man
he begins to scream
stay away from me
dont you come near me
all of you
go to hell
go to hell goddamn you
jezzie stares at jacob with a confused and embarrassed look
a man whispers to her
ill call a cab
jacob is lying in bed in his own bedroom with a thermometer in his mouth
jezzie is pacing the floor with great agitation
ive never been so mortified in my whole life
screaming like that
i dont understand whats gotten into you jake to make you do a thing like that
youre not acting normal
ive lived with too many crazies in my life
i dont want it anymore
i cant handle it
im tired of men flipping out on me
shit youd think it was my fault
well you picked me remember that
i dont need this
the neighbor pounds on the wall
continuing all right
jezzie jabs her finger at the wall
continuing if you go crazy on me youre goin crazy by yourself
jezzie reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer
she looks at it closely and then squints to see it better
whats it say
a hundred and two
i dont believe this
im calling the doctor
she runs out of the room
jacob calls after her
what does it say
its gone to the top
how high is that
the numbers stop at
jezzie is on the phone to the doctor in the next room
jacob begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the foot of the bed
he pulls it up around his shoulders
the whole bed vibrates with his shivering
suddenly jezzie rushes through the bedroom and into the bathroom
she turns on the bath water
what the hell are you doin
get your clothes off
what are you talking about
get your clothes off
jacob gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the kitchen
whatd the doctor say
that youd die on the way to the hospital
now get into that tub
jacob stares at her as she bursts back into the bedroom carrying four trays of ice cubes
she hurries into the bathroom and dumps them in the tub
hes coming right over
get in here
i cant stand around waiting
she rushes out of the bathroom and pulls jacob out of bed
he is shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and undressing him at the same time
she maneuvers him into the bathroom next to the tub
he looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water
youre out of your mind
im not getting in there
id rather die
thats your decision
look at me
im ice cold
youre red hot damn it
get in there
ive got to get more ice
she runs out of the room
the door to the apartment slams shut
jacob sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly
he sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water turns his foot bright red
he keeps it in as long as he can and then yanks it out quickly wrapping it in a towel
jacob rubs his foot vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water afraid of its pain
jezzie is running up and down the corridor knocking on doors and collecting ice cubes from those who will answer
she hurries back to the bathroom with several people behind her carrying additional ice trays
one of the men is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the burning cold
as jezzie enters the bathroom jacob is sitting on the rim of the tub with the water up to his calves shivering vigorously
i cant do it
what kind of man are you
she unloads two trays into the water
dont gimme that
my feet are throbbing
calling out sam tony come in here
hey im not dressed
you got nothin we aint seen before
sam and tony grab hold of jacob who wrestles to get away
get the hell off me
hes like a hot coal
its for your own good jake
let go of me you sons of bitches
the two men struggle with jacob and force him into the water
tony winces when the water hits his arm
jacob nearly flies out of the tub
the two men fight to hold him down
jacob screams and cries for the men to let him go but they keep him flat on his back
continuing im freezing
his hand turning red sam i cant take it
dont you let go
jez get help
my hands are killing me
to tony here
ill do it
take his legs
run your hands under hot water
carmichael comes in
i have some ice from the machine
bring it in
is he all right
he doesnt like it
i dont blame him
what should i do with the ice
pour it in
on top of him
hes melting it as fast as we dump it in
my husbands got two more bags
tony helps her pour the ice into the water
youre killing me
cut to jacob lying in a bedroom we have not seen before
he is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out
suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window
it is open and the shade is flapping
cold air is blowing in and he is shivering
you and your fresh air
he jumps out of bed and goes over to the window
he pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang
a woman in the bed sits up
it is sarah
what was that
im not cold
of course not
you have all the blankets
it must be ten degrees in here
im telling you sarah if you want to sleep with fresh air you sleep on the fire escape
from now on that window is closed
its not healthy with it closed
this is healthy
ill probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy
he settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side
he lies quietly for a moment thinking
continuing what a dream i was having
i was living with another woman
you know who it was
i dont want to know
jezebel from the post office
you remember you met her that time at the christmas party
i was living with her
god it was a nightmare
there were all these demons and i was on fire
only i was burning from ice
see what happens when you cheat on me even in your mind
she was good in bed though
go to sleep
she had these real beefy thighs
i thought you said it was a nightmare
suddenly out of nowhere we hear the tinkling sound of a music box
a young boy enters the room carrying a musical lunch box in his arms
he is wearing a long t shirt nearly down to his ankles
we recognize him from his photograph
it is gabe
daddy what was that noise
surprised to see him gabe
he stares curiously at his son what are you doing
there was a bang
it was the window
tell your mother
i heard you
go back to sleep
will you tuck me in
not happily oh
she starts to rise
jacob stops her and gets up instead
he whisks gabe upside down and carries him into his bedroom licking his belly and tickling him all the way
gabe laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed
jed and eli are both in bunk beds across the room
jed looks up
its the middle of the night
he kisses gabe and goes over to jed in the lower bunk whats up
you forgot my allowance
its five a
well talk at breakfast
okay but dont forget
suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk
i love you dad
what is this a convention
i love you too pickles
now go back to sleep
he turns to leave
he smiles im not going anywhere
im right here gabe
he looks at his son tenderly come on go back to sleep
you can still get a couple of hours
he hugs him warmly and then walks to the door
i love you
there is deep emotion and seriousness in gabes words
jacob is struck by them
continuing dont shut the door
jacob nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar
continuing a bit more
a bit more
jacob adjusts the opening enough to please gabe and make him secure
gabe smiles and cuddles in his bed
jacob settles back into bed
sarah turns over and gets comfortable
jacob lies on his back facing the ceiling
he pulls the blankets up to his neck
he is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing
i love you sarah
she smiles warmly
his eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back asleep
we hear summer morning sounds crickets and birds
the image of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky just before sunrise can be seen through the branches
it is an idyllic setting
suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance a metallic humming growing louder
there is a scramble of feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall grass
voices can be heard
move em out
bust your balls
there is an instant swell of activity
trees and branches blur and speed by overhead
the idyllic image of moments before reveals itself as a p
the camera races out of a jungle covering and into a huge clearing
high overhead a helicopter appears
its blades whirl with a deafening whine
long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid air
soldiers leap up into the air reaching for them
the air is filled with turbulence
tarps fly off dead bodies
soldiers hold them down
voices yell but the words are not clear
they are filled with urgency
the camera leaves the ground
the edges of the sky disappear as the helicopters gray mass fills the frame
it grows larger and darker as the camera approaches
rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come into view
suddenly the stretcher begins spinning out of control
hands emerge from inside reaching out to grab it
watery womb like sounds rise out of nowhere the rippling of water a heart beating
gradually voices can be heard mumbling distant sounds warm and familiar
jacobs doctor reaches down to help him out of the tub
surprisingly jezzie and mrs
carmichael are standing there too
jacob stares at them in total confusion
you are a lucky man my friend
a lucky man
you must have friends in high places thats all i can say
sam and tony appear next to the doctor
they are extending their hands to the p
jacobs arms nearly blue reach out to them
slowly they lift him from the icy water
jacob takes one step onto the tile and collapses to the floor
fade in sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet
a glass rattles on a tray
a television is on low in the background
slowly the camera lens opens from jacobs p
and we see jezzie puttering around the bedroom
suddenly she is aware that jacob is watching her
she places her hand on his head and strokes his hair youre gonna be all right jake
youre gonna be fine
am i home
the doctor said youre lucky your brains didnt boil
she smiles what a night jake
it was crazy
you kept sayin sarah close the window over and over
and talkin to your kids
even the dead one
you know you melted pounds of ice in hours
are we in brooklyn
youre right here jake
you just rest
she puffs up his pillow the doctor said you had a virus
thats what they say when they dont know what it is
you cant do anything for a week
he says you gotta recuperate
she strokes his forehead and gets up now you just lie here
sandelman made you some chicken soup
itll warm you up
jezzie leaves the room
jacob watches her as she goes
he seems lost and confused
jacob unshaven wearing his bathrobe is sitting at the kitchen table
piles of books on demonology are spread out before him
he studies them to distraction
jezzie is standing by the counter making sandwiches
she wraps them in plastic baggies and puts one in a lunch box another in the refrigerator
she is dressed in her postal uniform
you know you really ought to get out today
you cant just sit around like this all the time
its not healthy
its not good for your mind
go take a walk or somethin
go to a movie
christ whos gonna know
you think i care
i dont give a shit
one of us should be having a good time
jezzie knocks on jacobs head hello
she looks in his ear anybody in there
jezzie just stares at him
she does not respond
jacob returns to his books
cut to close up images of winged demons real demons with spindly horns and long tails
jacobs huge finger magnified scans page after page of ancient images and archaic text
jezzie enraged at his lack of attention returns to packing her lunch box
suddenly she spins around
i cant stand it anymore
ive had it up to here
go ahead and rot if you want
you son of a bitch im talking to you
cut back to the demons
suddenly a crashing sound catches jacobs attention as a kitchen pot flies by his head
he looks up to see jezzie knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room
the noise is terrible
the intensity of her rage is shocking
the pots crash into every surface knocking all his books onto the floor
and then suddenly she stops
jezzie stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich stuffs it back in its plastic baggie and puts it back in her lunch box
she is about to leave when she stops and looks at jacob
continuing her anger in check i made you a tuna fish sandwich
its in the fridge
eat a carrot with it
the aspirins on the bottom shelf
were out of soap so if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again use the dishwashing stuff
she walks out of the room and returns with her coat im sorry i yelled but you get on my nerves
she bends down and makes eye contact with hello
listen i gotta go
jezzie sits on his lap gives him a big kiss and then unexpectedly raises two fingers like horns over her head
the gesture catches jacobs full attention
continuing look im horny
keep it in mind
she kisses his cheek love me a little
speaking with affection you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met
one second youre a screaming banshee and the next youre florence nightingale
who are you
thats what i want to know
will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up
suddenly the telephone rings
it startles them
tell em ive left
jezzie grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down
a pocketful of change falls on the floor
jezzie curses as she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right
jacob gets the phone
well ill be goddamned
jacob indicates its for him
jezzie throws him a kiss goodbye and hurries out the door
you son of a bitch how the hell are you
i havent seen you in what five six years
a long time
howve you been
whats happening in your life
nothing too exciting
so tell me to what do i owe the honor
i need to see you jake
id love to see you
but im kind of laid up here
ive been sick
i need to see you
jacob and paul are driving through east new york heading toward williamsburg
the elevated trains rumble above them
jacob pats paul on the back
jesus man you look terrific
you must have put on twenty pounds
i work in a bakery
how many vets you know are even employed
count em on one hand
its almost like a conspiracy huh
that goddamn war
im still fightin it
its not worth it
youll never win
you tellin me
how many times can you die huh
paul looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes
he sees a black car tagging close behind him
he pulls out
so does the car
continuing still married jake
you and everybody else
god i hate this area
makes me nervous
why the hell we drivin here
i just need to talk
you cant talk in brownsville
im not sure where i can talk anymore
lets get a couple drinks okay
he looks at his rear view mirror hey take a look behind us
do you think that car is followin us
turning to look that black car
pull the mirror down on the sun visor
jacob does just watch em
whats goin on paul
i dont know
you in trouble
jacob notices pauls left arm
it is shaking
the black car passes on the left
both paul and jacob stare at it as it speeds by
jacob and paul are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure williamsburg bar
it is nearly empty
paul is leaning across the table in a very intimate fashion
somethins wrong jake
i dont know what it is but i cant talk to anybody about it
i figured i could with you
you always used to listen you know
paul takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into jacobs eyes
continuing im going to hell
jacobs face grows suddenly tense
continuing thats as straight as i can put it
and dont tell me that im crazy cause i know im not
im goin to hell
theyre comin after me
frightened but holding back who is
theyve been followin me
theyre comin outta the walls
i dont trust anyone
im not even sure i trust you
but i gotta talk to someone
im gonna fly outta my fuckin mind
paul cannot contain his fear
he jumps up suddenly and walks away from the booth
jacob follows him with his eyes but does not go after him
a young man in the next booth observes the scene with interest
he looks vaguely familiar like we have seen him before
paul stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke box
he pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot
his finger pushes a selection at random
some s rock hit blares out
jacobs mind is reeling by the time paul sits back down
sometimes i think im just gonna jump outta my skin
theyre just drivin me wild
i dont know who they are or what they are
but theyre gonna get me and im scared jake
im so scared i cant do anything
i cant go to my sisters
i cant even go home
theyre waitin for me thats why
pauls hand starts to shake
the tremor spreads rapidly to his whole body
the booth begins to rattle
continuing i cant stop it
help me jake
jacob slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward paul
he puts his arm around him and holds him tightly offering comfort as best he can
paul is obviously terrified and grateful for jacobs gesture
a few people at the bar look over in their direction
its okay paul
crying i dont know what to do
dont do anything
paul begins to relax a bit and the shaking subsides paul i know what youre talking about
what do you mean
ive seen them too
staring at jacob youve seen them
everywhere like a plague
i thought i was the only one
i had no idea
its like i was coming apart at the seams
what is it paul
whats happening to me
they keep telling me im already dead that theyre gonna tear me apart piece by piece and throw me into the fire
he fumbles in his coat pocket and pulls out a small bible and silver cross i carry these everywhere but they dont help
everyone thinks im crazy
my mother filed a report with the army
stunned the army
she said i havent been the same since then
since that night
theres still this big hole in my brain
its so dark in there jake
and these creatures
its like theyre crawling out of my brain
what happened that night
why wont they tell us
i dont know
i dont know
theyre monsters jake
were both seein em
theres gotta be a connection
jacob leans back in the booth his mind racing
the young man in the next booth is watching them with rapt attention
paul and jacob are in the mens room
paul flushes the urinal
im afraid to go by myself anymore
i keep thinkin one of ems gonna come up behind me
somethins wrong when a guy cant even take a leak by himself
ive seen em take people right off the street
i used to go home a different way every night
now i cant even go home
you come home with me
what about your girlfriend
you dont think shell mind
are you kidding
weve put up more of her cousins
you wouldnt believe how they breed down there
the two men leave the bar on a dingy side street
it is cold outside
christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bars front window
paul looks at them and smiles
paul steps into the street and walks to the drivers side of his car
he pulls out his keys and opens the door
jacob looks down on the sidewalk and notices a dime
goddamn this is my lucky day
he bends down to pick it up
paul inserts the key into the ignition and steps on the gas
he turns the key
the car explodes
pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air
jacob sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him
he covers his head
cut to a helicopter suffering an air bombardment
flack is exploding all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently
jacobs eyes peer to the left
infantry gunners are firing rockets into the jungle below
a pair of medics are huddled over him
a sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield
the pilot unable to see clears it away with his hands
jacob screams over the roar of the chopper
one of the medics presses his ear close to jacob to hear
were doing the best we can
get me out of here
the young man from the bar grabs jacob under the arms and drags him down the sidewalk
just hold on
where am i
who are you
the young man yanks jacob around the corner just as another explosion consumes the car
the air is filled with flames and flying debris
the young man pulls jacob into the bar
just lie still
youre not hurt
the customers are in a state of bedlam
part of the wall has blown apart and bricks and glass are everywhere
the cross from around pauls neck is buried in the debris
sirens are heard in the distance
a black car speeds off down the street
jacob looks for the young man who had helped him
he is gone
a funeral procession heads down ocean parkway
jacob and jezzie are driving in an old chevy nova
they are dressed up
jacobs face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear
they drive in silence
jacob appears very sad
slowly his right hand reaches across the seat seeking jezzies
their fingers embrace
the funeral procession enters the cemetery
cars park along the length of the narrow road
men in dark suits emerge from their cars along with wives and girlfriends
they are the soldiers we have seen at the opening of the film only they are older now
a small group of family members are helped to the graveside
jacob joins the other veterans as pallbearers
they carry the casket in semi military formation to the grave
jacobs old army buddies are sitting together in pauls living room talking
pauls wife can be seen in the bedroom
several women are comforting her
jezzie is talking to a small group of ladies in the dining room and nibbling off a tray of cold cuts
pauls sister is with her and they seem to be having a lively almost intimate conversation
jacob and his buddies are drinking beer
they all have a tired defeated look about them
did anyone see the police report
it sounds like a detonation job to me
the paper said it was electrical a freak accident
someones covering somethin
that was no accident
why do you say that
cars dont explode that way
any simpleton knows that
but the paper
that was set
im tellin you
paul didnt have an enemy in the world
how do you know
hey youre talkin about paul
whod want to hurt him
what did he talk about when you guys went out
did he say anything
he was upset
he thought people were following him
he didnt know
obviously struck by the word what do you mean demons
he told me he was going to hell
the statement has a surprising impact on the group
there is immediate silence and eyes averted from one another
whatd he say that for
what made him say that
what else did he say jake
he was scared
he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork
they were tryin to get him he said
his arm shaking how long had that been going on
a couple of weeks i think
he notices georges beer can rattling
he say what they looked like
excuse me a minute
ill be right back
in one end out the other huh george
george tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom
his arm is nearly out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks
continuing still a spastic huh
i hope you can hold your dick better than you hold that can
no one laughs
there is an uncomfortable silence
the six men are walking quietly through an unpaved alley
it is already gray and getting darker
i know what paul was talking about
i dont know how to say this
but in a way its a relief knowing that someone else saw them too
theyre not human ill tell you that
a car tried to run over me the other day
it was aiming straight for me
i saw their faces
they werent from brooklyn
what are you tellin me
theyre from the bronx

theres no such thing as demons
jacob frank jerry george doug and rod are sitting on plush chairs in the law office of donald geary
geary a red faced man with three chins is sucking on an ice cube
he looks at each of the men and then spits the ice cube into an empty glass
im sorry mr
singer but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world
itd break your heart
this isnt injustice mr
the army did something to us and weve got to find out what
what is it with you guys
were not talking about a trip to the library here
this is the united states government for gods sake
this is red tape coming out of your ass
you know what i mean
and we need someone to cut through it
we hear youre the man
what am i perry mason here
geary stands up and grabs a bag of cheetos from a file drawer
he chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others
there are no takers
thirsty he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth
ill look into it
the men are surprised and excited
do you think we have a chance
what do you want a fortune teller or a lawyer
ill need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon or their survivors
hey this is great
ill tell you if we find the military is implicated in any way you could stand to recover quite a lot of money
not that i can predict anything but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements
that wouldnt be so bad would it mr
geary looks at him oddly ph
i thought you were a mailman
confused then why arent you teaching
why arent you in a university
im too messed up to teach
well then theyre going to have to pay for that arent they
the men all nod in agreement
jacob and the others exit the office building
they are jubilant clasping hands and smacking each other on the back
we watch as they break up
jacob heads for the subway
frank and another group hop a cab
as the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind it
it follows them out of sight
jacob and jezzie are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen floor
the wastebasket flips over
jacobs hand splashes into the dogs bowl
nothing impedes their passion
jezzie laughs hollers and swoons
hands grab hold of table legs
feet bang wildly against the stove
it is all mayhem and ecstacy
and then it ends
jacobs face is ecstatic
he can barely talk and simply basks in jezzies glow
she looks especially lovely and radiant
they lie exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor
so tell me
am i still an angel
smiling broadly with wings
you transport me you know that
you carry me away
jezzie kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with her pinky
jacob loves it
were all angels you know
she bites his earlobe
he winces and devils
its just what you choose to see
i love you jez
underneath all the bullshit just love
you know what
exorcised like the demons are gone
in a way
at least now i have some idea of what was happening
if we can only get them to admit
to explain what they did
i dont know
maybe itd clear things up in my head
ill tell you something jez honestly i thought they were real
suddenly jezzie roars like a monster and scares jacob half to death
they laugh and tumble back to the floor
jacob emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe
jezzie is moving rapidly around the kitchen
i put a frozen dinner in the oven a manhandler
itll be ready at a quarter of
i threw a little salad together
its in the fridge
i also bought some apple juice red cheek
dont drink it all
oh and jake your lawyer called
grabbing her coat while you were in the shower
why didnt you call me
he didnt give me a chance
she pauses nervously look honey dont get upset but hes not taking your case
what do you mean
he said you didnt have one
whats he talking about
i dont know
thats all he said
he wasnt very friendly
he said your buddies backed down
they chickened out he said
i dont believe this
baby im sorry
i feel terrible
id stay and talk but im so late
look dont be upset
well talk when i get home
see you around midnight
she kisses him on the cheek bye
and dont brood
the door slams securely
the locks set
jacob begins instantly rifling through a desk drawer
he comes up with a frayed address book and looks up a number
we see frank standing at a window fingering the venetian blinds
he does not reply
the scene intercuts between the two men
continuing listen i just got a strange call from geary
he said the guys backed down
whats he talking about
fingering the venetian blinds thats right
what does that mean frank
i dont get it
its hard to explain
angry well try huh
i dont know if i can
its just that war is war
what the fuck are you talking about
they did something to us frank
we have to expose this
theres nothing to expose
whos been talking to you
silence whats going on
how can you just turn away
no response what about the others
theyre not interested jake
you know its not half the case if i go it alone
were all suffering the same symptoms frank
the army is to blame
theyve done something to us
how can you not want to know
pausing maybe its not the army jake
what do you mean
maybe theres a larger truth
what are you talking about
maybe the demons are real
what kind of bullshit is that
i gotta go
what the hell
what kind of mumbo jumbo
im hanging up
dont bother to call again okay
frank hangs up
jacob stands holding the phone for a long time until the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him its off the hook
the sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down
quickly jacob tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers
they arent there
jacob hurries into the bedroom and pulls an old shoe box from the closet
the box is filled with yellowing army papers dog tags and photos of old comrades
beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies
jacob grabs it
then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter
he picks it up and unfolds it with great care
the letter is written in a childs handwriting
dear daddy i love you
please come home
jed got gabe on a bicycle is rushing down the sidewalk
jacob is running alongside him holding onto the seat
plastic streamers trail from the handlebars
gabe is a bit wobbly but determined
after a couple of false starts jacob lets go and gabe is riding by himself
for an instant gabe looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face
jacob is grinning too
the camera holds on gabe as he pulls away from us and heads into the distance
jacob swallows hard as he stands there holding the letter
suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted on the bedroom door
something in the mirror like the image of a child seems to move
he looks over
there is nothing there
curious jacob walks toward the mirror
as his image appears he gasps and stops moving
to his horror and ours it is his own back that is reflected in the mirror
the impossibility of the moment startles him
he lifts his hand
the reflection moves with him
frightened but defiant jacob moves toward the mirror
the image in the mirror spins around
it is the frightening vibrating face he saw at the party with jezzie
an unearthly scream comes from both their mouths
a huge wooden door slams open
jacob charges through it
he is chasing his lawyer donald geary through a crowded court house corridor
geary sweaty and unshaven is cradling a coke in one hand a sandwich and a briefcase in the other
his stomach bounces wildly as he walks
listen goddamn it
you cant just walk away from this
geary keeps walking
jacob catches up to him
continuing whos been talking to you
have they been talking to you huh
nobodys been talking to nobody
you dont have a case you hear me
its pure and simple
now leave me alone
jacob grabs the back of gearys jacket and pulls him up short
continuing take your hands off me
jacob lets go
he stares into gearys eyes
listen will you listen
theyre trying to get me
theyre comin out of the walls
the armys done something to me
i need you
and whats he gonna do tell me im crazy
theyve fucked with my head
ive got to prove it
youve got to do something
geary gives jacob a pitiful look
theres nothing i can do
he turns and walks away
jacob stands there a moment and then rushes after him
geary is biting into his sandwich
mayonnaise spills onto his hand
he licks it with his tongue
jacob catches up to him
im eating huh
somethings going on here
youre not telling me something
what the hells gotten into you
ill tell you whats gotten into me
i dont know you from adam right
you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it
i said id check it out and i did
now i dont know what kind of fool you take me for but you have used and abused me and i dont like it
i talked to the armys bureau of records
youve never even been to viet nam
what the hell is that supposed to mean
it means that you and your buddies are whacko that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand
stunned war games
thats not true
how can you believe that
cant you see what theyre doing
its all a lie
we were in da nang for gods sake
youve got to believe me
i dont have to do any such thing
im eating my lunch okay
geary takes a swig of his coke and begins walking away
jacob enraged charges after him
with a wild swipe he sends the coke can shooting out of gearys hand
it reverberates down the corridor
geary is stunned
you slimy bastard
you goddamn piece of shit
with a powerful thrust jacob rips the sandwich from gearys other hand
tossing it on the floor he grinds his heel in it
tomato and mayonnaise squirt onto gearys shoe
jacob turns away
cut to jacob walking down the court house corridor to the elevators
there is a look of satisfaction on his face
cut back to geary
he picks up a telephone and dials
someone comes on the line
geary speaks quietly
hes on his way
cut to jacob stepping onto the elevator
the doors close
the muzak is playing sonny boy with al jolson singing
jacob is surprised to hear it
he presses the down button for the main floor
the elevator stops at the lobby
the doors open swiftly
several soldiers are standing there
they approach jacob
lets go singer
jacob is shocked to see them
he tries to get away but two of the soldiers yank him toward the lobby doors
youre coming with us
jacob is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside in between two officious looking men
the doors lock from the drivers command
what an appropriate name for a man who cant keep his mouth shut
the car drives off
who are you
what do you want
weve been watching you for a long time
you and your friends
youve been exhibiting some very odd behavior
frightening people with foolish talk about demons and experiments
jacob tries to speak but the other man grabs his mouth
youre in over your head mr
men drown that way
the army was another part of your life
it is dead and buried
let it lie
i hope we have made our point mr
jacob stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk
letting out a howl he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman
he is totally out of control
with a wild leap he grabs for the door handle
the door flies open
it flaps back and forth slamming into parked cars
jacob tries to jump out but the men yank him back in
one of them pulls out a gun
jacob sees it and goes crazy
his feet kick in all directions slamming the drivers nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window
the car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor
the men dive for it
it lodges beneath the seat
in the mayhem jacob throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement
people look down at him as the car speeds away
jacob grabs his back
he is in excruciating pain
he tries to get up but cant move
he reaches out to people passing by but they ignore him and hurry past
a salvation army santa has been watching the entire scene
after a moments consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to jacob
he leans down and steals his wallet
cut to the sound of a siren as an ambulance races through the streets
an ambulance crew rushes jacob to a hospital emergency room
hes been screaming like a madman
you better get something in him
approaching jacob hi
im doctor stewart
can you tell me what happened
i cant move
i need my chiropractor
did you fall
they said he slipped on the ice
may have hit his head
does he have any identification
they stole it
i dont know
i had my sons picture in it
its the only one i had
we better get an orthopedic man in here
davis on call
ill page him
call my chiropractor
were doing everything we can
im going to have to move you a bit just to check for injuries
this may hurt a little
dont move me
the resident ignores him
i dont have to ask if you can feel that
i want louis
hes out of it
im taking him down to x ray
an orderly pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors
jacob tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized
jacob begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of corridors
the wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity
the smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement
the orderlys feet plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along the way
the surface grows rougher the wheels more insistent
body parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves faster
where are you taking me
where am i
you know where you are
jacob panicked tries again to get up but to no effect
he glances to the side and sees mournful creatures being led into dark rooms
no one fights or struggles
we hear muffled screams from behind closed doors
occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in strange contraptions people in rusty iron lungs and hanging from metal cages
dark eyes peer out in horror
in one room a baseboard heater bursts into flame
no one seems concerned
a door opens
a bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and mangled
one of its wheels is still spinning
jacob cries out but it is not his voice we hear
rather it is a familiar unearthly roar
his whole body stiffens
as he rounds the corner he sees a figure its head vibrating in endless terror
it is the same image he has seen before
jacob is wheeled into a tiny room
a numer of doctors are waiting
as they draw closer jacob notices that something about them is not right
they bear a subtle resemblance to bosch like demons creatures of another world
jacob tries to sit up but winces in pain
he cannot move
he tries to scream but no sound comes out
chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling
they are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to jacobs arms and legs
the doctors laugh
there is the sound of a huge door closing
jacob is left in semi darkness
suddenly a new group of doctors emerges from the shadows
they are carrying sharp surgical instruments
they surround jacob their eyes glistening as bright as their blades
jacob is panting and sweating in fear
one of the doctors leans over jacob
he gasps with horror
it is jezzie
she pays no attention to him
he stares at her the camera tilting down her body
as it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass swarming with maggots
the doctors laugh
they take great pleasure in his suffering
their voices are strange and not human
each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones sincere and compassionate taunting and mocking at the same time
the confusion of meanings is a torment of its own
continuing get me out of here
where do you want to go
take me home
they all laugh this is your home
i just hurt my back
im not dead
what are you then
then what are you doing here
i dont know
i dont know
he struggles like an animal this isnt happening
what isnt happening
let me out of here
there is no out of here
youve been killed
dont you remember
a doctor approaches jacob
as he turns we notice with horror that he has no eyes or eye sockets
he extracts a long needle from his belt and positions it over jacobs head
like a divining rod it locates a particular point near the crown of his head
with a powerful thrust the doctor shoves the needle into jacobs skull and pushes it slowly into his brain
cut rapidly to vietnam and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence of the film
soldiers with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in the dark of the night
one of the soldiers charges at jacob with a long bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines
jacob cries out
that was years ago
ive lived years since then
its all been a dream
the army did this to me
theyve done something to my brain
he raves like a madman jezzie
i want my boys
im not dead
i want my family
the doctors laugh and back away disappearing into the darkness
suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead
normal hospital walls materialize instantaneously around him
a nurse enters the room followed by sarah eli and jed
they approach jacob who is lying in traction suspended over a hospital bed
hes still pretty doped up
i dont think hell be able to talk yet and i doubt that hell recognize you
i just want to see him
eating a snickers bar dad
we just found out
you look terrible
does that hurt
ill be outside if you need me
we heard what happened
his voice hoarse nearly whispering im not dead
i am not dead
of course youre not
youve just hurt your back
youre going to be fine
itll just take some time
a month they said
trying to joke you just hang in there dad
smacking him thats not funny
she reaches over and rubs jacobs brow what a mess huh
god i wish there was something i could do
i love you jacob
for whatever thats worth
there is a sudden sound of doctors laughing
jacob jerks his head painfully but does not see them
yelling at the unseen voice no
jacob what can i do
jacobs plea confuses sarah
she responds with a kiss
daylight streams through the window in jacobs room
he is still in traction and looks very uncomfortable
a new nurse enters holding a plastic container with a straw poking out
well dont we look better this morning
that was a hard night wasnt it
where am i
you look awake to me
she holds the straw to his lips drink some of this
staring at her intently wheres sarah
where did she go
the nurse gives him a strange look she was here
you havent had any visitors
thats a lie
my family was here
they were as real as you are
the nurse smiles and nods in appeasement
this is not a dream
this is my life
of course it is
what else could it be
she giggles nervously
there is a funny glint in her eyes
jacob looks away
he doesnt want to see it
there is a loud commotion in the hall
we see louis schwartz jacobs chiropractor screaming jacobs name
louis storms through jacobs door followed by several nurses and you cant go in there
youre going to have to leave
louis stares furiously at jacob stretched out on the traction apparatus
he begins to yell
good god jake
what have they done
he examines jacob and screams at the nurses what is this the middle ages
and they call this modern medicine
this is barbaric
turning to jacob its okay jake
its not serious
ill get you out of here
yelling at the orderly what is this the inquisition
why dont you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery
louis charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the pulleys that suspend jacob over the bed
the nurses and orderlies become instantly hysterical and start screaming
what the hell do you think
dont you come near me
you cant do that
what is this a prison
call the police
one of the orderlies lunges at louis who swings back at him with one of the pulley chains
it just misses
to the orderlies you take one step and ill wrap this around your neck
louis lowers jacob into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay
continuing hold on jake were getting out of here
nurses and orderlies part as he pushes him quickly from the room
louis helps jacob over to an adjusting table in a room that compared with the hospital is comfortable and serene
he pushes a lever and the table rises to a vertical position
jacob leans against it and rides it down to a horizontal position
every moment is agony for him
half an hour from now and youll be walking out of here all by yourself
mark my words
jacob barely hears them well youve done it to yourself this time havent you
nearly whispering am i dead louis
louis leans over to hear am i dead
smiling from a slipped disc
thatd be a first
i was in hell
ive been there
i dont want to die louis
well ill see what i can do about it
ive seen it
its all pain
working on jacobs spine like a master mechanic you ever read meister eckart
jacob shakes his head no how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart
louis takes hold of jacobs legs and yanks them swiftly good
okay lets turn over gently
jacob turns to his left
louis shakes his head in dismay
the other right okay
he helps jacob turn over youre a regular basket case you know that
he moves jacobs arm over his head eckart saw hell too
louis positions jacobs other arm bends his legs and then pushes down on his thigh
his spine moves with a cracking sound
continuing you know what he said
the only thing that burns in hell is the part of you that wont let go of your life your memories your attachments
they burn em all away
but theyre not punish ing you he said
theyre freeing your soul
okay other side
he helps jacob and repositions him
again he pushes and the spine cracks
so the way he sees it if youre frightened of dying and hold ing on youll see devils tearing your life away
but if youve made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth
its just a matter of how you look at it thats all
so dont worry okay
wiggle your toes
jacobs toes dance as louis gives him a quick unexpected jab to the lower vertebrae in his back
we got it
louis pushes a lever and the table rises back up okay
lets just give it a little try
see if you can stand
you can do it
just give it a try
jacob steps cautiously away from the table
he moves hesitantly with deliberate restraint
louis encourages him like a faith healer coaxing the lame
his first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them
jacob walks slowly without help
louis smiles impishly
he looks like a giant cherub
louis puts his arm around him
then jacob tries again gradually rediscovering his balance and strength
with each step his confidence returns
louis is pleased
then suddenly without warning jacob turns and heads toward the door
what are you doing
theres something ive gotta take care of louis
what are you talking about
you can barely stand
im walking arent i
jake you need to rest
not tonight louis
no more rest
he walks slowly out the door
louis starts to go after him
jacob turns around and shakes his head no
the look on his face is firm and defiant
louis stands back and lets him go
i love you louis
cut to a sdiren blaring and a fire engine racing through the streets of lower manhattan
a crowd is forming
banks of lights and television cameras amass in the cold night air
police cars and mobile units rush to the scene
cut to jacob
in one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch
in the other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps of the u
army recruiting headquarters
the volatile liquid splashes against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement
a five gallon container lies emptying nearby
gasoline belches from it insistently and pours onto the street
bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes toward them
television cameras and microphones are pointing in jacobs direction but at a safe distance
he is yelling at them his teeth chattering from the cold
listen to me
there were four companies in our batallion
five hundred men
seven of us were left when it was over
four companies engaged in an enemy offensive that not one of us who survived can remember fighting
use the torch
let him talk
police ambulances are arriving at the scene
firemen ready hoses at nearby hydrants
cameras are rolling
shouting you dont forget a battle where men were killed
they did something to us
i want to know the truth the goddamn truth
we have a right to know
he yells toward the cameras are you getting all this
i want this on national t
i want the whole country the whole world to know
he holds up the torch
a loudspeaker blares through the crowd
throw that torch away young man
give yourself up
youre under arrest
for seeking the truth
please come quietly
you come near me and ill blow us all up
were not going to hurt you
give him a chance to talk
the army will deny it
theyve falsified my records
theyve lied to my lawyer threatened my buddies
but they cant threaten me
you tell em
use the torch
okay lets clear the area
suddenly a lighted match flies in jacobs direction
jacob is enraged
he brandishes the torch at the crowd
what the fuck do you think youre doing
another match hurls toward him and dies in mid air
people on the fringe of the crowd begin to run
jacob does not move
clear the area
this is an order
what is wrong with you
we hear laughter from people in the crowd
as jacob looks out into some of their eyes he sees demons looking back
one of them throws another match
crazed jacob runs toward them
people jump back
suddenly jacob freezes
standing on the sidelines he sees one of the army officials who trapped him in the car
he is reaching for a gun
jacob stunned yells at the top of hhis lungs
with a defiant roar he hurls the torch straight up into the air
we see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher
all eyes stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder
then reaching its apex just below the camera it begins its descent
the eyes of the crowd turn to fear
hell burn us all
screams fill the air as people scramble to escape the potential conflagration
only jacob remains motionless standing silently almost heroically in the middle of it all
suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions
reporters and cameramen run for their lives
the army officials run too
the flames travel toward the army headquarters and rush along the curb
water hoses are trying to douse them as they spread
jacob surprisingly untouched by the fire walks slowly through the frightened crowds as if in a daze
viewed through the flames the scene momentarily resembles a vision of hell
jacob stark naked and covered with goose bumps runs his hands under a shower spray
the water is freezing and taking forever to warm up
anxious he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes grabs a suitcase from the bedroom closet and stuffs it with clothes
then he hurries back to the shower tests it and jumps in
lather covers jacobs hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes
his entire body is covered in suds
he is washing as quickly as he can
suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the bathroom
who is it
jacob struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes
they are burning
there is a shadow behind the curtain
continuing goddamn it
jacob rubs his eyes fighting to see
suddenly the shower curtain is thrown back
jacob backs against the wall
a hand reaches in and pulls his nipple pinching hard
its just me
who else were you expecting
where were you jake
whereve you been
why havent you called
stay away from me jez
i want to know
you tell me
you wanna know
turn on the t
watch the fucking news
he pushes her away and jumps out of the shower
cut to jacob dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his suitcase
jezzie in a robe is watching him
why are you doing this to me
you cant just go away like that
i can do anything i want
she stares at him with confusion
the phone rings
it might be for me
im not here
you havent seen me
picking up the receiver hello
hes not here
i havent seen him all night
i dont know when
tell him what
jacob looks up vietnam
jacob lunges for the phone
this is jacob singer
he listens with growing fascination god almighty
where would you like to meet
he listens how will i know you
jacob seems uncomfortable okay
ill be there
he hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment
who was that
part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon
he said he knows me and that ill know him when i see him
i have no idea
he thinks i was right
there were experiments
i knew it
i knew it
how do you know hes telling the truth
jacob stares at jezzie for several moments but does not respond
the news is coming on
jacobs image can be seen on the screen
we hear the newscaster speaking
leading the news tonight a bizarre demonstration on the steps of the u
army recruiting headquarters in downtown manhattan
jacob singer an alleged vietnam vet
challenged the united states army to admit conducting secret experi ments involving hundreds of american soldiers during the vietnam war
jezzie stares at the t
jacob takes his suitcase and hurries to the front door
he opens it a crack and peers into the hallway
jezzie runs after him
almost threatening dont leave me jake
jacob gazes at jezzie for a moment and then hurries down the hall
he stops at the stairwell and looks back
jezzie is still standing there
she is very angry
jacob just stares at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell
jacob is standing near the westside highway
groups of men in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at jacob with curiosity
one man in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him
im michael newman
friends call me mike
jacob is startled when he sees him
he is the same young man who has appeared throughout the film assisting jacob in moments of crisis
continuing surprised huh
i told you youd know me
ive been tracking you for a long time
i just wish id spoken to you before tonight
i dont get it
who are you
why have you been following me
you were one of the survivors
a police car passes them on the street
michael grabs jacobs shoulder and turns him away nervously
continuing come on were not safe around here
jacob and michael are sitting on a deserted west side pier that juts into the hudson river
jacob is wide eyed as he listens to michaels story
so first im arrested right
best lsd i ever made right down the drain
i figure this is it twenty years in the joint if im lucky
long time ago
nodding his head next thing i know im on rikers island
ever been there
jacob shakes his head suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows you know
four army colonels medals up their asses are standing on the other side
they tell me if ill come to vietnam for two years no action mind you just work in a lab theyll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean
well id only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldnt be any worse
shows how much you knew
they had me by the balls
next thing i know im in saigon
in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs
not the street stuff mind you
they had us isolating special properties
the dark side you know
they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies
we were losing the war
they were worried
they figured you guys were too soft
they wanted something to stir you up tap into your anger you know
and we did it
the most powerful thing i ever saw
even a bad trip and i had my share never compared to the fury of the ladder
thats what they called it
a fast trip right down the ladder
he makes a downward dive with his hand right to the primal fear the base anger
im tellin you it was powerful stuff
but i dont need to tell you
jacob can barely catch his breath the information he is receiving is so powerful to his mind
continuing we did experiments on jungle monkeys
they bashed each others heads in gouged out their eyes chewed off their tails
the brass loved it
then they made us try it on charlie
he pauses they took these pows just kids really and put em in a courtyard
we fed em huge doses of the stuff
he stops for a moment a tear rolls down his cheek they were worse than the monkeys
i never knew men could do such things
the whole thing still blows me away
michael stands up and begins walking in circles around the pier
jacob astounded gets up and walks beside him
continuing anyway this big offensive was coming up
everyone knew it time magazine huntley brinkley
and the brass was scared cause they knew we couldnt win
morale was down
it was gettin ugly in the states
hell you remember
like it was yesterday
a couple days later they decided to use the ladder on one test battalion
just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply to prove its effectiveness in the field
they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive
and you did too
but not the way they tnought
jacob is beginning to shake
michael pulls a container of pills out of his jacket pocket
continuing hey want something to calm you down
made em myself
jacob shakes his head no
none of us can remember that night
i get flashes of it but they dont make sense
we saw shrinks for years
but nothing they did could ever touch it
was there ever an offensive
a couple of days later
it was fierce
you guys never saw it
but there was an attack
i can still see them coming
there was a fight wasnt there
but not with the cong
he hesitates obviously uncomfortable
his eyes grow puffy
he looks at the river for a moment and then turns to jacob
you killed each other
jacobs mouth drops open
the words hit him like a truck
gunfire explodes in the darkening sky
we are in vietnam
jacob is at the bottom of a trench fighting with frank
chaos surrounds them
men are screaming
the enemy is storming at them from the rear
rod raises his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his attacker
it is only after a series of jabs that he sees its another american hes killed
rods eyes go blank with confusion and terror
oh my god
jacob looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of american soldiers bearing down on them
frank jumps up knocking jacob to the ground and slamming his rifle into jacobs back
as he spins around jacob sees another soldier charging at him
his bayonet is aimed at jacobs stomach
for the first time jacob remembers the face of his attacker
he is a young man about years old clean cut wearing glasses
the two men stare at each other in terrible confusion
it seems like a moment out of time
and then the soldier lurches forward and rams his bayonet deep into jacobs abdomen
cut to michael back on the pier
jacob is ashen faced
it was brother against brother
you tore each other to pieces
i knew it would happen
i warned them
i warned them
but i was just a hippie chemist right
and i helped em make the stuff
i talked to the guys who bagged the bodies
theyre in worse shape than you believe me
they saw what was left
its a blessing you dont remember
of course the brass covered the whole thing up right away
blamed it all on a surprise attack
he pauses i needed to find you
the ladder was my baby
tears start flowing down michaels face
he wipes them with his sleeve
it takes him a moment to regain his composure
jacob is shivering
michael takes off his jacket drapes it over jacob and leads him to the wooden planks overhanging the water
they sit and gaze at the cut to a wide shot of michael and jacob in pre dawn light
i always suspected the effects might come back
thats why i had to follow you
i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records
if you knew why didnt you say anything
the truth can kill my friend
five hundred men died out there
this isnt a story theyd ever want out
when pauls car blew up i realized the scope of the thing
i knew they meant business
so why tell me now
because i can get rid of the demons
i can block the ladder
i have an antidote
we can kill them off chemically speaking
theyll all disappear
its chemistry my friend
i created it
come with me
i can help
jacob and michael enter a sleazy hotel near the docks obviously frequented by a gay clientele
jacob is uncomfortable as they check in
michael however seems to know the ropes
they go to a small room
you come here often
when its convenient
how do i know this isnt just some kind of you know seduction or something
hey im not the problem
youve got bigger problems than me
michael reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial
continuing i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it
id hoped id never have to
just open your mouth and stick out your tongue
what is it
itll free your head
fearful i dont know
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil but no one ever said i wouldnt be shittin in my pants every
step of the way huh
jacob smiles his mouth open stick out your tongue
jacob obeys as an eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the back of his tongue thata boy
now why dont you just lie down and relax
its strong stuff
jacob stretches out on the bed
he stares up at the ceiling and examines its pock marked lunar look
long cracks and shallow craters erode the surface
it is an alien terrain
i think im falling asleep
the words send a jolt through jacobs body
he tries to get up but cant
i cant move
the ceiling begins to rumble
cracks split wide open
huge crevasses tear through the plaster
jacobs world is crumbling
he stares in horror as demonic forms attempt to surge through the rupture above him
piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness
hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through
continuing instantly michael appears standing over him
he is holding the vial with the antidote
he draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over jacobs mouth
jacob fights him but michael forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat
he tries to spit it out but cant
suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide like continental plates
the collisons wreak havoc on the demons chopping and dismembering them
body parts fall from the ceiling like a devils rain
horrible screams echo from the other side
continuing dont fight it
its your own mind
its your own fears
flashes of light and dark storm over jacobs head thundering like a war in the heavens
it is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe
it builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes
jacobs eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him
all space is becoming a dark liquid void
gradually the liquid grows bluer clearer
there is an undulating sense to the imagery a feeling of womb like comfort
strange lights appear and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean
jacob is rushing upward toward the surface
with the delirious sound of water giving way to air jacob breaks through
to his amazement he finds himself floating out stretched on shimmering sunlit water
above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be of the earth
pillars of golden light reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light
it is a vision of heaven a vast almost mythic paradise
jacob is awed
a sudden movement catches his attention
he looks over and sees michael standing before him
only michael looks different
his face seems to radiate an inner light a transcendental beauty
jacob is nearly blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him
so how you doin
the casualness of the words catches jacob by surprise
he sits up
to his shock and amazement he finds that he is back in the hotel room
michael is standing at the foot of the bed
jacob is totally disoriented
his eyes move slowly around the room taking everything in
he doesnt speak
continuing it was better than you expected huh
jacob just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh
it is a huge laugh full of energy and life
continuing and no more demons
i told you theyd be gone
i dont believe this
its a miracle michael
better living through chemistry thats my motto
jacob and michael are walking through the streets of greenwich village
it is early morning and the sidewalks are bustling with people
jacob stares into their faces and beams when they smile back
michael enjoys jacobs happiness
jacob and michael walk through washington square park
it was paradise michael
you showed it to me
you were there
well thats good to know
mike it was real
it was glorious
im not surprised
i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven
im just glad you came back
i would have stayed there if i could
youve got nothing but troubles waitin for you here
he points to two policemen on the far side of the square
taking jacobs arm come on
the two men head up to gramercy park and stop in front of the gramercy park hotel
reaching into his wallet michael pulls out a huge stack of credit cards and hands one to jacob
ive got every credit card ever printed
stay here till you can arrange to get away
its on me
you want the plaza
dont be foolish
take this too
he pulls out a business card this is my place on prince street
its got my phone everything
call if you need me
but you wont
everythings gonna work out
you just get outta town as fast as you can
the new york police can be effective when they want to be
i dont know what to say
save the words
just send back my credit card
michael laughs hugs jacob and walks away
jacob is in a lovely motel room overlooking gramercy square
he is sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door
he jumps up and opens it
jezzie is standing there
she looks at jacob quizzically
he smiles and takes her in his arms swinging her into the room
what are you doing here
are you all right
how do you expect to pay for this
jacob smiles everyones looking for you jake
i dodged people all over the place reporters police
i dont know what youre gonna do
im gonna make love to you
thats what im gonna do
are you out of your mind
i love you jez
god i cant keep up with all your changes
whats gotten into you
cut to jacob and jezzie lying in bed gently caressing one another
for all his ardor jacob is exhausted from the events of the preceding day
while stroking jezzies hair he begins to fall asleep
jezzie crawls on top of him and shoves her hand down his pants
dissolve to jacob and jezzie making love
dissolve to jacob and jezzie lying in front of the t
watching a romantic movie
jezzie snuggles up to jacob
its amazing you know that a drug could change things like that destroy a life and then give it back
its hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next
i tell you it was so wonderful
i felt like a little boy
i saw paradise jezzie
its so hard to believe
there is a knock at the door
jacob throws on a bathrobe
jezzie jumps under the sheets
its your dinner sir
jezzies eyes brighten
jacob opens the door
a bellboy wheels in a table set for dinner
he sets it in a corner of the room
jezzie jumps out of bed runs to the table sniffs at the food and squeals excitedly
this is one of my dreams jake
ever since i was a little girl
i never thought it would happen
stick with me kid
dissolve to jacob and jezzie sitting next to a large window overlooking gramercy park
they are sipping champagne
i want to go with you jake
wherever you go
its not practical jez
itll be hard enough alone
i can waitress
things are too hot
ill send for you
im a marked man jez
im the only one left
i dont want to expose you to that
its not right for you or me
youre gettin me angry
i love you when youre angry
her eyes twinkle suggestively try leavin without me
unexpectedly she grabs jacob and pushes him onto the bed
in seconds they are all over each other their clothes flying in all directions
they seem as happy as could be
jacob enters grand central station
he checks out all the people around him
not a demon in sight
hurrying to the ticket window he gets in line
the ticket seller looks up
jacob pulls out michaels credit card
the seller rings it up
while he is waiting jacob notices a policeman looking at him
the stare unsettles him
the seller hands jacob his ticket
he takes it and hurries into the crowd
looking back he notices the policeman is following him
jacob enters the mens room
he hurries into one of the stalsls drops his pants and sits
he eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall
it is moving
suddenly the tissue falls to the floor
jacob glances at the hole curiously and leans forward to examine it
he is shocked to see an eye staring back at him
he covers it with his hand
a pencil jabs his palm
he yells fucking pervert
two lips form around the hole
a tongue wags obscenely
the mouth is gone
jacob hears the stall door fly open and feet running from the room
he jumps up and grabs his pants
he dashes out of the mens room
he hears footsteps and chases after them
jacob bursts into the main terminal
he sees someone rushing toward the main doors and speeds after him
homeless people huddling along the corridors watch as they run past
escaping to the street the man disappears in the holiday throngs
jacob crazed stands gasping for breath
his fists dig into his coat pocket
suddenly he feels something and seems surprised when michaels card emerges in his hands
jacob runs up the stairs in a soho loft building
it is a dingy industrial staircase poorly lit
he reaches a door with michaels name painted on it in large black letters
he knocks loudly
there is no answer
he pounds on it
another door opens on the floor above
a head sticks out
you lookin for mike
panting hard where is he
hasnt picked his mail up in days
its not like him
jacob has a frenzied look in his eyes
he searches around the staircase and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner
he grabs a two by four and lunges at the door
what the hell are you doing
jacob doesnt answer
he smashes wildly at the door until the lock flies open
jacob charges into the dark space groping for a light
he finds it
the loft is a disaster area
nothing is standing
jacob runs from room to room
in the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab
glass vials and bottles are shattered on the floor
jacob rifles through the cabinets
a few bottles are intact but their labels mean nothing to him
he reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from the bottom
he opens it
michaels severed head stares him in the face
it is smiling
a scream rings out as the man from upstairs sees what jacob has seen
jacob jumps back trips and falls over michaels headless body
it is lying sprawled across the floor
oh my god
jacob stumbles to pull himself up
he is in a state of unrelieved panic
he runs past the man and spills out the doorr
he takes two and three stairs at a time nearly flying to the street
jacob rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast as his legs will move
with unexpected violence he charges into the side of a building
over and over he hurls himself against it
he grabs for the bricks
his fingers insert themselves into the crevices
it is as though he is trying to merge with the wall
suddenly jacob turns and dashes into the street
a taxi is speeding toward him its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark night
jacob steps into its path
it is hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to be hit
the taxi screeches to a halt
jacob stares at it a moment and then steps to get in
the driver tries to pull off but jacob yanks at the door and drags himself inside
rain is beginning to fall
it streaks the windows
barely audible im going to brooklyn
not with me youre not
i get lost in brooklyn
i know the way
jacob reaches into his pants pocket pulls out a twenty dollar bill and hands it to the driver
he takes it
continuing look this is all the money ive got in the world
take me home and its yours
wheres your home
cut to the taxi heading down west broadway approaching the brooklyn bridge crossing the east river and driving through dark brooklyn jacobs face passes in and out of dense shadows
every time he is bathed in light his image seems to alter
something in him is falling away
jacob gets out of the taxi and approaches the lobby of sarahs apartment building
jacob is greeted by the doorman
its been a long time
greeting him warmly hello sam
noticing jacobs battered condition are you all right
do you want some help
i can call upstairs
jacob stops in front of the apartment door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet
it comes back with a key
he inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door
he calls out
some lights are on
the apartment looks comfortable and cozy
is anybody home
there is still no answer
jacob is surprised
he peers into the dark living room and then walks to the kitchen
no one is around
a photo of jacob sarah and their boys is sitting on the counter
he picks it up and carries it with him through the apartment
he walks into his old bedroom and then into the boys room
the beds are still unmade
there is no one home
he sees his image in the bathroom mirror and turns away in disgust
he walks back to the living room
he is about to switch the lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall
he calls out
sarah is that you
i hope you dont mind
i needed to come home
jacob is startled to see jezzie enter the room
she does not seem he usual self
she appears larger more imposing
i knew youd come here in the end
jacob is nervous
where are the boys
sit down jake
where are they
whats going on
wheres my family
its over jake
its all over
where have they gone
stop playing with yourself
jezzie stares at jacob with a frightening powerful glare
the edge of her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him
it is an innocent sound at first but after a moment it transforms into something else an obsessive flapping noise the sound of a wing
jacobs body feels the first waves of an inner tremor
his legs are shaking
whats going on
your capacity for self delusion is remarkable dr
jezzie begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him
something about her walk is very unnatural
jacob eyes her fearfully
in the darkness jezzies movements become increasingly strange and elusive
we see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it only to reappear seconds later in a doorway on the other side of the room
jacob spins around confused
suddenly jezzie is inches from his face although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there
her movements are totally impossible defying all logic all physical laws
continuing whats wrong jake
she mocks him forget to take your antidote
who are you
what are you doing to me
you have quite a mind jake
i loved your friends
that chemist the ladder
what an imagination you have
continuing and your vision of paradise
youre a real dreamer you know that
only its time to wake up
jezzie has disappeared in the darkness of the room
only the sounds of flapping wings remain
they grow louder and more menacing whooshing past him with no visible source
continuing your mind is crumbling jake
no more army
no more conspiracies
youre dying dr
jacob frightened turns toward the door as if to hurry out
continuing wheres to run jacob
wheres to go
jacob pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him
how many times have you asked me that
how many times
with consummate power jezzie appears from the shadows
her coat collar obscures her and it seems for a moment that she has no face
then to jacobs horror she turns around
he is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so often before
glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror dark and undefinable
its face is a black and impenetrable void in constant vibration
its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry the essence of fear and suffering
jacob pulls away from it overhwelmed by confusion
he is rooted in fear
a sudden wind howls through the room great gales blowing jacobs hair straight up
it is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall
he can barely stand
he struggles to pull himself away
the flapping sound returns charging at him from all directions
it is as if the darkness itself is swooping down trying to envelop him
whispering to himself this isnt happening
new terrible sounds arise chain saws slashing through the air knives and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger
guns fire and explode past his head
it is as though all the sounds of destruction are closing in on him
jacob yells but his own voice is lost in the melee
terrified he looks heavenward as if crying for help
suddenly from the noise a calm voice rises speaking as if from a distance
it is louis
jacob is shocked to hear him
he stands motionless
if youre frightened of dying youll see devils tearing you apart
if youve made your peace then theyre angels freeing you from the world
the voice fades
jacob just stands there not sure what to do
and then the sounds return
only now they are more terrifying than ever
hideously loud they become a cacophony of sounds voices of parents friends lovers the sounds of battle fighting and dying
jacob looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room
all the sounds seem to emenate from it
the more jacob stares at it the louder they become
after a moment jacob takes a huge breath
we sense a great resolve forming inside him
then slowly courageously he begins moving toward it
new and more terrifying noises assault jacob attempting to drive him back but he will not be stopped
he continues walking toward the creature
in the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor
it rolls back and forth like a living thing with a maddening hypnotic regularity
doors slam open and closed unlatching snapping shutting with deafening force
the room itself seems like an organic presence
it is alive angry and threatening
the creature sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of madness itself
it writhes contorts and vibrates with unstoppable fury
jacob terrified but unrelenting continues to approach it
as the camera draws closer to the creatures head the density of its featureless form overwhelms the screen
it is like staring into emptiness itself the ultimate darkness
with superhuman effort jacob grabs hold of the creature
it is like grabbing hold of a live wire
his body begins shaking uncontrollably like a man being electrocuted
he is flying in all directions but does not let go
his fingers claw at the creatures head
jacob struggles defiantly with the monster
suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it
jacob does not respond
it cries out again
deep inside the darkness jacob begins to make out the presence of a form something writhing and tortured lurking before us
it looks briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human face
it is covered by a dark suffocating film like a mask
jacob digs into it with all his might and pulls it off
dead silence as jacob sees his own face staring back at him from beneath the mask
it is jacob singer as we first saw him on the battlefield in vietnam
only now his image is pale and lifeless
it takes jacob a moment to realize that he is dead
the recognition is one of terrible confusion and pain
jacob stares at himself for a long time as a huge cry wells up inside him
it bursts forth with devastating sadness
as that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of catacylsmic power
hundreds of images from jacobs life flash before us his birth his childhood his adulthood
the demons the room jezzie louis michael sarah all seem to assail us in a rush of blinding intensity
we are flying over a landscape of memories zooming across a constantly changing field of images
some of the images move some of the people in them speak
they are not particularly significant memories in some ways they are quite banal but something about them is infused with life and joy
even the painful moments resonate with vital force
some of the moments we recognize from the time weve spent with jacob
some we have not seen before
there is no order to them no logic to why they have been recalled
a newborn baby takes its first breath and screams
sarah pulls clothes off a clothes line on a rainy day
jacobs father stands in the florida surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs
paul frank and jacob play cards on the edge of a rice paddy
gabe rides his bike into the path of an oncoming car
a child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal listening to it talk
a young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her blouse to show her new breasts
jacob and sarah slice a wedding cake that topples to the floor
jezzie looks at jacob and asks love me a little
and then it is over
total silence overwhelms the screen a wonderful soothing calm
jacobs eyes open and he is shocked to find himself sitting on the floor in sarahs apartment
he is all alone
the first rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window
something about the apartment seems transfigured magical
jacob sits motionless stunned to be back there
the faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway
it is warm and familiar the tinkling of a music box
jacob listens to it for a few moments and then something registers inside him
curious he gets up and approaches the corridor
there is no response
suddenly the music stops
jacob freezes for a moment
he sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end
continuing who is it
tentatively jacob moves forward
as he draws closer he begins to see the outline of a child
then all of a sudden he realizes who it is
his eyes well up as he stands there the full impact of the moment registering inside him
its his son gabe
he is carrying the same musical lunch box we have seen before
the young boy smiles warmly at his father
it is the smile of an angel
jacob swallows hard
jacob runs to his son
unable to hold back the tears he embraces him in a rush of love and emotion
i dont believe
they hug one another over and over
jacob overcome sits down on the stiars
after a moment gabe puts his arm around his fathers shoulder in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion
we sense for an instant that their roles have reversed
gabe reaches for jacobs hand and gently encourages him to stand up
with a sweet tug gabe leads his father up the steps
sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars hitting the first landing
gabe is bathed in its warm glow
as jacob reaches the landing he too is surrounded by the comforting light
gabe hurries up the last set of stairs
jacob turns to follow but is stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above
squinting he cannot see his son
then suddenly gabe steps back out of the light and takes his fathers hand once more
his eyes sparkle with excitement
come on dad
you know what weve got
a sandbox just like the willistons only its bigger and the sands all white
you wont believe it
jacob smiles at his son
gabe smiles at him
it is a moment of total euphoria
the camera holds as they continue up the stairs
continuing and my parakeet
remember the one grandma let out of the cage
and hes talking now
he knows my name
gabes voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the intenstity of the light
the camera holds on the image
for a brief but stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase shimmering before us
it rises up into infinite dimensions
then the brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen
suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source
it holds for a second and then flashes off
an overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view
a doctor leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask
his expression is somber
he shakes his head
his words are simple and final
cut to jacob singer lying on an operating table in a large army field tent in vietnam
the doctor steps away
a nurse rudely pulls a green sheet over his head
the doctor turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat
an orderly wheels jacobs body past rows of other doctors and nurses fighting to save lives
a young vietnamese boy pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent
it is a bright fresh morning
the sun is rising
by bruce joel rubin cut to a huge ampitheatre style lecture hall at city college
it is almost empty
no more than forty students are scattered near the front of nearly three hundred seats
all are listening to professor emanuel stern who is nearing the end of his lecture
thus at the core of todays discu sion we find four fundamental doc trines
first that the world of matter and individual consciousness are both manifestations of one divine reality
one of the students seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding his head
even you mr
palmer are part of it as amazing as that may seem
palmer sits up quickly in his seat as other students smile
second human beings are capable not only of kowledge about this divine re ality by inference but can realize its existence by direct intuition superior even to reason
a door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall
jacob enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range of the professor
third man possesses a double nature an ego and an eternal self what we call spirit or soul
jacob takes a seat at one of the desks
there is a pencil lying on it which he fingers distractedly
fourth and most important mans life on earth has only one end and purpose to learn to let go of the separate ego and to identify with the divine spark
palmer is nodding off again
almost impossible to believe isnt it mr
palmer that somewhere in that unconscious head of yours lies the source of all consciousness
nodding his head well now having reached this apotheosis there seems little if anything left to say
so rather than try you are dismissed
the students seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden dismissal
they quickly gather their books and begin the long climb to the exits
only jacob remains seated
professor stern looks up and stares at kacob for several seconds before recognizing him
my oh my
isnt this a happy surprise
jacob comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old looking at jacobs uni form are you in the service
the postal service
im a mailman
surprised but non judgemental ah
neither snow nor sleet nor dark of night
i always admired that
smiling its good to see you
jacob and professor stern walk down the city streets that constitute the campus of city college
and how is your wife
shrugging his shoul ders i havent seen her in months
im with another woman now
were both with the post office midtown th street branch
i dont suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office
oh youd be surprised
they just dont have their doctorates thats all
he smiles last i heard you were offered a posi tion in the west somewhere
tuscon was it
oh that goes way back
they had a hiring freeze one of those last min ute things
bad timing for me though
middle of the war
stern nods his head
they walk a moment in silence ill tell you prof after viet nam i didnt want to think anymore
i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos
looking at jacob with affection jacob if it was any other brain but yours i might agree
he pauses tell me does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker what a sub lime intellect shes living with
smiling coyly i doubt its my mind that interests her
i tell you prof shes a fiery lady
with a fatherly demeanor well try not to get burned
you have a great mind jacob
dont let anyone tempt you away from it
jacob and professor stern are sitting at a quiet table in a nearly empty coffee shop
they are both fixing cups of tea not speaking
suddenly jacob looks at stern
ive got a problem prof
more augus tine than kierkegaard if you know what i mean
stern looks at him questioningly i need to know about
surprised demons jacob
are you writing
he pauses a moment i see them
he smiles uncomforta bly what do you mean
he looks at jacob
the intensity of his gaze is unsettling and jacob reaches for his tea
the cup rattles
i know very little about demons ja cob fleshy ones anyway
i know them as literary figures biblical ones dante milton
but jacob he pauses this is the th century
we dont see demons now
i see them prof
theyre invading my life
a look of concern fills sterns eyes
continuing christ i know how it sounds
have you considered a doctor
a psy chiatrist
suddenly uneasy i dont want them
im not looking for analysis or drugs
its too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis
he pauses uncomforta bly its more than that
i can feel it
i need you prof
youre the only one i can talk to
i dont know what to say
i need your insight your intuition
stern sips his tea slowly
he is thinking
i dont know what to tell you
it sounds like a spiritual mat ter to me
the problem jacob is that you have no context for it
youre a renegade existentialist suf fering demons a hundred years after freud
how the hell am i supposed to make it fit
im afraid prof
nothing makes sense
he pauses please help me
trying to be delicate jacob i dont believe in demons not in the empirical sense
i dont be lieve in devils fighting for our souls
i dont believe in enternal damnation
i dont believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us
we dont need them
we do a good enough job on ourselves
disturbed but i see them
i dont pretend to know whats going on inside your head
for all i know its pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart
but if youre not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me i admire you for that then youll have to do bat tle on your own
what can i say
its a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls
but to be pursued by
demons no less
there are no guides jacob
he muses you wanna know what id do if i sud denly started seeing demons
id hail the first taxi that came along shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment
im no saint
hell you think i am
ivenever understood you you know that
you were by far the best pupil ive ever had bar none
intellectu ally you were the most original the most imaginative
who knows maybe youve been elected to see demons
maybe youre in touch with
nothing would surprise me about you jacob
jacob gazes at his old friend and mentor frustration blazing in his eyes
they are both surprised to see tears form and run down his cheek
jacob reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly
stern uncomfortable in the face of emotion turns away
suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him
the dancers undergo a shocking transformation a full three dimensional alteration of their physical forms
clothes fuse to their bodies like new skin
horns and tails emerge and grow like exotic genitalia exciting a frenzy among the dancers
new appendages appear unfolding from their flesh
dorsal fins protrude from their backs
armored scales run in scallops down their legs
tails entwine sensuously
long tongues lick at the undersides of reptilian bellies
the metamorphosis holds a biological fascination
bones and flesh mold into new forms of life creatures of another world
cut to jacobs face as it registers terror and disbelief
he stares at the dancers
they are perverse corrupt aspects of their normal selves
he is mesmerized by jezzie
her flesh has grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake
her tongue long and curled darts in and out of her mouth repeatedly
her eyes are thin and domineering
they lock jacob in their gaze
he wants to stop to run but jezzie wont release him
jacob grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from them but it wont go away
the music throbs
his actions become spastic almost delirious
his hysteria attracts the attention of the other dancers
a circle forms around jacob and jezzie as their frenzy transcends the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic display
jacob is out of control
his fury becomes a kind of exorcism a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind
cut to jacob as his eyes pass beyond pain
the dark walls of the apartment fade away
strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large cloud
the faces are looking down and voices are speaking
hes burning up
hell never make it
thats some gash
his guts keep spilling out
push em back
crying weakly help me
his eyes focus on the moon
rings of light emanate from it filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance
the rings draw us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed
the rush causes them to flash stroboscopically and produce a dazzling almost sensual surge of color
the display is spectacular and compelling
a voice can be heard in the distance
i think were losing him
suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image a kind of celestial staircase rising up into infinite dimensions
as we speed toward it it grows increasingly majestic
the image is so awesome and other worldly that it is difficult to grasp what is being seen
music can be heard in the distance
it too is celestial in its beauty
then unexpectedly it grows hard and insistent like a heartbeat
heavy breathing accompanies the sound
the image of the staircase shatters and disappears replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light
the music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo
cut to applause from a real television game show as jacob switches channels on the living room t
he stops on an interview program turns up the sound and runs to the bathroom
the camera stays on the television
jacob can be heard urinating in the distance
mac hayes a young virile and smug reporter is speaking
the reverend norman murphy leader of one of the largest groups supporting the armageddon committee told our cameras that we are no longer dealing in decades but years
the reverend fills the t
the battleground is being readied
our planet is the battlefield
our souls are the prize
all the signs point to the inevitable confrontation between the forces of good and evil
people must choose sides
there is no draft evasions in this war
all are called
all must take up weapons
are you prepared
thats the question we ask
the toilet flushes and jacob walks back into the living room and turns down the sound
do you find people scoffing at you reverend
after all there have been doomsayers for thousands of years and were still here
people are less apt to laugh these days
the prophecies are too close for comfort
i mean all you have to do is watch the news
there are some who claim that your pessimism is defeatist and what the world needs now is hope a positive thrust
i think the time for hope has passed
the seeds have been planted
we shall reap what weve sown
he pauses pessimists no
i think we are percieved as the only realists around
other movement leaders agree
in an interview
suddenly the telephone rings
it startles jacob
it rings again
he reaches down turns off the t
and picks up the phone
his eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he talks
the bedroom is dark
jacob and jezzie are making love
a half smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed
jezzie is poised on top of jacob and his eyes are focused on her face
a hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies
its flickering light plays games with jacobs eyes and for a moment jezzie seems to disappear
jacob reaches out for her breasts and his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her
with sudden hallucinogenic impact jacob feels himself drawn into a starry universe opening from inside her
the camera plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly
pulsations of its light whiten the screen
out of the whiteness appears a momentary flash of the celestial staircase accompanied by sounds of sexual climax
the staircase sparkles for an instant and then its gone
the sparkle becomes a glimmer in jezzies eye as her face fills the screen
she looks especially lovely and radiant
her image moves with the lamplight
jacobs face is ecstatic
he can barely talk and simply basks in jezzies glow
slowly she leans forward and whispers in his ear
so tell me
am i still an angel
smiling broadly with wings
he strokes her hair you transport me you know that
you carry me away
jacob is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room
he is reading
the room is dark lit only by a reading light
the walls are mostly in shadow
the light however falls on one section of the wall a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling
jacobs eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood grain on the wall
all of a sudden he notices something strange an image in the grain
he stares at it
the more he stares the more precise its definition
the image of a demon appears in the wall
jacob sits up quickly and stares at the walll
it is impossible to get the demons image out of the grain
it seems etched even imbedded in the paneling
jacob looks away and returns to his book
he is reading about archetypes and the primordial mind
but the book does not hold his attention
he is obsessed with the wall
its molecules seem suddenly active the wood grain suddenly animate
layers begin to appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly define a rocky barren landscape
the demon is growing solid
cries and screams rise up in the distance
flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending rapidly into the wall
the image of hell erupts before him
jacob stands up
he can see bodies suffering beyond the wall masses of people wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery world
the demons arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall and reaches into the room
he is huge covered in flames and skulls a living horror
he grabs hold of jacob and pulls him toward the wall
jacob tries to back away but he cannot
his face is white with fear
the demon draws jacob toward the inferno
yelling at the top of his lungs suddenly jezzie appears the light from the bedroom flooding the paneled wall
the demon vanishes instantly
jake are you all
she stops dead in her tracks
cut to jacob pressed up against the wall defying gravity and logic as though about to merge with the solid surface
his body holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor
jezzie goes to him
he doesnt answer
he looks at jezzie with a blank stare
his body begins shaking
jacob is lying on the bed curled up in a fetal pose
jezzie is stroking his hair and trying to calm him
its going to be all right jake
its going to be all right
dont be afraid
ive got you now
hold me jezzie
jezzie wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with her own
the image seems tender and comforting until we notice jezzies tongue darting nervously in and out
it looks strangely like a snakes
the resident injects the serum into jacobs veins while two orderlies hold him still
jacob barely struggles
his eyes fixate on the emergency room wall
it is white and sterile
within moments it begins to emit a reddish glow
jacob watches with astonishment as the walls two dimensional surface separates into three dimensional planes
the solid surface gives way to a dark chamber that was not there before
out of the transmuted space creatures begin to form
bosch like demons with horns and tails undeniably of another world
slowly several of them emerge from the wall and approach jacob
they look like parodies of doctors and nurses wearing traditional hospital gowns
without a word they wheel him through the space where the wall had been
jacob tries to scream but no sound comes out
the dark chamber is filled with mournful creatures being led by demons through a series of corridors
no one fights or struggles
jacobs stretcher is moved through the darkness
he tries to sit up but is forced back down
he is obviously drugged
jacob is wheeled into a tiny chamber
a number of demons are waiting for him
chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling
they are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to jacobs arms and legs
the devices are manipulated smoothly and jacob is lifted off the stretcher
the chains retract stretching him spread eagle in the air
he screams loudly
the demons laugh
there is the sound of a huge door closing
jacob is left in darkness
the darkness is hallucinogenic
fires appear beyond the boundaries of the wall images of dantes inferno souls of the dead in endless torment
jacob is but one of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment
his own screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying
suddenly out of the meancing shadows a contingent of demons emerges
they are carrying sharp surgical instruments
they surround jacob their eyes glistening as bright as their blades
jacob is panting and sweating with fear
for an instant one of the demons looks like jezzie
jacob calls out to her
the demons laugh as she changes form
they take great pleasure in his suffering
their voices are strange and not human
each utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones sincere and compassionate taunting and mocking at the same time
the confusion of meanings is a torment of its own
jacob is lying on the floor of his bedroom doing exercises for his back
he has several days growth of beard and does not look well
his mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his back reminds him of what he is doing
jezzie can be heard vacuuming the carpet in the living room
suddenly the door swings open
the wail of the vacuum cleaner causes jacob to tense
his eyes drift down from the ceiling
jezzie vacuums around him and seems insensitive to his presence
jezzie shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits something
she looks and is shocked to discover a can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches
it takes her a second to understand the implications of what she has found
jacob is ready when she begins yelling
youre completely off your rocker you know that
youd think you fell on your head instead of your back
what are you planning to do burn down the apartment along with your demons
she begins to remove the gasoline can
yelling dont you touch it
he glares at her jezzie lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum
she moves it furiously across the carpet
suddenly jacob sees her tongue darting in and out unconsciously
she looks strange not human
he yells out
who are you
the sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice
he yells again
jezzie sees him and turns off the machine
his voice booms out
continuing who the hell are you
jezzie ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on
jacob rolls over and pulls out the plug
why wont you answer me
angry cause you know goddamn well who i am
i dont know you
youve lived with me for two years
that doesnt mean shit
where do you come from huh
and i dont mean indiana
what do you want me to say
my mothers tummy
you know goddamn well what i mean
youre out of your fucking mind
im not gonna stand around here gettin interrogated by you
well leave then
go to hell
furious you son of a bitch
who do you think you are
i dont deserve this
who takes care of you day and night
who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear
well ive had it
you flip out on your own you ungrateful bastard
im done holding your hand
i dont want anything to do with you you hear
she storms out of the room kicking the vacuum cleaner as she goes
jacob can see flashes of her through the open crack of the bedroom door
occasional curses and epithets hurl through the opening along with a flood of tears
jacob catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer
he can see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter as she stomps on it with her foot
there is a blur as she heads to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves
jacobs eyes drift up to the ceiling
they hardly blink
he stares at the plaster chipped and cracked above him
suddenly the cracks begin to move
jacob jumps up
a demon is materializing over his head
jacob yells and grabs hold of the extension pole for the vacuum cleaner
with a furious cry he begins jamming it at the ceiling
rather than blot out the evolving image his attack helps to define it
jacob slams harder
plaster and wood lath cover the floor
the demon is gone
panting hard jacob reaches for matches and the gasoline can
he stops and stares at them with great intensity
the ceiling begins to rumble
cracks split wide open
huge crevasses tear through the plaster
jacobs world is crumbling
he stares in horror as demonic forms attempt to surge through the rupture above him
piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness
hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through
continuing instantly michael appears standing over him
he is holding the vial with the antidote
he draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over jacobs mouth
jacob fights him but michael forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat
he tries to spit it out but cant
suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide with one another like continental plates
the collisions wreak havoc on the demons chopping and dismembering them
body parts fall from the ceiling like a devils rain
horrible screams echo from the other side
flashes of light and dark storm over jacobs head thundering like a war in the heavens
it is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe
it builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes
matter atomizes instantly
trillions of particles hurl chaotically in all directions
the walls shatter into a dazzling brightness
for a moment there is a sense of intense forward movement a rush toward oblivion
and then suddenly it stops
there is absolute quiet and stillness
jacobs eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him
all space has become a shining void
gradually faint pastel colors appear like colored molecules dancing and spinning redirecting space into new formations
they weave patterns of intricate complexity and stunning beauty
as the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction gives way to solid form
a garden scene emerges
it is a garden of light a vast almost mythic rousseau paradise
it radiates an intense shimmering light
jacobs eyes are cpativated by the vision before him
a sudden movement catches his attention
he looks up and notices michael still standing beside him
michael however is rapidly changing form
it is a full plastic three dimensional metamorphosis
his very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light
his face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty
jacob is nearly blinded by michaels presence and must shield his eyes to look at him
michael smiles an extraordinary and joyous smile that radiates such intense luminosity that jacob has to squint to see it
suddenly michael steps off the ground
he rises into the air and floats above jacob
jacob can barely breathe as he watches him
michael rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights
the lights shine on jacobs head
he effervesces and shimmers in their glow
one of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over jacob
so intense is the light that jacob grabs his eyes
as he opens them again he sees that the garden is fading back into pure light
michael too is fading
another burst of light and the garden is reabsorbed by the void
only the brightness remains
it is many seconds before we realize that the hotel room is coming together reconstructed by the light
in moments it is fully formed
sunlight is pouring through the window
michael is sleeping lightly in a chair
he hears jacob stare and sits up
jacob is sitting on the bed
he does not seem to know where he is
his eyes are filled with awe
they move slowly around the room taking everything in
he doesnt speak
michael gets up and sits beside him
he respects his silence
jacob enters the hotel room
jezzie is already there watching the evening news
she is still in her postal uniform lying on the bed
she taps the mattress inviting jacob to lie next to her
a woman is crying to a reporter on the t
its been four days
its not like him
hes never done any thing like this before
its like he just disappeared from the face of the earth
the bureau of missing persons is con founded by the continuing surge of reports
jacob snaps off the t
whatd you do that for
its an in teresting story
all these people are still disappearing
right off the street
staring at jacob hey whats wrong

i just dont want to lis ten
you look upset

he turns away
she stares at him for a mo ment concerned jake
is it the antidote

look at yourself
you look like youve seen a ghost
cant i just have a bad day
you can have anything you want
then dont bug me
im not bugging you

she taps the mattress again and jacob joins her
she unbuttons his shirt whered you go today
evasively mid town mostly
what was happenin there
looking away from her i picked up my ticket
he pauses im leaving in the morning jez
acting innocent where you going

i always liked the west west of il linois anyway
but you gotta give me time to pack
stop it jez
dont do that
i havent done a thing
dont play games with me
theres nothing more to say
there is a quiet rage building in jezzies eyes as she continues to stroke jacobs chest
he tries to relax and give himself over to the movement of her hand
silently she leans over and begins licking his stomach
jacobs eyes close
his stomach hardens
he reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head
slowly jezzie works her way back up to his chest
her tongue darts in and out suggestively
he eyes are burning with anger
her mouth poises itself over his nipple
she toys with it for a few seconds and then chomps down hard
the bite draws blood
his eyes shoot open
for the flash of an instant he sees a demon hovering over him a hideous horned creature licking his blood
jacob flies off the bed as the creature hurls to the floor
jacob is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it is jezzie lying at his feet
his head begins reeling
he backs away from the bed not taking his eyes off jezzie for a second
he backs to the closet and grabs his coat
what are you doing
look im sorry i didnt mean to bite
let me get you a towel
jacob grabs his wallet and his glasses
he backs toward the door
you cant leave
youre not seeing things clearly
the drugs wearing off
she stands up and begins to approach him
jacob lifts up a desk chair and holds it in front of him
blood is running down his chest
jake dont leave me
jacob throws the chair at the floor opens the door and hurries into the hallway
jezzie scurries around the chair and runs to the door
she yells after him but he is already gone
jacob stoops in front of the apartment door and reaches his hand underneath a section of the hallway carpet
it comes back with a key
he inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door
calling out hello
the lights are on and the apartment looks comfortable and cozy
is anyone home
dad dys here
there is still no answer
jacob is surprised
he walks into the living room and then the kitchen
no one is around
he walks into his old bedroom and then the boys room
he is surprised to hear footsteps coming down the hall
he turns around and calls out
sarah is that you
i hope you dont mind
i needed to come home
jacob is startled to see jezzie enter the room
she does not seem to be her usual self
she seems larger more imposing
i knew youd come here in the end
jacob is nervous
where are the boys
sit down jake
where are they
whats going on
wheres my family
its over jake
its all over
where have they gone
stop playing with yourself
jezzie stares at jacob with a frightening powerful glare
her lips snarl
her tongue begins darting in and out only now it is not a nervous habit but a conscious act
jacobs body feels the first waves of an inner tremor
his legs are shaking
whats going on
jezzie smiles at him
her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from her mouth beyond human extension
whispering to himself this isnt happening
your capacity for self delusion is remarkable dr
jezzies head begins to tighten and squeeze as though she is suffering from cramps
jacob watches in horror as her skull gives birth to pointed horns
whats wrong jake
she mocks him forget to take your antidote
screaming goddamn you
smiling and then laughing i loved your chemist jake
the height of fantasy
and your vision of paradise
she laughs with a hu miliating tone a most romantic creation
youre quite a dreamer jake
only its time to wake up
jacobs eyes are locked on jezzie
his mouth is wide open
his body is shaking badly
he tries to back away from her but his legs barely move
there is nowhere to run jacob
suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor
plaster from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the carpet
light bulbs and lamps explode
jacob runs to the door
he pulls it open and screams
he is on the edge of a fiery abyss
jezzie laughs with a new intensity of demonic force
jacob spins around
how many times have you asked me that
how many times
with consummate power you know who i am
suddenly jezzie reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all her might
it is an act of total unrelieved grotesqueness
with each yank the horror grows as jezzie literally pulls herself inside out before jacobs eyes
the emerging creature is jezzie transfigured a demonic presence beyond anything we have seen before
it is black and covered with a thick oozing slime
its head still recognizable as jezzie is rodent like with piercing green eyes and terrible horns protruding from its brow
its powerful arms have long spiked claws
its feet are cloven hooves
extending from its back is a long thick muscular tail that whips around the room with devastating force
it throws furniture crashing through the air
a sudden cracking sound emerges from the demons back
dark forms penetrate the air
jacob is breathless as huge wings unfold and spread out to the living room walls
the sound of their flapping is deafening
the walls shatter from their blows
as they crumble darkness appears on the other side
there are no other rooms
the void envelops them
the inferno emerges in all directions
the demon roars
with jezzies voice still love me jake
it laughs and reaches out to him cut to jacobs face
he has gone beyond fear
an intensity of rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before
his whole image seems transformed by it
he glows like a volcano before it erupts
suddenly he explodes
the full fury of the ladder detonates inside him
he yells at the demon with all his might
with a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the demon
jacob is battling for his very soul and tears at the demon with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise
its giant wings flap furiously lifting them both up off the floor
jacob keeps fighting
he claws bites and rips at the wings decimating their delicate fabric
the demon shocked and trying to gain control crashes up through the last fragments of the ceiling
jacob does not let go
they burst into the fiery darkness
the room crumbles beneath them and disappears into the void
the abyss opens beneath them
jacob continues his attack
his legs are locked around the demons waist
his hands dig into her eyes
the demon shrieks and surges downward with awesome velocity
the demon charges into a rocky slope smashing jacob into its cliffs
jacob claws at her wings shredding as much of them as he can reach
the demon takes a huge chunk out of jacobs arm
jacob screams grabs a rock and shatters the demons teeth
the demon falls to the ground
jacob holds on
all of a sudden the demon begins to shrink
jacob is shocked and struggles to contain it
as it dwindles in size it reorders its shape
within seconds a powerful insect is cupped in his hands
jacob tries to crush it but it stings with such force that jacobs entire body recoils
the stinging persists
jacob hurls himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the creature down
so massive is the insects attack
however that jacobs whole body heaves off the ground with each sting
then the attacks subside
jacob waits for the next blow
suddenly jacobs body shoots straight up
his hands fly apart as a new life form erupts between them
he holds on tightly as flesh and blood mold and expand between his fingers
the new body takes rapid shape
it is a child
jacob grasps it with all his might as it completes its identity
he is horrified when he sees it
it is his son
youre hurting me
what do you want from me
jacob does not let up
in an instant his son explodes into a gelatinous form constantly undulating and changing shape
within its translucent mass a new body is forming
jacob stares at it with growing terror
it is himself
a terrible perplexity fills jacobs eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image
he recoils as his own voice calls out to him
who the hell do you think youre fighting
the words shock him and for the first time he lets go
instantly the image disappears and the jelly like mass dissolves into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet
jacob looks down at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him
its surface reflects a smoky unearthly light
jacob gazes into the darkness
he is all alone
the quiet overwhelms him
the only sound is his own breath
he looks around in all directions but can see nothing
the camera holds on him as he stands waiting for the next assault but nothing comes
he is left only with his anticipation and with hinself
he stares at the terrible darkness
a subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath jacobs feet
he steps away from it but it follows his movement
suddenly as if by spontaneous combustion it bursts into flames
jacob screams and tries to run but the flames move with him lapping at his legs
he cannot escape them
as far and as fast as he runs the fire is with him
he yells and cries and screams as the fire eats at his lower limbs
he falls and jumps back up again his hands charred
his eyes grow wild
oh god help me
instantly the flames roar and engulf him
it is total conflagration
jacobs skin blisters and turns black
his flesh crackles
writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can find no freedom from his suffering
all at once jacob stops running
he throws his hands up into the burning air and stands motionless in absolute agony
it is a gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond himself
his flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly quiet inside him
through the flames jacobs dark form can be seen as it slowly sits down like a buddhist monk in the midst of the holocaust
he appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate him
gradually the fire dies
jacobs body his flesh like a charred and brittle shell sits motionless beyond pain
an orange glow from the embers of his body slowly fades leaving him in the final darkness
the screen stays dark for as long as possible
then slowly an eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky
it backlights jacob revealing his silhouette
the camera dollies slowly toward him
it approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of jacobs face
it is the face of death
the camera holds on the image
suddenly with shocking impact jacobs eyes move
within the crumbling shell of a body something is still alive still conscious
the eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings of a new light
it is dawn
jacobs dark remains are suffused by a preternatural glow
slowly huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon
jacobs eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in the still dark lansdcape
gradually the orbs begin their ascent like a thousand suns rising at the same time
jacobs eyes widen as his new world stands revealed
he is sitting in a garden of light the rousseau paradise he has visited once before
a sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead
the vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft glow
like a gentle breeze michael descends from the light and stands radiant before jacob
he smiles and the air itself seems to brighten
michael quietly approaches jacobs body
i am with you jacob
jacob stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and disbelief
speaking with a gentle compassion its all right now
jacob stares at him questioningly
michael reaches out his hands trust me
softly michael places his hands on top of jacobs head and begins to peel at the charred flesh
layer by layer he strips it away
then with an unexpected gesture he rips away a whole section with one quick pull
a blaze of light bursts through the gaping hole in jacobs head and beams into the air around them
it is an astounding sight
dont make me do it all
his eyes sparkle stand up
jacobs eyes are burst ing with wonder you can do it
slowly jacob begins to stir
he moves feebly at first like an old man
his black flesh creaks and cracks and through each sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike intensity
your flesh cant hold you anymore
jacob nods in response and takes a huge gigantic breath
his lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it
jacob stands transfigured filled with his own luminosity
his face is like a childs as he stares in amazement at his own hands glowing with light
michael directs jacobs vision to the sunrise
it is majestic almost biblical in its grandeur
great rays of light penetrate vast cloud formations and descend into the garden
slowly the clouds as if orchestrated by some higher power begin to part
a massive light complex emerges from behind them
jacob watches awestruck as the celestial stairway stands revealed
it reaches down from unknown heights radiating an infinite power and grace
it touches down far in the distance hovering over many acres of teh garden
jacobs eyes are filled with its splendor
michael looks at him and nods
go on jacob
it has come for you
jacob cannot speak
his eyes are fixed on the stairway dazzling him from afar
he can see angelic forms moving up and down it
suddenly as if transported by light itself he feels himself floating up into the air
he looks down upon eden sparkling below him
his mouth is wide open as he soars above it
the light pulsating from the stairway is brilliant and thrilling
jacobs own inner light intensifies as he approaches it
the stairway grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer
it pulls jacob toward it
streams of angels enter the stairway like a fast flowing river
it carries them instantly within its current up beyond the visible reaches of the glittering sky
billowing clouds glow in a parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the stairway reaches beyond all known dimensions
jacob stares at the light that is about to absorb him
it is a moment of total euphoria
he surges into the stream as the brilliant light of the stairway overwhelms the screen
slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller light source
an overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view
a doctor leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask
his expression is somber
he shakes his head
his words are simple and final
cut to jacob singer lying on an operating table in a large army field tent in viet nam
the doctor steps away
a nurse rudely pulls a green sheet up over his head
the doctor turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat
two orderlies wheel jacobs body past rows of other doctors and nurses fighting to save lives
a young vietnamese boy pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent
it is a bright fresh morning
the sun is rising
