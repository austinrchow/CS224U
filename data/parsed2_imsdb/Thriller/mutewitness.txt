a strong light starts playing on billys face and we hear a russian voice who seems to come from a loudspeaker
the upper part of the film set
three big spotlights on a rack

billy is kneeling near a large box used as a table
on the box something is written in large capital russian letters
around billy a lot of props are scattered around
apparently billy cant find what she is looking for and sits back on her heels in despair
she hears a loud noise
she sits up when she hears the noise
she tries to figure out what that noise means
she stands up and runs toward a window
the sky is darker
the night is coming soon
billy looks through the window
on the parking lot seen trough the bars of the window the janitor is crossing the yard with his dog
billy opens the window and turns around looking for something to hit the metal bars of the window
she takes a spear from a suit of armor
then she bangs on the bars of the window with the long handle of the spear
on the parking lot seen through the bars of the window the janitor keeps on walking around with his dog apparently not hearing the noise made by billy
then he closes the main door of the studio parking lot
billy drops the spear on the floor and runs away from the window
a large corridor
a door opens and billy rushes out
she opens a door at the end of the corridor and runs out
the gallery around the top of the set
a door opens and billy runs along the gallery
at ground level we see billy coming down the stairs leading to the gallery
billy runs across the film set which seems not to have been used recently
billy reaches a heavy metal door and tries to open it
without any success
she kicks it
the parking lot seen trough the heavy metal bars of a door
it is darker than before and completely empty
close up shot on an big padlock and a thick chain set across the bars of the door
we hear very loud rock music
close shot on the gas stove
ground meat is cooking in a frying pan
chopped onions are being poured into another frying pan from a wooden cutting board
andy is spraying some spices on the meat
he is wearing an apron tied around his waist
he tastes his cuisine from a spoon
he is bobbing up an down in rhythm with the music
andy makes the round spice rack spin around very fast and picks up a jar from the rack
then he pours spices from two different jars with both hands in rhythm with the music miming a drummer beating his drums with his sticks
then he pours tomato sauce from a can into a saucepan
he throws the empty can away
he takes another spice jar
but the lid of the jar comes off and all the spices fall down into the meat
he puts the empty jar down
he takes the lid off the meat
we hear the phone ringing
andy lowers the volume of the music from the radio set hanging on the wall
the phone is still ringing
honey can you get that
andy takes the meat frying pan out of the stove to pour the meat into the onions frying pan
the kitchen seen from the dark living room
there is no door between kitchen and living room just a wide open arch
the phone is still ringing
andy turns around
karen voice over im in the shower
andy puts the frying pan back on the stove and runs in the living room
he picks up the phone from a table
close dark shot of billy with the telephone handset to her ear
she taps on the microphone of the handset
the telephone set is on a small shelf fixed on the wall
even if the volume of the radio has been lowered it is still loud enough for andy not to be able to hear billys tapping
a hissing sound coming from the kitchen makes him turn around
on the stove a big stew pot is hissing and water is leaking between the lid and the pot
andy takes the telephone set and runs toward the kitchen
but the cord is a bit too short and is stretched tight just when he reaches the kitchen
he drops the telephone set on the floor
he tries to reach the stove control panel while still holding the telephone handset to his ear
andys hand is trying to reach the control panel of the stove
billy is still tapping on the microphone of the telephone

there are no light and the room is completely dark
we hardly see a huge bear and a bat
the camera pans on the right tilting slightly down
the camera comes to billy seated behind a desk and dialing on a telephone set
she puts the handset to her ear but only gets a busy tone
she puts the phone down on its hook
documents are scattered on the desk
a draught makes one of the documents fly away
billy looks surprised by what just happened
some more papers fly away
she looks on her right at a door with frosted small window panes which closes shut by itself
on the top of the door a small bell is ringing
billy looks at the door and stands up a long dark corridor
a door opens on the right ringing the small bell
its the door of billys workshop
billy walks out of the room
in the dark we only see the dark outline of her figure
she stops not sure about where she is going to go next
eventually she starts walking slowly
she stops again when she hears voices speaking in russian
then she starts walking again
a metal door with a notice hanging from the handle
zoom on the notice on which something is written in russian
actually it is an elevator door
billy peeks from behind the elevator door to look at what is going on down below
high angle shot of the elevator shaft
we hear voices speaking in russian and we see some light at the bottom of the shaft where the cabin is
billy is still peeking into the elevator shaft
a draught is waving her hair
she moves away
billy closes the door of the elevator
she walks toward the staircase and starts walking downstairs
through the open door of the staircase we see her stopping because she just heard a faint sound of a telephone ringing
karen is still seated behind the table and listening to a telephone which keeps on ringing without any answer
andy walks slowly toward the table coming from the kitchen
karen looks very nervous
suddenly we hear a clicking noise in the telephone
karen looks up at andy
are you all right
ask her about the mask
karen shushes andy with her hand
you want to tap something through
billy is holding the telephone next to her ear
she taps on the microphone with her finger
karen has the telephone handset squeezed between her head and her shoulder
andy turns around because he just heard a hissing noise in the kitchen
he runs toward the stove
karen voice over oh man
in the kitchen andy tries to save his cooking
andy puts his frying pan down into a large white plastic can full of water where it starts hissing
was it l
the second letter was it l
karen shushes andy with her hand
andy is getting his frying pan out of the plastic can
while karen is trying to understand her sisters message andy is banging the frying pan on the side of the can to get rid of everything that was inside it
in the kitchen andy looks at his empty frying pan

billy keeps on tapping on the microphone
karen voice over on the telephone do you have the mask
billy taps again

andy throws the frying pan in the can of water where it hisses again
karen looks at andy puts the telephone down and makes a face
billy is running downstairs
the entrance of a film set
we hear some giggles
the door opens billy enters and closes the door behind her
in the background spotlights are switched on above a scenery apparently someone is shooting a film
billy walks noiselessly across the empty part of the set
as billy comes closer to the lit part of the set we hear strange noises that sound like a woman having an orgasm
with billy in the background we see a camera with an operator behind it
on a bed two actors are having sex
the female a blonde woman is naked the male has his pants down to his ankles and is wearing a t shirt and a white mask
billy looks slightly embarrassed by what she sees
close shot on the face of the camera operator looking into the viewfinder of his camera
he is lyosha the young man who was courting billy
the blonde naked woman is moaning
she is a slightly plump woman with hair too blonde to be true
she could be in her forties
billy still looking slightly embarrassed is also smiling
the woman is faking a very strong orgasm
lyosha voice over stop
the woman instantly stops faking her orgasm and gets up from the bed
lyosha talks in russian to the woman who is still lying on the bed
her lover lying on the woman is answering lyosha in russian
lyosha looks back into his viewfinder
we hear the woman moaning again
billy walks around the set
close shot on the face of the lover
he is wearing the mask billy has been looking for
in the background behind the man we see billy looking from behind an open window in the scenery
lyosha looks up from his viewfinder then back again into it
the womans lover slaps her gently on the face but keeps on having sex with her
the man slaps her again but much harder this time
billy looks surprised by what she sees
the man holds the woman down on the bed with both hands
he slaps her very hard several times and then hits her with his fist
billy closes her eyes disgusted by what she sees
we hear the woman being hit and screaming
the woman seems very surprised by what is happening to her
the man keeps on hitting her
she tries to cover her face from the blows she is getting repeatedly
lyosha smiles looking very happy with what is happening on the set
the woman tries to get the man away from her
she grabs his mask and throws it away
underneath the mask the man has another black very close fitting fabric mask hiding his face which could be a black stocking
he grabs both her hands with one of his hands and holds them above her head
then he takes a black strong ribbon from under the bed and ties her hands with it
the woman is now very frightened and tries to get free
the man slaps her very hard
close shot on a pillow being lifted by the hand of the man
under the pillow there is a long very sharp knife
billy cant believe what she sees
the man takes the knife and slowly lifts the knife above his head
billy looks more and more frightened
she has tears in her eyes
she is crying silently with her fist in her mouth
the man start stabbing the woman
her blood is splashing on the wall and the mans t shirt
the woman is covered with her own blood
billy starts walking away from the window and across the set
the woman doesnt seem to move anymore but the man is still stabbing her
billy walks backward across the set and she bumps into a hatstand which falls down
everything that was in the open purse hanging on the hatstand hairbrush keys lighter make up things etc
falls on the floor
a plastic diskette case skids on the floor and slips under a big wooden wardrobe
lyosha alerted by the noise stands up from his camera
billy is kneeling on the floor near the fallen hatstand
lyosha goes back to his camera
billy kneeling on the floor puts everything back into the purse
then she stands up puts the hatstand back on its legs and walks away from it
she hides behind the large wooden wardrobe
lyosha walks slowly toward the place where billy is hiding
billy walks away and lyosha stops near the hatstand
the long dark corridor
in the foreground on the left the staircase the only part of the set where there is light apparently coming from the windows and the street lights
billy is running upstairs
she enters the corridor where she starts running just when lyosha appears in the staircase running after billy
when he reaches the landing lyosha switches on the lights in the corridor
just before lyosha enters the corridor in the background we see billy hiding in a nook a small partition in the corridor
lyosha looks for her
billy seems suddenly interested by something up on the wall across from her
it is a sign for an emergency exit
billy looks in the direction the sign is pointing at
it is the emergency exit
lyosha is coming toward billys hiding
he stops to listen for a meaningful noise
he opens a door to look into a room
billy peeks from behind her hiding nook
she runs toward the emergency exit which is located toward the end of the long corridor
the open door and just behind it lyosha looking into the room
he switches the light off just as billy reaches the emergency exit
he walks out of the room and closes slowly the door behind him
he looks at the far end of the corridor
he walks a couple of steps and stops
he turns around and says a few words in russian
billy is hiding behind a big red vending machine at the far end of the corridor
lyosha looks around him and billy looks at the emergency exit
close shot on the handle of the emergency door
then the camera pans on the left and stops on the red emergency box with the door key inside
near the key is posted a long notice in russian
lyosha walks slowly toward billy
he tries to open a door but it is locked
we hear him talking in russian
billy is still hidden behind the red vending machine
lyosha keeps on walking slowly toward billy
is anyone there
lyosha is looking at the far end of the corridor
he crosses toward a door

he opens the door and walks inside the room
billy peeks cautiously from behind the machine and sees the open door
she runs toward the emergency exit
she breaks the glass with her hand and grabs the key
lyosha voice over ho
billy runs back toward the vending machine behind which she hides again
lyosha walks out of the room leaving the door open and looks at the far end of the corridor
billy is still hidden behind the vending machine
lyosha is coming toward her
billy moves slowly along the wall keeping her back as close as possible of the wall
she opens a door and enters a dark room
she closes the door behind her
lyosha reaches the vending machine and starts running toward the emergency exit
he stops near the emergency box with its broken glass
he looks inside the emergency box
his finger comes out of the box with the tip covered with billys blood
he tries to open the emergency door which is locked
a dark store room with large windows
the door opens and lyosha walks in
he runs to the window
he looks outside but seeing nothing significant he turns around and walks a couple of steps inside the room
he stops and looks around
he starts walking again across the room
suddenly something catches his eye
close shot on the bottom of a long drape
there is a thin space between the bottom of the drape and the floor
and on this thin space the tip of a shoe is showing
lyosha walks slowly toward the drape
he pulls the drape open with a very quick movement
several racks of shoes were actually hidden by the drape
a door opens in the back of the room and billy walks in the room
there is some light coming from the door
billy walks to the main door of the room and opens it
she raises her arm and grabs the bell at the top of the door to silence it
she walks out of the room
the long corridor
the lights are still on
billy walks out of her workshop and closes the door
she starts running along the corridor toward the emergency exit
she suddenly stops when she hears a door opening
she runs back toward the staircase and hides near the entrance of the staircase
in the background we see lyosha coming out of a room
the camera pans toward the staircase and billy
a door opens on the floor below and the large shadow of a man is projected on the wall of the staircase
billy runs on the other side of the landing while the man starts climbing the stairs
he is arkadi the electrician working on andys film and the one who was playing with a spotlight on billys face
he is bare chested which makes us believe he was the poor actress murderer
he reaches the landing and stops
billy is still hiding in a dark corner
she sees arkadi coming on the landing
lyosha is coming to meet arkadi
they speak in russian
billy looks at the two men then she moves silently away from them
she reaches the door of the elevator which is supposed to be out of order and opens it
she puts the key of the emergency exit door in her mouth and start climbing down the elevator shaft emergency ladder
billy climbs down the emergency ladder trying not to miss the steps
her face is now on the level of the bottom of the door of the elevator
there is a small gap between the bottom of the door and the floor which enables billy to peek at what is going on in the corridor
a shoe appears in the gap between the door and the floor
close shot on the small window at the top of the elevator door
arkadis face appears in the window
he looks around inside the elevator shaft
billy is not in front of the gap anymore but hiding in the dark
she puts the key in front of the gap
arkadi tries to open the door of the elevator
but it is locked
the blood on his hand proves that arkadi was actually the poor actress murderer
through the small window he looks around in the shaft
billy tries not to be seen through the gap
arkadi still looks around in the shaft
he turns his head to talk in russian to lyosha
billy has got the key back between her teeth
we hear the two men talking in russian
arkadis face moves away from the window
some lights are switched off making the window slightly darker
billy moves away from the wall of the shaft and falls
she catches the elevator cables
close shot on billys face
she is holding the cables
she makes a face because of the pain
she doesnt have the key in her mouth anymore
close shot on a concrete ledge somewhere along the shaft
the emergency door key drops on it then moves away from it
billy is trying to climb back up to the door
we see the elevator cabin at the bottom the shaft and billy in the foreground trying to climb back up
there is some light in the cabin
we hear some strange noise in the shaft
billy looks down at where the noise is coming from
close shot on the key seen through the chicken wire roof of the cabin and resting on the floor of the cabin
billy still holding the cables starts going slowly down
she misses a step but holds on the cables
she keeps on going down the shaft
she eventually reaches the roof of the cabin
we hear muffled voices talking in russian
billy sits down on the roof of the cabin to rest a little
through the chicken wire that covers the roof of the cabin she sees the key on the floor of the cabin
she tries to open a panel in the chicken wire
it is stuck but she eventually succeeds in opening it
she moves the panel on its hinges and rests it against the wall
we still hear the muffled voices talking in russian
billy starts climbing down in the opening in the chicken wire
billy drops down on the floor of the cabin
the front door of the cabin is wide open showing the well lit store room in front of the cabin
but the cabin is not completely at the same level as the room it is slightly higher
we hear banging noises in the background
billy looks at the room and is suddenly frightened by something
she stands up and looks up at the roof of the cabin
she climbs back toward the roof
we see lyosha in the room walking toward the elevator
lyosha is coming closer carrying a large plastic trash bag on his shoulder
when he reaches the elevator he takes the bag down from his shoulder and drops it in the gap between the bottom of the cabin and the floor of the
the plastic bag drops down to the bottom of the shaft
billy lying on the roof of the cabin is looking through the chicken wire
arkadi is walking toward the elevator carrying a bag on his shoulder and pulling another one on the floor
close shot on the key which was not actually on the floor of the cabin but on the floor of the room just outside the cabin
the plastic bag pushed by arkadi under the cabin pushes the key in the gap
lyosha and arkadi are standing just outside the cabin
lyosha is pushing another bag in the gap
the two men then walk away from the cabin
billy climbs down from the roof of he cabin and stands up on the cabin floor
seeing lyosha she squats down but lyosha walks away
billy climbs out of the cabin
then she enters the gap and starts climbing down the shaft using the emergency ladder
the bottom of the shaft is full of plastic bags and various debris
billy reaches the bottom and steps on the bags
she kneels down and starts searching for her key
suddenly we hear a very loud noise
billy startled by the noise stands up
lyosha is looking through the gap at the bottom of the shaft
he turns around and talks in russian to arkadi
billy is hiding among the plastic bags
lyosha is still calling arkadi
he talks to him in russian
arkadi comes near lyosha with a powerful flashlight and with it he looks into the bottom of the shaft
the light from the flashlight is playing on the bags
close shot of billys face hidden among the bags
the light moves near billys face then moves to a transparent bag near billy with a head inside
billy looks up at the bag
she screams noiselessly
suddenly she turns around because she has seen something else
close shot of the emergency door key lying among the debris brightly lit by arkadis flashlight
arkadi walks away from the elevator followed by lyosha
before leaving they close the outside door of the elevator
after the door has been closed shut the elevator shaft becomes completely dark
billy slowly comes out of the bags
she takes the key
then she slowly stands up puts the key in the pocket of her sleeveless jacket and starts climbing the emergency ladder along the wall of the shaft
she climbs just a few step to reach the first door the basement door
close shot of the small window on the door of the elevator seen from outside the shaft
billys face appears in the window
the basement is completely dark
billy tries to open the door but it is locked
she bangs on it with her hand
then she shakes it violently
she looks up on the verge of tears
then she hears some steps
arkadi is coming carrying a powerful lamp
billy looks very frightened
the light from the lamp plays on her face
billy moves away from the door
arkadi stops near the locked door of the elevator puts his lamp down on the floor and takes a key out of his pocket
billy climbs on the emergency ladder in the shaft arkadi opens the door of the elevator
billy looks very frightened
arkadi is kneeling down by the lamp
he starts to stand up
he is carrying a plastic bag which he has taken away from inside the elevator shaft
he walks away leaving the door open
billy climbs down the shaft
arkadi walks away in the basement
billy slowly comes out of the elevator door and runs away in the opposite direction from arkadi
she hides behind a pillar because she sees arkadis lamp in the background
arkadi is coming back and billy moves around the pillar to be hidden from arkadis eyes
arkadi stops near the elevator
he opens the elevators door
billy runs away
she trips on something and makes a little noise
arkadi coming out of the elevator looks in billys direction
billy opens a door and walks out
arkadi slowly walks away from the elevator door
the door closes smoothly behind billy
billy is walking rapidly upstairs
the door of the set opens and billy walks in
she walks slowly through the set looking around her
suddenly the big spotlights are switched on one by one
in the electricians control cabin we see lyosha switching the lights on
more spotlights are switched on
billy is running around on the set trying to avoid the lights
she reaches the scenery and jumps out of one of the scenery windows
a searchlight controlled by lyosha
the searchlight is following billy
billy tries to avoid the searchlight
she runs away toward the exit of the set
she meets arkadi coming back on the set but she keeps on running
billy starts climbing a ladder but before climbing she pushes a heavy piece of furniture to block the bottom of the ladder
the piece of furniture falling down makes other props fall down
arkadi starts moving the props out of his way
he reaches the bottom the ladder
he starts climbing the ladder turning his head around to yell lyosha
in the electricians control cabin hearing his name lyosha looks outside the cabin
arkadi voice over lyosha
he says a few words in russian
a gallery near the ceiling of the set
billy is running along the gallery
lyosha runs out of the electricians control cabin and on the gallery
billy runs down a few steps and outside the room
from the other side of the gallery lyosha comes running after her
lyosha runs downstairs
the long dark corridor with the staircase in the foreground
lyosha runs in the corridor from the staircase but before entering the corridor he switches the lights on
with the lights on we can see billy running away to the far end of the corridor
lyosha runs after her
zoom on the emergency door coming closer to us
billy is running toward the door
billy puts the key in the keyhole
she opens the emergency door and shuts it behind her
lyosha runs toward the door
he pushes it open
the other side of the door opening on a small gallery leading to the emergency ladders set along the exterior wall of the building
the door is been violently pushed open by lyosha
with lyoshas violent push billy falls backward above the balcony of the gallery and down on the yard below
billy falls on her back on a huge pile of used film metal boxes
lyosha bends over the balcony and looks down at billy
billy is lying among the boxes and moves her head
a blurred dark picture with lights dancing around
it is what billys eyes are seeing when she tries to focus after her fall
she sees the blurred picture of lyosha running down the emergency ladder along the wall of the building
karen voice over hello
the corner of the building
a shadow is moving hidden by the building
karen voice over hello

when he hears karens voice he looks up

lyosha stands up
billy talks to karen with her hand
billy keeps on signing
she looks up at lyosha
lyosha shrugs his shoulders and makes a face that means he doesnt know what billy is talking about
this the set where the poor actress was brutally murdered
billy is seated between karen and andy
she has a disoriented look on her face and a blanket is wrapped around her shoulders
karen is tenderly stroking billys shoulder
we hear some laughing and people talking in russian
lyosha and arkadi are talking to an uniformed russian policeman who seems to be in charge of the inquiry
consequently he will be from now on mentioned as first policeman the other policeman who shall be mentioned as second policeman is kneeling down looking at something on the floor
and the janitor is standing in a corner with his dog on a leash
lyosha arkadi and the first policeman are still talking together
they slowly walk toward the rest of the group
the second policeman who was still kneeling down stands up
billy is listening to lyosha apparently trying to lip read and understand what he says
lyosha turns toward her
we just fake murder

the two uniformed policemen are listening to lyosha
lyosha voice over why make film of it
lyosha and arkadi both laugh

the janitor is trying to follow the conversation
we hear a policeman talking in russian

billy doesnt look at arkadi but karen does
arkadi voice over we understand how she feel

billy taps on karens arm
karen looks up at arkadi
the first policeman looks at the paper he is holding in his hand

the two policemen both turn around to look at the place billy is showing
the second policeman moves away and the first one looks at his paper
and it was this man
he points at arkadi
billy seated again points at arkadi
lyosha looks at arkadi
the first policeman resumes the reading of his paper

karen runs after lyosha

karen starts working on the hermetic bag used as a portable dark room
karen puts her arms inside the bag
this lets you unload the film without needing a darkroom
close shot on arkadis face
he looks very menacing
andy starts taking his jacket off
andy whispering god its hot in here
in the background arkadi is bending down on something we dont see
he looks up at karen
karen voice over if he had exposed the film to the light he could have destroyed all the evidence
billy looks at arkadi still busy doing something that we dont see

billy who understands something wrong is going on with arkadi stamps her feet
karen gives the film to the first policeman
arkadi is walking slowly with something that looks like a knife in his hand
we hear billy clapping her hands
andy turns around to look at billy
billy points to arkadi and tries to explain something in sign language
karen looks at billy
arkadi grabs andy and pushes him against the wall
arkadi stabs andy in the stomach with his knife
he has blood on his cheek
arkadi keeps on stabbing andy
the first policeman takes his gun out of his belt
both policemen grab arkadi from behind
they pull him away from andy
they have both drown their guns
karen rushes toward andy whose shirt is covered with blood
karadi still restrained by the two policemen is yelling in russian
lyosha voice over stop
arkadi drops his knife and it remains attached to his wrist by a plastic tube
actually it was a fake prop knife
andy stutters trying to explain something to karen
oh my god
karadi shows the knife to the policemen
he makes the retractable blade work to prove it is harmless
billy walks to her trunk and notices that the padlock on the lid has been broken
she opens the trunk
she takes the fake blood can out of the trunk it is almost empty
the policemen taste the fake blood
its for the actors
they put the stuff in their mouths
billy stamps her foot
they all turn toward her
she explains something in sign language
what she say
that its her knife
they broke into her box and used all the blood
so now she say it was a trick
billy keeps on talking in sign language
it happened so fast she couldnt see the knife clearly
but everything else she saw tonight was clear
billy keeps on talking in sign language
the body in the elevator shaft
she saw that
billy points to the elevator door
they are all walking in the basements toward the elevator
several of them are carrying torches
billy is still wrapped in the blanket
they reach the elevator and arkadi opens the door
the first policeman points his torch in the bottom of the elevator shaft
the dog barks
the janitor tries to calm it down
there are many plastic trash bags scattered in the bottom of the shaft
the first policeman talks in russian to the second one
apparently he asks him to go down to the bottom of the shaft and look at the bags
the second policeman doesnt look very happy to do it
but he does go down in the shaft and starts looking into the bags
he even pours the content of the first one out of the bag
but there are only trashes in the bag
arkadi and lyosha look at each other
the second policeman finds a bloody sheet in a bag
lyosha talks to him in russian
and the first policeman apparently tells him to do what lyosha just asked reluctantly he second policeman tastes the blood on the sheet
he smiles and says a word in russian
the first policeman repeats that word to lyosha what
it is fake blood
its fake blood
they could have soaked the sheets in fake blood afterwards
where is the body
the second policeman keeps looking through the trash bags
the first policeman shows the paper he is still holding to billy
here you say a head cut off
the second policeman has just emptied another bag
he makes a sign meaning nothing significant and talks in russian
arkadi answers something that makes lyosha and the two policemen laugh
billy says something in sign language
well there were more bags in there before
the first policeman seems a bit fed up with billy
no shes right
i will show you
they are all coming out of the basement on a ramp that reaches the yard and the parking lot around the building
arkadi is leading them
from lift shaft we take the rubbish here
the janitor says something in russian
they have reached the large plastic trash containers where all the trashes from the studio are dropped off waiting for the garbage collectors to take them away
the second policeman raises the lid of a container while the first policeman looks inside
arkadi takes a bag out of another container and drops it on the ground
the second policeman looks inside the bag with his flashlight
there seems to be a head inside the bag
the policeman pours the content of the bag on the ground
actually the head was just a mask
hey we need that
he picks up the mask from the rubbish
he wipes it with his hand
the first policeman gives his card to both billy and karen
sorry i can do nothing for you now
but i will call you after i see the film
he walks away
the second policeman shakes hands with arkadi and lyosha and goes away with his chief
billy rests her head on karens shoulder
lyosha looks at her shrugs and smiles
close up shot on billys face seated in the back of the car

karen looks at billy
no offense billy but id like to re shoot the stuff today using that guys knife
it was her knife
a very short flash back sequence of the murder of the actress
it looked good
another very short flash back
we understand those short flash backs come from billys mind reliving what she saw a couple of hours before
karen looking at billy seems to understand whats going on inside her sisters head because she says to andy shut up
more short flash backs of the murder and a close up shot on billys face
she seems very disturbed
the janitor is patrolling the basement with his dog
he is carrying an electric torch
he checks a heavy metal door which is closed
while he is checking the door the dog runs away
the janitor looks around him
he is apparently calling his dog but he gets no answer
he starts looking around
he reaches the door of the incinerator
we hear the noise of the incinerator and we see its light on the janitors face
the janitor seems surprises that the incinerator is working so late in the night
we hear the dog whining
the janitor enters the incinerator room
he walks slowly around until he reaches the incinerator
the incinerator door is slightly open
he looks inside
close shot of the inside of the incinerator
among the flames a human skull is burning
the janitor walks backward with a terrified look on his face
he trips on something and falls down
close shot on the fallen flashlight rolling around
in the light we see a pair of boots belonging to a still unknown man standing on the floor
still lying on the floor the janitor discovers his dog lying next to him and starts patting it
the dogs fur is covered with blood
arkadi walks toward the janitor
arkadi raises something we dont clearly see a knife
above his head and hit the janitor still lying on the floor
close up shot of a knife hitting a beefsteak
the directorss idea was of course to give us the impression that it was arkadis knife hitting the poor janitor
larger shot of the steak being cut into the plate
we hear some soft music
karen and andy are seated side by side at a table in a restaurant with billy sitting on the other side of the table
andy with his shirt still covered with fake blood is eating with an evident good appetite
billy doesnt seem to be very hungry
andy gives his plate to billy
please billy take some of mine
youll feel better
billy explain silently that she is not hungry
andy takes his plate back
andy pours a lot of ketchup on his steak
billy says something in sign language
karen looks at her while andy drinks his wine
billy keeps on talking

karen gives the salt to andy
you could at least make the effort
andy stops eating looks at billy drinking water and then at karen

he starts eating his steak again
how often have i heard that

andy puts his fork and knife down

billy smiles and nods her head no
it means somebodys look the expression on their face

what billy said shell never forget the look on the girls face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die
she said the pain and the terror was real
you cant act that
billy looks at andy and karen with a worried face
andy seems suddenly a bit worried too
the chimney of the studio seen from the parking lot in a low angle shot
a lot of black smoke is coming out of it certainly from the incinerator
lyosha is smoking on the ramp leading to the basement and he like the chimney exhales a lot of smoke but white one
the door of the basement opens and arkadi walks out
there seems to be a lot of smoke in the basement too
lyosha throws him a pack of cigarettes which he catches
he spits takes a cigarette out of the pack and lights it
two cars are coming toward them
the fist one is a large black limousine
lyosha picks up a small plastic bag
the cars stop near the ramp
arkadi and lyosha walk toward them
a man gets out of the front passenger door of the second car
he is wartschuk the big boss first assistant
he closes the door and walks toward lyosha and arkadi
lyosha gives him the plastic bag
the man says a few words in russian and nods toward the limousine
he walks away but lyosha doesnt move
a man is sitting in the back of the limousine his face hidden in the dark
he is called the reaper and he is the famous big boss of the whole criminal organization and consequently of arkadi and lyosha
come closer mr

lyosha starts walking slowly toward the car
the reaper voice over did it go smoothly

lyosha and arkadi look at the two cars driving away
lyosha gives a folded paper to arkadi who unfolds it
close up shot on the paper
it shows billys address and telephone number
low angle shot on the buildings around the street
then the camera tilts down to street level
andys car drives toward us and stops
billy opens the back door and walks out of the car
karen opens the drivers door and walks out
both sisters close their doors
billy starts walking toward her building and karen follows her
no honestly you can come back to our place and well set up the couch if you want

billy waves to andy and enters her building
karen looks at her sister and then turns toward andy
andy dont you care about her
andy looks offended by karens words
i dont care
i dont care

billy has stopped near her building door and is looking at karen and andys verbal fight
its the weekend
not for us
my dad gave me the duty officers direct number before we left just in case
so say goodbye
he waves to billy who waves back to him
she blows a kiss to her sister who blows one back and enters her building
a long corridor
in the foreground the two uniformed policemen who took care of billys case are sitting on a wooden bench
the second policeman is asleep
the first policeman stands up when he sees a group of three people a woman in white coat like a nurse and two men in suit and tie coming toward
the first policeman wakes up the second policeman who stands up
one of the men is mr
larsen a high rank police officer the other one is mr lovett the us ambassadors secretary
the woman in white shows the two policemen to larsen then walks away
larsen takes his hat off
lovett these are the two officers who answered the complaint
he shakes hands with the two policemen
good evening gentlemen
lovett shakes hands with the two policemen
please speak english to the ambassadors secretary
my chief asked me to meet mr
if this witness is correct about what she saw tonight she may help my own investigation
your english is quite good mr
my mother was a translator
in the university
after larsens answer there is a slight embarrassed silence between the two men
fortunately for them a door opens and a man in white coat walks out of a room carrying a film box under his arm
he talks to larsen in russian and shows him the room where they have to go
larsen shows the room to lovett
they all follow the technician
the door of the projection room opens and lovett enters followed by larsen
weve been tracking gangsters in moscow running an international pornography and prostitution racket
the two policemen enters behind them
larsen shows a seat to lovett
the projection room looks like a small cinema theatre with rows of red seats
sit down please
we have information they have made snuff films here and sold them all over the world
lovett sits down
larsen takes his coat off and sits down next to lovett
the two policemen sit on the row behind the two men
is that what i think it is
victims believe they are making a sex film but they are murdered in front of the camera
larsen turn toward the two policemen
what is the name of the witness
what is it
he snaps his fingers
billy hughes sir
she claims to have seen one being made
the technician is setting the film reel on the projector
we can hear the voices from the room coming through the loudspeaker of the cabin
larsen voice over from the loudspeaker the victims are illegal immigrants exploited as prostitutes by a gang headed by one man
the technician is feeding the film into the projector
he is brutal ruthless
they call him the reaper
larsen is making nervous movements with his hands
im surprised his men gave up the film so easily
if it is what i think it is our witness billy hughes is in great danger
the sequence ends with a close shot on larsens worried face
close up shot on the gas flames of the water heater
billy is getting ready to take a bath
she is just wearing a bath towel wrapped around her body
with her hand she tests the temperature of the bath water
she pours some bubble bath from a big bottle into the water
we hear the telephone ringing
billy turns her head toward the living room the apartment is a bit ancient looking
it doesnt look like billy
one can tell it is only a rented apartment for a short period
various clothes are scattered around the room
billy walks from the bathroom along the corridor to the living room
the telephone keeps on ringing
the telephone and the special answering machine are set on a small table
billy picks up the telephone handset and puts it on the machine
then she sits down on a chair and puts a pair of earphone on her ears
finally she presses a button on the machine
close up shot on the screen of the machine
it looks a bit like a computer screen
the machine offers the choice between different sentences hello hello this is billy hughes speaking i am using a digital voice computer please have patience and i will answer my
address is apartment kievsky prospekt my telephone number is etc
billy chooses the second choice using a ball mat
then she brings the arrow on an icon to start the machine
hello this is billy hughes speaking
momentarily the scene is seen through a binocular which makes us realize that billy is been spied by someone
billy apparently getting no answer but a deep breathing noise chooses the first choice
a shot on the large bay window makes us guess where the spy is hiding somewhere across the street
hello this is billy hughes speaking
billy keeps on trying to get an answer
but she gets only a disconnection tone
she takes the earphone out of her ears and puts them on the table
she looks at the window
shot on the window with a zoom on another window across the street
behind that window we see the figure of a man looking at billy with binoculars
billy seen through the neighbors binoculars
she walks to the window and pull the drapes to hide the window
the spy sees the drapes being pulled through his binoculars
the same men are still in the projection room
the first policeman has taken his cap off
and larsen is now seated in a seat behind lovett
have you seen a
how do you say
snuff film before
i saw a woman tied to a tree kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off
its hard to talk about it or even think about it
and it makes you sick to watch it
you never forget the look in the victims eyes
the sheer panic and horror when they realize theyre about to die
lovett looks very disturbed by what larsen just told him
the technician knocks on the window between his cabin and the room
larsen and lovett turn around and larsen makes a sign to tell the technician to start the film
then he takes a cigarette from the pack he left on his former seat
the room becomes dark and the projection starts
the four men watch the film which has no sound
on the screen of the projection room we see the sequence when the young actress pretending she is dying very slowly breaks the whole set
lovett and larsen turn their head toward the cabin
the technician is also watching the film through the window between the two rooms
when he sees larsen looking at him he shrugs to tell him that he is not responsible for what is shown on the screen
larsen and lovett turn back to watch the screen
on the screen the sequence when the young actress is pulling the tablecloth away from the table and also everything that was on the table
the two policemen are smiling because they find what they see on the screen quite funny
lovett and larsen do not smile because they are disappointed
now on the screen the actress is pulling the drapes down from the windows
karen wearing her night gown is seated on the edge of the bed
we hear andy talking into the telephone
andy voice over yes sir
andy is walking up and down in the next room carrying the telephone set in his hand and with the handset on his ear

he puts the phone down back on its hook
karen has a worried look on her face
i told you

he says the films the biggest piece of shit hes ever seen
andy is smiling but karen still has a worried look on her face
high angle shot of the room seen from the ceiling
billy is lying in her bathtub surrounded by foam and bubbles
her eyes are closed
she slowly puts her head underwater and leaves just her face above water
one of the faucet is leaking and water is dropping from it
one of the glass panes is broken and fixed with adhesive tape and newspaper
he eyes closed billy has her daydreams flashbacks again
she sees the actress blood spurting on the wall of the scenery
she sees her being stabbed
she sees herself running away from lyosha in the long dark corridor
suddenly she feels drops of blood on her face
and opening her eyes she sees the bloody actress behind the broken glass pane
she quickly sits up in her bath
she looks at the window which is empty
she hears the phone ringing
she stands up in her bath and takes her bath towel to dry herself
billy opens the bathroom door and walks out and along the corridor while drying her hair
she has put a bathrobe on
she puts the telephone handset on the answering machine
she puts her earphones on and select an answer

karen is sitting on the bed with the telephone handset to her ear

billy is looking through the peephole on the door
karen is looking worried

karens louder voice has awaken andy who sits up
billy is still looking through the peephole
the landing just outside billys apartment front door is dark and empty
billy still looking in the peephole moves her head from right to left trying to see further on the landing
she slowly moves away from the door to a small table by the door
close up shot on the table and a business card lying on it
it is the first policemans card
it says police inspector vladimir pekar precinct and underneath an address and a telephone number
billy is still standing near the door
she puts the safety chain on
and then she slowly opens the door
arkadi appears behind the door
billy tries to shut the door but he puts his foot between the door and the wall
i want to talk
desperately billy tries to push the door shut
close up on the earphones on the machine keyboard
karen voice over from the telephone billy
karen seems very excited
billy are you still there

he lies back in the bed
i heard a noise andy
billy is trying to push the door shut
arkadi has a big wire cutter in his hand
he brings the cutter near the chain
billy takes an umbrella from the stand near the door and with it tries to prevent arkadi from cutting the chain
arkadi cuts the tip of the umbrella off
with her slippered foot billy kicks arkadis foot still jamming the door but it doesnt move it off
then she takes the heavy metal umbrella stand and hits arkadis foot with it
arkadi removes his foot from the door
billy can at last slam the door shut
she leans on it panting
karen is now very frightened
she yells in the phone
she puts the phone down and stands up from the bed

andy sits up on the bed
billy is still leaning on the door panting
we hear the noise of an electric machine
billys eyes widen with horror
she rushes to the telephone and starts typing frenetically
close up shot on the door lock
we can guess that arkadi is trying to open the door with a power tool
billy puts her earphone on
she hears the disconnection tone
she presses the disconnection switch on her own telephone
close up shot on the door lock
one of the screws holding the lock pops off and falls on the floor
billy is listening to a russian speaking female voice in her earphones
she types on her keyboard
she sends her message
a few word in russian and then more distinctly police
billy types yes
getting a russian answer she types da da
billy chooses a pre recorded message and sends it

close up on the lock another screw just pops off
the telephone operator keeps on speaking in russian apparently not listening to billys message
we hear the power tool working again on the lock
billy takes her earphones off and rushes out of the room
billy enters her dark kitchen
she takes a big knife from the table and rushes out of the kitchen
billy rushes in the room with the knife in her hand
the answering machine keeps on speaking

close up on the lock another screw pops off
billy takes her earphones off and rushes to the light switch
she puts all the lights of the room at their maximum lighting capacity
we see billys living room window from the outside
billy is pulling the drapes wide open
then she starts waving her arms to attract the attention of the peeping tom and his binoculars
reverse angle shot on the window where the peeping tom was standing when he was watching billy
there is light coming through the window and someone is moving in the room behind the curtains but the peeping tom doesnt seem interested by billy at the moment
back to billys window
she unties her bathrobe and shows her breasts
the peeping tom is still moving in the room behind the curtains but he doesnt come to the window
billy is standing in front of the window with her bathrobe wide open revealing her naked body to whomever wants to watch it
close up on the lock
another screw is vibrating and pops off
we see the drill bit coming through the hole it just made
billy hears a male voice coming from her earphones
billy picks up the earphones and put them on her ears
i speak english
the door burst open and arkadi walks into the room
billy picks up her big kitchen knife and points it to arkadi
are you okay
arkadi presses the light switch to dim the lights in the room
close up shot on the earphones
if you just give your address we send somebody immediately
arkadi is walking slowly inside the room
billy is walking backward away from him but still pointing her knife at him
arkadi tears the telephone cord off the telephone handset
he tries to get near billy but she is still pointing her knife at him
he pulls the drapes back on the window
walking backward billy has reached the wall in which she bumps
she takes a white statuette on a chest of drawers and throws it at arkadi
arkadi bends down and avoid the statuette which crashes on the wall behind him
he takes his own knife out of his pocket a switchblade knife
billy pushes the chest of drawers toward arkadi
it crashes on the floor but arkadi avoids it
billy is still pointing her knife at arkadi when we hears some bumping noise
in the bedroom just underneath billys apartment a russian couple is trying to get some sleep which with all the noise in billys apartment is not very easy
the woman is still in the bed but the man is standing up on the floor holding a broom with both hands and hitting the ceiling with the handle of
both members of the couple swear in russian
billy who has understood the situation very well is hitting the floor with a stick
the man hears the noise made by billy and answer by hitting the ceiling with his broom
billy is waving her knife around her to prevent arakadi from coming closer to her
she throws the knife at him
arkadi bends his head and the knife hits the piano
close up of the piano keyboard with the knife stuck between two keys
billy rushes out of the room closing the door behind her
billy rushes into the kitchen
she takes various knives hanging from the wall and throws them at arkadi as he tries to enter the kitchen
one knife gets stuck into a painting on the other side of the corridor
arkadi almost catches billy but she jumps through a sort of window set between the kitchen and the living room
billy stands up after her jump through the window and she slams the door of the corridor in arkadis face
this door being a sort of french window with plenty of small glass panes on it arkadi crashes through the door scattering pieces of glass all over the floor
he falls on the floor
billy slips on a piece of glass and also falls on the floor
arkadi tries to catch her by the ankles
she kicks him in the face
he grabs her ankles back
billy grabs a big white vase from the floor she sits up and crashes the vase on arkadis head
arkadi lets her go and she rushes to the front door but as she reaches the door lyosha comes in
she rushes to the corridor
arkadi still a bit groggy looks at lyosha with blinking eyes
same high angle shot as before of the bathroom seen from the ceiling
billy enters the bathroom and locks the door behind her
arkadi stands up slowly and walks into the corridor
arkadi tries to crash the door open
billy looks around for a possible escape
she opens the door of the small cabinet above the sink and takes everything out of it close up shot on the bathroom door
arkadi has put his knife inside the lock of the bathroom door to open it
close up shot on the door
we see the handle of the lock spinning slowly
billy still looking in the cabinet sees the handle spinning
she rushes to the door and spins the handle back into the lock position
a knife blade comes through the door a few inches from billys face
billy goes back to the cabinet and starts searching it again
eventually she seems to have found what she was looking for a small disposable razor
the door is shaking under arkadis blows
eventually his hand breaks through the door and tries to find the handle of the door
billy picks up the toilet brush the handle of which is a donald duck and hits arkadis hand with it
but the door starts falling down under arkadis blows
billy looks through the hole arkadi has made in the door with his hand
through the hole we can see arkadi going to the end of the corridor and running back full speed to smash the door
at the last moment when arkadi is going to hit the door billy opens it
arkadi cant stop himself he crosses the bathroom and falls into the full bathtub
billy hits him on the head with the donald duck toilet brush
then billy takes the hair drier switch it on and throws it in the bathtub
arkadi is instantly covered with blue sparks
then he falls back into the bathtub where he remains motionless
billy grabs a bunch of clothes and rushes out of the bathroom
lyosha is looking through billys documents scattered on the desk
when billy comes rushing through the room he grabs her
she tries to fight him but he locks both of her arms behind her back
he brings her to the desk and slams her face on the desk
he puts a knife very close to her face
wheres the diskette
he puts a piece of paper and a pen in front of her face
he frees her right hand for her to be able to write
where is the diskette
billy takes the pen and starts writing
close up shot on the paper
billy writes what diskette
i know you have
lyosha raises billys bathrobe above her waist revealing billy naked bottom underneath
billy looks very frightened afraid of what lyosha can do to a defenseless naked girl
she takes the pen very firmly in her hand and brings it violently to lyoshas leg
close up shot of the pen hitting lyoshas leg
he raises his knife to bring it down on billy
billy is waiting for the worse to happen
she hears the noise of something or someone falling violently on the floor
and suddenly she realizes she is free
she raises from the table and sees larsen holding arkadis big wire cutter in his hands
he just hit lyosha with it
larsen throws the wire cutter on the floor and bends on billy
my name is alexander larsen
im a policeman
take your clothes
we must get out of here
larsen goes to the window and peeks through the drapes
you must hurry
billy rushes to her clothes she had dropped on the floor when lyosha grabbed her
she sits down on the floor and starts putting her socks on
i explain everything in the car
he is still peeking through the drapes
in the car
no time now
he gathers the rest of billys clothes takes her hand to makes her stand up and drags her outside the apartment
they come out of the apartment and start running along the corridor on billys landing
they reach the staircase
billy drops a piece of clothing and picks it up
larsen opens the door of the elevator and pushes billy inside
he closes the door
larsen is ready to press the number on the control panel but the button number lights up by itself before larsen presses it
they are coming
billy starts putting her panties on
we are in great danger
he looks down at billy who is still putting her panties on
he takes the rest of billys clothes in his hands and presses the button number
the elevator stops and larsen opens the door
billy walks out of the elevator and follows larsen down the staircase
larsen and billy are coming from the third floor and start going downstairs toward the first landing
the elevator is going up with two people inside
they look very much like andy and karen
larsen and billy are coming out of the building
larsens car is parked just in front of the building
larsen opens the passengers door for billy who climbs inside the car
then he walks around the car open the drivers door and climbs inside
he starts the engine
a big black limousine with two men inside starts and follows larsens car which has just started
the driver is wartschuk whom we have seen before with the reaper and who is the reapers first assistant
larsen gives a quick look in the rear view mirror
we see the headlights of the other car through the back window of the car
billy resumes her dressing
when she puts her white sweater on without a bra her breasts are showing
larsen gives a quick glance toward her and then turns his head away
billy looks back at him smiles and kisses him on the cheek
its not over yet
billy puts her jacket on
larsen looks in the back view mirror
karen and andy enter the apartment and stop when they see the mess around them
we realize that it was really them and not some gangsters going up in the elevator
oh my god its trashed
karen rushes through the room
andy remains on the doorstep
billy where are you
ill call the police
karen is running through the corridor
andy picks up the telephone handset without noticing that the cord has been cut
karen is checking all the rooms to find her sister billy
oh my god
andy is still trying to get a dialing tone how do you work this thing
oh there it is
behind andy the front door is closing slowly revealing lyosha standing behind it
he has the big wire cutter in his hand and is ready to hit andy with it
andy looks at the cut cord but doesnt realize the telephone cant work with a cut cord
karen enters the bathroom we hear karen screaming
andy puts the telephone down on the table and rushes across the room karen is coming out of the bathroom screaming
andy walks toward the corridor but karen meets him at the door
someones dead in the ba
she doesnt finish her sentence because she has just seen lyosha behind andy
she grabs andy and moves him out of the way of lyoshas wire cutter
the wire cutter smashes what is left of the door of the corridor
andy and karen run and enter a room presumably billys bedroom and slam the door behind them
oh my god
lyosha looks at the door and doesnt even bother to smash it
he slowly walks back to the living room
we hear karen and andys voices in the room
karen voice over get the door
get a chair
get the chair
andy voice over what chair
karen voice over the chair
out of the way
put it over there
andy voice over move
get the wardrobe over
lyosha enters the living room through what remains of the door
karen voice over andy quick
the man seated on his bed stares at the ceiling through which we can hear andy and karen yelling
his wife has put the sheet over her head to try not to hear the noise
the man stands up and throws one of his slippers to the ceiling
then he sits back while his wife stares at him
andy voice over im pushing
get out of the way
karen voice over what are you doing
andy voice over i cant
oh my god
lyosha sits down in an armchair and takes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket
but he doesnt take a cigarette
he gives a quick look at the front door and closes his eyes ready to fall asleep
the front door bursts open and two uniformed policemen enters the room guns in hand
lyosha looks at them without moving from his chair with a sort of look of indifference in his eyes
he shows them the corridor where we can still hear andy and karen yelling in the bedroom
from lyoshas attitude we can guess that those policemen are not real ones but fake ones
karen voice over i cant
you hold the door
andy voice over get out of the way
the two fake policemen cross the room
karen voice over come here
andy voice over dont yell at me
im trying to get the goddamn wardrobe near the fucking door
karen voice over oh my god
lyosha doesnt even look at them
he just smiles
before going through the smashed door into the corridor one of the policeman nods to his colleague who takes his gun from his holster aims and sends a bullet through
lyoshas head whose blood splatters the wall
the gun is equipped with a silencer and doesnt make much noise
then the policeman goes through the smashed door to join his colleague
while driving larsen talks to billy
the girl you saw murdered tonight
billy nods in approval
her boyfriend stole a diskette full of information
money names connections everything
he blackmailed the reaper
and now he thinks that you have the diskette
billy mouth a word we can easily understand
you have it
billy is trying to think about the lost diskette
andy and karen are kneeling on the floor with their hands joined behind their heads
one of the fake policeman is searching the room throwing everything off the shelves on the floor while the other one is aiming his gun at andy and karen
he is leaning on the piano and he throws all the objects which are on top of the piano on the floor
he raises briefly the piano lid and then starts looking behind the picture hanging on the wall
we dont have any diskettes
the policeman picks up a diskette he had thrown on the floor and looks at it
not that one
thats my script
karen hits andy with her elbow
the policeman puts the diskette into a small white plastic bag he is carrying around
he puts another diskette in the bag
the other policeman is speaking in russian in a walkie talkie
wartschuk is answering the fake policeman on his own walkie talkie
next to him his passenger is screwing a silencer on his gun
the street is empty at this time of the night but for the two cars following each other
the girl had it when she went into the studio
then she was murdered and it was gone
where is it
you were the only person there
close up shot on billys face trying to think about the mysterious diskette
she has a short flashback of arkadi taking the knife to murder the actress
then another one of the naked actress lying on the bed
then another one of the blood splattering the wall
then another one of arkadi stabbing the girl
another short flashback of billy going away from the set
then another one of billy bumping into the hatstand
then another one of the girls purse contents scattered on the floor
then another one of the diskette skidding on the floor and hiding under the large wooden wardrobe
billy grabs larsens shoulder
billy takes a notepad and starts writing on it
but she is interrupted by a russian voice coming from somewhere in the car
larsen opens the glove compartment and takes a walkie talkie out of it
he talks in russian in the talkie
billy looks at the pair of handcuffs in the glove compartment
larsen puts the talkie back in the compartment
they drive along a police station but larsen doesnt stop
billy looks a bit worried all of sudden
billy shows the police station to larsen
then she writes police on the notepad
yes but only with the diskette
she writes why
on the notepad

the reaper thinks i work for him
she grabs the steering wheel to force larsen to park the car
through the car windshield we see larsens car zigzagging on the street
the two passenger talks in russian billy is trying to force larsen to stop the car
through the windshield we see larsens car stopping near the sidewalk
the two men talk nervously in russian
billy hits larsen violently on his private parts
billy takes the handcuffs out of the glove compartment and ties larsens hand on the steering wheel
the two men look at larsens parked car
they see the passenger door being opened
billy opens the door and gets out of the car
theyll kill you
billy shows him the handcuffs key
then she slams the door
larsen moves his hand nervously but of course cant get it out of the handcuff
billy is running away from larsens car toward the other car
larsen looks into the glove compartment and takes the talkie out of it
he speaks in russian into the talkie
wartschuk answers larsen in russian
larsen is yelling in the talkie very excited
billy is walking in the street and she suddenly stops
she sees a ray of light on the sidewalk
through the windshield we see billy who has stopped on the sidewalk
she starts crossing the street and the camera moves to a nook between two building near the car and where a man is hiding
actually he is wartschuks passenger
larsen puts his gearshift into reverse and starts driving backward
billy is walking in the middle of the street and larsens car is coming toward her
billy starts running
larsens car turns around to face billy and starts again driving forward
the man who was hiding between the two buildings comes out of his hiding nook and runs toward larsens car
larsen stops and starts driving backward again
larsen is driving looking in the rear windshield
he stops suddenly
the man walks in front of larsens car
close up shot on larsens feet

larsen changes gear and looks through the rear windshield
the man stands up and starts running after larsens car driving backward again
the car reaches billy standing on the sidewalk
the big black car which was following larsen starts and turns around
larsen looks at billy
the man is running toward larsens car
billy looks at him and hesitates on her next move
but she decides to climb in larsens car
the big black car is coming toward them
billy climbs into the back of the car and closes the door
the man reaches larsens car just as it drives away
the man remains on the sidewalk with a mean look on his face
the black limousine stops near him and he climbs inside
billy looks through the rear windshield at the car following them
larsen has a hard time driving with his hand tied on the steering wheel

wartschuk speaks in his talkie
one of the fake policeman picks up his talkie from the table wartschuk voice over from the talkie delta three
the policeman answers da then listen to wartschuk speaking in russian
he says da again and a few more words
karen and andy look at him with a worried look on their face
wartschuk answers him
apparently andy understood a few words because he says what
the policeman drops the talkie on the table and talks to his colleague
the other policeman walks near andy and karen raising his gun
this is all a big misunderstanding and

the policemen dont seem to take any notice of what andy is saying
one is still cuffing his hands while the other one is holding his gun
and my father okay he knows a lot of big people and
the policeman raises andy to his feet and moves him away from karen
you want money

the policeman has seated andy on an armchair
he bends him down and puts the barrel of his gun on andys neck
i dont understand what is going on here
we dont have a diskette
you have one more chance to tell me where is diskette
since the policemen are not looking at her karen moves slowly on the floor

the policeman clicks his gun in a ready to shoot position
karen grabs the carpet with both hands and pulls it violently
the small telephone table falls on the floor but also the policeman who was ready to kill andy

the policeman who had been knocked out by karen is slowly waking up
karen sees him and yells
karen picks up a gun and points it at the policeman
andy grabs a wooden armchair and crashes it on the policemans back

close shot on the entrance of the studio where a plate says something in russian and underneath central film studio
larsens car enters the studio
it stops near the building
we see billy and larsen through the windshield
larsen shows his handcuff to billy
billy tries to get out of the car but she cant open the back door
billy gets the key out of her pocket and gives it to larsen who unlocks the handcuff
he gets out of the car and closes the door
he goes around the car to open billys door
as he is doing it he sees car headlights coming his way
dont look now but our friends are still here
they both runs toward the building
he opens a big metal door and they enter the building
this is the unused set where billy went at the beginning of the story when she found herself locked in
it has metal doors opening directly on the parking lot
billy pulls the big bolt that locks the door from the inside
then larsen puts a padlock on the bolt
i will block the other entrances
they both walk away
karens car is driving full speed toward the red square
when she takes a turn the tires are screeching on the macadam and the car zigzags a little
through the windshield we see a small roadblock with lights on it
it is not permitted to cross red square during the night
what are you doing
thats red square
the car rushes toward the roadblock
when he sees the roadblock coming toward him andy slides down under the dashboard
without even slowing down karens car smashes through the roadblock
the debris are flying around
and the car keeps on driving full speed toward red square
wartschuk and his passenger are walking on the empty yard guns in hand
voices are coming from their walkie talkie
several cars are entering the parking lot behind them
the cars stop in front of the building
men carrying machine guns are coming out of the cars
wartschuk directs the whole operation with his walkie talkie
a man tries to open the big metal door but its locked
he yells something in russian to wartschuk who answers him and points at something
apparently he tells him to go around the building because the man starts running away
just outside the parking lot karens car is coming to a stop near the entrance
we hear the russian voices in the parking lot
karen and andy get out of the car
karen walks to the entrance of the parking lot and peeks inside
andy joins her trying to make his gun work
this damn gun i cant work the safety
karen shushes him down
they both peek inside and they are surprised to see such a number of big black cars
wartschuk is giving orders through his walkie talkie
a man with a machine gun walks away from him

around the back
they run across the entrance
the men all looking toward the building dont see them
wartschuk is still giving orders
all the men with machine guns are scattering around the building
someone is calling wartschuk through his talkie
he walks away from his men
on the other side of the studio compound karen and andy are entering the place by climbing over the wall
karen is already in the place and she is helping andy to join her
for the moment he is sitting on top of the wall and he throws the two guns to her
then he goes down himself
karen holds his legs
i got you
i got you
i got you
andy falls down heavily on the ground
on a balcony on a near building a man is watching the yard with a flashlight
this is the balcony which billy fell from
andy and karen are crossing the yard trying to be as discrete as possible
wartschuk is climbing rapidly up an emergency ladder to meet the man with the flashlight
karen and andy lying low are coming slowly toward the building
wartschuk has reached the balcony where the man is watching the yard
they whisper in russian
then wartschuk goes inside actually through that same emergency door through which billy tried earlier to escape
the watcher closes the door behind him
andy and karen are still crawling slowly toward the building
on the balcony the man is smoking a cigarette
this is the set where the poor actress was murdered
larsen is trying to use a telephone on the wall
its no use
all lines are cut
billy is watching larsen
behind her we see wartschuk peeking through the half open door
where is it
billy shows him the ancient looking wardrobe under which the diskette is hidden
he bends down
then he raises and takes a piece of wood from a rack
he slides the piece of wood under the wardrobe
wartschuk enters silently on the set
larsen gets the diskette out of its hiding place
billy picks it up
behind her wartschuk has got his gun out
billy stands up with the diskette in her hand
wartschuk grabs her from the back
she throws the diskette
larsen catches it
you helped us a lot billy
larsen puts discreetly the diskette in wartschuks pocket
the reaper wants to meet the woman who has kept him up all night and witnessed a live snuff
he gives his gun to larsen
he wants you to do it
you know why we call him the reaper
you see his face you die
billy spits in larsens face
then she yells silently because wartschuk is squeezing her a little tighter
larsen wipes the spit from his face
larsen raises his gun holding it by the barrel
billy looks very frightened because she knows that larsen is going to knock her out
but the butt of the gun lands violently
on wartschuks head who screams and falls heavily on the floor
billy looks from larsen to the falling man not understanding clearly what happened
andy is hiding behind a trash can
he looks up at the watcher on the balcony
he finally comes out of his hiding place but bumps into a beer can lying on the ground
the watcher says something in russian and points his flashlight toward andy
nice night isnt it
karen is slowly going around the pile of empty film boxes on which billy fell earlier
im just taking a piss
right you know just
the watcher walks slowly down the ladder
karen reaches the ladder climbs on something we dont see and catches the watchers foot through the steps of the ladder
the man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder
he is unconscious and andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff
karen joins him
andy seems very happy about the successful operation
the reapers black limousine is entering the parking lot
karen who has started to go up the steps of the ladder looks at the limousine
who the hell is that
well whoever it is theyre coming here
they reach the balcony and enter the building
the reapers car is driving toward the building with all the men equipped with machine guns watching his arrival
karen and andy are running along the long corridor
andy is still trying to work out the safety of his gun
i cant work the safety
andy come on
yeah yeah im coming
he falls down dropping all the bullets on the floor
andy picks up his bullets stands up and runs after karen
the reapers car is still surrounded by all the guards in arms
we see only the shadow of the reaper inside his car
where is she larsen
we guess he is talking into a walkie talkie
this is the unused film set with large metal doors opening on the parking lot karen enters the gallery above the room followed by andy
she bends down and makes him bend down
the reaper voice over from the talkie larsen are you reading me
karen whispering somebodys coming
andy whispering im waiting
down below on the set itself billy is walking with larsen behind her pointing a gun in her back
larsen answering the reaper im bringing her out now
on the gallery andy is still trying to work his gun
shoot him andy
andy shoots misses larsen and hits a statue
larsen and billy try to hide from the shooter
andy shoots again and misses again
be careful of billy
karen runs along the gallery while andy shoots and misses again
and once again
then he realizes that the gun is empty and he drops it on the floor of the gallery
he runs after karen
down below larsen brings billy near the big metal door opening on the outside
he unlocks the padlock that he had put earlier on the bolt of the door
karen rushes toward them
karen yelling billy
larsen pulls the bolt open
billy is very surprised to see her sister
larsen points his gun at her and yells something in russian
karen stops running but billy makes large signs to her signs she doesnt seem to understand
karen hides and then comes out
stay where you are
karen throws a piece of metal at larsen
the piece of metal hits his hand and he drops his gun
karen yelling run billy
billy opens the big metal door
andy runs in to join karen
larsen picks up his gun and points it at billy
but billy is already out of the building
karen yelling not out there
andy grabs karen and pulls her out of larsens gun
billy runs out of the building
an army of men armed with machine guns is waiting for her
the cars drivers all switched their headlights on high beams
with all that light in front of her billy doesnt see anymore where she is going and stops running
the reaper still in his car bends down to look at her
he takes his walkie talkie
kill her larsen
larsen walks out of the building and we hear the end on the reapers sentence coming from his own walkie talkie
karen and andy rush to the window to look at what is happening on the parking lot
billy looks at the men in front of her with a frightened face
she turns around to look at larsen pointing his gun at her
then she turns back to the men in front of her and especially the reaper looking at her from his car
behind her larsen aims his gun at her
karen and andy are still looking through the window
karen yelling no
larsen closes one eye before shooting
he shoots seven times
we see the bullets going through billys body from the back and coming out through the front making red bloody spots on her white sweater
billy falls down on her stomach and remains motionless on the ground with her arms spread apart
karen still standing behind the window cant believe what she just saw
through the window we see billys body lying on the ground with all the big black cars surrounding her
through the half open door larsen shows the reaper the diskette he has found on the set
the reaper smiles
the big metal door closes as larsen goes back inside
all the men go back inside their cars
the engines start
and the cars start driving out the reapers car being the first one to go
billy is still lying motionless on the ground her blood flowing slowly on the tarmac
karen is in andys arms crying
the last cars are leaving the parking lot
andy with karen crying on his laps looks at larsen coming back in and closing the door
now please let me explain
karen yelling explain
she rushes out of andys arms and bumps violently into larsen
they both fall on the floor and larsens gun flies away from his hand
karen hits larsen very hard with both her fists
andy picks up the gun and points it at larsen
larsen pushes karen away from him
karen takes the legs of a statue and hits larsen with it
then she grabs larsen by the ears and throws him on the metal door
she turns toward andy
karen opens the door and walks out
billy still lying on the ground opens one eye and smiles
karen runs out of the building and rushes toward her sister who stands up when she sees her
karen stops and looks at her
karen sits up and raises her sweatshirt
underneath she is equipped with the special effect system she uses to pretend people are being shot
little bags full of fake blood explode one by one tearing the piece of clothing in front of them and pouring the blood through the fabric
for the spectator it does looks like bullet going through a body and blood spurting out
karen rushes to billy and hugs her
larsen is still kneeling on the floor
andy is pointing the gun at him trying to look mean which is a bit hard for him
you thought we were tourists huh
guess again pal
larsen is slowly getting up
im talking to you
he shoots the gun to the ceiling
im warning you
dont move or im gonna shoot you
he shoots at larsen who doesnt react and walks closer to him
he shoots twice more walking backward
he bumps into a prop and falls down on his back
next to wartschuk all tied up and with a large piece of tape across his mouth
wartschuk moans andy screams and gets quickly up
he rushes out of the building while larsen is trying to get over what just happened to him andy rushes out of the building and sees karen cleaning billys face
billy mouth the words im fine and shows him the special effect device on her stomach
larsen comes behind her and takes her by the shoulder saying a few words in russian
billy says something in sign language to karen
oh my god im sorry
your sister was brilliant
karen pats larsens shoulder
next time hit back
larsen throws a remote control into andys hands
this is the remote
i get it
they all laugh
larsen pats andys shoulder
billy starts talking in sign language to larsen
he turns toward karen
that was an invitation to dinner sometime
how you say
it would be a pleasure
billy mouthes the word pleasure and then makes the sign for it which is rubbing you stomach
larsen makes the same sign
then he stops and seems to think about something
i still dont understand
i dont understand why the reaper didnt take the diskette off me
the sound of a shot and a blood bag explodes under billys sweater
since she was just in front of billy her face is covered with fake blood
andy looks at them the remote control in his hand
they all look at him
a little later
andy drives his car near the entrance of the building
billy walks toward the car looking at wartschuk his mouth still gagged being forced by larsen to go inside his car
he moans incomprehensible words and seems not to want to get inside the car
andy waves to larsen
andy opens the back door of his own car to let billy inside
but she doesnt climb in still surprised by wartschuks attitude
finally larsen succeeds in putting his prisoner in the back of his car where another prisoner also gagged is already waiting certainly the man that andy had handcuffed earlier on
the emergency ladder
before climbing into the drivers seat larsen waves to billy
he makes the pleasure sign
billy waves back to him
billy looks at wartschuk inside the car
she seems worried
whats the matter
billy makes several signs
andy doesnt understand but he looks at larsen
larsen smiles back to him
karen is already seated in the car and doesnt understand the reason for the delay
guys could we get out of here please
close shot on wartschuks face who is trying to tell them something
andy eventually understand what billy is trying to tell him
it is the word he learned earlier in the restaurant
billy nods yes
larsen smiles to her and starts his car
billy slams violently on the roof of andys car
she seems frightened by something
she yells silently
billy keeps on yelling silently and moving her arms
andy is beginning to understand what she means
wartschuk looks more and more frightened
andy want to rush to larsens car but billy holds him back
andy yelling get out of the car
get out of the car
watching billy and andy larsen has suddenly a worried look on his face
he is beginning to understand that something is wrong
he gets out of his car walks a few steps and then his car explodes and he falls on the ground
andy billy and karen who is now out of her car they all look at the car burning and at the motionless larsen lying on the ground
billy looks very sad
but slowly larsen begins to move
he sits up and looks at billy
billy is crying and smiling at the same time
we get to understand she must be in love with larsen
