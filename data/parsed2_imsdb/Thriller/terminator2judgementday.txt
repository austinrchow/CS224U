a screenplay by james cameron and william wisher revised final shooting script downtown l
noon on a hot summer day
on an extreme long lens the lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity
in slow motion they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to bumper
heat ripples distort the torrent of faces
the image is surreal dreamy
and like a dream it begins very slowly to same spot as the last shot but now it is a landscape in hell
the cars are stopped in rusted rows still bumper to bumper
the skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some unimaginable force like a row of kicked down sandcastles
wind blows through the desolation keening with the sound of ten million dead souls
it scurries the ashes into drifts stark white in the moonlight against the charred rubble
los angeles july angle on a heap of fire blackened human bones
beyond the mound is a vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete
the rush hour crowd burned down in their tracks
we dissolve to a playground
where intense heat has half melted the jungle gym the blast has warped the swing set the merry go round has sagged in the firestorm
small skulls look accusingly from the ash drifts
we hear the distant echo of childrens voices
playing and laughing in the sun
a silly sing songy rhyme as we tracks slowly over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch lines are still visible
camera comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle
next to the tiny skull of its owner
hold on this image as a female voice speaks billion human lives ended on august th
the survivors of the nuclear fire called the war judgment day
they lived only to face a new nightmare the war against the machines
a metal foot crushes the skull like china
tilt up revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle
it looks like a chrome skeleton
a high tech death figure
it is the endoskeleton of a series terminator
its glowing red eyes compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain hunting
the sounds of roaring turbines
searchlights blaze down as a formation of flying hk hunter killer patrol machines passes overhead
pan with them toward the jagged horizon beyond which we see flashes and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in progress
human troops is desperate combat with the machines for possession of the dead earth
the humans are a ragtag guerrilla army
skynets weapons consist of ground hks tank like robot gun platforms flying aerial hks four legged gun pods called centurions and the humanoid terminators in various forms
beam weapons firing like searing strobe light
b a gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a law rocket at a pursuing aerial hk bringing it down in a fiery explosion
c another apc is crushed under the treads of a massive ground hk
d a team of guerrillas in a intense fire fight with terminator e endoskeletons in the ruins of a building
three terminator f endoskeletons advance firing rapidly
another complete cyborg with flesh ripped open and back broken gropes for a rifle on the ground
g a centurion overruns a human firing position
soldiers are cut down as they run
fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing machines
in a blasted gun emplacement at the edge of battle a man watches the combat with night vision binoculars
he wears the uniform of a guerrilla general and a black beret
he is still amid running shouting techs and officers
man pushing slowly in as the battle rages o
he lowers the binoculars
he is forty five years old
the left side of his face is heavily scarred
a patch covers that eye
an impressive man forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war
the name stitched on the band of his beret is connor
we push in until his eyes fill frame then
skynet the computer which controlled the machines sent two terminators back through time
their mission to destroy the leader of the human resistance
the first terminator was programmed to strike at me in the year
before john was born
the second was set to strike at john himself when he was still a child
as before the resistance was able to send a lone warrior
a protector for john
it was just a question of which one of them would reach him first
wild fingers of blue white electric arcs dance in a steel canyon formed by two tractor trailers parked side by side in the back lot of an all night truck
the strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid air and in the sudden flare of light we see a figure in a sphere of energy
then the frame whites out with an explosive thunderclap
through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly
a naked man
terminator has come through
physique massive perfect
face devoid of emotion
terminator stands and impassively surveys its surroundings
on a back route to north l
a handful of local truckers hunch over chili sizes cat hats pushed back on their heads
three bikers are playing a game of pool in the back their miller empties lining the tables rail
the dives owner lloyd a fat aging biker type in a soiled apron stands behind the bar
nothing much going on
then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in that doesnt happen every night
all eyes simultaneously swivel toward terminator
its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room
everyone frozen not sure how to react
a terminator pov
a digitized electronic scan of the room overlaid with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow
in pov we move past the staring truckers past the owner and the awestruck waitress and approach a large nasty looking biker puffing on a cigar
his body is outlined or selected and thousands of estimated measurements appear
his clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable
i need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle
the big bikers eyes narrow
he takes a long draw on this cigar the tip cherry red hot
you forgot to say please
he grinds the cigar out on terminators chest
which produces not the slight reaction of pain
terminator calmly and without expression grabs cigar by his meaty upper arm
cigar screams from the hydraulic grip
terminator doesnt see cigars friend behind him holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a louisville slugger
the heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and cracks in two across the back of terminators head
terminator seems not to notice
doesnt even blink
without releasing his grip on cigar he snaps his arm straight back and grabs pool cue by the front of his jacket
suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window
terminator hurls cigar all pounds of him clear over the bar through the serving window into the kitchen where he lands on the big flat grill
we hear a sound like sizzling bacon as cigar screams flopping jerking
he rolls off in a smoking heap
the third biker whips out a knife with a eight inch blade and slashes at terminators face
terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand
holding it by the razor sharp blade he jerks is from the guys hand
ultra fast here he flips it
grabs the handle like youre supposed to hold a knife
grabs the biker and slams him face down over the bar
then brings the knife whistling down pinning the bikers shoulder to the bar top with his own steel
the doors bangs open and terminator strides in
the mexican cook does a fast fade as terminator walks toward cigar who is cursing in pain on the floor
with his deep fried fingers he struggles to get out the
auto tucked under his leather jacket
but he cant even hold onto it
terminator takes it from him
instead of pointing it at him terminator carefully examines weapon analyzing its caliber and operating condition
terminator never threatens
thats a human thing
he just takes
cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him
he slides the keys to his bike across the floor to terminators foot
then painfully starts getting out of his jacket
terminator strides from the kitchen fully clothed now in a black leather jacket leather riding pants and heavy clean boots
he moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table
without slowing his stride he jerks the knife out
the guy slumps to the floor groaning behind him
terminator continues toward the front of the diner passing lloyd the owner
at the door he comes abreast of two truckers who sit frozen like a snapshot in mid bite
one of the truckers finally nods
terminator impassively stares back
then moves on out the door
terminator walks out surveying the parked harleys
in his belt and swings one leg over a massive custom electro glide
he slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition
kicks over the engine
it catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron into gear with a klunk
lloyd appears at the diners door with a sawed off gauge winchester lever action shotgun
he fires into the air and jacks around round in fast aiming at terminators back
i cant let you take the mans wheels son
now get off or ill put you down
terminator turns and considers by coldly
he eases the shifter up into neutral
rocks the bike onto its kickstand
swings him leg over and walks calmly toward the guy
terminator strides right up to lloyd staring straight into the shotguns muzzle
lloyd starts sweating trying to decide is hes going to kill a man in cold blood
hes still trying to decide when terminators hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun
lloyd gapes knowing hes screwed
terminator reaches toward him
and slips the sunglasses out of lloyds shirt pocket
puts them on
strides back to the harley and roars off in a shower of gravel
terminator roars down the freeway heading for l
cold neon flares across the chrome of the big bike
the gauge is jammed through the clutch and brake cables across the handlebars
the lights flow over terminators wrap around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer rounds
the first street bridge
rusting chain link fence and graffiti covered walls
black and white cruises the empty street
a tremendous blue white glare suddenly spills out between the columns of the overpass
the young uniformed cop in the car whips his head around at the source of the light
he pulls over quickly in time to see
a the powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between the columns
lightning climbs the chain link fence and light standards lighting up the night and papers swirl in a blasting whirlwind
b the cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades
he sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the strange light
he draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the shadows between the rows of pillars
a naked man glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop
nothing special about him
certainly not built like a terminator
the flash of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he just arrived from the future
his features are handsome bordering on severe
his eyes are gray ice
the cop spins at a sound
x is already on him
the blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand
low angle as the unconscious cop hits the deck his beretta mm automatic clattering next to him
a hand enters frame and picks up this pistol
c highly polished black shoes rounding the rear tire of the police cruiser
follow the shoes to the cruisers door then move up as mr
x dressed now in lapd blue climbs behind the wheel
he looks and acts exactly like a cop
cool alert confident in his power his expression emotionless and judgmental
x now officer x puts the car in gear and drives into the night
tight on young john connor who at his moment is ten years old and busy reassembling the carburetor on his honda dirtbike
he has ripped levis and long stringy hair
a sullen mouth
eyes which reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel
the ramones i wanna be sedated blasts from a boom box next to him
a woman janella voight stands in the doorway of the garage yelling over the music
get in here right now and clean up that pigsty of yours
johns friend tim a thirteen year old hispanic kid watches as john replies by turning up the volume on the boom box
janelle gives up with a slam of the houses back door
your foster parents are kinda dicks right
gimme that phillips right there
janelle storms into the room
tod voight her husband watches sports on the tv
theyre both in their thirties
middle class working stiffs
i swear ive had it with that goddamn kid
he wont even answer me
neither does he todd
are you gonna sit there or are you gonna do something
throws down the tvs remote and heads for the garage
john hops on the bike
kick starts it
tim picks up johns nylon bag then climbs on the back
todd enters and shouts over the engine which john revs louder and louder
get your ass inside right now and do what your mother says
john pins todd with a defiant glare
shes not my mother todd
he revs the engine and peels out of the garage with tim almost falling off the back
they take off down the street
john cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced in drainage canal
he guns the bike through a hole in the retaining fence
tims eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment
a in the drainage canal john zig zags along throwing up a roostertail of muddy water
tim shouts pretending he didnt just see his life flash before his eyes
he slaps john on the back
major moves homes
where is your real mom anyway
john doesnt answer she dead or something
its hard to read johns expression
she might as well be
john twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward
a sign on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads pescadero state hospital for the criminally insane
beyond it squats an imposing four story building
about as inviting as kgb headquarters
security guards patrol the manicured grass
sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall
the room is empty of all furnishings save the bed a stainless steel sink toilet and a dented metal mirror
we hear a rhythmic grunting small explosions of breath in perfectly metered time
pan to a bedframe leaned upright against the wall legs facing outward
a pair of sweaty hands grip one leg
tendons knot and release as someone does pull ups
a man of tangled hair hides the face that comes into frame dips out comes back
a woman in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the top leg of the vertical bedframe
her body is straight and taut
knees bent so the feet clear the ground
the arms are lean and muscular
the inmate face hidden pulls up dips pulls up
like a machine
no change in rhythm
figures move toward us down a corridor of polished tile and two tone walls
peter silberman a smug criminal psychologist leads a group of young interns
following laconically are three the next patient is a year old female diagnosed as acute schizo affective disorder
the usual indicators
depression anxiety violent acting out delusions of persecution
the interns nod judiciously here we are
silberman stops at one of the soundproof steel doors
there is a two way speaker beneath a tiny window
silberman flips the intercom switch
silbermans scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window
his voice comes over the tinny speaker
reverse angle as she turns slowly into close up
sarah connor is not the same woman we remember from last time
her eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered animal
defiant and intense but skittering around looking for escape at the same time
fight or flight
down one cheek is a long scar from just below the eye to her upper lip
her voice is a low and chilling monotone
good morning dr
hows the knee
silbermans smug composure drops a second
he switches off speaks to the interns she uh
stabbed me in the kneecap with a screwdriver a few weeks ago
sarah watches them talking about her through the glass but cant hear them
she feels like a lab animal
the interns look in at her through the glass as silberman talks
with her face drawn eyes haggard and hair wild she looks like she belongs where she is
the delusional architecture is interesting
she believes a machine called a terminator which looks human of course was sent back though time to kill her
and also that the father of her child was a soldier sent to protect her
he was from the future too
he smiles the year if i remember correctly
the interns chuckle lets move on shall we
as the interns walk on silberman steps close to douglas the head attendant and speaks low
douglas i dont like seeing the patients disturbing their rooms like this
see that she takes her thorazine would you
douglas is pounds and warm hearted at a rattlesnake
he nods catching silbermans meaning and gestures for the other attendants to hang back as silberman moves on in his rounds
sarah looks up as the cell door opens
douglas walks in slowly idly tapping his police baton against the door in a ominous rhythm
the other two orderlies ease in behind him
one of them carries a stun baton like a sawed off cattle prod
the other has a tray with cups of red liquid thorazine
time to take you meds connor
sarah faces him weight centered
feral eyes darting from one to the other
you take it
douglas grins casual now you know you got to be good cause you up for review this afternoon
im not taking it
now i dont want any trouble
aint no trouble at all he whips the baton in a whistling backhand which whap
takes her square in the stomach
she doubles over and drops to her knees unable to breathe
douglas tips the bed and it slams down with a crash right new to her
he takes her stun wand from the other attendant and walks forward
tight on sarah grimacing and struggling to breathe
son of a
the stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise
it drives her to the floor pinning her like a bug
little electric arcs crackle as the baton makes her writhe in pain
douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees
holds the cup of thorazine in front of her lips
last call sugar
gasping she chokes the zombie juice down
john furtively hunches before a ready teller machine at the rear of a local bank while his friend tim stands lookout
john slips a stolen atm card into the machine slot
it is something hes rigged up because trailing from the card is ribbon wire which goes to some kind of black box electronics unit hes got in his ever present
he holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a little lap top keyboard which is also connected to the black box
john enters a few commands and the plasma screen displays the pin number for that account
he quickly enters the number on the ready tellers keypad and asks it for bucks
the machine whirs then begins dispensing twenty dollar bills
tim looks back over his shoulder amazed
whered you learn all this stuff
john collects the twenties as the machine kicks them out
a cool and professional electronic age thief at ten years old
from my mom
my real mom i mean
come on baby
he grabs the last bills lets go
they sprint around the corner to an they huddle behind the building as john counts out tims share
he folds five twenties and palms them to the other kid
when john opens his wallet to put in his money tim notices a picture in a plastic sleeve
john reluctantly shows his friend the polaroid
it is a shot of sarah
pregnant in a jeep near the mexican border
john doesnt know it now but he will carry the photo with him for over years and give it to a young man named kyle reese who will travel back
in time to become his father
yes that photo
so shes pretty cool huh
actually no shes a complete psycho
thats why shes up at pescedero
she tries to blow up a computer factory but she got shot and arrested
yeah shes a total loser
cmon lets check out the eleven whatya say
john has tried to sound casual but we see in his eyes that is really hurts
he slaps tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his honda
john fires up and they whine off down the alley
close on computer terminal attached to the dash
a juvenile division file
subject john connor
below his arrest record are his vital stats
mother sarah connor
legal guardians todd and janelle voight
and below their names an address s
officer x stares at the screen for a moment
then gets out the car
tight on front door as todd voight opens it revealing the unsmiling face of officer x beyond the screen door
todd greets him with a weary sigh
are you the legal guardian of john connor
thats right officer
whats he done now
officer x ignores the question
he casually scans the living room
could i speak with him please
todd shrugs showing the cop hes past his patience with the boy
well you could if he was here
be he took off on his bike this morning
could be anywhere
you gonna tell me what his is about
i just need to ask him a few questions
janelle appears in the doorway behind todd concerned
there was a guy here this morning asking about him too
yeah big guy
on a bike
has that got something to do with it
officer x registers the significance of that
he realizes who the big guy must be
reassuringly shakes his head no
i wouldnt worry
do you have a photograph of john
todd stares unhappily at the cop
turns to janelle
get the album janelle
angle through an alley from the main street
we see john and tim flash by on the honda a block away
hold a beat
a big chrome wheel enters frame
boom up a leather clad leg to terminators implacable face
it surveys the area slowly as the bike idles then kicks it into gear and moves on scanning in a slow shark like manner not aware that it missed its
prey by seconds
close on sarah
she is shackled hands and feet to the bed
sunlight falls across her pale face
a hand enter frame gently stroking her cheek
she wakes up to see kyle reese
sitting on the edge of her bed looking exactly the same as we last saw him in
scruffy blonde hair and a long raincoat
he gives her a gentle smile
this is a dream sarah
make me take this stuff
he puts a finger to her lips
then silently unfastens her restraints
they gaze into each others eyes
and in the look that his death and the horror she has been through since hasnt touched their love at all
she melts into reeses arms
pulls him to her
i love you
i always will
i need you so much
she kisses him passionately
they are locked together in a timeless moment
push in tight on sarah as she buries her face in his shoulder
she shuts her eyes tight
stay on sarah as reese speaks
he voice is strangely cold
wheres john sarah
sarah opens her eyes and he is no longer in her arms
he is standing across the room
pinning her with an accusing gaze
they took him from me
its john whos the target now
you have to protect him
hes wide open
dont quit sarah
our son need you
struggling not to cry i know but im not as strong as im supposed to be
i cant do it
im screwing up the mission
remember the message
the future is not set
there is not fate but what we make for ourselves
he turns toward the door
kyle dont go
turning back to her theres not much time left in the world sarah
reese goes out the door
sarah jumps from the bed frantic
yanks the door open
follow her out
sarah staggers from her cell
reese is already impossibly a hundred feet away striding down the dim corridor
a silhouette in a long coat disappearing around a corner
sarah runs after him her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum
her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream runs along the seemingly infinite corridor
she reaches the corner slides around it and
a slams right into the arms of douglas and his three helpers
they grab her as she struggles and screams
the silberman is there smiling soothingly
they force her down and she is pinned to the floor screaming
a new figure approaches
one even more menacing
terminator walks toward her with heavy measured steps
backlit eyes concealed by the sunglasses it stands over her like the angel of death itself
it reaches down and
takes her hand
lifts her up
leads her to a door
they go through together
b a beautiful sunlight morning
children are playing nearby
sliding down slides clambering through a jungle gym
sarah knows this dream know
its is the worst of all her nightmares
she starts to scream but no sound comes out
c the sky explodes into white light
everything is seared by the unholy glare hotter than a thousand suns
the children ignite like match heads
sarah is burning screaming silently everything silent and overexposed
terminators flesh and clothing are burning silently
it grips her hand virgil to her dante in this tour of the nuclear age inferno
d the blast wave hits
a near solid wall of compressed air followed by mph winds
the children charcoal statues frozen in positions of play explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away
sound hit now with a thunderous roar
sarahs scream merges with the howl of the wind as the blast hits her exploding the flesh from her bones
beside her terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh becoming a smoking skeleton of steel
e then she wake up
in her cell shackled to the bed
sunlight hurts her eyes
she looks desperate and defeated
she knows the war is coming
it visits her every time she closes her eyes
lost and alone sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity
tight on video screen playing a previously recorded session
sarah is in a strait jacket talking softly
like a giant strobe light burning right through my eyes
but somehow i can still see
look you know the dreams the same every night why do i have to please continue
a the real sarah dispassionately watches herself on the screen
her expression is controlled
silberman watches her watching
they are in a brightly lit interview room
two attendants stands nearby
the children look like burnt paper
black not moving
then the blast wave hits them and they fly apart like leaves
video sarah cant go on
real sarah watches herself cry on tape her expression cold
we hear silberman speak on the tape
dreams about cataclysm or the end of the world are very common sarah
video sarah cuts him off her mood shifting to sudden rage
its not just a dream
its real you moron
i know the date is happens
im sure it feels very real to you on august th its going to feel pretty fucking real to you too
anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day get it
relax now sarah you think youre alive and safe but youre already dead
everybody you him
she gestures are the attendant everybody
youre all fucking dead
she is raving half out of her chair
the orderly moves to inject her with something
youre the one living in a dream silberman not me
because i know it happens
c silberman pauses the tape
freezing sarahs contorted face
real sarah turns away from the screen he expression stony
i was afraid
i feel much better now
silberman gives a calculated paternal smile
your attitude have been very positive lately
sarah looks up at him
her voice is hopeful
it has helped me a lot to have a goal something to look forward to
and what it that
as she answers we pull back revealing that we have been looking through a one way mirror from an adjacent observation room
in the shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the earlier rounds and a couple of staff psychologists
they smoke and make the occasional note
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months
well its been six months and i was looking forward to seeing my son
lets go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines
now you think they dont exist
close on sarah
her voice sounds hollow
they dont exist
i see that now
silberman leans back studying her
toying with her
but youve told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press
if i had there would have been some evidence
they would have found something at the factory
so you dont believe anymore that the company covered it up
sarah shakes her head no
the corporate headquarters of a mega electronic corporation
as imposing cubist castle of black glass
the elevator doors slide open with a whisper and miles dyson strides out
in his early thirties
the star of the special projects division
hes brilliant aggressive driven
dyson walks down the corridor swinging his arms
a man in a hurry
a man with much to do
he reaches a solid security door and zips his electronic key card through the scanner
the door unlocks with a clunk
the sign next to the door reads special projects division he nods to the guards as he passes through the security checkpoint
they can see all activities on the floor on their bank of monitors
he unlocks another service door with his card and enters the lab is quite large comprising banks of processors disk drives test bays prototype assembly areas
extremely high tech
he is jokingly saluted by fellow members
not a lab coat in sight
this is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd
all young and bright
they sit at their consoles drinking coke and changing technology as we know it
a young lab assistant rushes over to dyson
name tag says hes bryant
the material teams wants to run another test on the uh
ill get it
dyson produces an unusual looking key from his pocket as they stride through the lab
bryant has to hustle to keep up
dyson i know i havent been here that long but i was wondering if you could tell me
i mean if you know
where it came from
i asked them that question once
know what they told me
dyson enters with bryant
dyson and a guard stand together before what looks like a high tech bank vault
it requires two keys to open like the launch controls in a nuclear silo
the guard and dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously
dyson then enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a sequence of clunks
the door swings open and dyson enters
bryant stays outside with the guard who notes dysons name and item on a clipboard
dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it
inside is a small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas
it a ceramic rectangle about the size of a domino the color of liver
it has been shattered painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal frame
dyson removes the artifact it its insert gas and sets it on a specially designed cart
he handles it like the turin shroud
dyson closes the cabinet
turns to the one next to it
opens its door
in this cabinet is a larger object
an intricate metal hand at the elbow the metal is twisted and crushed
but the forearm and hand are intact
its metal surface scorched and discolored it stands upright in a vacuum flask as if saluting
this is all that remains of the terminator sarah destroyed
dyson stares at it lost in thought
the he closes the cabinet blacking out frame
we can see through the one way mirror into the interview room where sarah is still talking with silberman
the other psychologists are still watching through the mirror
reviewing sarahs condition
so what do you think doctor
ive shown a lot of improvement havent i
you see sarah
heres the problem
i know how smart you are and i think youre just telling me what i want to hear
i dont think you really believe who youve been telling me today
we go tight on sarahs reaction
and we see that silberman is right
she was playing him and it didnt work
and she knows shes fucked
her tone becomes quite pleading
you have to let me see my son
its very important
hes in danger
at least let me call him silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze
im afraid not
not for a while
i dont see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here another six months
sarahs eyes turn cold and lethal in one second
she knows shes lost
she knows this guy is just playing with her and she silberman jumps back and the attendants dive on her
she is writhing and twisting like a bobcat
silberman whips open a drawer and pulls out a syringe
he jabs it into her and she yells goddammit
let me go
you dont know what youre doing
you hear me
silberman signals and the attendants drag her out
he looks at the doctors behind the glass
officer x has stopped two young girls in front of a eleven
he is leaning out the cruiser window and showing them the picture of john
the first girl nods
yeah he was here about fifteen minutes ago
i think he said he was going to the galleria
the second girl points toward a massive complex visible about the houses several blocks away
officer x stares at it
terminator cruises slowly on the bike
he crosses an overpass above a drainage canal and whips his head around at the sound of a dirt bike engine
b terminator wheel the harley around cutting onto a street which runs parallel to the canal
terminator hauls ass at keep john in sight
he catches glimpses of the kid through trees and houses
catches one last glimpse of him heading into the parking lot of a large shopping mall
john works his way through a crowded video arcade
sees some guys he knows
stops to talk striking a pose
mall rats in the element
we dont hear the dialogue
terminators idling harley shakes the parking garage walls
he stops at a row of bikes near the escalators
johns little honda sits proudly with the big street bikes
officer x is moving through the flow of shoppers
the place is a zoo
he stops some kids and shows them the picture
a in a crowded video arcade john is lost in an intense battle going for a new high score at missile command
he parries deftly at the enemy icbms deploy their mirvs
the warheads stream down
its more than he can deal with
the world gets nuked
he slouches away from the game looking for another
rack focus to officer x passing the entrance of the store behind him
the cop moves on down the concourse out of sight
john gets in an afterburner simulator game
b on terminator walking through the crowd in slow motion
he moves with methodical purpose knowing the target is close
we see that he is incredibly carrying a box of long stem roses
like some hopeful guy with a hot date
c the cop is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the multi cinema
he walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized combat
cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise
d john is shooting down migs at mach
his friend tim slides up next to him
taps him on the shoulder trying to play it cool
some cop is scoping for you dude
john looks around the corner of the afterburner ride
sees the cop showing a picture to some of the kids
the kids point his way
john ducks just as the cop glances over
he slinks out the other side of the ride and heads for the back of the store instinctively retreating
sarah has taught him that cops are bad news
the cop scans the crowded arcade
glimpses john looking back as he moves around a row of machines
starts toward him
john sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast
the cop is shoving through clots of kids
one of them is slammed to the floor
as eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed
john breaks into run
so does the cop
kids scatter like ten pins as the cop charges after john
john sprints through the arcades back officer and store rooms
john emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects to the parking garage
hes running full out when around the corner ahead of him comes
time stretches to nightmarish crawl as john tries to brake to a stop
terminator reaches into the box of roses
the cold back steel of the shotgun emerges at the box falls open the roses spilling to the floor
terminators boot crushes the flowers as it moves forward
john transfixed by terror is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor
the shotgun comes up
terminator expressionlessly strides forward
jacks a round into the chamber slow and fluid
john looks behind him for a place to run
sees the cop coming toward him pulling his beretta pistol
incredibly john realizes the cop is aiming his gun at him
john looks back at terminator
he is starting into the black muzzle of the gauge now
aimed right at his head
he realizes hes screwed
then something crazy happens
john instinctively ducks
terminator pulls the trigger
the cop catches the shotguns blast square in the chest just as he fires the pistol
the pistols shot goes wild
terminator pumps another round into him
advancing a step each time he fires he empties the shotgun into the cop blowing his backward down the corridor
the sound is deafening
the cop lies still on his back
a terminator is now standing right over john
they both watch as the cop incredibly sits up unharmed and gets to his feet
terminator grabs john roughly by his jacket
clutches the kid to his chest then spins around at the cop opens fire with the beretta
b the cop who not only isnt a cop he clearly isnt even human pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine pistol
on terminators back as the mm slugs slam into it punching bloody holes in the motorcycle jacket
john is bug eyed with fear but completely unscratched
terminators body has blocked the bullets
the beretta clacks empty
terminator turns at the sound
shoves john behind a coke machine
drops the empty shotgun
starts walking toward the cop
the empty magazine clatters to the floor
the cop inserts another one
snaps back the slide
terminator still has twenty feet to go
he doesnt break his purposeful stride
the cop opens fire
bullets rake terminators chest
he doesnt even flinch
ten feet to go
blam blam blam blam
neither the cop nor terminator show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips terminators wardrobe to shreds
the pistol empties again
terminator stops two feet in front of the cop
the appraise each other for a second
we realize now that the cop is a terminator too
we dont know the details yet but lets call him the t since thats what he is
a newer model than the one weve come to know so well the series arnold
this guys a prototype
and hes got quite a few surprises
t and terminator size each other up
terminator moves first
he grabs t in his massive hands but the t snaps back with a counter grip
after about two seconds of intense slamming the walls on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in and the two battling machines have blasted through the
wall and disappeared
john totally stunned by all this remembers to move
he staggers to his feet
stumble runs toward the parking garage
c third level concourse
a plate glass window explodes and terminator crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd
d t turns without a word and heads back through the store after john accelerating slowly into a loping predatory run
e terminator is totally still
a japanese tourist cautiously steps forward and takes a picture of the body
suddenly terminators eyes snap open
the stunned tourist backs away
he sits up and looks around
gets his bearings
rises smoothly to his feet
all servos seem to be working fine
the tourists camera whirs as the motor drive runs on by itself taking shot after show
the owner isnt even looking through the eyepiece hes so shocked
john is frantically pumping the kick start of his bike scared shitless and the damned thing wont start
his hands are shaking so badly he cant find the choke
he looks up to see the t running down the corridor toward him
john fumbles with the choke
the bike catches
he slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage
john looks back
the t is behind him running
he twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward
incredibly the t is gaining
this nightmare isnt happening
john races out the exit ramp and charges right into the street
john shoots into the busy traffic
cuts off a big rig tow truck
the driver swears
hits his air horn
what the driver doesnt see is the cop running faster than o
simpson at the airport who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck
a in the truck
the driver hears a thump as something slams against his door then feels himself pulled right out
t slides in and takes his place
the truck is still rolling along about mph
t accelerates after john without missing a beat
it can see him up ahead weaving through traffic
b out of the garage entrance terminator roars onto the street on the harley
he accelerates after the others
john slides his bike down the service ramp faster than hes ever done it before
he races along the bottom of the canal turning into a narrower tributary which has vertical sides
he looks back
no sign of pursuit
a suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow
the kenworth tow truck
big as a house all chrome and roaring diesel engine
crashes through the fence and launches itself right into the center of the canal
it crashes down feet to the ground going about hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal
it ricochets back and forth between the walls then bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus it just keep on plowing forward gathering speed
b john looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike has
the kenworth is all muscle tearing along the canal like a train in a tunnel
its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray backlit in the setting sun
it looks like some kind of demon
c above them on the service road running parallel terminator is fighting to overtake them
he looks down and sees john with the tow truck from hell catching up to him
it is only about twenty feet behind him and still gaining
d angle in the canal looking back past a desperate john at the wall of metal filling frame behind him
e above terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left leaving the road
hitting an earth embankment just right he jumps the bike into the air like steve mcqueen in the great escape and vaults the fence bordering the canal
it slams down at the edge of the canal and tears along inches from the drop off on a dirt path accelerating past the truck in the canal below
f john hits some water and slews momentarily loosing speed
the massive push plate on the front of the truck slams into his back fender
panicked he pulls a little ahead
all this is happening at about sixty miles and hour
top speed for the little dirt bike
g slow motion as terminator jumps the bike again
this time the pound harley sails out into space and drops into the canal
it arcs down between the truck and john hitting on its wheels
it bottoms out an explosion of sparks under the frame
only the ultra fast reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright
terminator fights for control
h he guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside johns tiny honda
terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him onto the harley in front of him
johns honda weaves and falls smashing instantly under thundering tires
the harley roars ahead
it hits eighty
ahead is an overpass and supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two channels
the harley thunders into one channel which is essentially a short tunnel
i the truck cant fit on either side
neither can it stop at that speed
tires locked it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into the concrete abutment at seventy
j terminator and john emerge from the tunnel looking back to see a fireball blasting through behind them as the trucks side tanks explode
terminator stops the harley
john peers around his body to see the destruction
a burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in the mud
terminator revs the bike and they roar away down the canal disappearing around a bend
k angle on the fire as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass
smoke boils from the tunnel as well and inside it is a solid wall of flame
a figure appears in the fire
just an outline
the figure emerges from the flames
it is human shaped but far from human
a smooth chrome man
not a servo mechanism like terminator is underneath with its complex hydraulics and cables
this thing is a featureless liquid chrome surface bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks
it reminds us of mercury
a mercury man
its face is simple unformed
unruffled by thousand degree heat it walks toward us
with each step detail returns
first the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface then finer details
buttons facial features ears
k but its still al chrome
with its last step the color returns to everything
it is the cop again
handsome young face blond hair mustache
it stops and looks around
it is a perfect chameleon
a liquid metal robot
a killing machine with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society
l angle nearby as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up
t climbs out of the canal behind them
more cops arrive
t blends in perfectly
there are always cops at diasters and scenes of violence
we now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so perfect
it walks among the other cops unnoticed
gets into one of the squad cars
starts it and drives away
terminator with john in front of him on the harley roars down the empty street
john cranes his neck around to get a look at the person thing he is riding with
the image is strangely reminiscent of father son out for an evening ride
john is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and hes just a ten year kid but hes also john connor who will someday rise to greatness
and we see a bit of that in him even know
stop the bike
terminator immediately complies
he leans the bike into a turn
they head into a nearby alley
terminator and john rolls into the alley and come to a stop
john slides off the gas tank
terminator impassively stares at him
john checks him out
now dont take this the wrong way but you are a terminator right
cyberdyne systems model
john touches terminators skin
then the blood on his jacket
his mind overloads as the reality of it hits him
youre really real
stepping back youre uh
like a machine underneath right
but sort of alive outside
im a cybernetic organism
living tissue over a metal endoskeleton
this in intense
get a grip john
youre not here to kill me
i figured that part out for myself
so whats the deal
my mission is to protect you
who sent you
thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here in this time
john gives him an amazed look
this is deep
john and terminator on the bike again weaving through the side streets
they blend into the evening traffic
in the darkness terminators wounds are not readily visible
john cranes his head up and back
so this other guy
hes a terminator too right like you
not like me
a mimetic polyalloy
what does that mean
you are targeted for termination
the t will not stop until it complete its mission
john mulls that over
where we going
we have to leave the city immediately
and avoid the authorities
can i stop by my house
the t will definitely try to reacquire you there
john is quickly going through his pockets for change
he has plenty of bills but no quarters
look todd and janelle are dicks but i gotta warn them
you got a quarter
terminator reaches past john and smashes the cover plate off the phones cash box with the heel of his hand
a shower of change tumbles out
terminator hands one to john
janelle voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife
she answers sweetly
filtered through phone janelle
in the backyard johns german shepherd is going bonkers barking at something
where are you honey
you should come home dear
im making a casserole
at the payphone
john listens an odd look on his face
he covers the phones mouthpiece and turns to terminator
whispering somethings wrong
shes never this nice
in the voights kitchen
todd comes through the kitchens back door
just home from work
he ignores janelle and opens the fridge
grabs a carton of milk
takes a sip
frowns at the dogs barking
what the hells the goddamn dog barking at
tight on janelle as todd growls around the kitchen behind her
he passes out of frame next to her
janelle switches the phone to her other hand then
her free hand seems to do something out of frame
there is a gurgling and the sound of liquid dribbling onto the floor
dont go away
well find out what happened in a moment the dogs really barking
maybe its already there
what should i do
terminator takes the phone from johns hand
janelles voice is floating through the receiver
john are you okay
terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of johns voice
in johns voice im right here
to john a whisper whats the dogs name
speaks into the phone
hey janelle whats wrong with wolfy
i can hear him barking
is he okay
filtered wolfys fine honey
where are you
terminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone
turns to john
your foster parents are dead
terminator heads for the bike
john shocked stares after him
janelle hangs up the phone
her expression is neutral
pan over along her arm which is stretched out straight from the shoulder
partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into something else
a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword like spike
now we see todd voight pinned to a kitchen cabinet by the spike which has punched through his milk carton through his mouth and exits the back of his head
into the cabinet door
his eyes are glassy and lifeless
the spike is withdrawn swiishhtt
so rapidly todd is actually standing there a second before he slumps out of sight
a janelle doesnt bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and color transforming back into a hand and then
b janelle changes rapidly into the cop we now know as the t
the change has liquid quality
t opens the back door
t approaches the big german shepherd which slinks away from it barking in fear
t walk right into close up
reaches down out of frame
we hear that sickening thunk followed by a shrill yelp
then t s hand snaps up into frame holding a bloody dog collar
the tag reads max
t nods thoughtfully
heads back to the house
off a quiet street
terminator stands near the harley watching john pace before him
johns brain is calling time out
this is all too weird
i need a minute here okay
youre telling me it can imitate anything it touches
anything it samples by physical contact
john thinks about that trying to grasp their opponents parameters
like it could disguise itself as anything
a pack of cigarettes
only an object of equal size
johns still reeling from meeting one terminator which now seems downright conventional next to the exotic new model
well why doesnt become a bomb or something to get me
it cant form complex machines
guns and explosives have chemicals moving parts
it doesnt work that way
but it can form solid metal shapes
t walks down the dark hall
it passes the bathroom and we see the real janelles legs through the half open door
the shower is running
her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor
a in johns bedroom the t begins searching methodically in the dark
calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that could lead it to its target
t finds a box of audio cassettes marked messages from mom
in it are some letters and envelopes filled with snapshots
it begins looking through some of the photos
shot of john and sarah during the missing years
sarah in olive cammos with an rpg grenade launcher teaching john how to aim
sarah with a group of military clad guatemalan men standing next to cases of stinger missiles
john and sarah in a contra camp deep in the mountains
john is now sitting on the curb lost in stunned thought
terminator stands above him watching the street like a doberman
he glances down at john
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua
places like that
for a while she was with this crazy ex green beret guy running guns
then there were some other guys
shed shack up with anybody she could learn from
so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader
then she gets busted and its like
sorry kid your moms a psycho
didnt you know
everything id been brought up to believe was just made up fantasy right
i hated her for that
he looks up but everything she said was true
he stands we gotta get her out of there
the t s highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her
and what happens to her
terminators reply is matter of fact
typically the subject being copied is terminated
why didnt you tell me
we gotta right now
she is not a mission priority
yeah well fuck you shes a priority to me
john strides away
terminator goes after him and grabs him arm
john struggles against the grip
which doesnt do him much good
whats your problem
starts dragging john back to the bike
john spots a couple of collage age slab o meat jock types across the street and starts yelling to them
im being kidnapped
get this psycho off of me
the two jocks start toward him
john yells in outrage to terminator
let go of me
to his surprise terminators hand opens so fast john falls right on his butt
he looks up at the open hand
whyd you do that
you told me to
john stares at him in amazement as he realizes
you have to do what i say
that is one of my mission parameters
stand on one foot
terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg
hes the first on his block
my own terminator
this is great
the two guys get there and look at terminator standing there calmly with one leg up in the air
this big guy in black leather and dark glasses standing like a statue
john turns to him
no longer needing to be rescued
take a hike bozo
fuck you you little dipshit
did you say dipshit
to terminator grab this guy
terminator complies instantly hoisting him one handed by the collar
the guys legs are pinwheeling
now whos the dipshit you jock douchebag
immediately things get out of hand
the guys friend jumps behind terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car grabs the second by
the hair whips out his
in a quick blur and aims the muzzle at the guys forehead
john grabs terminators arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger johns weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches
the guy flinches stunned by the k boom next to his ear
he stares shocked
john is freaking out too
he screams at terminator
put the gun down
terminator sets the
on the sidewalk
john scoops it up fast then turns to the shocked civilians who cant believe what just happened
john grabs terminator by the arm and tugs him toward the bike
john still holds the gun reluctant to give it back
you were gonna kill that guy
im a terminator
john stares at him
having your own terminator just became a little bit less fun to him
listen to me very carefully okay
youre not a terminator any more
you got that
you cant just go around killing people
whattaya mean why
cause you cant
you just cant okay
trust me on this
terminator doesnt get it
john just stares at him
frightened at what just almost happened
he gets a glimpse of the responsibility that comes with power
finally he hands the
back to terminator who puts it away
look im gonna go get my mom
you wanna come along thats fine with me
t finds an envelope
a letter from sarah to john sent since shes been at pescadero state hospital
it reads the return address on the envelope
it has what it needs
it picks up a tape player and the battered shoebox full of sarahs tapes and exits
close on a black white photograph
the image is a nightmare from the past
it is a surveillance camera still frame from the l
police station where the first terminator made such an impression in
we see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency lights of a burning corridor
a black clad figure stands at the end of the corridor
the guy has short cropped hair and dark glasses
an ar assault rifle in one hand and a gauge in the other holding them both like toy pistols
another photo is slapped on top of the first
another still frame blow up is placed over the last
terminator looms in closeup
these were taken at the west highland police station in
you were there
were in the photos are lying on the table in front of sarah placed there by detective weathersby
his partner det
mossberg and dr
silberman sit at the table as well
two uniformed cops plus douglas stand by the door
sarah stares listlessly at the top photo
shes withdrawn haggard
he killed seventeen police officers that night
weathersby slaps another black and white eight by ten on the table
a closeup of terminator taken by the japanese tourist at the mall
its the same face
this one was taken by a japanese tourist today
sarah doesnt react
its hard to tell shes thinking
whether shes up hope or is just in a drugged stupor
connor youve been told that your sons missing
his foster parents have been murdered and we know this guys involved
talk to us
dont you care
sarah stares up at him
a cold and empty stare
he glances at silberman
then at his partner
were wasting out time
one of the uniformed cops opens the door and mossberg strides into the hall
weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out with silberman right behind
tight on sarah slumped under the bright lights
totally out of it
then we see her hand creeping along the edge of the table toward the stack of photos
she slips off the paper clip binding the stills together and hides it between her fingers
douglas jerks her up by the arms and leads her out
douglas inches up the last of sarahs restraints
then her leans over her
even wrecked as she is we see the beauty in her face
he bends down
we think hes going to kiss her
instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would
she seems not to even see him
her dull eyes past him
he cant provoke a reaction
even here strapped down the two of them alone she give him no superiority
he smirks and leaves
we hear the sound of his night stick tapping its way down the corridor growing fainter
sarahs eyes snap suddenly alert
there is intensity and resolve in them
she slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire
with slow painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the restraints that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides
terminator and john charge through the night on the harley
streetlights flare past them like comets
two serious guys with a mission
one a ten year old kid the other a half man half machine cyborg from the post apocalyptic future
tight on restraint lock as it unlatches
successfully picked by sarahs paper clip
this is not an easy thing to do
but sarah taught herself a lot of things in her years of hiding
sarah her hands free sits up and releases the velcro straps on her feet
she rolls off the bed and we see her in a whole new light
she is totally alert almost feral in her movements
a bored security guard glances up as an lapd black and white pulls up
he raises the barricade and nods at the t cop as it passes
the cruiser pulls in next to the other police vehicles
the t walks toward the main entrance
sarah is using the paper clip on the door lock
she hears an echoing tapping sound
its getting louder coming her way
she goes back to work on the lock
in the corridor
douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along the wall like he does every night on his rounds
he shines a little mag light in the windows of the cells as he passes barely slowing
a he rounds the corner
his footsteps echo in the dark hallway
the tip of the stick hits the wall
tap tap tap
getting closer to sarahs cell
he stops at the door
he is about to shine his light in when he notices that a utility closet across the hall is open
he goes to shut it absently flicking his light into the dark closet
he notices something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies
a mop lies on the floor with its handle snapped off about halfway up
the other half is missing
douglas ponders this for half a second then hears a sound behind him and spins around
the sound he heard was sarahs cell door
the missing two feet of mop handle fill his vision as it cracks viciously across the bridge of his nose
pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement
sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his head bouncing him off the linoleum
lights out douglas
she drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys
then swaps her mop handle for his nice heavy night stick
b sarah moves down the dark corridor cat stepping in her bare feet
she holds the baton like a pro laid back along the forearm police style
she looks dangerous
a long corridor ends at a reception area which is closed and a night receiving desk which is a glass window where they can buzz you in through a heavy
a night nurse types at a desk nearby
she looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop t walking toward her
you have a sarah connor here
she assumes hes with the other cops
running late arent you
she turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees silberman and the cops coming toward the door from the other side
your friends are on their way out now
when she turns back to the window t s no longer there
she goes to the counter and leans out to see if hes at the drinking fountain or someplace
reception is empty
and so is the long corridor beyond
a silberman comes through the solenoid door with mossberg and weathersby the two uniformed cops and the hospital security guard
the guard retrieves his mm pistol from a lock out box behind the night desk
silberman faces him
lewis see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night
the security guard nods
silberman goes back into the secure area of the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main doors
no sign of t
mossberg and the other cops exit and the guard locks the door behind them
b the guard walks slowly back along the long corridor
the hall is dark with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary
his footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor
his keys jingle
c angle on floor as the guards feet pass through frame
an instant later the floor starts to move
it shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass still retaining the two tone checkerboard of the tile
it hunches up silently into a quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard
d up ahead we hear typing
the night nurse has her back to us working
the guard stops as the drinking fountain
bends to take a sip
behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure
it loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes
t s mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor
the guard walked over the t and his structure was sampled that instant
now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard
the t guards feet are the last to form the last of the liquid floor pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes
the shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the t guard takes its first step
e the real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see
he has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that
then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and inexplicably points his right index finger directly at the real guards face about a foot away
in a split second the finger spears out elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto slamming into the guards eye
it punches into the corner of the eye past the eyeball like a trans orbital lobotomy tool and emerges from the back of the guards skull
life quietly empties from the guards face
he is dead weight hanging from the rod finger with suddenly reacts sssnick
as the guard slumps the t takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him like its carrying a suit on a hanger back toward the night desk
the wounds are so tiny no blood drips onto the floor
f on the night nurse glancing up as the t guard walks past dragging something casually which she cant see because its below the countertop
whatcha got lewis
just some trash
she nods uninterested
t moves past dragging the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night receiving station
t guard removes the browning high power pistol and the keys from the real guards belt then stuffs the body into the utility closet
t guard comes back out and glances at the nurse
she glances toward it
sees the beretta in its holster
gotta check the gun first lewis
t opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as it mimes putting the gun in
h close angle on t s chest from inside the locker
instead of setting the gun in the locker it inserts the pistol into it own chest where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of hot fudge
it withdraws its hand
the chest is once again a surface that looks like cloth buttons name tag etc
youd ever guess it was really an intelligent liquid metal
t slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button unlocking the door with a buzz clack
t guard goes through
a small room before a short sally port corridor designed to prevent violent inmates from making a run for it
there are doors at each end
the first one is barred like a jail cell door and the second is a steel fire door
the attendants have a video monitor with which they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors
the two bored attendants barely notice the t guard as it approaches
looks briefly at a chart next to the door seeing sarah connor is in
a in the isolation ward the t passes a nurses station which looks a cage walled in by heavy metal mesh
silberman leaning in the open doorway is talking to an attendant in the cage
he doesnt glance twice at lewis the guard passing by
sarah moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor hears footsteps coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with douglas master key
a she slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass
we glimpse the t guard pass the window
she waits as the footsteps fade away
she looks over
a female inmate strapped to a bed watches her with bird like eyes
she puts a finger to her lips sshhh
the inmate nods
b pov moving toward nurses station
we hear silbermans voice reviewing medication with the night attendant
on silberman yawning looking at his watch
he turns to go
sarah is there
she slams into him hurling him through the door into the cage and follows him in
the orderly jumps up going for his stunner but she nails him with douglas baton
whap whap whap
you can barely see the thing shes swinging it so fast
the guys goes down
silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his arm
he cries out and grabs his wrist
she grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton
his legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk
she pins him with one hand
he face is full of outraged disbelief
you broke my arm
theres bones in the human body motherfucker
now dont move
b moving rapidly she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a syringe
they keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients
she jams it into the orderlys butt and fires the whole shot
still holding the empty syringe she sees what she need next
they keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from drinking drano
she grabs a plastic jug of liquid plumr and slams it down on the desk inches from silbermans eyes
she jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug
draws back the plunger
the syringe fills with blue liquid
she whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into silbermans neck
his horrified eyes rack toward it
ccs of blue death fill the cylinder
her thumb hovers over the plunger
she jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him then hauls him through the door
in the corridor outside cell the t stops and looks in the window
douglas his face a bloody mess yells to be heard
open the door
the goddamn bitch is loose in the halls
to douglas amazement lewis the guard turns impassively and walks away leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window
terminator and john are approaching the guard gate on the harley
they can see the guard inside looks up at the sound of the engine
now remember youre not gonna kill anyone right
john looks at him
hes not convinced
just say i swear i wont kill anyone
john holds his hand up like hes being sworn in
terminator stares at john a beat
then mimics the gesture
i swear i will not kill anyone
terminator stops the bike and gets off
the guard sensing trouble has his gun drawn as he comes out of the shack
terminator walks toward him drawing his
he shoots the guard accurately in the thigh
the guy drops screaming and clutching his leg
terminator kicks the guards gun away then smashes the phone in the shack with his fist
he pushes the button to raise the gate and walks back to the bike
terminator climbs onto the bike
they drive toward the hospital heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area
the attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the monitor as someone enters the corridor
they see sarah holding silberman at syringe point
sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall
her voice comes through the speaker
open it or hell be dead before he hits the floor
the attendants adrenaline levels just went off the scale
the first attendant shakes him head no
the amperage here is really high
the second attendant keys the intercom switch
theres no way connor
let him go
silbermans face is the color of suet
it wont work sarah
youre no killer
i dont believe youd do it
her voice is a deadly cold hiss
youre already dead silberman
everybody here dies
you know i believe that
so dont fuck with me
open the goddamn door
the attendants looks at one another
one of them hits the solenoid button
the far door unlocks
a in the lockout corridor
sarah pushes silberman ahead of her
the nearer barred door must be unlocked manually
one of the attendants cautiously approaches
nervously unlocks it
she faces both of them
down on the floor
she comes through with silberman giving them a wide berth
starts backing down the hall away from them still holding her hostage
shes actually pulling this off
b angle from behind her
what we can see but she cant see it a third orderly waiting just around the corner
hes poised ready to jump her when she comes abreast of him
on sarah backing up
she reaches the corner
the third attendant lunges grabbing her syringe hand
sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the nightstick
he loses interest fast dropping to his knees and gagging
silberman pulls away screaming at the top of his lungs get her
they scramble up as sarah takes off like a shot around the corner
one of them hits the panic button and alarms begin to sound
in the isolation ward the t is looking in at a very stoned attendant inside the nurses station when the alarms shriek through the halls
it reaches into its chest and pulls out the mm pistol
heads for the security entrance
in another corridor in the maze of the vast hospital sarah flies past us her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles
the orderlies charge after her
shes like an animal in a maze
she turns the corner glancing off the wall and sprints on without slowing
she reaches a steel door
footsteps like a drum solo behind her
she fumbles with douglas keys breathing hard
jams the master in
the orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt
sarah gets the door open
she turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch on the other side
hes too late
sarah sees them beyond the window fumbling with their keys
a sarah is in another sally port corridor
a jail cell type barred door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond
she sprints to the walls of bars jams her key into the door
she unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked
she flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her
she slams the bars shut
her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her
the orderly is racing at her white lipped with rage
she reaches back through the bars turns the key and purposefully snaps it off in the lock
an instant later the big orderly slams against the door grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach
he lunges against the steel bars unbelievably pissed off
sarah takes off running looking back at the frustrated orderlies
theyre shouting at each other unable to fit their keys into the lock the broken off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in
silberman shouts at them
go around goddamnit
the orderlies run back the way they came and along a cross corridor to another set of doors
b on sarah as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead
now shes home free
at a full tilt sprint shes nearly there when the elevator doors part
terminator steps out
his head swivels to face her
sarah reacts stricken by the image from her worst nightmares
her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward
her bare feet slip on the slick tile
she slams to the floor staring up at the leather clad figure with the shotgun
she loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity
shes not even aware that she is screaming or what would be screaming if she could get the breath to do it
in slowed down dream time sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall
she runs like the wind like in her nightmare
if she looked back she would have seen john step warily out of the corridor behind terminator
john however catches a glimpse of the fleeing sarah and figures out instantly what happened
sarah doesnt hear
she has clicked fully into her own nightmare
they take off running after sarah
c she is pelting down the long corridor back the way she came
as she reaches an intersection with a cross corridor a white clad figure blurs from that corridor
the orderly hits her in a flying tackle
she skids across the floor shrieking and struggling
the other two orderlies leap into the fray
goddamnit its gonna kill us all
she is shouting pleading trying to get them to understand what is coming
they grab her thrashing arms and legs
they dont even look where the out of control woman is pointing
back along the corridor
they have pinned her to the cold tiles a ring of faces above her
silberman leans down to her holding a syringe with a heavy dose of trank
sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of terminator coming up behind them
it is exactly her nightmare
she screams in utter hopelessness
terminator holding the shotgun in one hand reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand
he hurls the pound guys against the far wall of the corridor
he drops to the floor
the other two orderlies react instantly leaping onto the intruder
terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys
then there is an explosion of white clad figures as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine
one crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two story fall by the outer steel bars
the other crashes through an office door splintering it into kindling
silberman has jumped to hold sarah
he is grabbed by a roll of skin at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat
the doctor feel his feet pedaling above the ground
he looks into the expressionless face
and it hit him
sarah was right
this guy isnt human
he feels the fabric of reality crumbling
then he feels himself flying through the air
the wall smacks him then the floor kicks him in the face
he decides to lie there a second
sarah blinks staring up at the figure looming over her
john kneels next to her
mom are you okay
she looks from terminator to john
back to terminator
is this a nightmare
or has she finally gone truly bad
incredibly terminator politely reaches his hand down to her offering to help her up
the last thing she ever expected to see
come with me if you want to live
the orderlies are stirring
its all right mom
hes here to help
sarah is a daze takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers
terminator lifts her to her feet
d john sees a guard standing thirty feet away on the other side of the walls of bars
john doesnt know what we know but he knows somethings not right with this guy
terminator turns to follow johns gaze
the t had its pistol in its hand at its side
terminator pushes john behind him
they start backing up
e the t walks forward reaching the bars
it doesnt stop
its body divides like jello around the bars
as it squeezes itself through like metal playdough its surface reforms perfectly on our side
we see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste forced past an obstacle
silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this
that faint snapping sound is his mind
there is a clank and we see that the guards gun has caught against the bars
the only solid object
the t turns its wrist and tries again slipping the gun endwise through the gap
f sarah is agape
its been a heavy day for her
terminator grabs john by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto his back
john grabs him around the neck
terminator raises the shotgun and starts backing up
sarah doesnt need to be told twice
t walks toward them opening fire with the browning hi power
terminator straight arms the guage like a pistol and fires
the stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is filled with high velocity lead
one of them stupidly running for the cross corridor gets hit by the t
terminator is hammered by several slugs and the t is cratered by two buckshots hits
it staggers but comes on
in the craters we see bright mercury before they close and reseal disappearing in a second
g terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run
ahead sarah is already at the elevator
terminator and john pile in and john slaps the button for garage level
the doors start to close
t clears the corner
terminator slams john and sarah back against the side walls as the t charges at them rapid firing the browning
the rounds hit the steel doors as they close
t keeps pumping them at the closing gap
h inside they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that are punching holes in the other side
i the browning locks open empty
t drops it without a glance back
the doors close
the t hits them a split second later
the elevator hasnt moved yet
j a sword like blade rams through in between the doors forcing them open
terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap
punches the muzzle right into t s face boom
k we get a glimpse of the t s head blown apart by the blast
it is hurtled back
the doors close
the car descends
l on the t outside the elevator
its head which is blown apart into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders reforms quickly
there is no trace of the injury
it sees the closed door and jams its hands between them its fingertips becoming pry bars
it pulls the doors apart with inhuman strength m and leaps into the open shaft
it falls two floors and
in the elevator
out trio hears a loud thump on the roof
terminator reloading the shotgun looks up
sarah grabs the
from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling
a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears down four feet into the elevator car
it is inches from sarahs face
she opens fire bam bam bam right through the roof
lighting fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again slashing terminators jacket and missing john by inches
terminator chambers a round and k boom
the guage opens a hole in the ceiling
terminator rocks out in a fury of firing cocking firing as the metal shafts slash down again and again
sarah yells in pain as one of them slices open her upper arm
the doors open
sarah pulls john out as soon as the gap is wide enough
they emerge into the basement
we see the harley parked nearby
terminator in a rearguard action fires another blast through the ceiling and runs out
he throws his leg over the harley kicks it to life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the inner pocket of his jacket
he throws it to john
a road flare
in the elevator the t has bashed a hole in the ceiling big enough to
pour itself through
a massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening
the mass drops through the hole down out of frame then comes back up into frame as officer x
it seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after doing this king of taffy pull with itself
it opens its eyes and sees terminator the shot gun held in his teeth astride the roaring harley twenty feet away
terminator twists the throttle and pops the clutch
the back tire screams on the concrete
the front wheel lifts off the ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie
terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator
the harley slams the t square and smashes it right through the back wall of the elevator
terminator rolls to his feet
johns strikes the flare on the concrete
terminator catches the life flare with one hand
levels the shotgun with the other
with his last round he blows a big hole in the bikes gas tank
gas splashes everywhere covering the struggling t
terminator tosses the flare
the explosion knocks terminator backward off his feet enveloping him in the fireball
he gets up smoking and runs after john and sarah toward the exit ramp
at the exit ramp
they are partway up when a blue and white hospital security car comes screeching down the other way
without breaking stride sarah runs right at the car
it skids to a shrieking halt
shes in the guys face with the
in both hands
out of the car
the patrol guy is thinking what he can try when blam
she puts a round through the glass next to his head
the door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as terminator arrives
the cyborg flings the rent a cop out of the way and slides behind the wheel
sarah gets john into the back seat and dives into the front passenger seat as a terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it lighting up the tires on
the slick ramp
terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to john and tells him to reload
john pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket and starts feeding them in
terminator power backward up the ramp scraping along one wall barely in control
the t is running at them out of the inferno below
this guy wont quit
shifting from chrome mode to cop form as it runs
it sprints up the ramp after the retreating car
t is gaining
terminator hands sarah another magazine for the
she snatches it drops the other out and slaps in the new one
cocks the slide
the car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate
john hands the shot gun back to terminator
he leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer
the t s face is right in the headlights
a terminator fires blowing a hole in its shoulder
shiny liquid metal visible in the hole which then closes
b sarah half out the passenger window opens fire
the car crashes backward through the security barricade
calmly hang on
he cuts the wheel hard
the car slews into a reverse swapping ends with a screech
t is almost on them
terminator punches it
the car accelerates forward
c t leaps
lands on the trunk
its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid
feet dragging on the pavement it slams its other hand down punching another metal hook into the trunk lid pulling itself up
terminator turns to sarah
terminator heaves himself half out the drivers window
sarah slaps her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side
d t fully on the car now holds on with one hook hand while it slams the other into the back window sweeping away the glass and missing john by
inches as he ducks
it draws back for another swing lunging forward as e terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car
fires point blank
hits the t s arm just above the hand which anchors it to the car
the guage blows the arm apart severing the hook hand
f t tumbles backward off the accelerating car
john looks out the back window his eyes wide
he sees the t roll to his feet and continue running
but hes dropping way behind now
sarah has the car floored and the liquid metal killer wont catch them on foot
g john watches in awe as the crowbar hand stuck into the trunk right in front of him reverts to the neutral polyalloy
a kind of think mercury
the gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob
h the car speeds off into the night
reverse on the t walking now coming right up into closeup watching the tail lights recede
it looks down
i angle on blacktop tight on the liquid metal blob
next to it is the t s shiny cop shoe
the mercury blob crawls and rejoins the main mass disappearing into the shoe
a ghost car blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight highway
headlights off the hospital security car punches a hole in the wind
a inside the speeding car the energy is still high
the air is blowing in the shattered windows as terminator drives the car easily by electronic night vision
his eyes glow faintly red
can you see anything
b terminators pov
a monochrome image of the highway lit bright as day
c terminator replies in a matter of fact tone
sarah looks at terminator still not quite believing this is happening
but this is a different sarah than the waitress of
she spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable
then she turns to john in the back seat
she reaches for john and we think shes going to hug him
she starts to rub her hands over him and we realize shes checking for injuries very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones
he pulls away from her
he hates her always checking him treating him like he might break like some piece of rare china
i said i was okay
sarah looks at him exasperated and stern
it was stupid of you to go there
john stares at her surprised
goddamnit john you have to be smarter than that
youre too important
you cant risk yourself not even for me do you understand
i can take care of myself
i was doing fine
you almost got yourself killed
we see his chin quiver
hes a tough kid but all he really wants is for her to love him
he hasnt had enough years on the planet yet to be the man of steel she demands
had to get you out of the place
im sorry i
his face crumples
he starts to cry
sarah gives him a cold stare
you cant cry john
other kids can afford to cry
hes trying to be brave he really is
terminator turns and sees the water leaking from his eyes
it doesnt make and sense to him
what is wrong with your eyes
john turns away ashamed
sarah lets her breath out realizing how keyed up she is
she turns to terminator giving him a wary once over
so whats your story
the cops have shown up as they always do
there are black and whites everywhere and ambulances are arriving
two cops and an orderly are required to subdue poor doctor silberman who is raving at the top of his lungs
it was all true and were all going to die and the changed i saw him change
its quite pathetic
a nurse shoots him up with a sedative
they lead him away
a t walks unperturbed among the milling cops
no one notices him
it slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night
terminator drives steadily into the black night
what happens when you shoot it
ballistic penetration shocks it but only for a few seconds
sarah thinks about that
then can it be destroyed
they ride along in silence for a few seconds
sarah sees something up ahead some lonely neon in the blackness
pull in here
we have to ditch this car
a rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around
they pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office
a sign in the window says closed sundays
they continue around the building to the garages back door
at the garage door
terminator breaks the lock on the roll up door and raises it
sarah pulls the security car in out of sight
terminator rolls the door down behind them
sarah switches on the single drop light
she and terminator look at each other
terminator is shot up and bleeding and sarah has a vicious slash in her upper arm which was soaked her sleeve with blood
you look like handmade shit
so do you
tight on first aid kit from the office plus some not so oily rags a bottle of rubbing alcohol a few small tools and other makeshift odds and ends
terminators hand comes into shot
sets down a bloody rag
picks up a clean one
sarah sits on an empty crate
terminators is beside her suturing her wound with some fine wire from the winding of an alternator
using a pair of needlenose pliers he draws the wire through her pale skin with a delicate hand
i have detailed files on human anatomy
sarah stares into his face inches away fighting the pain
she doesnt like him being this close to her to begin with let alone carving on her
makes you a more efficient killer right
tight on terminators back
the leather jacket is riddled with bullet holes
sarah and john help pull it off revealing terminators broad muscular back beneath
john and sarah stare in amazement
there are at least twenty bullet holes in him
fortunately theyre all mm
the holes are small and the damage cosmetic
does it hurt
i sense injuries
the data could be called pain
tight on sarah and terminator
sarah starts washing the bullet holes in his broad back with alcohol
will these heal up
she reaches into the bloody wounds with pliers and finds the copper jacketed bullets flattening against the armored endoskeleton
pulls them out
they clink one by one into a glass
because if you cant pass for human you wont be much good to us
she concentrates on removing the slugs
how long do you live
i mean last
a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell
sarah nods pulling out another slug
the glass nearly full of flattened bullets
she begins to sew the holes closed with a few wire sutures
john watches in quiet amazement the two warriors calmly fixing each other
can you learn
so you can be
not such a dork all the time
terminator turns towards him
my cpu is a neural net processor
a learning computer
but skynet presets the switch to read only when we are sent out alone
cynical doesnt want you thinking too much huh
can we reset the switch
of an x acto knife cutting into terminators scalp at the base of his skull
his voice calmly directs sarah as she spreads the bloody incision and locates the maintenance port for the cpu in the chrome skull beneath
now open the port cover
she wipes away the blood and uses the garage mechanics air tools to unscrew the port cover
a terminator pov digitized as he watches her work in a mirror theyve taken from the washroom
sarah and john are standing behind him
her hands are covered with blood like a surgeons
hold the cpu by its base tab
following the instructions she reaches in with a pair of tweezers and pulls there is a burst of static and the screen goes black
tight on john and sarah looking at what she has removed
a reddish brown ceramic rectangle with a connector on one end
about the size and shape of a domino
on close inspection it appears to be made up of small cubes connected together
it is identical to the shattered one in the vault at cyberdyne systems
now we know it is that that miles dyson values so highly
the brain of a terminator
john walks around terminator and looks at his face
eyes open he is completely inert
john lifts his huge hand
the dead servos whine sullenly as he forces them
its like rigor mortis
he releases the hand and it stays in the lifted position
sarah examines the cpu chip
can you see the pin switch
she ignores him
see looks at terminator
the back at the chip
then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer
john realizes what she is about to do
dives at her as the sledge is whistling down
he slaps his hand down over the chip
sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers
out of the way john
dont kill him
we need it
john keeps his hand right where it is
were better off by ourselves
but its the only proof we have to the future
about the war and all that
i dont trust it
these things are hard to kill john believe me i know
we may never have this opportunity again
look mom if im supposed to ever be this great leader you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while
cause if you wont nobody else will
hes got her
she nods reluctantly
he palms the chip and studies it minutely
b john takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the other position
it is now in write mode
then he grimaces as he inserts the wafer back into the slot in terminators skull
c terminator vision flares back to life in a burst of static
the image forms
sarah and john stands behind him in the mirror
was there a problem
john glances sheepishly at sarah then smiles at terminator
john sleeping lying on a pile of rags next to a stack of tires
the lights are off
sarah sits nearby cross legged he back against the wall
is cradles in her lap
she looks weary but she wont allow herself to sleep with terminator present
by the office windows in a slash of moonlight is terminator
he stands silent and still watching the night
only his eyes move tracking with the occasional car passing on the road
he figure silhouetted and still
now daylight streams in the dusty windows
terminator has not moved
faithful machine sentinel
he turns at a sound
john stirs waking up
he squints into the sunlight
sarah is still awake
she gets up wincing at the pain in her arm
john and terminator walks to an old chevy pickup parked behind the garage
the day is clear but windy
dust devils chase themselves behind the place
the pickup is locked but terminator breaks the side window with his fist and opens the door
he and john climb in
a in the pickup
terminator has this trick which you could do too if you had servo driven steel fingers where he smashes the cowl around a steering column with one blow from the
palm of his hand
when it shatters he strips it away with a single move and then turns the stub of the lock mechanism with his fingertips
this starts the vehicle
it takes about three seconds
in fact he does it so quickly the truck is running by the time john flips down the sun visor
a set of keys drops out and john catches them
dangles them in front of terminators eyes
are we learning yet
b sarah comes out
shes found a mechanics coverall inside used but fairly clean
it doesnt fit her too well but its better than the stuff from the hospital
shes still barefoot
the sun which she hasnt seen in months hurts her eyes terminator and john pull up in the pickup
she gets in
we need to get as far from the city as possible
just head south
the open road
the pickup roars through light traffic down a long stretch of highway
they set three abreast on the bench seat john in between like some improbable family on a car trip
sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer
keep it under sixty five
we cant afford to be pulled over
terminator backs off the throttle slightly
no no no
you gotta listen to the way people talk
see you dont say like affirmative or some shit like that
terminator nods filing away the information
sarah is ignoring the lesson lost in thought
it someone comes off to you with an attitude you say eat me
if you wanna shine them on its hasta la vista baby
hasta la vista baby
yeah or later dickwad
or if someone gets upset you say chill out
or you can do combinations
chill out dickwad
see youre getting it
theres a gas pump and a sleazy fast food stand
picnic tables are set up at the side of the food stand
a family sits at one children playing and running about
a the pickup truck pulls into the lot
stops at the gas pump
sarah turns to john
you got any cash
john pulls whats left of his ready teller money from his pocket
only a couple hundred bucks
ill give you half
sarah grabs all of it
peels off a twenty hands it to john
get some food
she opens the truck door and steps out
john turns to terminator
no sense of humor
the ordering window as john and terminator approach
and thats another thing
you could lighten up a bit yourself
this severe routine is getting old
smile once in a while
people smile right
goes to the order window
smiling broadly hi
nice place you got here
stone faced gimme a break
to terminator okay
over there look
john points at three teenage guys standing at a drinking fountain nearby
one of them has said something funny and the others are laughing grinning
terminator pov digitized the real time image continues while a replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window
it expands so that the guys mouth fills the window
replays again in slow motion
a vector graphic of the lips smiling appears along with an array of symbolic data
terminator tries it
the result is dismal
a rictus like curling of the lip
terminators next effort is a marginal improvement
i dont know maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something
sarah and john are eating cheeseburgers and fries sitting in the truck and on the curb respectively
they are parked away from the other families at the end of the gravel parking area
terminator is pouring coolant into the radiator
sarah is deep in through turning and turning the whole thing in her brain
john unable to deal with her silence goes around to where terminator is working
a john sees two kids playing with machine gun water pistols nearby viciously squirting each other
john and terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the death
sarah rounds the front of the truck and sees the kids
john sighs solemn
he looks up at the cyborg
were not gonna make it are we
people i mean
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves
john nods depressed
i need to know how skynet get built
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor
b terminator closes the hood and gets into the truck as he speaks
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems
all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers becoming fully unmanned afterward the fly with a perfect operational record
getting behind john uh huh great
then those fat fucks in washington figure what the hell let a computer run the whole show right
starting the engine backing out the skynet funding bill is passed
the system goes on line august th
human decisions are removed from strategic defense
skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate
it becomes self aware at a
eastern time august
in a panic they try to pull the plug
and skynet fights back
they accelerate back onto the highway
it launches its icbms against their targets in russia
why attack russia
because skynet knows the russian counter strike will remove its enemies here
beat then how much do you know about dyson
i have detailed files
i want to know everything
what he looks like
where he lives
miles dyson sits at the huge desk in his study
he is deep in thought tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal
next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear
on a sunday morning when most men are relaxing spending time with their families dyson is hard at work
in a profile closeup we see him in deep concentration his mind prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor
a womans face enters frame soundlessly behind him
he doesnt hear her
his wife tarissa extends her tongue and traces it down the back of his neck
he smiles and turns to kiss her good morning
shes still in her bathrobe holding coffee
hes been up for hours
he turns and goes back to work forgetting instantly that she is standing there
she watches him work the arcane symbols moving across the screen
we see her frustration her inability to truly enter the magic box of his world
you going to work all day
im sorry baby
this thing is just kicking my ass
i thought we had it with this one
he points to a metal box on his desk about two feet long
as assembly of small cubes
it looks like a dinosaur version of terminators cpu
but the output went to shit after three seconds
im thinking now its the way im matrixing the command hierarchies
you need a break
youll see it clear when you come back
i cant miles its sunday
you promised to take the kids to raging waters today
i cant honey
im on a roll here
he takes her hands
we see a childlike excitement in his face
he wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery the satisfaction of creation
baby this thing is going to blow em all away
its a neural net process i know
you told me
its a neural net processor
it thinks and learns like we do
its superconducting at room temperature
other computer are pocket calculators by comparison
she pulls away from him but why is that so goddamn important miles
i really need to know cause i feel like im going crazy here sometimes
im sorry honey its just that im thiiis close
he holds up his thumb and index finger
a fraction of an inch apart
she picks up the prototype
it doesnt look like much
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake never gets tired never shows up to work with a hangover
he taps the prototype meet the pilot
why did you marry me miles
why did we have these two children
you dont need us
your heart and your mind are in here
she stares at the metal box in her hands but it doesnt love you like we do
he takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down
then he puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently
she acquiesces to his kiss
tarissa glances over his shoulder
she nods her head toward the doorway to the study
dyson turns and sees their two kids standing there
danny and blythe look rumpled and adorable in their pjs
dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions
how about spending some time with your other babies
the forces of darkness have lost this round
he holds out his hands and his kids run to him cheering
the desert northwest of calexico
burning under the sun like a hallucination
heat shimmers the image mirage like
terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a roadbed a sand and gravel trailing a huge plume of dust
a sign at the turnoff says charon mesa mi a ahead is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland a couple of aging house trailers surrounded by assorted
junk vehicles and desert style trash
there is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers and a stripped huey helicopter sitting on block nearby
the truck rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust
the place looks deserted
the door to the nearest trailer bangs in the wind
to terminator and john stay in the truck
a dark figure in the f
has an ak trained on the pickup as sarah gets out
on sarah peering through the backlit dust
the sound of wind
she approaches the trailer
in spanish enrique
she hears kachank
behind her and spins whipping out her
in one motion
enrique salceda stands behind a rusting jeep a gauge pump trained on her
he is mid forties a tough guatemalan with a weathered face and heavy mustache
he wears cowboy boots and a flak vest no shirt
you pretty jumpy connor
his fierce face breaks into a broad grin
the shotgun drops to his side as he walks toward her
when he reaches her he hugs her then steps back
in spanish good to see you connor
i knew youd make it back here sooner or later
he grins at john as he steps from the truck and then clocks terminator getting out
oye big john
whos your very large friend
perfect spanish hes cool enrique
this is my uncle bob
to terminator in english uncle bob this is enrique
salceda squints at him hmmm
uncle bob huh
get out here we got company
and bring some fucking tequila
a thin guatemalan kid franco eighteen or so comes out of the trailer with the ak followed by salcedas wife yolanda
she has three younger children with her from a five year old girl juanita to a year and half old boy
she waves at john
they exchange greetings in spanish
they seem like nice people
terminator looks down at john next to him
he says quietly
to sarah so sarahlita you getting famous you know that
all over the goddamn tv
salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle
the two year old toddles to terminator and grabs his pants sliming them with drool
terminator looks down at the tiny kid fascinated
what is it
he picks up the child with one huge hand
looks at it
turns it different ways
then sets it down
the kid waddles off a little dizzy
honey take pacolito
she hands him the tequila and takes the child
salceda takes a long pull from the cuervo bottle
to terminator drink
terminator gestures no at the proffered bottle but sarah grabs it and takes a long pull
she lowers it without expression
her eyes dont even water
i just came for my stuff
and i need clothes food and one of your trucks
grinning hey how about the fillings out of my fucking teeth while youre at it
turns to terminator and john you two are on weapons detail
there is an aging and rusted caterpillar sitting behind one of the trailers
john expertly backs it toward terminator who is holding one end of a piece of heavy chain which disappears into the sand
hook it on
terminator hooks the chain onto the towhook on the back of the tractor
john hits the throttle and the cat churns its treads pulling some massive load
a six by eight foot sheet of steel plate moves slowly under six inches of sand
john drags it far enough to reveal
a rectangular hole in the ground
like the mouth of a tomb
the kid drops down from the tractor and walks to the hole
one thing about my mom
she always plans ahead
from inside the tomb
sunlight slashes down into a cinder block room less than six feet wide but over twenty long
sand spills down the steps
the walls are lined with guns
john precedes terminator into sarahs weapons cache
rifles pistols rocket launchers mortars rpgs radio gear
at the far end boxes containing ammo grenades etc
are stacked to the ceiling
terminator gets real alert
scanning wondering where to begin
he picks up a mac machine pistol
racks the bolt
yeah i thought youd like this place
sarah emerges from a trailer
she has changed
boots black fatigue pants t shirt
she looks hard
salceda is nearby packing food and other survival equipment with yolanda
he looks up as sarah approaches and slaps the side of a big four by bronco next to him this is the best truck but the water pump is blown
you got the time to change it out
im gonna wait till dark to cross the border
she pulls him away from yolanda enrique its dangerous for you here
you get out tonight too okay
he grins just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life
she slaps him on the shoulder
terminator returns from carrying out several cases of ammo
john is selecting rifles from a long rack
see i grew up in places like this so i just thought it was how people lived
riding around in helicopters
learning how to blow shit up
john grabs an ak and racks the bolt with a practiced action
inspects the receiver for wear
doesnt like what he sees
puts is back
his movement are efficient
then when mom got busted i got put in a regular school
the other kids were like into nintendo
terminator has found a vietnam era blooper m grenade launcher
a very crude but effective weapon
he opens the breech and inspects the bore
are you ever afraid
terminator pauses for a second
the thought never occurred to him
he searches him mind for the answer
terminator slings the m and starts looking for the grenades
not even of dying
you dont feel any emotion about it one way or the other
i have to stay functional until my mission is complete
then it doesnt matter
john is idly spinning a sig saur mm pistol on his finger
backwards and forwards like bat masteron
i have to stay functional too
sing songy im too important
terminator pulls back a canvas tarp revealing a squat heavy weapon with six barrels clustered in a blunt cylinder
chain ammo is fed from a canister sitting next to it
the most fearsome anti personnel weapon of the vietnam era
terminator hefts it
looks at john as if to say can i
its definitely you
sarah and john have their weapons and supply selections laided out on two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing
maps radios documents explosives detonators
just the basics
sarah is field stripping and cleaning guns very methodical
there is no wasted motion
not far away john and terminator are working on the bronco
theyre greasy up to their elbows lying on their backs under the engine compartment ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump
there was this one guy that was kinda cool
he taught me engines
hold this a second
mom screwed it up of course
sooner or later shed always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader and thats be all she wrote
john thinks hes being causal but his longing for some kind of parental connection is obvious
torque wrench please
i wish i coulda met my real dad
i guess so
my mom says when im like i think i send him back through time to
but right now he hasnt even been born yet
man is messes with your head
wheres that other bolt
terminator hands it to him thanks
mom and him were only together for one night but she still loves him i guess
i see her crying sometimes
she denies it totally of course
like she says she got something in her eye
they crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight
why do you cry
you mean people
i dont know
we just cry
when it hurts
pain causes it
uh unh no its different
its when theres nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway
you get it
terminator gets into the bronco and turns the ignition key and the engine catches with a roar
john grins and does a victorious thumbs up
terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly
john laughs and makes him get out of the truck to try the move again
a sarah across the compound pauses in her work to watch john and terminator
a sarahs pov
we dont hear what john and terminator are saying
it is a soundless pantomime as john is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg
trying to get him to walk more casually
john walks then terminator tries it then john gestures wildly talking very fast
explaining the fundamental principles of cool
they try it again
continued ad lib as we hear watching john with the machine it was suddenly so clear
the terminator would never stop it would never leave him
it would always be there
and it would never hurt him never shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it couldnt spend time with him because it was too busy
and it would die to protect him
of all the would be fathers who came and went over the years this thing this machine was the only one who measured up
in an insane world it was the sanest choice
sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work
a strong woman made hard and cold by years of hard choices
a police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet empty road on the outskirts of los angeles
a ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a freeway in the distance
nothing stirs around the cruiser except some pump jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it
a in the cruiser
the t sits inside
johns notes and letters are spread out on the seat beside it
sarahs voice speaks from a cassette deck
her voices mixes with the static filled chatter of the radio that t monitors for any signs of its targets
if we are ever separated and cant make contact go to enriques airstrip
ill rendezvous with you there
t whips around and rewinds the tape replaying the last section
it then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier
ecu on envelope
we see the postmark charon mesa calif
tight on t staring at the postmark on the envelope
it glances up at the sound of crunching gravel
in the rear view it sees a bike cop pulling onto the shoulder behind it
the big kawasaki idles up next to the t still seated in the cruiser
i saw you pulled over here earlier
thanks for checking
it gets slowly out of the car since youre here though can i talk to you a second
the t thunders along on the kawasaki doing about a hundred and twenty
pan with it until it recedes toward the horizon
sarah sits at the picnic table
the weapons are cleaned and her work is done
she hasnt slept in twenty four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder
she draws her knife from its belt sheath
idly starts to carve something on the table top
the letter n
a not far away john and terminator are packing the bronco for the trip
a on sarah at the table as she looks up from her carving thinking
she watches salcedas kids playing nearby
wrestling with a mutty dog and loving it
sarah watches yolanda walking her toddler by her hands
she looks over at john
loading guns and supplies
a angle on kids playing
a sarahs head droops
she closes her eyes
a tight on small children playing
wider now to reveal a playground in a park
a dream playground crowded with laughing children playing on swings slides and a jungle gym
it could be the playground we saw melted and frozen in the post nuclear desolation of
but here the grass is vibrant green and the sun is shining
a sarah short haired looking drab and paramilitary stands outside the playground
her fingers are hooked in a chain link fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers playing with their kids
a grim faced harbinger
b some girls play skip rope
their sing song weaves through the random burbling laughter of the kids
one of the young mothers walks her two year old son by the hands
she is wearing a pink waitress uniform
she turns to us laughing
it is sarah
sarah from another life uncontaminated by the dark future
she glances at the strange woman beyond the fence
c grim faced sarah presses against the fence
she starts shouting at them in slow motion
no sound comes from her mouth
she grabs the fence in frustration shaking it
waitress sarahs smile falls
then returns as her little boy throws some sand at her
she laughs turns away as if the woman at the fence were a shadow a trick of light
g the sky explodes
the children ignite like match heads
sarah is burning screaming silently everything silent and overexposed
h the blast wave hits
devouring the cowering mothers and children
sarahs scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips into her blasting her apart and she
all is quiet and normal
the children are still playing nearby
less than fifteen minutes have gone by
bathed in sweat sarah sits hunched over the table
every muscle is shaking
she is gasping
sarah struggles to breathe running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat she can escape from the hospital but she cant escape from the madness which haunts
she looks down at the words she has carved on the table amid the scrawled hearts and bird droppings
they are no fate
something changes in her eyes
she slams her knife down in the table top embedding it deeply in the words
then gets up suddenly and we a long lens on sarah walking toward us striding across the compound with grim purpose
she carries a small nylon pack and a car assault rifle
her face is an impassive mask
she has become a terminator
a a john looks up from his work in time to see sarah throw the rifle behind the seat of their stolen pickup jump in and start it
she slams it in gear
salceda walks up to john
she said you go south with him
he points at terminator tonight like you planned
she will meet you tomorrow in
but john is moving running after her
a b moving with sarah as she leaves the compound
we see john running after her
cant hear his words
she looks in the rear view mirror but doesnt slow down
john and terminator ponders the message carved into the top of the picnic table
sarahs knife is still embedded there
no fate but what we make
my father told her this
i mean i made him memorize it up in the future as a message to her never mind
okay the whole thing goes the future is not set
there is no fate but what we make for ourselves
she intends to change the future somehow
i guess yeah snaps his fingers as it hit him oh shit
yeah gotta be
shes gonna blow him away
john motions to terminator and breaks into a run
sarah speeds through the darkening desert
in her dark glasses she looks as pitiless as an insect
tracking with the bronco terminator and john heading toward l
this is tactically dangerous
the t has the same files that i do
it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dysons house
i dont care
weve gotta stop her
killing dyson might actually prevent the war
i dont care
theres gotta be another way
havent you learned anything
havent you figured out why you cant kill people
terminator is still stumped
look maybe you dont care if you live or die
but everybodys not like that
we have feelings
you gotta learn this stuff man im not kidding
panning as they pass revealing the lights of the city ahead
the house is high tech and luxurious
lots of glass
dysons study is lit bluish with the glow of his computer monitors
he is at the terminal working
we see him clearly in a long shot from an embankment behind the house
a dark figure moves into the foreground
rack focus to sarah as she turns into profile
she raises the car rifle and begins screwing the long heavy cylinder of a sound suppresser onto the end of the barrel
dysons kids danny and blythe are playing in the halls with a radio controlled off road truck
danny drives and blythe scampers after it trying to catch it
they stop in the hall outside dysons study and sees him working at his terminal
danny puts a finger to his lips shushing blythe
his expression is mischievous
b with the silencer in place sarah eases back the bolt and then slips it forward chambering a
then she lies down on the embankment
he cheek pressed against the cool rifle stock she slides one hand slowly forward to brace the weapon taking the weight on her elbow
her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger
her expression is cold impassive
she looks through the scope at the man in the house
she feels nothing as she raises the rifle
dyson in deep thought
the rhythmic sounds of keys as he works
symbols on the screen shift
on his back we see the glowing red dot appear
it is the target dot of sarahs laser designator
it moves silently up his back toward his head
in extreme closeup we see sarahs eye at the night scope
tight insert on her finger as it tightens on the trigger taking out the slack
she takes a deep breath and holds it
adjusts her position minutely
the laser dot jiggles on the back of dysons neck and then rises centering on the back of his skull
a low angle as dannys bigfoot truck roars toward us filling frame
it hits dysons foot
he jerks startled and looks down as b his monitor screen is blown out spraying his with glass
he jerks back utterly shocked
and spins to see the huge hole blown through the window behind him
this saves him as k thump
the second shot blows the top of his high backed chain into an explosion of stuffing an inch from his head
instinctively he dives to the carpet as blam blam blam rounds blast through the window tearing into his desk and computer blowing his keyboard into shrapnel
c with the monitor screen blown out the room is in darkness
sarah cant see dyson now down behind his desk
she puts round after round into the heavy desk blasting one side of it into kindling
d dyson scared out of his mind has his face jammed against the carpet terrified to move
he sees his kids in the hall
e in the hall tarissa rounds the corner at a dead run
she sees the kids running toward her and grabs them in her arms
down the hall in the dark study she sees dyson on the floor amid the splinters and shrapnel of the continuing fusillade
oh my god
f on the floor dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered computer components shower down on him
he looks desperately toward the door but knows hed be totally exposed
hed never make it
sarahs rifle empties with a final clack
she throws it down and draws her
smoothly from a shoulder base
she starts toward the house snapping back the slide on the pistol chambering a round
she is in a fast purposeful walk keeping her eyes fixed on the target
she is utterly determined to kill this man
from under the desk dyson can see a sliver in the backyard
he sees sarahs feet as she strides toward him
he tenses to make a break for the door
sarah raises the pistol eyes riveted ahead controlling her breathing
dyson springs up in a full tilt sprint
she tracks him
he hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive
her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was
he hits the floor hard but keeps moving scrambling forward
crunch of glass behind his as sarahs dark form is framed in the blown out floor to ceiling window
dyson leaps toward the hall
her second shot spins him
he hits the floor in the hallway
tarissa is screaming
dyson struggles forward stunned
there is a caliber hole clean through his left shoulder
he smears the wall with blood as he staggers up
looking back he sees the implacable figure behind him coming on
he topples through a doorway as boom
shots blowing away the molding where he just was
terminator and john leap from the jeep sprinting toward the house
the shots sound muffles from outside
shit were too late
advancing with sarah we enter the living area
tarissa has blythe and shes screaming at danny who has run back to his collapsed father
danny is pulling at dyson crying and screaming as his father tries to stagger forward
tarissa drops blythe and runs back for dyson grabbing him
sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed
dont fucking move
dont fucking move
she swings the gun on tarissa get on the floor bitch
sarah is crazy eyed now shaking with the intensity of the moment
the kill has gone bad with screaming kids and the wife involved
things she never figured on
tarissa drops to the knees terrified as she looks into the muzzle of the gun
blythe runs to dyson and hugs him wailing
dont hurt my father
screaming shut up kid
get out of the way
dyson looks up through his pain and incomprehension
why is this nightmare happening
the black gun muzzle is a foot from his face
its all your fault
its your fault
we see her psyching herself to pull the trigger
needing now to hate this man she doesnt know
its a lot harder face to face
she is bathed in sweat and it runs into her eyes
blinking she wipes it fast with one hand then gets it back on the gun
tight on sarah as we see the forces at war behind her eyes
she looks into the faces of dyson tarissa blythe danny
sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract as she tenses to fire
but her finger wont do it
she lowers the gun very slowly
it drops to her side in one hand
all the breath and energy seems to go out of her
she weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture like stay where you are dont move
as if should they move the fragile balance might tip back the other way
she backs away from them slowly panting
its as if shes backing away in terror from what she almost did
she reaches a wall and slumps against it
slides down to her knees
the gun falls limply from her fingers
she rests her cheek against the wall
a the front door is kicked in
terminator steps inside
john grabs his sleeve and pushes past him
he scopes out the situation in two seconds
sarah the gun the sobbing family
john moves to sarah while terminator checks dyson
john kneels in front of his mother
she raises her head to look at him
he sees the tears spilling down her cheeks mom
she seems to she him for the first time you
to stop me
she reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly surprising him
drawing him to her
she hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside her from a spring she had thought long dry
she hugs him fiercely as the sobs wrack her
john clutches her shoulders
it is all he ever wanted
itll by okay
well figure it out
i love you john
i always have
i know mom
tarissa looks around at the bizarre tableau
terminator has wordlessly ripped open dysons shirt and examined the wound
no shattered bone
compression should control the loss of blood
he takes tarissas hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and exit wounds
do you have bandages
in the bathroom
danny can you get them for us
danny nods and runs down the hall
john disengages from sarah
she wipes her tears the instinct to toughen up taking over again
but the healing moment has had its effect nevertheless
john walks toward dyson and terminator
who are you people
john draws the bikers knife from terminators boot
hands it to him
terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms
john takes blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall away from what is about to happen
b tight on terminators left forearm as the knife makes a deep cut just below the elbow
in one smooth motion terminator cuts all the way around his arm
with a second cut he splits the skin of the forearm from elbow to wrist
terminator grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a surgeon rips off a rubber glove
it comes off with a sucking rip leaving a bloody skeleton
but the skeleton is made of bright metal and is laced with hydraulic actuators
the fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts
they flex into a fist and extend
terminator holds it up palm out in almost the exact position of the one in the vault at cyberdyne hold on dyson reacting to the servo hand in front of
hes seen one of these before
tarissa is screaming now but he doesnt hear her
now listen to me very carefully
sarah puts out her fifth cigarette
shes sitting on the counter
john terminator dyson and tarissa are at the kitchen table under a single overhead light
dyson looks like that guy on the sistine chapel wall the damned soul
eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge
his shoulder is bandaged
terminators arm is wrapped with a blood soaked bandage below the elbow
the steel forearm and hand gleam in the harsh kitchen light
tracking around the table as terminator speaks
we dont hear the words
dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down
the history of things to come
its not every day you find out youre responsible for billion deaths
he took it pretty well considering
terminator finishes speaking
i feel like im gonna throw up
he looks around at them clutching the table like hes about to blow away
his face his posture his ragged voice express soul wrenching terror
this is a man ripped out of normal life into their grim world
his voice is pleading
youre judging me on things i havent even done yet
how were we supposed to know
sarah speaks from the shadows behind them
dyson turns to find her looking right at him
how were you supposed to know
all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your
fucking ideas and your weapons
did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man
colt browning smith thompson kalashnikov
men built the hydrogen bomb not women
men like you thought it up
youre so creative
you dont know what its like to really create something
to create a life
to feel it growing inside you
all you know how to create is death
you fucking bastards
mom mom we need to be more constructive here
i dont see this as a gender related issue
to the dysons shes still tense
to sarah we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening
but i thought
arent we changing things
changing the way it goes
seizing on that thats right
theres no way im going to finish the new processor now
im out of it
im quitting cyberdyne tomorrow
ill sell real estate i dont care coldly thats not good enough
dysons voice is pitiful
look whatever you want me to do ill do
i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up okay
no one must follow your work
thoughts racing alright yeah
we have to destroy the stuff at the lab the files disk drive
and everything i have here
i dont care
stacks of files are dumped onto it
wider reveals we are in terminator dumps lighter fluid liberally over the fire which flares up lighting his face demonically
sarah dyson tarissa and john return from his office with more stuff files notes optical disks
even his kids are carrying stuff
it all goes into the fire
dyson drops the prototype onto the fire
his eyes hollow and distant
he stares into the fire watching his world burning
the has a sudden thought
do you know about the chip
they have it in a vault at cyberdyne
to terminator its gotta be from the other one like you
to sarah the cpu from the first terminator
son of a bitch i knew it
they told us not to ask where they got it
hell i dont know
i didnt want to know
those lying motherfuckers
i was scary stuff radically advanced
it was shattered
but it gave us ideas it took us in new directions
things we would never have thought of
all this work is based on it
i must be destroyed
to dyson can you get us in there past security
i think so yeah
dyson looks at her terminator then john
sees his answer
he takes a breath yeah right
he turns to his wife
her face is streaked with tears but her eyes are strong and clear
tarissa puts her hands on his arm
she is stunned by what shes heard but dealing with it
she believe them
miles im scared
but the only thing that scares me more than you going
is you not going
to terminator is it safe for them here
to tarissa take your kids
go to a hotel
to the others lets go
pavement rushing at us lit by headlights
the future always so clear to me has become like a black highway at night
we were in uncharted territory now
making up history as we went along
tilt up to reveal a rectangle of light ahead
the cyberdyne building
tight on a card key scanner as dysons hand zips his security card through a slot in one motion
there is the sound of a servo lock and a dyson enter the spacious lobby followed by sarah john and terminator last of all
in a frontal angle the others block terminator from view
the guard at the front desk gibbons looks up as dyson moves toward him
dyson is pale and sweaty but smiles warmly at the guard speaking well before he reaches the desk
these are friends of mine from out of town i just thought id take them up and show them around
im sorry mr
you know the rules about visitors in the lab
i need written authoriz k chak
gibbons is staring down the barrels of sarahs
and terminators mac
the guard is too stunned to move
we see that terminator is wearing his jacket and one black glove
gibbons eyes go to the silent alarm button on the console
dont even think about it
he stays frozen
terminator circles quickly and gets the guard out of the chair
john pulls a roll of duct tape from his knapsack and tears off a piece
elevator doors open and terminator leads the group warily into the corridor
they have a cart piled high with gear in nylon bags
dyson motions down the corridor to the right
as they walk he continues to fill them in the vault needs two keys to open
holds up key and one from the security station
its in a locker but my card should access it
here we go
they stand in front of a wide security door
a sign above reads special projects division authorized personnel only
dyson zips his key card through the scanner and the door unlatches
a roving guard moshier strolls down the long corridor from the first floor office block
a punch clock swings at his hip and hes just completed his circuit of the building
he passes the back of elevators and rounds the corner to the front desk calling out honey im home
he sees the desk is deserted and frowns
figures gibbons must be in the can so checks that first before getting alarmed
tracking with him to the restroom around the corner hey man you shouldnt leave the a over his shoulder we see past the door as he pushes it open revealing
gibbons handcuffed to the urinal
moshier spins on a dime and sprints to the desk where he slams down on the silent alarm button
the security station is a pass through area with a counter behind which are desks and a bank of monitors showing boring movies about empty corridors
dyson crosses quickly to a locker behind the monitor area
he swished his card repeatedly through the scanner on the locker
the light on the locker is blinking red
sarah notices dysons alarmed expression
what is it
dyson whips around staring at a light flashing on the console behind him
silent alarms been tripped
it neutralizes the codes throughout the building
nothingll open now
we see his nerve snapping
we should abort
were going all the way
you got that dyson
shes right in his face
somehow it works for him
he nods getting some resolve from somewhere
moshiers gotten gibbons loose
hes on the phone to the cops
multiple armed subjects
look i think its the guy from that mall shootout and the woman
just send everything youve got in the area john jumps up on the desk next to the wall mounted locker
dyson stares in amazement as john starts pulling his counter electronics gear out of his knapsack
its just another ready teller to him
you guys get started on the lab
i can open this
a dyson leads terminator and sarah to the main lab doors
another servo lock
he tries his card
let me try mine
he unslings the m pulling it over his shoulder in one motion
sarah grabs dyson and drags him back down the hall
terminator opens the breach and slide in one of the fat mm h
he flips the thing closed with a snap of the wrist
yelling as she runs john
fire in the hole
john drops what he is doing and covers his ears
terminator fires at inhumanely close range
b the door explodes into kindling
the concussion blow his jacket open and flying shrapnel whizzes all around him
before the thunderclap has faded terminator walks into the fire and smoke
john goes back to work without missing a beat
sarah and a stunned dyson walk through the burning doorframe into the artificial intelligence lab
a siren is sounding
the halon fire control system has been triggered
the invisible gas roars in putting out the flames
fires set off the halo system
dyson runs to a wall cabinet and pulls out some breathing masks
he hands one to sarah and dons the other
then he reaches out to hand one to terminator
terminator doesnt need a mask since is oxygen requirements are so low
he ignores dyson as he removes his massive backpack and opens it
dyson shrugs and tosses the mask on a desk
he turns to sarah
yelling through the mask well have to keep these on a couple minutes till the gas clears
terminator pulls two five gallon jerry cans of gasoline from his pack
sarah starts pulling out book sized olive grab claymore mines stacking them next to the gasoline
part of him cant believe theyre really doing this
the t moves slowly though the ravaged office analyzing what has happened here
it walks down the dark hallway
the place is deserted
the police walkie clipped on its belt real not simulated blares to life
all units all units
in progress at kramer street the cyberdyne building
multiple suspects armed with automatic weapons and explosives
swat unit is en route
the t sprints up and throws its leg over the big c
fires it up
it smokes an arcing scorch mark on the pavement as it spins around and roars away
tight on a large disk drive
state of the art
a fire axe smashes down through the housing shattering the disk
a wider revealing a scene of high tech pillage
terminator beats the disk drive into junk and steps to another
hes already demolished half a dozen
sarah topples a file cabinet scattering files
dyson staggers up with an armload of heavy m o magnetic optical disks and drops them on a growing stack in the middle of the floor
he and sarah have their breathing masks hanging down around their necks since the halon gas has dissipated
to sarah panting yeah all that stuff
and all the disks in those offices
especially my office
everything in my office
to terminator these too
this is important
and all this here
b sarah goes into dysons office and starts hurling everything out the door onto the central junkpile
books files everything on the desk
a framed photo of dysons wife and kids lands on top of the heap
tarissa hugging danny and blythe all grinning
the glass is shattered
c terminator cuts a swath under dysons direction exploding equipment into fragments with his inhuman swings
millions in hardware and all irreplaceable fruits of their years of research
shattered broken dumped in a heap for the big bonfire of destiny
dyson stops a second panting
give me that thing a second
terminator hands him the axe
dyson hefts it one handed
he turns to a lab table
on it is another prototype processor
ive worked for years on this thing
swinging awkwardly but with great force he smashes the axe down onto the processor prototype exploding it into fragments
his shoulder is agony but he looks satisfied
john taps away at his little lap top which is running code combinations into the card key lock
suddenly the green light on the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk
he whips it open revealing a rack of keys
but the vault key is distinctive a long steel rectangle on a neck chain
john grabs it and runs toward the lab
sarah and terminator are working like a crack team rigging the explosives
she is taping the claymores to the gas cans with duct tape to create powerful incendiary bombs
terminator is attaching claymores and blocks of c plastic explosive to the large mainframe computer cabinets nearby
all the claymores are wired back to one detonator with has a radio control relay switch
how do you set them off
terminator shows him a remote detonator a small transmitter with a red plunger
he makes a plunger pushing motion with his thumb and an accompanying click sound
just then john comes running in holding up the key
i got it
piece of cake
to dyson and terminator go
ill finish here
they run out as the sound of sirens grow louder outside
ill deal with the police
remember what i said you cant
the security duo of moshier and gibbons cowers behind cars in the parking lot in front of the building
they turns as l
black and whites pour into the lot turn the area into a disco of whirling blue and red lights
the cops are jumping from their cars and ducking behind them
emphasis on small arms here
behind them an ugly black swat van screeches into the lot
a we hear the thump of rotors as a police chopper arrives and swings in close to the building
it rakes its xenon spotlight through the second floor offices
terminator crosses the office toward the floor to ceiling windows
he is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark offices
without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward the window
a glass explodes outward and the desk topples falling to the sidewalk below
b terminator standing at the edge fires a long burst with strafes the police cars lines up below
cops duck as glass flies
terminator with his superb aim hits no one
but noticed is served
c the cops surprise fire back
terminator turns and is walking calmly from the window as glass office furniture drapes etc
are riddled by return fire
a few rounds hit his back but he doesnt notice
he reloads as he walks
tight on a key inserted into one of the vault locks
wider as john and dyson stand poised hands on keys
and lets see whats behind door number one
dyson nods and they turns the keys together
the vault grumbles to itself withdrawing it locking bolts with a final klonk
together dyson and john swing the door open
the varsity takes the field as the swat troopers sprint forward by squads
they flank the lobby and work their way inside deploying rapidly
they move and freeze behind cover quivering with adrenaline
they have all that great swat equipment body armor gas masks m s tear gas launchers ropes
they make a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut
theyre well trained and deadly
outside we see cops firing tear gas grenades through the broken windows into second floor offices
john and dyson are isolated from the world in this silent steel womb
dyson opens the cabinet containing the terminator relics
its john turn to stare with uneasy deja vu as he sees the terminator hand and then in one vicious move he sweeps his arm behind the inert gas flasks
and hurls them to the floor
john snatches the cpu and the metal hand out of the broken glass
got ol skynet by the ball now miles
come on lets book
clutching the steel hand and pocketing the chip like its a mars bar he just bought john runs out
we see the advance squad of swats make it to one of the stairwells
they start up two at a time covering each other ritualistically by the numbers
john pelts into the lab with dyson stumbling along behind him
sarah is just finished wiring all the charges to the central detonator
ready to rock
john tosses her the metal hand
she catches it and bends to put the hand in her empty back pack
sarah zips the pack and starts to shuck into it
dysons running out of steam
the bandages at his shoulder are soaked with seeping blood
he stands in the middle of the lab saying goodbye in his mind looking weak and empty
terminator strides into the lab
time to go
he and john head back the way they came through security
sarah sees that in her work she has set the detonator down twenty feet away near where dyson is standing
dyson hand me the detonator
lets go he gingerly picks up the detonator
starts toward her
then swat leader and two others open fire
their m s rake the room
sarah dives behind a computer cabinet
dyson is hit
he is slammed to the floor by the impacts
in the hall john hears the firing and spins to run back
terminator grabs him as bullets slam into his broad back
he makes it around the corner with john out of the line of fire
in the lab bullets rake over sarahs head smacking all around her clanging into the machine protecting her
she can see dyson slumped on the floor
debris and flying glass rain on her as the swats pour on the fire
the detonator is clutched in his hand
he rolls to face her his eyes bulging from the pain of his torn up guts
a sarah hesitates a split second
then she snap rolls and fast crawls through broken glass and debris into the hall where terminator grabs her by the jacket and hauls her roughly to her feet
bullets rake the walls behind them as they sprint forward
they round the corner
john does a fast take that shes not hit and they run together through the security checkpoint
john reaches the first door and tries it
terminator unslings the m blooper smoothly opening the breach
he pulls a grenade from the bandolier over his shoulder and slides it into the bore
flick his wrist
the breech snaps shut
sarah and john have a split second to duck and cover
cover you ears and open you mouth
a they do
twenty feet away the door and half the wall around it explodes outward
the backblast hits terminator full force but he strides through the smoking hole before the debris has even hit the floor
swat leader moves cautiously through the lab
cat stepping he circles around a desk which block dysons body from his view
his m is leveled crisply
we look over his shoulder as he rounds the desk revealing miles dyson is not dead
he will be very soon but at this moment he is conscious
he has propped himself up against the desk and holds a book in one hand
a heavy technical manual
below the book is the detonator upright on the tile floor
the message is clear
shoot me the book drops on the plunger
dyson wheezes trying to draw enough breath to talk
i dont know
how much longer
hold this thing
swat leader seems to see the wires the claymores the gas cans all around him for the first time
his eyes visible through his gas mask go very wide
he spins and motions his squad back
out they retreat so fast they crash into the next group coming up the stairs
terminator reaches the main elevators
hits the button
sarah and john are coughing and stumbling in the choking darkness buddy breathing with the single mask
the doors open
they get in the elevator and head down
dyson is lying amid the ruins of his dreams
sprawled on the floor he has his back propped up against the desk
he is bathed in his own blood which runs out in long fingers across the tiles
his breathing is shallow and raspy
he still holds the book trembling above the switch
in his lap is the picture from his desk
he has pulled it from the debris next to him
a tear trickles from his eye
his wife and children smile up at him through broken glass
cut to the pupil of his eye at the moment of death the instant the light fade from his eyes and he is gone his arm drops and the book
his the switch as the face of the building explodes in an eruption of glass and fire
remains of the second floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge fireball rolls out leaping into the sky
the cops look up stunned
the helicopter banks away from the heat
burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers break ranks pulling back
only one of them seems to be moving with purpose
a bike cop who has just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd directly toward the building
a t guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses from a parking structure to the cyberdyne building
it enters on the second floor which is now a burning maze
t drives into the smoky wreckage
it draws a hoechler and koch mpk machine pistol and cruises slowly into the firelit offices scanning
a in the corridor the bike skirts flaming wreckage as it idles forward
t scans the leaping shadows for its prey
the elevator doors part and terminator eases a look out into the corridor
the walls on either side of him erupt with bullet hits
the swats have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off
theyre totally trapped cut off and screwed
to sarah dont forget
its always darkness right before
youre totally fucked
a the swats fire a tear gas grenade toward the elevators
it spews the vicious cs gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops sarah and john who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator
keep your eyes closed
they nod eyes squeezed shut ill be back
he slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into the corridor
a tear gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down the corridor
it skids to rest in front of terminator throwing out a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor
c in the elevator sarah and john are choking handing the breathing mask back and forth desperately
this looks like it
d angle on the swat team gripping their weapons at the mouth of the corridor
they watch the boiling cloud waiting
e their pov on the wall of boiling smoke
a figure appears
walking totally unaffected
terminator emerges from the smoke
not even misty eyed
not what they expected
through megaphone stop where you are
lie down on the floor face down
down on floor now
he continues to stride toward them
the swats tense up
theyve never seen anything like this
theyre not sure what to do
closer and closer
they open fire
the corridor is filled with cracking thunder
the rounds tear into terminators chest
his leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him
the swats think the guys wearing body armor or something
they keep firing
the rounds tear into him staggering him slightly but he keeps moving
youre not hitting him
getting scared yes i am
terminator draws his
he shoots the nearest man in the left thigh
as he screams and drops terminator shoots him in the right thigh
terminator bends down and picks up the shrieking mans weapon
the tear gas launcher
it is one of those new rotary jobs that hold rounds in a big drum
terminator shoots the next swat in the chest with the tear gas launcher
the gas canister hits the guys body armor and doesnt penetrate
but its like getting slugged in the stomach with a full swing from a baseball bat
the swat fold double and hits the tiles gasping
terminator is an image from hell a tall figure in shredded black leather streaked with blood
one eye is a bloody socket the metal eye servo glistening
the flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath
the whole front of his jacket is blown open revealing his metal armor chest
the remaining swats start to fall back
one turns to run and kpow
a gas canister nail him in the back sending him sprawling
f terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby
it fills rapidly with the white gas cutting the visibility to a few feet
it is total pandemonium
swat leader crouches in the fog white knuckling the rifle
terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right in front of him
terminator drills him in the leg with the
as the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg terminator rips his gas mask off
the swat leader drops writhing to the floor choking and gagging clutching his bleeding thigh
terminator walks up to two swats at the front doors
leg and leg
he snatches their masks as they fall
the gunfire has stopped
nobody an see anything
screams and whimpers echo in the smoke
smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges
firing the tear gas launcher with one hand terminator launches all remaining rounds among the cop vehicles
unprotected officers run choking and half blind slamming into cars and tripping over each other
it is a total rout
at the swat van on of the swats is rapidly handing out the remaining masks to unprotected cops
a figure appears out of the smoke beside him
he looks up
his mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty launcher
instinctively he catches it
terminator grabs his flak vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist
terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the drivers seat
no keys in the ignition
he flips down the sun visor
the keys fall into his hand
he starts the van and slams it into gear
the tear gas has cleared to a thin haze
the uninjured swats are tending their wounded
they look up at the sound of shouts and a roaring engine
a the swat van crashes into the lobby in an explosion of glass and debris
cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a smoking one eighty sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads to the bank of elevators
terminator backs up until crunch he seals the corridor with the back of the van
b sarah and john stumble along the corridor coughing
they leap into the back of the van and terminator hits the throttle
the van roars across the lobby and exits through blown out windows
t astride the kawasaki looks down from a second floor office and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining cops firing at it
it looks around
it sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of this corner office block
it twists full throttle on the powerful bike
roars through the office accelerating fast straight at the windows t blasts out through the glass airborne on the motorcycle
it rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and a slams into the canopy
the impact of bike and rider pitches the chopper radically
the startled pilot fights to regain control as the bike tumbles to the pavement below
b the t doesnt
it clings to the shattered canopy
nightmarishly the pilot watches as the t smashes its head through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly pours itself through the jagged hole
it reforms instantly into its previous self on the passenger seat
c it hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the drivers seat
the chopper is auto rotating spinning out of control
it drops toward the parking lot
t recovers control ten feet above the ground
d cops hits the deck as the tail boom swings around going over them by inches
the chopper lifts out in a power climb roaring away across the parking lot toward the fleeing swat van
terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van onto a divided highway
sarah and john are catching their breath still coughing from the cs gas
terminator look to the rear view mirror
he sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them gaining
sarah looks around the inside of the swat van
it is a rolling armory
there are rifles ballistic vests all manner of equipment
john get under these
he sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet proof vests on top of him completely covering him
then she grabs two m s from the wall rack and loads them
she starts on a shotgun as the swat van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed
terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to be crawling
the van hits it top speed of eighty
they swerve to miss the back end of a white wheel tanker
a the chopper swings in behind them closing fast
b t reaches through the shattered canopy with the mpk machine pistol and fires
the back of the can clangs with hits
the door windows are blown in
terminator weaves the van trying to throw off the t s aim
the unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control
one of the doors is kicked open
sarah wearing a ballistic vest crouches in the doorway whipping up the m
she opens fire
c bullets riddle whats left of the choppers canopy as the t returns fire
the van is stitched with hits
d inside the van holes are punched through the thin sheet metal walls ripping up the interior
the vests covering john are hit repeatedly
we see that sarah has hung two kevlar vests on the inside of the back door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her
she pops back out and fires in controlled bursts
the m empties and she grabs another
e terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes hitting it and knocking it skidding
a sarah reloads and keeps firing
the van swerves around a toyota
a moment later the helicopter passes it the rotor just clearing the top of the car
b t fires the machine pistol
c sarah has popped out to fire
she takes a hit in the thigh and several rounds hammer into her kevlar vest
she is thrown back onto the floor of the van
she lies there an exposed target
d terminator sees the t preparing to fire again
he locks up the vans brakes
tires scream as the vehicle shimmies
sarah is thrown forward sliding up to the bulkhead next to john
and the helicopter slams right into the back of the van
the rotor disintegrates
the back doors of the van are crushed in as the canopy the whole front of the fuselage is hammered into junk trapping the t inside the twisted metal
the chopper hits the pavement flips sideways and cartwheels
smashing itself into a shapeless mass of twisted metal
it falls away behind the van tumbling end over end
a terminator fights to control the van which is fishtailing violently from the impact
it smashes up against the center divider screeching along the concrete and then pulls away
terminator puts the hammer down and the van accelerates
he swerves to avoid an ugly pickup crawling like a snail ahead
the right front fender of the van crumpled by slamming the wall is sawing into the tire
the tire blows and peels off the clean rim
the steel wheel grinds across the pavement striking trails of sparks and the van slides sideways and topples steel screams on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on
b inside the van john crawls to sarah who is groaning and holding her bleeding leg
she is white and shocky
terminator starts to extricate himself from the crumpled drivers seat
back down the road the helicopter wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk metal unrecognizable
behind it the tanker truck brakes hard shuddering and groaning trying to stop
the big tires lock up in clouds of tire smoke
the rig comes to a shuddering stop just short of the wrecked chopper
a the shaken driver jumps down
the behind the wreckage a cop emerges walking toward him
goddamn are you alri b ssshhck
t drives a blade through the mans abdomen and walks on past without slowing or even looking at him
c it climbs into the open cab of the tanker
releases the brake
as the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters on the side which say cryoco inc
liquid nitrogen supply
at the swat van john and terminator are carrying sarah out of the wreck
terminator has the m slung over his shoulder the bandolier of grenades and his
stuck in his waistband
john has borrowed a gauge riot gun from the swats
a the pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them
the driver a hispanic guy in his s is getting out to help them
terminator and john hear a crash and look back as the helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck
come on mom
we gotta keep moving
come on to the pickup owner we need your truck
the guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as terminator slides sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel
john runs to the passenger side
the tanker roars spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts up through the gears
terminator slams the pickup in gear checking the rear view
the tanker is a hundred feet behind them now and really moving
terminator puts the throttle down but the pickup is and old slug loaded down by a heavy home made wooden camper shell
it accelerates slowly
the tanker slams into one end of the swat van spinning it out of the way with a roar and screech of twisting metal
the wheeler shifts to a higher gear still accelerating
with the tanker right behind them terminator cuts the wheel swerving the pickup back and forth across the lanes
the big rig stays right on them it tanker whiplashing violently
hes right on us
terminator doesnt reply
he rapidly unslings the blooper still around his neck and reaches for a grenade
low angle on the tractor trailer as it roars right up to the lens filling frame with chrome and lights
a k wham
it rams the backs of the pickup sending it skidding
b then the t pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and crabs over sandwiching it against the center divider
the spinning chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail screeches along the other side
the pickup bucks and shakes insanely
it ricochets violently between the big rig and the divider horrible screech of tortured steel
sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides
the windshield shatters as the door posts buckle in
metal and glass shower in through the side windows
the frame twists and buckles
john feels like the fillings are being shaken right out of his teeth
the wooden camper disintegrates falling away as kindling behind them
t holds the wheel hard over mercilessly grinding the pickup
the whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained hammering
terminator slides toward the passenger side
keeping his foot on the gas he lifts john over him and puts him in the drivers seat
drive for a minute
where you going
terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand
held together by the plastic laminate the windshield flops out of its frame
it flies over the top of the truck
e terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up
he turns and aims the m one handed
the grenade misses the t by less than a foot
it explodes against the front bulkhead of the tanker almost at the top
liquid nitrogen pours from the opening swept back by the mph windstream
g the big rig swerves as t regains control
the tanker swings like a pendulum behind the cab
h the pickup accelerates getting back out in front by a few yards
behind it the big rig is trailing a swirling comet tail of nitrogen vapor
it is gaining again
terminator still standing opens the breech and starts to reload
i john cuts across the highway and takes an off ramp
j t swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the ramp after him still accelerating
it is twenty feet behind them and closing when terminator closes the breech and fires
k the grenade hits the front grill and explodes
the radiator is destroyed along with half the hood
steam blasts out obscuring the whole front of the truck
l the semi rams the back of the pickup again
spewing smoke and vapor like some demon locomotive the tractor trailer pounds into the back of the pickup
driving it right through the intersection at the bottom of the ramp and straight toward the chase has led them to an area of heavy industry
the gates are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup right through them
terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos and impacts
he has three grenades left on the bandolier
john isnt even steering
they are just being pushed
theres nothing he can do
they are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare which leads directly to the main building of the plant
a terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup
he leaps to the bed takes two powerful strides and leaps onto the semi
he climbs rapidly onto the hood
b and fires point blank through the windshield
right into t s face
the explosion blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke and fire terminator grabs onto the air horn as the truck starts to almost dream slow the
cab begins to swing sideways until its tires are shrieking over the pavement
the tractor is smashed back at right angles to the tanker trailer which begins to slide broadside
d the juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways across the pavement
it begins to topple
terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top
with an unholy scream like the unoiled hubs of hell the whole rig slides on its side at mph toward the steel mill
a sheet of sparks sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement
e john sees whats behind him then snaps around to see the building looming right in front
the huge rolling doors are partly open
he steers right through them into the mill as f terminator with one second to go leaps from the cab he flies through the open doors as the tanker hits
the building and terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls as the tanker trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side of the doors
thunderous carnage of twisting metal
o a it splits wide open
a river of liquid nitrogen pours out at
b john hits the brakes sliding out of control
he slows almost to a stop but hits a steel support column head on
he and sarah are slammed forward hard
c terminator still clutching the m blooper rolls and slides across the floor
he smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a massive machine
d the semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage into the building and shudders to a stop
liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab flooding out around it in a hissing wavefront of ultracold
freezing vapor swirls everywhere obscuring the wreck
e terminator lies still
then he rolls weakly rising on one elbow to survey the scene
f in the wrecked pickup john stirs
he is stunned and blood runs from his nose
dazed he realizes he is in a steel mill
there are sirens and he can see men running
he turns and sees what they are running from
g the wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker
it is a strange vista of fire and ice
the huge smelters pour out orange light and fire from the sides of the huge galley while the freezing vapor rolls down the center
h tight on the wreck
a billowing gray cloud
deep inside the shape of the cab in visible
a figure emerges pulling itself out
it drops to the floor
the hissing boiling river of liquid nitrogen flows around its feet
the t staggers moving slowly painfully
it has finally been affected by something
its feet are freezing to the ground as it walks
one of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle
it stumbles forward and b its other foot snaps off
as it catches its balance on the stump of its other ankle c the whole lower leg shatters at the impact
it topples forward to its knees
catches itself on one hand
liquid nitrogen flows around the hand
now the hand is stuck to the pavement
d the t pulls and
the hand snaps off at the wrist
it looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist
for the first time we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one
the expression is pain
its mouth opens in a soundless scream as the hoar frost races up its legs across its body
e and thats the position it freezes in
it has become a statue kneeling in the frozen vapor that surprised look of agony frozen on its face
the liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate
f terminator just beyond the boundary of the cold can see the t clearly
he draws his
hasta la vista baby
g k pow
the single shot blows the t into a million diamonds spraying up into the air
they shimmer across the ground for twenty feet in all directions
terminator lowers the gun satisfied
he looks like he needs a vacation
john and sarah have seen it from the pickup
she is in bad shape
conscious but very weak
he tries the door
he kicks it open
okay mom we gotta get out now come on
he helps her slide down from the seat of the truck
her knees give way
john has to take a lot of her weight
he reaches in and picks up the riot gun off the seat
they hobble toward a terminator
on his knees he looks into the dissipating cloud of vapor
the heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid nitrogen
insert tight on the floor the t shards are melting liquefying
hundreds of drops of mercury spattered across the floor
orange light of the enormous black furnaces dances on liquid metal
terminator struggles to rise
one arm is shattered the hand smashed and useless
and some leg servos are damaged
he can barely stand
john and sarah arrive
we dont have much time
john and sarah watch as insert t droplets are creeping together
fusing into larger blobs
these pools shiver and run together soon forming a central mass
on john and sarah realizing its not over
terminator gets one of sarahs arms over his shoulder and they go
behind them something is moving
a head is forming up out of a pool mercury
it rises as shoulders form
hunching up from the liquid mass
half formed it turns to look straight at them
john looks back in new terror as the t rises to man height
it is still in mercury form but its features are forming rapidly
it takes its first step after them
sarah stumbles and they pull her up
terminator himself has a pronounces limp dragging one leg with a shattered ankle joint
johns the one pulling straining driving them forward
they round a corner into it is a maze of monstrous machinery
the heat is tremendous
the air shivers with a pounding roar
sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again
come on mom you can do it
they drag her up and stagger on
her leg is bathed in blood and she is deathly pale
he looks back
the t steps into frame
the hell fire light glints on its impassive cop face
it walks forward
at first it seems unaffected by its crystallization but a angle on its hand as it touches a railing in passing
the railing is covered with o
yellow and black safety tape
the hand turns yellow and black the color fading to normal by about the elbow
it rips the hand from the railing with difficulty
there is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface
b the t looks at its yellow and black striped hand
it wills the hand back to normal
we see ripples of static or system noise moving subtly over the surface of its body
its starting to glitch
c tracking with the t s feet
with each step the pattern on the tile floor invades its lower legs
fades as the foot is lifted
returns as it is set down
the foot is trying to meld with the floor
the chameleonic function is out of control
the t is losing it
it moves forward searching
it rounds the corner entering the aisle between the furnaces
terminator sees the silhouette closing on them through the smoky gleam
the t breaks into loping run when it sees them terminator turns to sarah over john
john shakes his head no
the t is almost on them
john runs dragging half carrying sarah as best he can
she can barely stay conscious
half running delirious she stumbles and drops to her knees
john pulls but she cant rise
crying shouting come on you gotta try
john looks back to see a terminator trying to load the m
with his shattered hand he can barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech
t smacks the weapon out of his hands
it clatters to the floor
the grenade spins across the floor rolling under some machinery
terminator lunges slamming the t against a wall with all his weight
the battle is joined
b john and sarah have reached the back of the aisle
it is a cul de sac blocked on the end by the base of an immense smelter crucible
they turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette backlit by the molten sparks falling from the furnaces above
the battle which will decide their fate
c terminator grabs the t and hurls it with awesome force against the opposite wall of the narrow alley
in less time than it would take to turn the d t morphs trough itself front to back
face emerging from the back of its head
e it comes off the wall straight at terminator who smashes his good fist into its face
the pile driver blow buries terminators fist almost to the elbow
f but the t s head morphs in a split second into a hand which grips terminators wrist and the head emerges somewhere else the geometry shifting faster than we
g the t slams terminator into a large machine jamming his arm into the moving works
a massive sliding bar scissors his arm smashing it into junk at the elbow pinning him in the machine
terminator strains against the machine pinning him
we hear his servos whining with overload
the t turns and lopes toward sarah and john
sarah screams and hurls john into a gap between the machines
he falls into a maze of pipes and girders
john turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap
she could follow him but she doesnt
suddenly a dark mass moves toward him
john gasps as a huge steel counterweight driven by a chain inches thick slides toward him
he rolls out of the way
when he looks back he cannot see the opening
terminator strains to reach a foot steel bar lying near him
steel workers use them to move the red hot ingots around
he gets hold of the end and uses it as a lever
with titanic effort he spreads the massive components which are holding him and withdraws him arm which is severed at the elbow
dangling junk hands from the crushed joint
sarah has lost sight of john
it is much of a goodbye as they will have
she turns as the t closes on her
she is half slumped against the sooty machines looking barely conscious
she struggles to load a shell into the empty weapon
at the last instant she whips up the riot gun and fires
a t s face is blown open but quickly reforms as it closes on her
she fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but a thunk
a steel needle slams through her shoulder pinning her
the polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand
the index finger extends as a gleaming needle toward her eye call to john
something whistles down on the t with such force that is cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval
the foot steel bar is imbedded in its body
terminator hurls the killer off sarah
d the t pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with fury
swinging again and again
hammering terminator back
terminator falls back against the wall
behind the t is an enormous i beam hanging from two chains
it is used to lift ingots into the smelters and it runs on a linear track
e the t grabs the i beam and rolls it down the track
straight at terminator
the two ton girder smashes into his chest crushing the armor
the t pulls the i beam back and then heaves it forward again
terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder
we hear metal crush and break inside him
he sags turning to grip the wall
the third blow slams into his back smashing his spine and pelvis
we hear servos ratcheting and failing
he drops to his knees crucified on a wall of machinery
the fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades
sound of crushing metal
his skull is partially caved in
he slides to the floor
f on the t emotionless as it walks forward
g terminator is a pathetic shape on the floor
he is trying to crawl feebly
dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine
his arm stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward
his exposed machine eye burns red with determination
we see his prize
he has the m with the breech still open cradled in the crook of his ruined arm
he good hand the exposed steel one is reaching for the last grenade which is visible under the skirt of the massive smelter base
his metal fingers reach out for it as h the t raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down with unbelievable force
it punches into terminators back through a gap in the shattered armor
the t levers it back and forth widening the hole
then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it down
it punches right through
emerging from terminators chest
and into the floor
he is pinioned
the cyborg sags face down and stop moving
the light goes out of his eye
john scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter
above him vast machines churn untended
he hears a voice
sarahs calling low and urgent to him
can you hear me
where are you
a he crawls out of the shadows
onto a landing next to one of the smelter crucibles
molten steel glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace
heat shimmers the air giving everything a hallucinatory quality
john sees sarah nearby limping toward him
she can barely move her leg bathed in blood
he runs toward her
gasping help me honey
tight on sarah her stoic face as she hobbles forward reaching out to him
something rises behind her out of focus
another identical sarah
but this one has a shotgun
aimed right at us
a john freezes
which is which
he looks down
the first sarahs feet are melded with the floor sucking and fusing with the tiles as she walks
they have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the knee
john get out of the way
screaming b john dives aside
the sarah form spins changing into you know who
sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it
it staggers back
she chambers another round
it staggers again
c the t is blown back a step and sarah advances with each shot
the craters in the t s body heal slowly
its power is waning
she fires again
her eyes blazing with feral intensity
she walks it back right to the edge of the pit of molten steel
the t is right at the edge
in a second it will recover its composure as its crater hits close slowly
she has failed
now it will kill them both except
closeup terminator as the chain drive brings it into view
half human flesh half chrome steel
his red eye gazes right at us as he a the t takes the round in the belly
the grenade explodes inside its body
a huge hole is blown clean through it and it is ripped open and peeled back half inside out
it topples into the molten steel and the t s head and upper body reappear above the molten steel
it is screaming
a terrifying inhuman siren of a scream
it is changing morphing transforming into anything and everything its ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it we catch a glimpse of janelle voight checkered with the
linoleum tile colors lewis the guard with knives exploding from his face other faces switching at a stroboscopic rate now
a face every two frames until they merge into one face the t screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel
we see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the superheated surface
until it vanishes swirling into nothing
john runs to sarah
she stands staring into the pit
the empty shotgun slips from her fingers
clatters to the floor
he sees that shes okay and he runs to the fallen terminator
a the crippled cyborg is trying to rise
its servos whine and stutter
it pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position collapses
john lifts for all hes worth
sarah joins them helping
the help the crippled machine get on its feet
it can barely stand
i need a vacation
they walk to the edge of the pit
terminator looks down and sees that it is over
to terminator is it dead
john unzips sarahs backpack and takes out the hand of the first terminator
will it melt in there
throw it in
it sinks into the lava
and the chip
john takes it out of his pocket
looks at it
tosses it into the smelter
its finally over
there is another chip
he touches a metal finger to the side of his head
and it must be destroyed also
john suddenly understands what he means
terminator looks at sarah
they both know what must be done
john shakes his head
im sorry john
no no no
itll be okay
stay with us
i have to go away john
dont do it
dont go tears are streaming down his face
tight closeup terminator turning toward john
the human side of his face is in shadow so we see mostly the chrome skull and the red eye
it must end here
or i am the future
i order you not to
terminator puts his hand on johns shoulder
he moves slightly and the human side of his face comes into the light
he reaches toward johns face
his metal finger touches the tear trickling down his cheek
i know now why you cry
but it is something i can never do
to both of them goodbye
sarah looks at terminator
reaches out her hand to shake it
they lock eyes
are you afraid
he turns and steps off the edge
they watch him sink into the lava
the metal hand sinking last
at the last second it forms into a fist with the thumb extended
a final thumbs up
then it is gone
hold on john and sarah watching through the heat ripples as we tilting down reveal that we are in a park very green
people are casually dressed having fun
children are playing in a playground
beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of washington d
with the capital building and the washington monument
the skyline is subtly changed with a lot of new buildings advanced high rises
july we boom down and track laterally through a playground in the foreground
children swinging on swings
sliding down slides
timeless things that decades of technical advancement will not change
as we track we hear august th came and went
nothing much happened
michael jackson turned forty
there was no judgment day
people went to work as they always do laughed complained watched tv made love
we pass a jungle gym neither melted nor burned but full of kids swinging and yelling raucously
past it we drop down to see a boy pumping the pedals of a tricycle
i wanted to run down the street yelling
to grab them all and say every day form this day is a gift
use it well
instead i got drunk
still tracking we come to rest on an elderly woman seated on a bench
it is sarah now years old
the world has aged her but she seems at peace in this moment
she speaks into a microcassette recorder
that was thirty years ago
but the dark future which never came still exists for me and it always will like the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light
and the war against the machines goes on
or to be more precise the war against those who build the wrong machines
there is a man in is forties playing with two small children nearby
it is john connor
through he has the same stern features in adulthood there is no eye patch no scarring
he is far from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might have been
but there is still penetrating intelligence even wisdom in his eyes
john fights the war differently than it was foretold
here on the battlefield of the senate the weapons are common sense
a four year old girl runs to her to have her shoelace tied
tie me grandma
grandma sarah smiles
it is the only time we have seen her smile so far
she bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench
she ties as we hear the luxury of hope was given to me by the terminator
because if a machine can learn the value of human life
maybe we can too
sarah ruffles the kidss hair as she runs off to play with her dad
