max jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him self in the darkness
he has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted good looking face
then he notices the blood dripping from his nose
max wipes it
maxs voiceover begins monday september first
a pull string light flips on
max examines his bloody nose in the mirror
the alchemist awakes
imitating turn lead into gold max lead into gold
today i find it
maxs hand as three unmarked circular pills hit his palm
then he slams the pills into the back of his mouth
max replaces the cap on a plastic bottle of unmarked prescription drugs
he drinks from the sink and splashes a generous amount of water onto his head and face cleaning his nose
he wipes his nose and examines the last remnants of blood on his fingertip
then he dips his finger under the tap
maxs room is constantly dark because the windows are blacked out
he flips on his desk lamp
a tiny ant crawls across his desk
he looks at it for a moment before getting angry and squashing it
sitting on the desk are three computer monitors which max flips on
then he pops on more lights and more switches
we pull back revealing that maxs apartment looks more like the inside of a computer than a humans home
the room is knee high in computer parts of all shapes and sizes
the walls are covered with circuit boards
cables hang from the ceiling like vines in a brazilian rain forest
they all seem to be wired together forming a monstrous homemade computer
this is euclid maxs creation
the computer is alive with sounds and lights
max works on euclid with his solder and drill
he cares for the machine as if it were his dream car heats been getting to euclid
feel it most in the afternoon when i run the set
have to keep the fans on all night from now on
otherwise everything is running topnotch
the stack of s is now faster than columbias computer science department
i spent a couple hundred dollars
half a million
small snicker ha
max checks the peephole on his front door
no one is there
he unbolts the five lock and slides into the hall
as he secures his apartment a young girl named jenna runs up to him
her mom down the hall looks apologetic
jennas eyes light up and she pulls out her fisher price calculator
can we do one
over and over again jenna
whats three hundred and twenty two times four hundred and ninety one
jenna types it into her calculator
max finishes locking his door
instantly one hundred fifty eight thousand a hundred two
eyes light up right
max heads down the staircase
jenna screams after him
okay seventy three divided by twenty two
instantly again three point three one eight one eight one eight
max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of chinatown
the streets are clogged with people
somewhere in there
i know its right in front of me
they say its chaos it cant be understood too much complexity
max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an endless dump for old and rotting computers
history its there
structuring hiding right beneath the surface
he unscrews a random ibm board from a keyboard and slides it into his pocket
on max looking up at something as he reclines on a public bench
the cycling of disease epidemics the wax and wane of caribou populations in the arctic sunspot cycles the rise and fall of the nile and yes
the new york stock exchange they are all the same
on a tree branch shaking gently in the wind
bright stock quotes drift across the screen
ill find this structure this order this perfection
max stares intensely at the ticker on the small tv that sits next to his monitors
turn lead into gold
the numbers of the stock market are my lead
when i find the pattern then i will find gold
max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers appear
he wants to see whats before that edge
max slaps the return button on his computer
the phone starts ringing
max eyes it suspiciously
just then euclid starts printing results on an old dot matrix printer
max suspiciously answers the phone
maximilian cohen please
my name is marcy dawson
im a partner with the predictive strategy firm lancet percy
can i speak with mr
i told you
the printer finishes printing
how are you
its been a long time
sorry i havent been in touch
but i was hoping you would allow me to take you to lunch tomorrow say one oclock
sorry i cant
were very anxious to talk with you sir i cant
im prepared to make you a generous
max hurries to wrap up the conversation
i dont take offers for my research
you know that
sorry i couldnt help you
cohen give me a moment
but before marcy finishes max hangs up
he rips off the printout and heads to the front door
he checks the peephole his landlady
ovadia is sweeping the hallway stairs humming a turn of the century the last one not this one tune
max waits a moment
he tousles his hair
then he checks again
he opens his locks and releases several bolts
max locks his front door
meanwhile his next door neighbor devi minstry a sexy young indian woman is just getting home
max looks away and tries to get his door locked
shes weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food
i grabbed you some somosas
devi heads over to max with her bags of food
she looks up at max
devi hands the bags to max
then she goes to pat down his hair
what are you doing
your hair you cant go out like that
devi pats down his hair
max is humiliated
you need a mom
max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs
i have to go
an embarrassed max takes the bag
at the counter max stirs cream into his coffee
then he takes three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his coffee
max flips past a full page ad in the paper that reads max flips the page before he or we can absorb it
he compares stock quotes in the wall street journal against his printout
sixteen twenty seven
results euclid shows tomorrows dow closing up by four points
anomalies include pronet at sixty fire and a quarter a career high
possible explanations either a an error in the june fifth algorithm or b euclids main processor is running a recursion
max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders his bits and misses
then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in bothering max
he fans it away when oh sorry am i bothering you
max shrugs and looks over
the voice belongs to lenny meyera bearded man in his late s sucking on a cigarette
on closer inspection something is off
it seems that lenny is an orthodox jew
his yarmulke sticks out slightly from his wide brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi tsis hang out from the bottom of his untucked shirt
ill put it out
which he does the names lenny meyer lenny sticks out his hand
max responds with a small nod
and you are
max shrugs and turns back to his work
joking im a jew too
serious do you practice
no im not interested in religion
have you ever heard of kabbalah
im sorry im very busy
its just that its a very exciting time in our history
right now is a critical moment in time
yes its very exciting
have you ever put on tefillin
max has no idea what lennys talking about
lenny pulls a leather box with black leather straps from his pocket
you know tefillin
i know it looks strange
but its an amazing tradition that has a tremendous amount of power
its a mitzvah for all jewish men to do
mitzvahs good deeds are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads
and then max notices that his thumb is twitching he grabs it self consciously
they purify us and bring us closer to god
you want to try it
just then max pays his bill and prepares to leave
i gotta go
are you okay
im sorry bye
well maybe some other time
max splashes water on his face
please god let it be a small one
he pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet
then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine
he rolls up his sleeve dabs alcohol on his arm and fires the gun into his arm
sixteen thirty five
second headache in under twenty four hours
theyre getting more frequent now
more painful too
drugs dont work just take the edge off of it
just gotta wait for the nosebleed
relief comes from my nose
next door he hears devi and her boyfriend talking
so i gotta make this drop off in harlem and on the way down theres these three kids hailing me
max slaps himself in the face a few times
i was tight so
max watches his thumb twitch
and then pain shoots through him
he grabs the right side of his head massages it and pushes it in with his fingers
in the mirror he examines the right side of his scalp
he sees nothing ahh
max walks back into the and sits down in a chair
the lamp is blinding so he snaps it off
only the bathroom light lights the room
he takes a few breaths
leave me alone
his neighbors conversation begins to build in volume and distortion
so i drop them off in the village and they dart
max gags and rubs his head
i get out grab my bat and start running
one of the kids maybe sixteen i catch a block later hes cursing at me calling me a paki bastard
so i whacked him right in the head
the pain seems to disappear
max looks at his hand that was rubbing his bead
then he looks at the front door
the doorknob seems to move
something begins knocking on maxs door
the knocking gets louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock
farrouhks words begin to overpower max
im kicking the bastard in the ribs banging his ass knocking his head against the curb harder and harder i fucking lost it
a hot dog guy starts screaming youre cracking his skull youre cracking his skull
so they pulled me off of him and calmed me down
cops said he had it coming to him
then something starts pounding the door
the doorknob quivers the locks unbolt
the chains are the only thing keeping out the intruder
the door shakes and the chains are strained
max is paralyzed with terror
and then the door smashes open
blinding light fills the room and we crash into the a moment of silence then we a phone rings incessantly
maxs eyes pop open
hes scrunched up in a corner of the room squashed beneath the sink
his nose is bleeding
max crawls into the and picks up the phone
he pinches his nose and tilts his head back
marcy dawson here again i was just looking over my schedule and i realized ill be in your neighborhood tomorrow around three
max heads to the and checks the locks
he is barely listening to marcy groggy who is
the locks seem secure
marcy dawson from lancet percy im so anxious to meet you
it will be worth itfor both of us i promise
see you at your house at three okay
oh dont worry i got your address from columbia
so three it is
looking forward to it
max tries to stop her but before he can marcy hangs up
a bewildered max slowly hangs up
max checks the peephole all clear
then he opens his which is filled with random computer parts and boxes
he pulls a thick neuroscience book from a shelf in the back of the closet
he almost knocks over an old dusty brass microscope on the shelf
max flips through the book
it contains old plates illustrating the brain
max examines some of the diagrams
s ls hallway day max rings the bell on an apartment door
a few moments pass and then sol robeson opens the door
sol is a wise looking man in his early s
he walks with difficulty leaning out of breath on a wooden cane
his arms are covered with faded russian prison tattoos and he speaks with a thick eastern european accent hes happy to see max
how are you max is happy to see sol but hes a bit bashful and intimidated
tight on the japanese game of go being played
sol is white and max is black
sols moves are secure and controlled while max is hesitant
stop thinking max just feel
use your intuition
its the only way to get into the flow
beat what did you think of hamlet
i didnt get to it
its been a month
knowingly you havent taken a single break
im so close sol
im so close but i just cant grab it
sol changes the subject
he feeds his goldfish and points to one of them
have you met the new fish my niece bought me
i named her icarus
my renegade pupil
you fly too high youll get burned
max looks up at sol
the more i see you the more i see myself thirty years ago
my greatest pupil
published at ph
but life isnt just mathematics
i spent forty years looking for patterns in pi i found nothing
you found things
i found things but not a pattern
max sits in the corner of a rickety new york city subway car
the train is almost completely deserted
max looks down at his hand
he opens his palm and reveals a black go chip
tuesday september second eighteen twelve
if sol hadnt gotten sick who knows where math would be
he spent years in the numbers of pi
searching for meaning for order
max notices a skinny man in a business suit staring at him
the man catches maxs eye and looks away but then he quickly looks back making max turn away
he looks down at his wall street journal and draws a circle with its diameter then he writes a pir and c pir
next he writes pi
three point one four
off into infinity and maybe insanity
somewhere in there he wanted sanity
sanity like he found in the circles pi represented
simple sane circles
if only the stock market had circles
some type of sanity
some type of form of shape
suddenly max hears someone singing
max looks up
it is the skinny man and hes singing with passion
its all very strange to max who nervously looks away
and then the singing stops mid verse max looks up and the man is gone
max looks aroundno one in sight
max heads up the stairs to his apartment
just then a toy slinky appears from nowhere marching down the stairs
max stops and waits until the slinky hits his foot
he picks it up and looks at it
he looks around wondering whats going on
then jenna leans out over a railing and starts laughing at max
max sits at the counter frantically looking at the wall street journal
he plops three pills into his coffee
he draws circles and other shapes across the page
max is interrupted by a puff of smoke
at the same time someone touches his shoulder and says hey max how you doing
motioning to the cigarette ill put it out
which be does so what do you do
um i work with computers math
what type of math
no way i work in theory too
not traditional though
points to his yarmulke i work with the torah
awed by the coincidence amazing
passing it of as a coincidence yeah
you know hebrew is all numbers
its all math
lenny pulls out a worn dog eared bible from his pocket
there are paper slips marking what seems like every other page
when he opens it up max sees that the pages are marked up by highlighter pens notes and diagrams
lenny points to the text
extreme close up of hebrew letters
the ancient jews used hebrew as their numerical system
each letter is a number
lenny pulls out a pen and grabs maxs journal
he writes on it as he talks
the hebrew a the number
the hebrew b bet is two
you can take any hebrew text and turn them into a long string of numbers
the waitress refills maxs coffee
the torah is just a long string of numbers
some say that its a long code sent to us from god
satisfied lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag
mildly impressed kind of interesting
proud of himself yeah like take the hebrew word for say the garden of eden kadem
kuf dalei mem
kuf is a hundred
daled four mem forty
they equal one hundred and forty four
then take the tree of knowledge
in the garden aat ha haim it equals two hundred and thirty three
now you can take that number and
theyre fibonacci numbers
the fibonacci sequence
italian mathematician thirteenth century
if you divide a hundred and forty four into two hundred and thirty three it approaches theta
the greek symbol for the golden ratio
the golden spiral
lenny exhales the smoke
max quickly graphs the number on his wall street journal
youre right i never saw that before
thats the series you find in nature
like the face of a sunflower
wherever theres spirals
you see theres math everywhere
lennys smoke drifts by maxs eyes
slow motion maxs pov of smoke spirals spinning in front of him
slow motion max looks down at his coffee cup
he pours cream into his coffee
it shoots up and mixes with the black coffee forming spirals in the mug
slow motion max looks at the spiral he just drew on the wall street journal
normal speed suddenly max stands up
oh my god
max draws spirals all over his wall street journal
then he takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the entire page
max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes moments to wake up drops pills and drinks a ginseng soda
tuesday september second
twenty twenty two
shapes in the market
and theyre spirals
max traces a big circle on the journal
then he cuts it out with an x acto blade
he cuts out the middle of the circle so that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees
he tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in front of him into a spiral
a circle spread out overtime
its open ended
it has a beginning and it grows and changes through time
if i can find where it fits if i can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers then i can calculate the future
lead into gold
chaos into order madness into sanity
pain into bliss
max is about to slap return but he stops himselfhes nervous
next door devi and her boyfriend are making love
he looks at the wall with disdain
then he looks back at the screen shrugs and confidently slaps return on his keyboard
stock prices float across the screen
max cant believe his eyesthe quotes are absurd
and then euclid crashes
the electricity in maxs room flips off
the numbers on maxs screen fade to black
in near minus streetlights darkness shit
max removes a fuse
he replaces it with a penny
max tries to reboot euclid but nothing happens
he tries a second time but nothing happens
devi and farrouhk are still at it
max puts on a pair of latex gloves
he dons a surgical mask
he climbs up to a loft above his monitors
a glass case fed cool air by a vent tube encases some computer parts
he carefully removes the front glass cover
then he gets it off hes stunned
not only have the chips melted down but a strange flaky substance covers the board
max grabs his face frustrated
deri and farroakk are giggling having a great time
max stares at the wall
then he angrily throws euclids mainframe onto the ground it lands with a smash
under the mainframe is a small city of ants
they scramble for cover
max furiously attacks them stomping them out with his bands
then he jumps on the smashed mainframe
he slides to the ground and covers his face
tight on a tree branch shaking manically in the wind
max sits on a park bench watching the branch shake
it terrifies him
he pulls out the printout of his picks and examines them
wednesday september third seven fifteen
results aar at fourteen and a halflow very low
abr at six and a halfjeez
six and a half abr hasnt been beneath twenty in ten years
there is no pattern
chaos chaos all chaos
he crumples up his picks and tosses them into a public trash can
sol and max play go
sol is peaceful while max is distant
max plays a piece absently
sol counters with a deafening atari
max whispers euclid crashed
i lost all my data my hardware
i dont know first i got these horrible picks
then euclid spits out some numbers
never saw anything like it and then it fries
the whole machine just crashed
you have a printout
the picks the number
i threw it out
what was the number it spit out
i dont know just a long string of digits
i dont know
intense what was it a hundred and fifty a thousand two hundred sixteen
i dont know
probably around two hundred
i dealt with some bugs back in my pi days
i was wondering if it was similar to one i ran into
sol begins to feed his fish
he points to one
have you met archimedes
the one with the black spot
remember archimedes of syracuse
the king asks archimedes to determine if a present hes received was actually solid gold
unsolved problem at the time
it tortures the great greek mathematician for weeks
insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns on his bed for nights on end
finally his equally exhausted wife shes forced to share a bed with this genius convinces him to take a bath to relax
while stepping into the tub he observes the bathwater rise as he enters
a way to determine volume
and thus a way to determine density weight over volume
and thus archimedes solves the problem
he screams eureka
greek for i found it
and is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the kings castle to report his discovery
now whats the moral of the story
that a breakthrough will come
the point of the story is the wife
listen to your wife she will give you perspective
meaning you need a break max you have to take a bath otherwise youll get nowhere
there will be no order only chaos
go home and take a bath
max waits for his train on an empty platform
just then he hears a dripping sound
max looks up and notices something across the tracks on the other platform
he cant quite make it out because his vision is blocked by columns
he gets up and spots a young hasidic man standing at him
blood drips from the mans hand
max doesnt know what to make of it max reads an ad that says in big block letters moshiac is coming
he checks out a few of the other passengers
then he notices a man reading a newspaper across from him
the headline reads market takes nose dive
max jumps up and approaches the man
hey excuse me can i see that
the man hands max the paper
max scans the article
then he quickly turns to the listings
his finger barrels down a column
it stops at abr
six and a half
max looks up the column for aar
fourteen and a half
max stumbles toward the doors
he looks out the window into the darkness of the tunnel
out of breath my god
gets pumped to himself yes
hey paper please
max hands the paper back and looks at the man for the first time
it is the skinny man he saw earlier
max gets suspicious and moves into the next car
he notices that the skinny man gets off one car down as well
he hustles toward the exit
as hes about to turn a corner he looks back
the man seems to be following him
he dodges around a corner and heads up a staircase
he seems to have lost him when he notices a business woman with a pretty face heading right toward him
it is marcy mr
marcy sticks out her hand
max not knowing what else to do shakes it
i was just waiting for you
i thought you stood me up so i was going to head home
who are you
from lancet percy
we were supposed to meet at three
im sorry i dont
marcy hasnt let go of maxs hand
she guides him toward a large black street limo thats just pulled up
i cant tell you what a pleasure it is to finally meet you
ive studied your papers for years
i have something you wont be able to say no to
why dont we take a spin in the limo
no no no really i cant
were excited by your work
we cant wait to discuss
max attempts to pull away but marcy is firm on leading him to the car
meanwhile the shinny man is heading right at them
the chauffeur reaches out to him
max yanks his arm free and runs away
he whips around a corner
max barrels into the grocery store and buys a journal
he heads to the back of the store and lays the paper across the juice section
he checks the listing
on the nose
on the damn nose
max turns the page on the journal and sees the lancet percy ad
then he notices one of the bodega owners staring at him
max scouts his front door
the coast is clear
max examines the smashed euclid mainframe
he uncovers some of the strange filo like substance
he carefully touches it
then he grabs a small pinch of it
he examines it near a light bulb
he cant guess what it is
he sniffs it
he carefully tastes it with the very tip of his tongue
he still doesnt have a clue
max opens his closet
he pulls out his dusty brass microscope
he dusts it off
next he pulls out a slide kit
max places the instrument on the windowsill
he grabs an old glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it
he slides it under the microscope
he looks into the lens but doesnt see anything
he gets up quickly and heads for the where he looks at devis door nervously
he gathers his courage and knocks on her door
through the door hears
um no its max from next door
devi opens the door wearing a sexy nightshirt
max is everything all right
do you have any iodine
concerned she reaches for maxs hands iodine
did you cut yourself
pulling his hands away no
i just need it to stain a slide
ah science the pursuit of knowledge
she heads to her bathroom
max waits impatiently
here we are
what are you examining at the door a potato
she hands max a bottle of iodine
just something with my computer
max uses his pinky to drip a drop of iodine on the slide
through the wall he hears farrouhk arriving home
the neighbors up to his old science
max listens to the conversation for a few moments
why are you talking to that dork
i just helped
pounds on wall
hey dork leave my girlfriend alone
max shakes his bead
then he finishes preparing the slide and slips the glass under the turret
max catches the low hanging sun in the microscopes mirror and reflects it through the sample and up the turret into his eye
maxs pov down the turret of some strange substance
max pulls out the slide and looks at it
i dont give a shit
ill kill the dork
exploding again you hear me
ill kill you
ill fucking kill you
then an idea comes to him
he takes out his brain book
he looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons
he compares the image to the view through the turret
they look different but there are similarities
come here baby
max rushes out
max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from yesterday
frustrated he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk and starts looking through it mrs
ovadia watches him
max sees her and is embarrassed for a moment
i just threw out something
i didnt realize i needed it
just a printout
i uh lost my data
max looks back at the trash and forgets about mrs
soon max gets up and kicks the trashcan
he heads home
max watches marcy get out of the limo and call to mrs
max backs away when he smacks into someone
its lenny meyer the young jewish man
max jumps back in fear
how you doing
max tries to quickly pass him
hey where you going
you got a few moments to do tefillin
max turns around and notices marcy talking to mrs
ovadia points up the street toward him
i gotta car we can cruise over to my
you gotta car
yeah right there
thats ephraim my friend
we swing around with max and see a station wagon
ephraim sits in the passenger seat
hes a big boned bearded orthodox jew
all tight lets go
they head for the station wagon
the synagogue is a claustrophobic fluorescent lit room in general disarray
two rows of imitation wooden pews face a makeshift altar and ark
young hasidic men study texts
some work alone reading and dovening
others are in small groups sharing in heated discussions
lenny wraps the tefillin around maxs arm
max just wants to get out of there
ephraim prays in the background
lenny i dont really want to do
do it for me
it means a lot having someone of your stature performing a mitzvah in my presence
beat when you told me your name was max cohen i didnt realize you were the max cohen
you know me
f course ive followed your research since your columbia days
youve inspired the work we do
yes very much so
the only difference is were not looking at stocks
were searching for a pattern in torah
lenny finishes wrapping maxs arm
he reaches for another box and strap
what kind of pattern
were not really sure
our calculations have shown us that there is a number encoded in the text
what sort of number
we dont know
all we know is that its two hundred and sixteen digits long
max stunned looks at lenny
this one just goes over your head
lenny places the other teffilin over maxs head
max collects himself
coolly two sixteen
now we have to say a small prayer repeat after me
bewildered max does
after the prayer
wasnt so bad was it
you feel anything
lenny starts removing the teffillin from max
what is it
its a prayer about our dedication to our one and only god
attempting calmness no i mean the number the two sixteen number
what is it
we dont know
we just know that its the most common number encoded in the text
it might be some type of linguistic pattern
if we could figure out what the number is we could maybe answer that
tell me more
max firmly rings sols bell
in a few moments sol answers the door in his pajamas
whats going on sol
relax its early
max sits at the kitchen table while sol heats up a pot of tea
max is shaking
now whats up
whats the two hundred and sixteen number sol
you asked me if i had seen a two hundred and sixteen digit number right
oh you mean the bug
i found it working on pi
what do you mean by found it
whats this all about max
well theres these religious jews who have
well you know hassidim
i met one in the coffee shop
the guys a number theorist
the torah is their data set
the thing is theyre searching for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the torah
whats it mean to them
they say they dont know but thats crazy
i mean what are the odds
its just a coincidence
but hold on theres something else
you remember those strange picks i got
yesterdays stock picks
well it turns out that they were correct
i hit two picks on the nose
smack on the nose
somethings going on and it has to do with that number
the answer is there
max its a bug
its a pattern
a pattern is in that number come with me
sol and max sit on either side of a half played go board
listen to me
the ancient japanese considered the go board to be a microcosm of the universe
although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered in fact the possibilities of game play are endless
they say that no two go games have ever been alike
just like snowflakes
so the go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe
that is the truth of our world max
it cant be easily summed up with math
there is no simple pattern
but as a go game progresses the possibilities become smaller and smaller
the board does take on order
soon all moves are predictable
so maybe even though were not sophisticated enough to be aware of it there is an underlying order
a pattern beneath every go game
maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market in the torah
the two sixteen number
that is insanity max
or maybe its genius
i have to get that number
hold on you have to slow down
youre losing it you have to take a breath
listen to yourself
youre connecting a computer bug i had a computer bug you might have had and some religious hogwash
if you want to find the number two sixteen in the world youll be able to pull it out of anywhere
two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door
two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator
when your mind becomes obsessed with anything it will filter everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere
three hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty twenty three
youve chosen two sixteen and youll find it everywhere in nature
but max as soon as you discard scientific rigor you are no longer a mathematician
you become a numerologist
what you need to do is take a break from your research
you need it
you deserve it heres a hundred dollars i want you to take it
if you wont take it borrow it
either way take a break
spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation
real world stuff okay
max looks at his bands
just try it
in a week youll laugh about this
think about it
max gives a half nod
max rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him
a limo pulls up next to him
marcy dawson jumps out of the car mr
please stop for a second mr
max stops and faces marcy
damn it already
stop following me
im not interested in your money
im searching for a way to understand our world
im searching for perfection
i dont deal with mediocre materialistic people like you
im very sorry
i admit ive been a bit too aggressive
but all i ask is for five minutes of your time
marcy hands max a metal stopwatch
allow me the four and a half minutes left let me tell you what i want
let me tell you what i can offer you
afterwards if you dont want to talk to me then fine we part as friends and i promise that you will never see me again
thats fair isnt it
after a moment he looks at the stopwatch go
its funny even though we have different aims and different goals were actually incredibly alike
we both seek the same thingperfection
clearly were seeking different types of perfection but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership
if you let me i can be your greatest ally
take the acacia tree
in east africa
it is the most prevalent plant in all of kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator the giraffe
to accomplish this the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant
the tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants in return for shelter the ants supply defense
when a giraffe starts to eat the trees leaves the shaking branch acts like an alarm
the ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffes tongue
the giraffe learns its lesson and never returns
without each other the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal african sun both would die
but with each other they succeed they survive they surpass
they have different aims different goals but they work together
max we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you
handing back the stopwatch im not interested
allow me to dose
the chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and brings it over
as a sign of good faith we wish to offer you this
i told you i dont want money
the suitcase isnt filled with fifties or gold or diamonds
a ming mecca chip
theyre not declassified
max starts to move away
but lancet percy has many friends
come here take a look
stuttering what do
but then max notices that his thumb is twitching
beautiful isnt it
you know how rare
are you okay
yeah i got to go
but what about
let me think about it
max trots off
the station is strangely silent
it is also extremely rundown
the tracks are rusted and fucked up
all we hear is the sound of dripping water
the sound is warped and grows and morphs until its downright scary
max sits on a bench sucking down pills
his head begins to hurt
he touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it
as the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of pain
he gags several times
then the pain lets loose and all max wants to do is die
he smashes the side of his head with his fist
across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone
for a moment maxs pain dissipates
his view is obscured by the columns
max gets up and sees the young hasidic man from earlier staring at him
the man stares at max without any emotion
max notices blood dropping from the mans right hand
max looks at the mans face and sees for a split second his own face staring back
max charges up a flight of stairs
he crosses a passage over the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the platform
the man is gone
a pool of blood sits where the man was
max touches it with his toe
he notices a trail of blood leading off from the pool
he follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner
he notices something strange in the shadows
he carefully advances on it
hiding in the shadows is what looks like a small piece of brain
it seems to be moving slightly
max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it
suddenly max hears a trains honk honk behind him
max spins around
nothing is there but silence
he turns back to the gray matter
he touches it again
once again he hears the deafening honk honk
max spins around but nothing is there
frustrated he pushes his pen deep into the brain fiber ripping apart
suddenly a train is barreling down on max
seconds from impact max screams
we hear two deep long sleep filled breaths and then we cut maxs eyes pop open
a transit cop is sticking him with a nightstick
up buddy coney island last stop
max sits up
his nose is bleeding
the cop hands him a tissue
max wipes his nose and looks around nervously
he sees the rides of coney island in the distance
max sits on a boulder on a coney island jetty
he watches the sea
then max sees an old man dressed like king neptune scanning the shore with a rusty metal detector
the old man picks up something
he admires it for a moment before gently setting it back on the ground
then neptune continues his search
max wanders over to the place where the old man exam maxs pov through the microscope
max sees the brain structures
just then theres a knock on the door
the knock startles him and his hand bumps the turret of the microscope
the lens moves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed
a knock again
max looks out the peephole and sees nothing
confused looks down at his thumb
its not shaking
he heads back to his microscope
theres a knock again
max angrily unlocks the door and whips it open
in the hallway is jenna with her calculator
max max can we do one
i cant now jenna
im working now later okay
max shuts the door and returns to the microscope
he changes the magnification
at a weaker magnification the mathematician sees that the cells are grouped in spirals
max is stunned he grabs the phone and pulls a business card out of his pocket he quickly dials a number
someone answers with a shalom on the other end of the line
max asks for lenny meyer and is put on hold
hello this is lenny
lenny its max cohen
how are you
you want to come down
ive been thinking about our conversation earlier
max looks into the microscope
he stares at the spirals
i want to help
do you have the torah in digital form
start in tight on the epicenter and pull out to reveal the entire storm
thursday september fourth sixteen forty five
the alchemist awakes
all of my ideas work and dreams are spinning together it all has to do with spirals
it began with spirals and the answers are thee
max uses a drill to rip out some old parts
he lays new wire and does a bunch of soldering
he rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general housecleaning
he also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment
he plants some ant motels and sprays the room with
a pest killer
the most i can remember about their significance is from schneiders class
that bullshit core for majors
schneiders fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack
then again look at kepler
he was really into pythagoras
the leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers
pythagoras greatest contribution was the golden ratio which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years arguably all the way up to today
tight on max writing a b b a b
he draws it over a copy of leonardo da vincis famous drawing of man s anatomy
the golden ratio if i recall is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle
tight on max carefully measuring out a golden rectangle
the rectangle fits perfectly over leonardo da vincis man
if you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio
as the original rectangle
au can continue squaring the rectangle over and over again making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity
tight on max squaring rectangle after rectangle
then he draws the golden spiral through the rectangles
then if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral
the pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature
the images mirror what max talks about
we see nautilus milky way and dna strands
it really is amazing
in the sea on land in air our basic building block dna and even our home
max wanders through the crowded streets of chinatown
if were built from spirals while living within a giant spiral is it possible that all of human behavior if it could be quantified is in the form of a
then maybe extensions of our behavior like the stock market
maybe even the writing of the torah is infused with the spiral pattern
we start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner meaner and more exciting machine
friday september fifth
its fair to say im stepping out onto a limb
but im on the edge and thats where it happens
he holds two wires apart from each other as he contemplates what will connect them
max wanders helplessly through the dump
theres nothing but junk and more junk
max eyes marcy dawsons business card suspiciously he dials the number
a man answers on the other line
three eight two
max is put on hold
he notices a man in a business suit watching him
max turns away
im so happy
look what do you want for the chip
you tech guys
i think you know what we want
no i dont
we can work together we can both profit from this information
we both need each other to get it so why not work with us
i dont know if ill find anything useful
were willing to take the risk
first i want you to call off the surveillance
yeah im a very private person
knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside
i dont want to talk to anyone
how do i know youre home
ill knock back
max sits at the counter
the post headline in front of him reads market doomed
president in panic world leaders meet
max flips to the stock quotes
he cant believe how far things have dovetailed
he shakes his head in disbelief when an envelope appears in front of him
it belongs to lenny meyer
what is it
in hebrew characters and numbers
no what is it
the two hundred and sixteen digits
i dont know
beat if you get it maybe we can figure it out
changing subject can you really find it
if the numbers in there ill find it
max marches into his foyer when hes suddenly ambushed by devis boyfriend farrouhk
farrouhk is a little guy with a big sadistic smile
he grabs max by the collar and slams him against the wall
his fist butts up against maxs chin
there you go dork
been thinking about my girlfriend
you want to fuck her dont you
you calling my girlfriend ugly
why dont you want to fuck her
you think shes ugly
no no i just
its that shes your girl
so you do want to fuck her
you think about fucking her in the mouth dont you
no no sir please
ive never touched devi
i never will
give the fucking genius a mars bar
stay away or ill slice off your balls
farrouhk tosses max against the wall
max whimpers off to his apartment
farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be gives max a small slap on the butt
inside his apartment max bolts the front door
at his desk he rips open the envelope lenny meyer gave him
he pulls out a black disk and eyes it expectantly
next door he hears farrouhk and devi talking
hes just a bit unique
hes a dork
then max carefully slips the disk into euclids drive
hebrew characters pop onto euclids screen
max pounds in several strings of code lightning fast
the hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts
max toggles between hebrew and numbers a few timesimpressed
then theres a knock at the door
to himself okay
max peeks through the peephole
two well dressed large men brad and abe the babe wait for the signal
max knocks and the suits leave
then max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the black attache case in front of his door donning a surgical mask and latex gloves max opens the
black attache case
sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip
max studies it with awe
friday september fifth
lots of work to be done
but im close so close
today is the day might have cost me my soul but down the line ill work it out
just keep them in the dark let them beg
a damn ming mecca chip
its like giving a desperate junkie a syringe filled with junk
defense uses them to nun nuclear sub reactors
im going to dissect the market
max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner euclid
he welds it into euclids waiting wires
happy birthday euclid
then he lifts his hand to slap the return button but a sudden wave of fear stops him
he gets up and grabs a ginseng soda from the fridge he drops eight pills in the can
he calmly takes a sip from the soda and places it on the counter
max can hear devi and farrouhk starting to make love
their gentle sounds drift through the wall
max darts over and smacks the return
moments later we see what max sees on the screen is a long string of zeros
at the bottom of the screen euclids cursor blinks waiting for instructions
he smacks return again max gets the same empty result
euclids cursor blinks waiting
max starts to laugh
he laughs and laughs and laughs
damn religious freaks
sarcastic the holy torah
but then he notices his thumb twitching
he rubs his scar
his neighbors love sounds start to get rough
theyre having fun
max almost throws up
max dry heaves in the sink
then he forces himself to stand in front of the mirror
he grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve
he cant get it to roll up
suddenly hes overwhelmed by pain
he quickly rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm
he checks the barrelits empty ohh
he grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the sink
he cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles
he loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm
a wave of pain and nausea floods in
he grabs another bottle and fires it into his arm
then he fires another and another
frustrated he collapses into the mirror
stop please stop
slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart
he sees something
so he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair
meanwhile his neighbors lovemaking gets more intense
their screams carry into maxs head
max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side of his head
he has uncovered a light scar on his head
he examines it in the mirror
what is it
what is it
then his neighbors lovemaking turns outright evil
it sounds like sodom and gomorrah next door and max can barely stand it
a jolt of pain surges into his head
he grabs his scar as he vomits blood into the sink
he starts banging his head against the mirror
he bangs his head again and again until the mirror cracks
his neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted and agonizing
the mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob
he reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head where the pain is coming from
max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off
suddenly the pain is gone
then he hears something
its euclid buzzing with life
he gets to his feet and heads into euclid
the main monitor is screaming with numbers
the lights in the room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor
a filo substance billows out of euclid
and then a number pops onto the screen
max estimates how many digits are on the screen
max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil
he starts writing down the number
he mumbles each digit as he sees it
but then be stops writing
he stares at the number
something clicks in his head
his eyes go wide
he barely musters a oh
we move closer and closer into the number deeper and deeper into the screen
until finally a single pixel fills the screen and were in the blinding white void where we hear several deep peaceful breaths
then a fuse blows and we cut to a phone ringing
then we hear hes alive
his eyes are moving
fade back into the main room maxs eyes slowly open
on the phone hes busy right now im sorry
max is sprawled out in front of euclid
a large amount of blood from his nose is semi dried on his chin and chest
devi hangs up the phone
the landlady mrs
ovadia and farrouhk brandishing a crowbar stand over him
you were screaming
who told you you can put extra locks on the door
suddenly jolting up and remembering the number the number
max looks at euclid
the screen is blank
he looks at the mainframe
it is covered with the filo substance
then be looks at the piece of paper he wrote the number on
only a few dozen numbers are on the page
the last number be wrote is barely a scribble
youre out you hear me youre out
ive had enough of you
look at all this junk
he starts reciting the numbers
then max suddenly realizes something
he continues reciting the numbers from memory
its in my head its in my head
somehow i memorized it
i got it up here
he points to his head
but what is it
ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room
are you okay
what is this stuff
what does it do
max finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb
ut out you have to get out
get out get out its my room
to devi lets go
the phone starts ringing again
thats it no way
youre the one out of here mister
utt the three neighbors retreat to the front door
are you okay
max slams the door in their faces
max rubs his chin and looks around the room
he starts saying the number to himself he gets more and more excited as he reads each digit
max stirs cream into his coffee
then he pulls out the journal
a phone continues to ring
in the clouds of the lancet percy ad in the journal max writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number
he studies it examines it draws on it tries to figure out what it is
there was a moment there
when i dont know
when i didnt exist
we hear a phone being picked up
the ringing stops
silence then max is that you
pleading max just talk to me
things are a bit out of hand down here
people are getting desperate
suddenly firm we had a deal max
talk to us max
we hear the sound of a phone hanging up
at the coffee counter max pops a handful of pills and crumples the paper
max stares at his bald head in the mirror
all of his hair has been removed
a fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right ear
max ignores the incessantly ringing phone
max flips through an old neuroscience book
he examines a few illustrations and finds the part of his brain thats killing him
must be an explanation must be a reason
with a thick black marker he carefully outlines the part of his head that is causing the pain
max sits in his chair staring at the stock market monitor
the phone continues to ring
numbers drift by
a single beam of sunlight leaks through the window and shines on the edge of the screen
walking along the edge in the sunlight is a tiny ant
max gets up to squash it
but as he gets closer he suddenly feels mercy
he looks at the ant in awe
and then his attention switches to the ticker
two and a quarter twelve and an eighth six and two eighths
max states the numbers right before they enter onto the screen
i know these
seven and a quarter
two and a half oh
max strains to figure out what is going an
suddenly hes overwhelmed with fear
its gonna crash its gonna fucking crash
max charges into the room
sot is looking at his go board
sol looks up when max comes in
i was just studying our
noticing maxs head what did you do to yourself
you lied to me
i thought you were going to take a break
you found the two sixteen number in pi didnt you
you saw it
sol doesnt respond
i saw it sol
i dont know what happened but i know things
the market is going to crash
its going to crash
it hasnt yet but i know it will
i saw it sol
what is it sol
whats the number
he looks down at the board and collects himself
you have it
its in my head
leveling with max okay sit down
i gave up before i pinpointed it
but my guess is that certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular loop
the loop leads to meltdown but right before they crash they
they become aware of their own structure
the computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients
the computer becomes conscious
in some ways
to himself studying the pattern made euclid conscious of itself
before it died it spit out the number that consciousness is the number
no max its only a nasty bug
a door in front of a cliff
youre driving yourself over the edge
you need to stop
how can i stop
im this close
the bug doesnt only destroy computers
what are you saying
look what it did to your computer
look what its doing to you
max doesnt respond
its killing you
leave it unknown
clarity you were afraid of it
thats why you quit
max i got burnt
it caused my stroke
its math numbers ideas
mathematicians are suppose to be out on the edge
you taught me that
max theres more than math
theres a whole world
thats where discoveries happen
we have to go out there alone all alone no one can accompany us
we have to search the edge
we have to risk it all
but you ran from it
youre a coward
max its death
max stands up and screams down at sol
you cant tell me what it is
you dont know youve retreated to your goldfish to your books to your go but youre not satisfied
sol grabs his cane and whacks the go board
max get out
i want to understand it
i want to know
sol swings his cane as max heads for the door
max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into nd street
through the open doors max notices a young photographer in jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown platform
max is enraged and screams at him
the man ducks behind a column but a few moments later hes back snapping pictures
the doors start to shut but max uses his body to get off the train
the photographer sees him coming and flees
max follows the mans movement on his platform
when the young man shoots up the exit stairs max does so as well
max catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs heading toward times square
max chases him down a looooong passage
but he loses him at an underground five way fork in the road
one staircase is uptown and queens
another is brooklyn
one other is unlabeled
still enraged max marches forward just then he catches a glimpse of the photographer exiting the station
in the heart of new york max spins around searching for his foe
his frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he sees a strange reflection
not knowing what its of he turns around to see the source the reflection is from a giant brilliant stock ticker yards long and luminous
max stares at the quotes they are hypnotizing and max is suddenly calm
then max has a premonition
he turns and spots the photographer in front of a porn shop on eighth and nd
max whacks the photographer against a back lit image of a hustler centerfold
the man screams
who are you working for
the photographer hands max his wallet
i dont want your wallet
who sent you
max grabs the kids camera
who the hell sent you
who are you
student ive got an assignment for class
the photographer pulls out his student id
max looks at it
then he rips out the film exposing it
leave me alone damn it
leave me alone
max hands the man back his camera and leaves
max heads home in a furious state
suddenly he sees two of marcys men blocking his path
its brad and jake yet another tough guy and they dont look happy
max spins around and sees marcy dawson blocking his exit
lets take a ride max
i cant i got work
max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him
we had a deal
now get in the limo
marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks max down
dont ever hit
he pushes marcy aside and darts
jake and brad charge after him
theyre right on him he has a meter or so on them
he scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge
then he runs into an all night the tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a lead in the narrow aisles
he pleads with the owners for help nothing doing
jake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle
but max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guys nose
the guy goes down and max shoots out the exit
max dives under a car and crawls for terror
he sees two sets of feet nun by
max starts to relax when he notices a pair of heels on the other side of the car
marcy bends down and looks at him
enough max cmon out
leave me alone
i dont know anything
max retreats in the opposite direction
suddenly jake and brad grab him and drag him out
they search him taking his wallet keys everything
marcy looks at the guys who shake their heads
she walks over to max and shows max the front page of the wall street journal
it reads market craches youre responsible for this
i didnt do anything
i didnt play the market
but we did
marcy pulls out a folded worn piece of paper
she opens it
its maxs stock pick that he threw out
part of the number is on the page you have to be careful where you throw out your trash
how could you do that
you gave us faulty information
you gave us the carrot the right picks but then you only gave us part of the code
you selfish irresponsible cretins
how could you be so stupid
marcy jabs max in his stomach
max falls to the ground
the tough guys sit on him
this isnt a game anymore
were playing on a global scale
we used your code
but we can fix things if we make some careful picks
give us the rest of the code so we can set things right
i know who you are
youre not gonna save the world
marcy nods to jake who pulls out a gun and points it at maxs head
my god what are you doing
information is the private language of capital
we tried to establish a symbiotic relationship but if you choose to compete and enter our niche we are forced to comply with the laws of nature
max thinks for a second
max thinks hard
he realizes be cant give them the number
you cant kill me
you dont get it
i dont give a shit about you
i only care about whats in your fucking head
if you wont help us help yourself then ill have only one choice
destroy the competition
ill take you out of the game
survival of the fittest max
and weve got the gun
jake cocks the gun
max starts to cry
you stupid bastards
suddenly jake is whacked with a sawed off baseball bat
he smashes into the sidewalk
it is farrouhk maxs neighbor whos just pulled up in his taxicab
spotting his savior farrouhk
farroukh threatens marcy and the other tough guy who retreat in fear
farroubk is afraid as well so he doesnt quite leap on them
he just keeps swinging the bat
max gets to his feet and runs behind farrouhk
just then a station wagon screeches up to the curb
lenny meyer ephraim and a bunch of other his burly jews jump out
max looks at farrouhk and then he looks at lenny
ephraim grabs max and pulls him toward the station wagon
to farrouhk cmon
farrouhk heads for his cab
ephraim helps max into the backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him
lenny meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray bearded yisrael slams on the gas pedal
farrouhk jumps into his cab
yisrael yanks the steering wheel to the left the old station wagon skids around a corner
farrouhk what about farrouhk
ephraim pushes maxs head down
yisrael takes another corner sharp
hes okay he got in his cab
weve been looking for you
whats going on
do you have the number
whats going on
do you have the number
yeah i have it
you have it
where is it
you have it written down
what is it
lenny nods to ephraim who starts scanning through maxs pockets
the other guys hold him down
what are you doing
what the hell are you doing
were not joking around max
wheres the number
pushing ephraim away its not on me
its in my head
you memorized it
did you give it to them
those wall street bastards
why do you care
just answer me
in hebrew hit him
yisrael screeches the car to a halt
he spins around in his seat and looks max in the face
youre dealing with something really big now max
i dont want to hurt you so answer me
did you give it to them
theyve got part of it now get off me
theyre using it
max chews into ephraims hand which is pinning him
ephraim screams and lets loose a punch to maxs jaw
but lenny is late and maxs world as well as ours goes black
max stares suspiciously at the bathroom
he slowly picks up his drill
wielding it like a hammer he carefully advances into the bathroom where he looks into the sink
he almost vomits when he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain
ants swarm across its surface
max becomes furious
he whacks it with the drill
blood flies up into his face
in a wild rage he smashes it and punches it
then he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it down the drain
screaming like a madman he jams it until it is gone
a wise looking bearded hasidic man with benevolent piercing eyes stands tenderly over max
he wears traditional black clothes
lenny meyer paces nervously in the background
as max comes through rav cohen speaks
youre okay im rabbi cohen
cohen like you
im sorry for what lenny did hes been reprimanded
it is not our way are you okay
yeah yeah everything will be fine max
you need to give us the number
do you have it
what is it
charging over i told you we dont know you wouldnt be so flipped out if you didnt know
whats happening to me
give us the number
max ill tell you whats going on
just calm down
deep breath then the talmud tells us it began two thousand years ago when the romans destroyed the second temple
what are you
just give me a chance
youll understand everything if you listen
max takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some
the romans also murdered all of our priest hoodthe cohanimthe cohens and with their deaths they destroyed our greatest secret
in the center of the great temple was the holy of holies which was the heart of jewish life
this was the earthly residence for our god
the one god
it contained the ark of the tabernacle which stored the original ten commandments that god gave to moses
only one man could enter this space once a year on the holiest day of the year yom kippur on the day of atonement all of israel would descend upon
jerusalem to witness the high cohens trip into the holy of holies
if the holy man was pure he would reemerge a few moments later and israel was secured a prosperous year
it meant that we were one yea r closer to the messianic age
closer to the return of the garden of eden
but if he was impure he would die instantly and it meant that we were doomed
the high cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies
he had to intone a single word
rav cohen takes a dramatic pause
max is anxious to hear the end of the story
that word was the true name of god
the true name which only the cohanim knew was two hundred and sixteen letters long
a long beat
incredulous youre telling me that the number in my head is the name of god
wondrously max rubs the scar on his head
passion building yes
its the key into the messianic age
as the romans burned the temple the talmud says the high cohen walked into the flames
he took his secret to the top of the burning building
the heavens opened up and took the key from the priests outstretched hand
weve been searching for the key ever since
and you may have found it
now let us find out
thats what happened
i saw god
no no max
youre not pure
you cant see god unless youre pure
its more than god
it s everything
its math and science and nature
i saw the universes dna you saw nothing
i saw everything
theres much more
we can unlock the door with the key
it will show god that we are pure again
he will return us to the garden
youre not pure
im the one who has the number who do you think you are
you are a vessel from our god
you are carrying a delivery that needs to be made to us
it was given to me
its part of me
its changing me
its killing you
because you are impure
it will kill you
and what will it do to you
give us the number
the number is nothing
you know that
we can use it
we can wield it
its just a number
im sure youve written down every two hundred sixteen number
youve translated all of them
youve intoned them all
but whats it gotten you
its not the number
its the meaning
its the syntax
its whats between the numbers
if you could understand you would
but its not for you
ive got it
i understand it
im going to see it
whispers to rav cohen rabbi
i was chosen
max races through the streets of new york
he is wide eyed
suddenly its all there
it all makes sense
i can crack it
i can know it
i know what it is
sol knows too
i need to tell him
i need to show him
i need to bring him with me
people fly by
max in a spiraling whirlwind
a pumped and excited max paces the hall as he rings the bell
the door opens
but it isnt sol
its a young beautiful woman wearing a simple black dress
her name is jenny robeson and she is sols niece
can i help you
were you a friend
what do you mean
he had a second stroke
where is he
jennys eyes drop
max rushes into sol s study
the room is covered with sols p research books
it seems sol had recently come out of retirement
max looks at a few of sols books
then he finds a piece of paper with sols handwriting on it
on the paper is the number
max slides it into his pocket
max looks at the go board
the pieces are arranged in a giant spiral across the board
max sits on his bed staring at sols handwritten number
then he notices that his thumb is twitching
he drops sols note
stop it please
he dumps the contents of the bottle of pills into his hand
max stops as he prepares to shove the pills down his throat
he looks at the pills
then he looks at euclid around him
he throws the pills and the bottle to the floor
they fall to earth in slow motion
the room rushes in on max and so does the pain
it throws him to the ground and he bashes his head against the floor
max recites the number and uses it to get to his feet
the pain rips apart his voice
maxs pain and anger transform into violence
he attacks euclid furiously
he recites the number with rage in his voice
three seven two
he smashes the old computer apart
he tosses his step stool through the mainframe
then he goes to the window and tries to rip off the cardboard covering the glass panes
nothing doing so he yanks the entire window wide open
sunlight floods the room and throws max into the where max looks around starry eyed
the pain is gone
everything is new to max even his hands
the stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag
max continues to recite the number his voice becomes tender and peaceful
as he starts to become part of the void his voice turns into a whisper and his eyes start to close
then he hears devi
are you okay
oh my god max
her voice reaches into the void
max looks toward her voice
listen to me
we cut back to where devi leans over max
maxs eyes are open while he continues to recite the number
max turns away from devi and we return to the where max continues to recite the number
stay with me max
stay with me
and then we cut back to where devi grabs maxs palm
maxs fingers wrap around her hand
we return to where max stops reciting the number
he suddenly opens his fear filled eyes
where am i
what is this
this is wrong sol
max lets out a sol
and reaches out into the void
we match cut back to where max grabs devi and hugs her
he gasps for air as he collapses into her arms sobbing
you were right sol
he was right
thats right max
he was right
i want to breathe
yes breathe max
he holds onto her for dear life and then be realizes that devi is not in his arms
he is holding onto himself
then max notices sols note on the ground
he looks at the number
he collects himself and catches his breath
max looks at sols note
he lights a match and burns it
next he prepares something in the sink
we hear the whine of a motor
then it stops max looks at himself in the mirror he smiles
then he gets solemn
he takes a deep breath
then we hear the motor again
max lifts up his arm
hes holding a drill
he places the bit against the math section of his scalp
he applies pressure and drills into his brain
max collapses as we quickly a tree branch gently blowing in the wind
max watches it with peaceful understanding eyes
he wears a hat on his head
he listens to the wind in the trees
just then jenna surprises him with her fisher price calculator on hand
max smiles at jenna
hes glad to see her
can we do one max can we
max shrugs not able to say no
how about two hundred and fifty five times a hundred and eighty three
jenna types m the number
max is about to say no to jenna but then be decides to give it a shot
max thinks he really thinks
jenna presses the equals button

smiling and then laughing i dont know
i really dont know
what is it jenna
forty six thousand six hundred and sixty five
