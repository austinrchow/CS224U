batman early draft by sam hamm screenplay by sam hamm based on the character created by bob kane october the place is gotham city
the time once removed
the city of tomorrow stark angles creeping shadows dense crowded airless a random tangle of steel and concrete self generating almost subterranean in its aspect
as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and kept on growing
a dangling fat moon shines overhead ready to burst
amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate gothic anomaly old city cathedral once grand now abandoned long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition
on the rooftop far above us stone gargoyles gaze down from their shadowy windswept perches keeping monstrous watch over the distant streets below sightless guardians of the gotham night
one of them is moving
the pulsing heart of downtown gotham a neon nightmare of big city corruption almost surreal in its oppressiveness
hookers wave to drug dealers
street hustlers slap high fives with three card monte dealers
they all seem to know each other
with one conspicuous exception a tourist family mom dad and little jimmy staring straight ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the main drag
theyve just come out of a bit show two blocks over the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out and now playbills in hand they find themselves adrift in the predatory
traffic of gothams meanest street
for gods sake harold can we please just get a taxi im trying to get a shouting three cabs streak pass and disappear
mom grimaces in frustration as little jimmy consults a subway map
were going the wrong way
nearby street types are beginning to snicker
dad surveys them nervously gestures toward the subway map
put that away
well look like tourists
two cops lean on their patrol car outside an all night souvlaki stand sipping coffee and chatting with a hooker
the hooker smiles at jimmy
jimmy smiles back
mom yanks him off down the street and glowers at dad
well never get a cab here
lets cut over to seventh
seventh is that way
i know where we are
a deserted access street sidewalks lined with the husks of stripped down cars
mom dad and jimmy take a deep breath and march down the darkened street
a voice startles them
gimme a dollar
the voice belongs to a derelict nineteen or twenty acne scarred who sits between two garbage cans his palm uplifted
his ratty t shirt reads i love gotham city
mom dad and jimmy pause for the merest of seconds then move on pretending not to hear
how about it
standing up one dollar man
are you deaf are you deaf do you speak english by now the tourists are halfway across the street
mercifully the derelict doesnt seem to be following
they pick up their pace
they dont see the shadowy figure in the alleyway
they dont see the gun until a gloved hand brings it down butt first across the back of dads neck
mom grabs jimmy and backs up against a brick wall too terrified to scream
the derelict races across the street to join his confederate the street punk whos already searching for dads wallet
moms mouth opens in panic
they can see shes about to snap so the street punk still in a crouch trains his gun on jimmy
do the kid a favor lady
the poor woman is utterly horrified
tears stream down her face
but she keeps her wits about her stifles the urge to shriek and hustles jimmy off down the street
the two punks watch them break into a run then chuckle slap hands race off in the opposite direction
six stories up
the punks nick and eddie hunker down on the tar and gravel roof sizing up their take
emptying the wallet all right
the gold card
tossing the credit card in eddies face dont leave home without it
a chill wind whips across the roof as nick extracts the cash and begins to count it
theres a distant indistinct clang metal on metal
eddie hears it and tenses up
lets beat it man
i dont like being up here
what scared of heights
i dunno man
after what happened to johnny gobs look johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right
no big loss
that aint what i heard
that aint what i heard at all
beat i heard the bat got him
gimme a break will you
five stories straight down
there was no blood in the body
it was all over the pavement
nick has no patience with campfire tales but here on the roof in the pale moonlight he cant ignore the slight tingle at the base of his spine
there was no blood man
beat my brother says
all the bad things you done
they come back and haunt you
listen to this
how old are you
there aint no bat my brothers a priest man
no wonder youre such a chickenshit
now shut up conclusively there aint no bat
as they speak our attention shifts to a point at the opposite corner of the roof some fifteen yards away
where at the end of a line a strange black silhouette is dropping slowly implacably into frame
you shouldnta turned the gun on that kid man
you shouldnta do you want this money or dont you
now shut up
shut up both punks freeze at the sudden inexplicable sound of boots crunching on gravel
they turn slowly
their jaws standing at the edge of the roof bathed in moonlight is a eddie stands rooted to the spot a choked gurgle in his throat as if hes just
seen his own death
the black figure advances spreading its arms
or rather its wings great black batwings flapping in the wind
nick drops to the gravel gropes for the gun brings it up
and still the black figure draws closer deliberate menacing
on its chest the emblem of a bat in an oval yellow field glowing like a target in the darkness
nick fires twice
two clean hits
the strange black figure is knocked bodily to the roof
trembling sweating buckets nick gets to his feet
he whacks a motionless eddie on the arm nick cont
im gettin outta here
and bends to retrieve his loot
eddie lets out a strange pre verbal squeal
and nick sees the human bat back on its feet panic
sheer raw unrelenting panic
stolen money flutters out of nicks hands
he scuttles around the periphery of the roof his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches for a way down
the black spectre is blocking his path to the fire escape
trapped like a rat nick fires wildly
eddie is frozen in place his eyes glazed over his face drained of blood
the bat treads calmly past
a leg snakes out
a black boot catches eddie high on the chest and sends him flying through the air
eddie slams into a brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious a broken weightless puppet
not even break his stride
nick sees his chance and charges past the black wraith scrambling toward the fire escape
a gloved hand slices through the air and nick pitches forward his legs ensnared in a tangle of wires
screaming now he drags himself across the gravel roof the looming figure of the bat at his heels
until theres no place left to go
nick cowers against the ledge his pants torn his hands and knees bloody
he has dissolved into total mindless hysteria
almost by reflex nick keeps shooting
hed do better if he could manage to open his eyes
by now the hammer is falling on an empty chamber but nick continues obsessively to pull the trigger
he weeps he moans he wails
the bat grabs a fistful of nicks shirt and with supernatural ease hoists him into the air
dont kill me
dont kill me
when nick finally opens his eyes he realizes the bat is standing on the ledge of the roof holding him out at arms length over six stories of nothingness
the gruesome black apparition speaks in a rasping whisper i wont kill you
i want you to do me a favor
nick looks down
far far below cars wink silently past
he looks up
and sees in the mirrored lenses where batmans eyes should be the twin reflections of his own stricken face
tell your friends
tell all your friends
almost as an afterthought the batman heaves him roughly back onto the roof
and then casually without a moments hesitation steps off the ledge of the trembling nick crawls to the ledge and looks over
finding absolutely no trace of the batman
nick is still screaming as we pan up to the bilious yellow globe of gothams moon
main credits roll an oversized campaign poster fills one wall a new gotham
harvey dent for district attorney
we tilt down to find the man himself determined dynamic harvey dent addressing a crowd from behind his podium
it is no longer enough to go after the small time punks and petty criminals who infest the streets of gotham city
crime and corruption must be attacked at the root
civic minded politicos decked out in fund raiser finery
they applaud dents tough talk wildly
theyve just shelled out a plate for a chicken dinner and by god theyre going to enjoy this
tuxedoed waiters move among the tables deftly refilling water glasses
as they do we see an empty place setting the only one in the hall
some well meaning moneybags has laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up
the engraved placecard reads bruce wayne
if elected my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against boss carl grissom a womans apartment decorated in pastel pinks and mauves
original paintings and sculptures everywhere
the place reeks of money
in the foreground a mans hand long elegant manicured
manipulating a deck of cards doing a one handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse
in the background a tv set tuned to the oclock news with highlights of harvey dents campaign speech
on the tv screen together we can make gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play
the hand sets the deck on an end table raps it twice turns up four aces off the top
this most unusual deck sports a
calibre bullet hole straight through the middle
decent people shouldnt live here
theyd be much happier someplace else
jack napier is right hand man and chief enforcer to boss carl grissom
his features are delicate almost feminine and he takes a vain gangsterish pride in his appearance
he is also absolutely merciless
he trains a cold eye on dents televised image as alicia hunt beautiful carl grissoms kept woman glides over in her negligee and snuggles up
the usual gas
if this clown could lay a hand on grissom
i wouldve had to kill him by now
alicia finds jacks necktie draped over a nearby chair
she begins knotting it playfully about his neck
if grissom knew about us he might kill you jack seems uninterested in her affections
his eye darts back and forth between the tv and his own reflection in a nearby vanity
dont think so angel
im too valuable
thats the way ive planned it
pause and besides he doesnt know
jack checks his watch reaches for his topcoat and stands in front of the vanity
he runs a hand through sculpted hair checks out his albert nipon ensemble
you look just fine jack
he smiles at himself before turning to the door
i didnt ask
the scene of the earlier mugging a half block off gotham square
only now the deserted alleyway is a beehive of activity police cars an ambulance a forensics van
eddie the punk goes past on a stretcher catatonic
watching him are a porcine cop lt
eckhardt and a police that one there wont say a word
the other ones raving his head off
the spice of life
at the mouth of the alley we find alexander knox thirty hyperactive a crime reporter for the gotham gazette at the moment hes chatting with a uniformed they found him
hugging a drainpipe
he was scared to come off the roof
great but tell me is this another you know what
cause if so its the third one this week
testily i dunno
im gonna put you in for a commendation
knox spots eckhardt and the medic waves cheerily and saunters down the alley
eckhardt curses under his breath
oh christ its knox
this anything i should know about
nothing out of the routine
at this exact moment two uniformed patrolmen drag a brain fried nick past the mouth of the alley
bat i tell you a giant bat he wanted me to do him a favor knox tilts one eyebrow
eckhardt and the medic trade disgusted looks
no offense boys but these guys are seeing something up there
print what you like
is there a six foot bat in gotham city
knoxs tone is jokey but only half jokey
eckhardt snorts in disgust and turns away
knox shouts after him knox cont
if so is he on the police payroll
if so whats he pulling down after taxes
we pick up lt
eckhardt as he emerges onto the side street
hes headed for his car when he spies a stretch limo idling across the street
leaning on the hood waving hi is the dandyish jack napier flanked by two impressive goons
eckhardt throws a nervous glance back in knoxs direction
he turns left gestures to jack to meet him farther up the block
by the time he reaches the corner jack has swaggered up alongside him
eckhardt takes a fat brown envelope from jack and stuffs it quickly in his coat
you didnt show up
we had another bat sighting
im sure that was vitally important
listen things are heating up
someone is leaking information to harvey dent
theres no love lost between these two
im doing the best i can
if its a problem eckhardt
our problems are your problems
ill work on it
jack reaches out and grabs eckhardt by the lapels of his topcoat an italian job obviously expensive
he rubs the material between his fingers
very nice lieutenant
but a little ostentatious on a cops salary dont you think
knocking his hands away i answer to grissom punk
not to you
youre a smart boy eckhardt
you should be thinking about the future
eckhardt laughs in his face
nodding his head forget it jack
youll never run that organization
and whys that
youre a psycho friend
youre an a one crazy boy and grissom knows it
jack lashes out and backhands eckhardt across the face
the fat cop stunned turns bright red and charges jack
jack claps a hand on eckhardts face and shoves him back full force
the cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an all night cuban chinese restaurant
by now patrons are staring out of the restaurant windows
eckhardt is livid
his hand goes instinctively to his gun
jack pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in eckhardts lap
he looks down and laughs daring eckhardt to pick it up just as the two enormous goons from the stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement
eckhardt wipes blood from his mouth as jack an a one crazy boy grin on his face reaches down for the gun
its all right boys
eckhardt here is a good cop
a real good cop
pause smiling inexpensive
gotham citys leading tabloid daily
copy boys rush to and fro reporters pound out articles on computer terminals
alexander knox saunters in a sheath of typed pages in his hand and pauses at a cartoonists drawing table
what have you got for me jerry
jerry holds up a cartoon a human bat with an awful fanged rodents face wearing a business suit
the caption at the top reads have you seen this man
knox nods in approval
maybe a little more gore on the fangs huh
he pats jerry on the shoulder moves on
a bespectacled colleague spots him and calls out hey knox you got a visitor
im real busy clark
be a pal and dust him okay
this one you might want to dust yourself
curiosity piqued knox moves toward his desk
and stops in his tracks
propped up on the desk are a pair of legs
the legs exceptionally nice ones are attached to a woman leaning back in knoxs swivel chair taking a nap her face obscured by a big outrageous hat
the hat tips back
vicki vale her face framed by a shock of bright red hair flashes a dazzling smile
she pulls knox over for a quick smooch and laughs
howd you know it was me
honey i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale
grinning if i had a good enough hint
he points at the oversized camera bag on his desk
it bears the monogram v
vicki catches on makes a face at him
where the hell have you been
a nice restful vacation
she reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy x s combat photos from some unspecified war torn corner of the world
knox leafs though them impressed
god a girl could get hurt doing this
i do get hurt
she unbuttons her sleeve rolls it back to show knox a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm
he winces then points to the scar and adds slyly got any more of those
nothing im at liberty to reveal here
whats new and hot in gotham city
its too good vick
we got a six foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers
laughing evildoers huh
big or small
small so far
i mean they dont allow bats in boardrooms do they
speaking of which
i hear the notorious bruce wayne is throwing a big do for the harvey dent campaign
hottest ticket in town
every lawnorder freak in the citys gonna be there
knox suddenly freezes
its just occurred to him that vicki may have a purpose in all this
wa a it
youre not saying she reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an invitation
knox is all but panting with excitement
apprehensively got a date
she flutters her great big eyelashes shakes her head no
knox grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair
vicki baby i love you ive always loved you
will you marry me
straightening her clothes no
well im starving
will you at least buy me a hamburger
yes but please be gentle
overwhelmed with glee he offers her his arm
a huge plate glass window opens on the best view in gotham
this spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power perks available to carl grissom kingpin of the gotham city rackets fat fifty and utterly without charm
grissom behind a big broad desk addresses his lieutenants a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white collar types and few outright goons sprawled in chairs throughout this makeshift boardroom
the big boss waves a copy of the gotham globe with harvey dents face on the cover
nine points ahead in the new poll
i dont like the way this is shaping up
jack napier slouches in an easy chair off to grissoms right doing his trademark one handed shuffle
we can always pop him
or pop someone close to him
lets feed him to the bat
this suggestion draws chuckles from several members of the crowd
grissom is unamused
hes going after our front companies
specifically ace chemical
which would tie us in with councilman kane senator miller
on up the line
pause we have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down
how do we go
the usual fire
im thinking break in
trash the office remove the relevant documents
and jack pause id like you to handle this operation personally
jack has just turned up the third ace off the top of the deck
his hand freezes in midair
me at this exact moment metal doors slide back and alicia hunt steps out of grissoms private penthouse elevator
shes carrying a handful of shopping bags
i wonder if youd mind waiting in the other room
alicias gaze meets jacks as she vanishes through a side door
the eye contact is not lost on grissom
why do you need me to handle a simple break in
emphatically because i want someone i can trust jack bridles but doesnt protest
nervously he turns the fourth card off the top of the deck
its not an ace
its a joker a joker with a neat round
calibre hole through its face
well work out the details later
but its got to be soon
all right thats all for now
grissoms cronies get up to go
jack troubled lingers behind a moment
you dont mind do you jack
its an important job
i cant trust it to somebody wholl screw up
dont forget your lucky deck
jack pockets the deck and leaves
grissom sits behind the big desk and grins wolfishly
my friend your luck is just about to change
he reaches for the phone
alicia appears in the doorway nearby modeling her new purchases for him
he smiles coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver
get me lieutenant eckhardt
a vast rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half hours drive from gotham old money and how
out front a team of red jacketed valets are parking expensive cars
a dealers hand pushes cards out of a shoe the card kind not the florsheim kind
its casino night at wayne manor the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels blackjack tables etc
and the various members of gothams power elite are happily and legally throwing money into harvey dents campaign kitty
dent himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies telling jokes calling in favors
vickis off in another group looking luscious drawing compliments from big shots and envious furtive glances from their wives
and in a corner of the room all alone in his cheap suit stands alexander knox staring inquisitively up at the ceiling
a butler alfred appears alongside knox with a trayful of champagne glasses
he too looks up at the ceiling
how high up would you say that is
id say about thirty feet sir
you know if you cut your bathroom in half youd have my apartment
which bathroom is that air
the small one
knox takes a drink and alfred moves on
a moment later vicki detaches herself from her little circle of admirers and hooks up with knox
man i feel like robin leach
you actually know all these people
i am a rich bitch remember
pause im quoting
knox winces at the reminder
she smiles and takes his arm
yeah i guess we move in different circles
though i did meet a one eyed pimp last week
gothams police commissioner a distinguished looking gent in his late fifties
hes at a craps table blowing into his fist
onlookers root him on as he lets the dice fly
gordon passes the dice as knox and vicki wander up alongside him
what do you hear from our pointy eared friend
knox puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his fingers like little bat ears
knox for the ninth time and you can quote me there is no bat aww commissioner
theres gotta be one honest cop in gotham city
harvey dent is working the room
he ambles up claps a friendly hand on gordons shoulder
hows your luck jim
whats your stand on winged vigilantes
dent exchanges a meaningful look with gordon
knox i think we have enough real problems in this city without worrying about ghosts and goblins and halloween characters
a neon sign reads ace chemical
for a modern tomorrow
from the sign we pan over to a metal sluice gate dumping tons of churning toxic sludge into gothams east river
tight on the rear view mirror
jack napier is meticulously applying black camouflage paint to his face
he could be getting ready for a date
the van is parked outside a chain link fence which surrounds the ace chemical complex
the security guard in a glass booth at the entrance to the parking lot
one of jacks boys creeps up behind the booth and takes the guard out
he turns the key in the ignition shifts into first
knox and vicki are taking an unauthorized tour of bruces house wandering through rooms decorated in wildly divergent motifs eyeing an astounding collection of artworks and antiques from every corner
of the world
my question is where does one man get all this junk all over the world
they say he spends most of the year overseas until recently anyway
knox goes goggle eyed as they enter the library
we found the arsenal
one wall is lined to the ceiling with leather bound volumes
on the other walls hang exotic weapons
thugee ropes and samurai swords
every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever devised
knox lets out a low whistle
this guy has just gotten interesting
what else do you know
just what ive heard
old money and lots of it
likes to kill
smiling women find him magnetic
i bet they like him for his big charity balls
that and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks
well you know me
the more theyve got the less theyre worth
scanning the room this guy must be the most worthless man in america
just then a voice from behind intrudes
you disappoint me
why not the world
we get our first good look at the smiling face of bruce wayne tall athletic impeccably mannered
and intensely handsome
i assume in my usual charming manner ive just insulted the host
extending a hand alexander knox
ive read your work
i quite like it
give me a grant
i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale
knox blinks at vicki
bruce already seems to know who she is
knox shrugs and forges bravely ahead this is miss vale
that felt redundant
to vicki youre just back from corto maltese
i saw your combat photos
quite a departure for you
they havent been published yet
bruce smiles and ignores the implied question
you have an extraordinary eye
hes laying on the charm now
knox his territorial instincts aroused pipes up some people think she has two vicki shoots knox a sidelong glance dont mind my friend
hes a little nervous tonight
knox chastened calls off the dogs and sizes up his competition
bruce is charming all right but theres something formal maybe even calculating about it he could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards
its almost as though hes an actor doing a brilliant imitation of charm
this is a man who thinks three moves ahead knox doesnt like him
but vicki whos used to seeing male charm turned on and off at will doesnt seem to mind at all vicki cont
this is an amazing house
id love to shoot it sometime
will you be staying in gotham for a while
as far as i know
then with any luck well run into each other
suddenly alfred the butler appears in the doorway behind them
he clears his throat
excuse me sir
commissioner gordon was compelled to leave very unexpectedly
he asked me to convey his regrets
thank you alfred
to vicki i hope youll excuse me
it was a great pleasure meeting you
to knox and you
without bothering to shake hands bruce does a sharp and strides hurriedly out of the room
i know the rich are different but that guy is real different
vicki staring off after bruce doesnt seem to hear him
i was thinking
what were you thinking
well he must like the way he looks
hes got a mirror in every room
and indeed the two of them are standing before an enormous wall mirror eight feet wide running from floor to ceiling
i get it
she pokes knox
he groans at the dumb pun
and suddenly we looking down on knox and vicki through one way glass as they continue to chat
behind the mirror
recording everything that happens in the room
is a small silent state of the art surveillance camera
showing knox and vicki in the library
camera pulls back to reveal that the screen were watching is only one in a whole vast bank of video monitors
from this control center we can see everything thats happening in the house
now we zero in on a single screen guests moving backward with exaggerated speed as a videotape rewinds
at the panel bruce wayne hits a button
and now we see commissioner gordon talking to a uniformed policeman
the ace chemical company
obviously agitated good lord it we could put our hands on jack napier
why wasnt i told about this
whos in charge of the lt
eckhardt oh my god
and suddenly commissioner gordon is grabbing for his coat
the monitor goes black
bruce reaches up loosens his tie
unmarked police cars are pulling into the lot headlights off
eckhardt circulates among his armed swat team handing out xeroxed copies of a photograph
the photograph is a full face shot of jack napier
shoot to kill
a safecracker in welders mask trains a blowtorch on the office safe
behind him jacks hoods are at work on the filing cabinets
the safecracker kills his blowtorch and opens the metal door of the safe giving jack a good look at its contents empty
just like the file cabinets
i dont get it
if this place is cleaned out already what do we need five men
jack shakes his head
his boys are antsy ready to mutiny
by now its depressingly obvious theyve been set up
then as if they needed any proof a siren blares outside
eckhardts swat team goes wide eyed as a convoy of police black and whites roars into the ace parking lot
uniformed cops pile out of their squad cars relieving the swat team
eckhardt goes livid as commissioner gordon approaches
what are you trying to do blow the collar
to swat team you men are dismissed
well take over from here
to uniformed cops any man who opens fire on jack napier
will answer to me
eckhardt tries to slink off
gordon grabs him roughly
jack and his hoods ducking out of the office
its two stories above the refinery floor accessible by a network of steel ladders and catwalks running between the walls
down below a corrugated metal door begins to rise
one hood goes into a crouch and opens fire
half of his colleagues dive back into the office looking for a rear exit
the others take off across the catwalks
standing in the doorway as his men rush into the building and take their places behind heavy machinery
shots ring out as the hoods scatter
snidely nice work commissioner
im in charge here
not carl grissom
two hoods run down a tiled corridor in the office section of the complex
theyre almost at the end of the hall when a caped black shadow steps into their path
it stands there motionless
extends its arms like giant wings revealing the yellow and black insigne on its massive chest
one millisecond later the shocked hoods are racing back in the opposite direction
the batman flings a handful of steel ball bearings across the tiled floor
hood i tumbles to the floor and lands hard losing his breath
hood ii rolls and pulls a gun
batman hurls a boomerang its edges scalloped like a bats wing
hood ii finds his gun hand pinned to the wall by the twin prongs of the batarang
the batman strides briskly toward them businesslike taking his time
he grabs a handful of hood is hair lifts his head off the floor knees him in the face
he turns to the petrified hood ii
chrome steel talons spring out of his fingertips
he strolls past hood ii reaching out casually to give him a quick nick on the chin
hood ii slumps against the wall unconscious
down on the floor racing along a wall throwing switches anything to create a diversion
with every switch he throws another gigantic machine roars to life
huge polymer extruders spit out thick strands of plastic gunk
overhead chemical tanks rotate into place over giant basins
jack sees a squad of cops on his tail moving from machine to machine keeping covered
he shoots and runs
blasting away hoods iii and iv scuttle across the elevated walkways keeping down avoiding police fire
one of them starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up
batman plunges past on the end of a rope
a black gloved hand snatches at hood iiis collar as he climbs and yanks him cleanly off the ladder
they drop to the lower catwalk
hood iv gapes
he levels his gun at batman who stands his ground holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support
a bullet hits him squarely in the chest
he does not fall hood iv turns and scrambles
batman goes to his belt for a miniature spear gun
he points it at hood iv and fires
planting a barbed hook in the hoods leg
staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk
its him hood iii on his feet now charges batman from behind
batman not even turning to face him drops hood iii with an elbow
now he has a hood on either side
he takes a steel billy club from his belt whips it once through the air
it telescopes out into a four foot staff
like a drum majorette from hell he whirls the staff as the hoods converge on him
hood iii takes a debilitating jab under the jaw
batman spins on his heels and slams the staff into hood ivs back knocking him off the catwalk to the factory floor forty feet below
jack spots a possible out
he hits a button on the wall steel doors rise to reveal ace cargo trucks in the parking lot outside
beyond the trucks
an army of cops waiting for jack to make his move
behind him other cops the inside team are rushing at him in full riot gear
jack ducks behind a forklift and darts into the adjacent room
jack sprints through the room firing four shots at the metal chemical tanks on the wall
toxic chemicals gush out onto the floor in streams
the streams run together
begin to smoke and sizzle
cops right behind him
jack cant resist taking one last pot shot at a fifth chemical tank
an explosion knocks him off his feet
cops look on in puzzlement as a river of chemicals courses out into the main refinery
a second later they go up in flames
a wall of fire bisects the factory floor
jack races along behind the spreading wall of flame
the cops cant see him now
he ducks behind a huge machine hits a switch and sluice gates open
chemical sludge begins to churn
a big hole in the wall appears as a gate opens on the east river
its the waste dump
up on the catwalk batman has a perfect view of jack
if jack can just sprint through the flames without getting shot hell make it to the river
batman hooks a rope to his batarang flings it at a catwalk across the floor
bursts through the wall of fire
and just as he does batman leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him
his foot catches a thirty foot roll of plastic six feet in diameter one of several standing upright on the floor
the plastic roll drops into jacks path blocking his exit
an instant later batman lands on top of jack
wraps an arm around his throat and raises his free hand
drug tipped steel talons appear
but before he can paralyze jack
in all the ruckus hood v has managed to circle back behind the heavy machinery
now hes got a gun pointed directly at let him go or ill do it
batman releases jack and stands back
jack chuckles to himself what loyalty
then with plenty of time he strolls across the floor to a jacobs ladder mounted on the back wall
and begins to climb toward the catwalks
all action stops
batman doesnt move
the cops dont move
hood v stands there sweating his gun hand shaking as he waits for jack to climb safely out of shooting range
eckhardts pig like eyes glisten
his hand drops to his side
hes half tempted to pull a gun and get the commissioner plugged at a crouch groping his way along the rail of the catwalk
he reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a supporting rod
its a forty foot drop to the swirling black currents of the east river
hes about to climb out when his eye falls on a
automatic which lies abandoned on the gridwork floor of the catwalk mere yards away
the hood one arm around gordon
with his gun at the commissioners temple he backs slowly toward the door
nobody makes a move
we go out clean
all eyes turn to the catwalk overhead where jack stands poised with the
in his fist
a single shot drops eckhardt cleanly
the moments distraction is all batman needs
he hurls a ninja wheel a small ratcheted razor sharp disc at the forearm of hood v
one jerk of a thin filament wire a sudden shriek and gordon is free
the thug lurches forward
his gun drops to the floor an ungodly howl of pain echoes out from the catwalk above
jack reels and staggers his hands clutching at his cheeks
blood gushes from between his fingers
a young cop unnerved by the sight of jacks agonized pirouette draws his gun and opens fire
but the bullet has caught jack in the arm
he spins totters to the edge of the catwalk
and topples over
the cops look on helplessly as jack plunges two stories down into a catch basin full of bubbling toxic waste screaming gordon cont
goddammit we had him
we and suddenly with jack out of the picture all attention focusses on the batman
cops reach for their guns circle warily around him
cornered now he backs off slowly hands gordon cont
hold it right there mister
the batman raises his hands in a gesture of surrender
then as the cops advance he flicks two tiny capsules onto the factory floor
a blinding flash of light
colors burst in a wild pyrotechnic display
cops stumble backwards momentarily dazzled as a thick wall of black smoke conceals batman from view
a tiny grappling hook rockets out of the dense curling cloud and catches on a catwalk overhead
the cops are firing wildly into the smoke
but its too late
at the end of a cord the black majestic figure of the batman whips upward rising out of the smoke like an avenging angel and disappearing into the shadowy heights
safely out of range
who is this guy
i dont know but hes one hell of a showman
a black shadow scurries across the roof
from the illuminated sign with its neon ace we pan down past the chemical sluice to a second ace
a card from jacks lucky deck pierced by a neat round bullet hole bobbing on the oily surface of the foul polluted river
as deadly toxins gush forth other cards from the deck swirl past a nine
and finally a joker a bone white hand breaks the surface as we a banner headline on the late edition of the globe behind the newspaper feet propped up on
his desk is a jubilant knox
hes on the horn to commissioner gordon
do us both a favor
dont tell me some lie youll have to retract later
knox grins lowers the paper finds himself looking up at the smiling face of vicki vale
looks like our friend the bat is getting ambitious
why the dopey grin
guess whos got a date with bruce wayne
he called you up and asked you for a date
shit shouting to vicki i want you to pay close attention to this
miranda tell my friend here what you told me about bruce wayne
a superannuated southern belle toddles over
miranda reitz is the society editor of the globe you mean mister one nighter
mister one nighter
to vicki because thats the average length of his relationships with women
the current record is almost two weeks
that cover girl whats her name
you mustve shot her vicki tell her about the peanuts
which is how he goes through women like planters peanuts
vicki is about to break out into helpless giggles
plain or roasted
standing up alex im very flattered that youve gone out and done all this research
blushing suddenly aw come on vicki im a reporter
i do this for a living
whatd you tell him
i told him yes
vicki shakes her head and laughs
she takes knoxs face in her hands plants a kiss on his forehead
youre awfully sweet to be concerned but its really not necessary
ill call you okay
knox stands there looking poleaxed
what was that that was one of the most gracious fuck yous its ever been my pleasure to watch
what a nice girl
knox totally flustered sighs and sinks into his chair
miranda im busy
go be productive
a cabin cruiser slices through the waves
in the distance closer to the shore we see a throng of sailboats
bruces forty foot cabin cruiser aptly christened die fleidermaus
bruce and vicki are on the deck in chairs soaking up sun gazing off at the sailboats
do you sail
too much work
im not really the physical type
thank you alfred
alfred has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of drinks for bruce and vicki
vicki watches as bruce reaches for his glass
his forearm looks like a thin layer of skin over braided telephone cables
you do a very convincing imitation
sipping her drink mm this is tasty
he smiles slides the drink over toward her gestures for her to try a sip
two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops
beat tell me vicki
theres something im very curious about
what took you down to corto maltese
i guess i needed a change
you were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city
everyone wanted you
have you ever been to corto maltese
not since the shooting started
we went there once when i was little
i played on the beach
and at nights they had a band i danced with my father on the hotel patio
shrugging that was corto maltese
when the war broke out i had to go back
and i promised myself that this time
i wouldnt look away
what did you see
the conversation is getting rather intense at both ends
vicki seems to have hit some weird chord within bruce
theres terror everywhere
some types are just more familiar than others
for a moment bruce seems to be drifting back into his familiar preoccupied mode
vicki laughs apologetically
i didnt mean to i know it all seems a million miles away out here on the water with all this insulation
vicki is momentarily stuck for a reply
in some way she cant quite grasp he seems to be challenging her
bruce really when i say these things i dont mean to criticize you i think you see things very clearly
im happy to talk about something else
i dont want to be depressing
smiling do you assume that if i know you better i wont like you as much
vicki starts laughing
bruce is a notorious womanizer but if this is a come on its like no come on shes ever seen
im sorry bruce i have to ask
are you like this with the other women you know
because i just cant seem to get a handle on this conversation
taking her hand vicki if i say anything cryptic or
ambiguous i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it
because even if it doesnt sound that way
thats how ill mean it
the guys a chessplayer but on the other hand hes also rather touchingly almost childishly sincere before she knows it vicki finds herself melting
rigoletto the duke onstage launching into his big crowd pleaser la donna e mobile
we pan the audience finding several mobile young donnas in the crowd drop dead beauties in slinky gowns
although most eyes are fixed reasonably enough on the stage donna is staring with undisguised envy at a private box above the orchestra seats
her mouth twists in disgust
she scans the crowd finds her counterpart donna some rows back on the arm of a bald bigwig
donna is wearing a similar sour expression staring up at the same box donna is even less discreet than her comrades
she has her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box
bruce and vicki
he whispers in her ear
she smiles and whispers back
he whispers again
this time she doesnt laugh
but her lips part slightly
screen goes black as the opera glasses snap shut
staring icily at the duke as he finishes up to a round of bruce and vicki enter
he takes her coat drops it on a chair by the door
vicki is giddy all champagned up
but its not fair im half drunk and youre not even would you like me to take you home
you would sidling up to him come on bruce
i just want to get two drinks in you
as an experiment maybe we should just kiss
we could try that
bruce embracing vicki in the vastness of the darkened entry hall framed by long semicircular stairways on opposite walls
a sudden flash of lightning transports us to broken windows graffiti on the walls a decrepit rathole near the gotham docks
tight on a face swathed in bandages
the patient sits erect in a wooden chair surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of an unlicensed gangland doctor
the doctor a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner of a back alley abortionist steps up with a scissors
napier lets see how we did
he begins to snip away
as the bandages come off we get the last strands of gauze peel away
the doctor stands there looking at his handiwork
his mouth falls open
his eyes bug out
the doctor just stands there staring at camera stock still apparently transfixed by the sight of jacks face
mirror he clears his throat reaches apprehensively for a hand mirror and passes it out of frame to jack
then the sound of glass shattering as the mirror drops to the floor
jack begins to laugh
the doctor gets a little edgy
you understand the facial muscles were completely severed jack keeps on laughing
the doctor turns uneasily away gestures apologetically at his seedy equipment
you can see what i have to work with here more laughter
the trembling doctor covers his face with one hand whining now not daring to look at jack
im sure that with proper recon recon reconstructive surgery a door slams
jack is gone
the grateful doctor breathes a sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table
from a point high above we see jack emerging into the alley pulling on a hat wrapping a muffler about his head
we cant see his face
but we cant forget his laugh
vicki nestled peacefully under the covers
beside her is bruce hands behind his head staring up at the ceiling
its almost as though bruce is not used to sleeping at night
he doesnt know what to do with himself
he looks at vicki
shes terribly lovely
but despite all that we cant shake the feeling that bruce
would really rather be somewhere else
kids in punk regalia stand outside a rock club as jack stalks past
the wind knocks his hat off
nice hair dude
jack ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat
then he gazes up at the steel and glass facade of a skyscraper and strides deliberately across the street
the spectacular gotham skyline seen through the plate glass window of grissoms conference room
the doors to the private elevator hiss open and jack wanders in
he plops in the big plush swivel chair behind grissoms desk
that you sugar bumps
grissom waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room
hes fresh out of the shower a towel wrapped around his impressive girth
hes using a smaller towel to dry his hair and so its a moment before he sees the bundled up figure at his desk
who the hell are you
recognizing his voice jack
advancing cautiously thank god
i cant believe its you
i heard youd been standing up is that what you heard
jack gestures him over to the empty chair
grissom doesnt move until he sees the gun pointed at his belly
beat over a girl you must be insane
grissom surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer
keep your hands on the desk
sooner or later you wouldve tried to take me jack
you may get me now but your life wont be worth a dime
ive died once already
it wasnt so bad
in fact i recommend it
grissom is beginning to panic now
its obvious that jack is utterly hopelessly deranged
jack listen well cut a deal and now for the first time he flings away the hat
rips the muffler from his face
and as grissom gasps in shock stands revealed in his full horrendous glory
his flesh is bleached bone white
his hair is a luminous seaweed green
and his cheeks are torn and puckered from the bullet wound twisting his mouth into a hideous jack cont
im not a jack any more
pause cackling you made me a joker
grissom revulsed terrified pushes himself away from the desk back toward the window which overlooks the city
jack im warning you
wipe that ha
thats the best part
and with that jack pulls the trigger
and fires again until the clip is empty
we tilt up the chrome and glass facade of the skyscraper arriving finally at the top floor a plate glass window spiderwebbed with cracks where jacks bullets hit
the room is still dark
jack or as well know him from this moment on the joker sits in grissoms swivel chair staring out at the moon drenched skyline
what a view
our little city
it always brings a smile to my face
he reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at grissom who lies dead on the floor the towel still wrapped around him
the joker laughs softly to himself
guess its my little city now
wonder what itll look like when i get done with it
pause i bet itll be something real fine
real fine and pretty the sun is just up and vicki finds herself alone in bed
a soft off key baritone voice drifts out of the adjacent bathroom bruce in the shower singing honeysuckle rose
she breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed
somehow shes wound up wearing bruces ribbed formal shirt
bruce in his opulent deco shower stall still singing to himself
vicki sneaks up behind him opens the door
he instantly stops singing as if hes been hit by a brick
i didnt mean to scare you
i just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing she smiles teasing him
he doesnt respond
he acts as if shes caught him doing something shameful exposed him
singing dont buy sugar you just have to touch my cup
youre my sugar no response from bruce bruce you are such a case
bruce seems somehow unable to sing along
but be quickly recovers his composure and forces a crooked almost childish smile
i dont sing very well
then theres one thing in the world you dont do very well
and i know what it is
now youll have to kill me
he kisses her good morning steps out and reaches for a towel
his body is one big mass of bruises and abrasions
you should stay off that horse
knox in a surly mood examines the morning edition of the globe hes turned to page six the gossip page and there under miranda reitzs byline is a picture of
it seems she and bruce are the talk of the town
a copy boy approaches his desk with a manila folder heres that morgue file you wanted
knox leans back in his chair
the file is labelled bruce wayne
knox opens it and begins to leaf through old clippings from back issues of the globe victims say thank you to bruce wayne
knoxs face sags in dismay
every article seems to be telling us just how swell a rich philanthropist can be
gimme some dirt then he notices something odd
in the whole fat file of clippings there are no pictures of bruce wayne with two partial exceptions
one is a group shot bruce in the middle waving at the camera and blocking our view of his face
the other is an ancient picture of a collegiate bruce stern faced hair down to his collar
the caption reads bruce wayne in years out of date even when it ran in the paper
why dont you like your picture taken
a doorman dozes in the plush lobby of alicia hunts apartment building on the east side of gotham
through the glass doors we see alicia outside in the chill wind peering inside hesitant to enter
as silently as possible she uses her key and steps in tiptoeing past the doorman trying not to wake him
shes almost made it when he sits bolt upright startling her
smiling no need to sneak in
the rents been taken care of
alicia mystified lets herself in and turns to lock the door
shes startled once more by a voice from behind
honey im home
her eyes widen
sitting cross legged in an easy chair a twisted grin on his loathesome face is the joker
hes in a smoking jacket and slippers reading the paper a dry martini at his side
this grim parody of domesticity sends poor alicia into a dead faint
it looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom
at a long table sit gothams most distinguished criminals ganglords and rackets bosses from every corner of the city
they stare suspiciously at the head of the table
so thats how it is gents
until grissom decides its safe to come up for air
im running the show
now we see what they see the joker dressed rather flamboyantly in a big slouch hat
his face is layered with flesh toned makeup and his hairs been rinsed black
unfortunately he cant conceal his ghoulish smile
so why dont we hear this from grissom
i got something id like to know
how come youre wearing that stupid smirk cause i got an army chum
and i got grissoms army
and this city is mine carmine rotelli an especially oily mobster speaks up i dont like taking orders from grissom
and i especially dont like taking orders from grissoms goon ive considered that possibility
and what happens if we say no
chuckling nobody wants a war carmine
if we cant do business we shake hands and part friends
the joker extends a hand
rotelli reaches out to shake it
he doesnt see the joy buzzer concealed in the jokers palm
volts course through rotellis body
he drops back into his seat a blackened husk smoke pouring out from his sleeves and shirt collar
the crimelords recoil in horror
before they can make a move a squad of armed thugs burst into the room
looks like carmine got a little hot under the collar
youre insane the joker is a wee bit agitated
he removes the hat and mops sweat from his brow exposing a patch of chalk white flesh to the great bewilderment of the onlookers
thats what they said about lee iacocca
now get out of here
and the sickened criminals file out cautiously
that leaves the joker alone in the room with the charred corpse of rotelli
the joker sinks into a chair and as is his wont joker cont
heck theyre not such bad guys
i say we give em a couple of days to come around
thoughtful pause we e ll
maybe one day
then casually aaah screw it
lets grease em
a poker game
a crimelord from the jokers board meeting picks up his hand and fans out the cards
he looks up puzzled
the last thing he sees is a hired killer bursting in through the door gun in hand
a costumed clown with a wheeled cart filling balloons from a helium tank passing them out to the kids
crimelord strolls past
the clown offers him a balloon which be politely refuses
the clown reaches into his cart for a red metal tank
but as we quickly find out its not a helium tank its a a sunny landscaped quad surrounded by corporate skyscrapers trees grass marble fountains flags of many nations
amid the pedestrians we catch bruce and vicki all smiles cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch
to tell you the truth id just about given up waiting
i said id call you the minute i got free
and i did
and here we are
teasing him hm hmm
not even dinner
he stops in his tracks takes her by the shoulders
do you want the whole truth
all coyness aside
long pause i wish i had more time to give you
every day i dont see you i miss you
are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me
all this of course is delivered with devastating sincerity
vicki finds herself totally disarmed
okay im a sucker
you sound so much like someone i used to
stopping suddenly bruce
i know this is silly but youre not married are you
he stops and laughs
she smiles crookedly takes his arm
philly ricorso another crimelord from the boardroom enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of paid bodyguards
a painted street mime walks alongside them feeling his way along an imaginary wall
all street mimes should be executed
looks like a convention and indeed there are half a dozen street mimes converging on the center of the plaza
ricorso and co
approach the mirrored glass entrance of a skyscraper
in the lobby a mime whos been annoying the passersby throws a bolt locking the doors from inside
a bodyguard bangs on the glass
nearby another mime reaches into a trash bin and pulls out a machine gun
sudden screams of terror from the onlookers
vicki turns to bruce
before she can get his name out hes hoisted her bodily and thrown her behind a marble fountain
bruces eyes darting birdlike around the plaza intercut with the following pov shots all in slow motion two mimes with machine guns
one of them lining philly and co
up against the glass doors the other holding the crowd at bay a woman in the crowd fainting
a third mime gleefully imitating her swoon to no ones amusement philly and his goons cowering hands in the air as other mimes cruelly mimic their terrified poses
and suddenly bruce is running frantically looking for a secluded spot an alleyway anything
hes out in the open with onlookers everywhere
in his civvies hes just another citizen
he darts around a corner backs against a wall
women children grown men race past
no privacy hes practically quaking now in the throes of some terrible anxiety
he looks up at the sky overhead terrified
a brilliant sun bears down on him as machine guns chatter
bodies jerking as glass rains down in shards
his back arched his mouth agape his face drained of blood as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza
its almost as if the bullets are striking him a moment later its all over but the screaming
vicki emerges from the crowd and finds bruce slumped against the wall nearly catatonic
she moves to touch him
as if by reflex he reaches out and grabs her by the arms with a grip so strong it could crush bone
she gasps looks up and sees in his traumatized eyes a look so raw so desperate that it virtually defies comprehension
he blinks rapidly
he relaxes his grip
before vickis eyes hes changing
becoming the bruce she knows
oh my god
are you all right
he reaches for her
involuntarily she steps back
he sees her reaction and his face goes slack frightened pleading
this time she lets him embrace her
but her face is full of bewilderment and doubt
live from halliday plaza where a gangland style execution claimed the life of racketeer philly ricorso
ricorsos death is the third in a rash of underworld killings
cut to two shot the anchorwoman and commissioner gordon
commissioner youve heard the rumors
are these murders the work of the mysterious batman
a piercing cackle fills the air
camera pulls back from the tv placing us in the jokers boardroom
behind the big desk he swivels into view phone in hand
all reet i think its about time we called another meeting huh
alfred on the phone a feather duster in his hand
im sorry miss vale
ive given him your messages
thats all i can do
bruce is sitting mere feet away obviously distraught locked in some sort of internal struggle
please tell him
im not trying to make his life difficult
id just id just like to know whats going on a knock at the door as vicki hangs up
she goes to open it finds knox wearing a big cheshire cat smile
i got something id like you to see
a microfilm machine
as vicki looks on curiously knox all eagerness now threads up a roll of film and begins cranking through back issue newspapers
okay here we go
check it out he steps back
vicki stares down at the display screen
a front page banner headline reads prominent doctor wife slain in robbery unidentified gunman leaves child unharmed beneath it a photo cops kneeling over corpses
medics with stretchers
and off to one side a young boy bruce wayne his arms wrapped around the waist of a beat cop
the boy stares straight at the camera
his face is a mask of unforgettable agony
you cant take your eyes off it
oh my god
ive seen this picture
i guess so
allie look at his face
tight on the boys contorted face staring out in shock and disbelief his features recognizable across all the years permanently indelibly traumatized
the same face vicki saw in halliday plaza yep
he watched the whole thing happen
recognize the beat cop
jim gordon oh bruce
something like this what do you suppose this could drive a guy to
a greasy spoon off the lobby of the globe building
knox and vicki in a booth
alexander you are on drugs
he walks out on his own party
half an hour later the caped crusader turns up in full bat drag
beat sees an execution freaks out in an alleyway
no place to change smiling yeah vicki hes married all right
youre pissing me off allie
i know exactly why youre doing this
leaning forward oh
why is that vicki
vicki wilts under the challenge
she holds her silence for a second then changes the subject
hes best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent
they would know okay vicki i have a confession to make
im the batman
vicki snorts rolls her eyes impatiently
dont believe me
i know you
and they know him and thats why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out
looking for this is pointless
grabbing her arm your little chum is out of his mind
relaxing his grip next time you call him up and he cant go out friday night think it over
low angle on the joker
he stands on a catwalk high above the refinery floor lord of all he surveys overseeing production like a demented middle manager
a dank windowless room in the bowels of ace chemical which the joker has converted into a makeshift lair
sap like goo drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead
camera drifts across the jokers cluttered desk
psychotic doodles scrawled in crayon
more significantly an old contract dating back to the mid seventies
its half obscured by other papers but the initials cia are plainly visible
then a bound report with the title ddid nerve gas results of preliminary experimentation
across its title page a diagonal rubber stamp discontinued january
and finally a sheaf of photos
laboratory apes chimps and orangutans all dead
their lips are drawn back exposing on one wall poster sized blowups of the grinning apes
on the opposite wall a large scale photographic reproduction of the gotham city skyline its bottom half hidden from view by the jokers desk
the phone rings
the joker who has been sitting on the floor by the cityscape pops into frame and picks it up
hows that first shipment coming
right on schedule
oh we got that address for you east end mmm
howd you find it
called her agent
the joker nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the floor
like a happy kindergartener with paste pot and scissors hes clipping photos from a magazine horrible scenes of death destruction panic mutilation
one by one hes pasting these shots on the blowup of gotham city all along sidewalk level creating a massive photomontage of anarchy in the streets
weve seen these photos before
vicki vale took them
in corto maltese
in foreground rows of makeup in startling profusion mascara blusher eyeliner lipstick
half a dozen beautiful models giggle into their makeup mirrors
in the background vicki wanders past with a stylish friend claire who owns and operates the studio
of course after corto maltese this must all seem pretty tame
not to me
i need a job
everyone knows youve got your hooks in bruce wayne
then everyone must know something i dont
well come on dear tonys dying to see you
in a corner of the studio tony a gaunt tubercular brit is shooting a swimsuit layout with two supermodels
they all ad lib greetings to vicki as tony darts around hyperkinetically snapping the girls in a series of poses
yes ladies smiles show me those smiles fabulous tropical smiles think tahiti i want to see teeth yes those glorious teeth as vicki looks on the supermodels freeze in place
simultaneously a strange stricken look on their faces
my god no dont stop now those smiles i need those smiles suddenly the girls are laughing but the laughter is unnatural involuntary
vicki sensing that something is terribly wrong lays a hand on claires arm
the models now wearing huge smiles begin to twitch spasmodically
tony snaps away
oh baby yes
thats beat no
too far too far
pull back pull back
dropping the camera the supermodels pitch to the floor shuddering convulsively their lips drawn back in frightful frozen the eyewitness news set with anchors patsy narita and dave mcelroy
behind them blowups of the two dead the fashion world was stunned today by the sudden deaths of top models kelly brinkley and christie emberg
cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction although authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of drug use
behind dave on the bluescreen a huge statue covered in canvas not unlike new yorks statue of liberty
in gotham plans continue for the citys th birthday celebration
the four day event will conclude with the unveiling in gotham harbor of the newly restored lady gotham
a technicians hand passes a slip of paper into frame
this bulletin just in
nine more mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor in off to the left patsy begins to laugh
this is hardly the his eyes widen an offscreen crash
suddenly dave is up out of his seat mouth agape in horror
right and left as she jerks out of her seat and totters uncontrollably across the set laughing insanely
technicians rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy
patsy spins like a dervish and lurches backward over the newsdesk in a death spasm giving us a quick look at the grisly jokers grin etched on her now lifeless
dave gestures frantically to the cameraman dave cont
suddenly crackling video static wipes out the screen
a moment later were looking at their gorgeous faces sprout big animated cartoon grins as a bouncy tune put on a happy face comes up underneath
love that joker theme music continues as a grinning deranged pitchman the joker pushes his shopping cart down the aisle
the shelves are filled with products bearing his trademark harlequins face
he waves merrily in time to the music
panicked technicians swarm the booth
the studio feed has been jammed
every monitor shows the jokers commercial
new improved joker brand
with the secret ingredient
a sweep of the hand lets go to our blind taste test
tight on an anonymous man gagged and blindfolded tied to his chair squirming struggling
on the table before him is a package labelled brand x
a superimposed title reads not an actor
out of sorts
wagging a finger hes been using brand x
but with new improved joker brand
angle widens to include a blindfolded corpse limp in his chair grinning horrifically
its a smile every time
the joker in a field of wheat
on a picnic blanket before him are two clean cut models one male one female both dead
and grimacing horribly
and the world smiles with you
irresistable oh so kissable he grabs the dead models by the hair
their teeth clink as he forces their heads together for a post mortem kiss
television sets all over gotham as startled citizens react to the jokers maniacal promo
i know what youre saying
where can buy these fine fine products
well thats the gag folks you never know chances are
youve bought em already as his rant continues we see a young man watching the bedroom tv as he dresses for a date
hes got an aerosol deodorant can poised under one arm ready to spray
he looks down at the can suddenly uncertain
could it be
a family in their kitchen eyeing a inch portable as mom serves dinner
they dig in automatically then freeze with their forks in midair
a middle aged matron at the living room tv
shocked she calls to her husband and gets no reply
we follow her to the bathroom door
on the floor she sees an overturned shampoo bottle
then her husband slumped down in the tub a lethal grin on his face
she lets out a shriek
alfred the butler in a crouch glued to the tube
his pov the joker in tight closeup
offscreen an infant begins to squall
the joker cocks an eyebrow
babys got a tummyache
heres something thatll fix him quick he tosses a joker product out of frame
then leering he gives the camera a big juicy wink
now on your grocers shelf
so remember use joker brand and put on a happy face
video snow fills the screen as the jammed transmission end
alfred looks over his shoulder
the gotham globe cartwheeling into frame contaminated products claim lives an anchorwoman on the evening news
her complexion is curiously sallow
black bags show under her eyes
sixteen new deaths with no clues as to the jokers identity or demands
the list at potentially lethal products now includes perfume mascara cold cream the makeover counter at bloomingdales
security guards rush to the scene as three matronly customers go into simultaneous smiling fits
an anchorman with a big ugly zit on his nose mens cologne toothpaste mouthwash underarm deodorant a subway car jammed with straphangers
huge patches of sweat under every arm
the doors slide open oncoming passengers recoil visibly at the unendurable stench
the original anchorwoman whose look is now natural
her hair is frizzy
her eyebrows are missing altogether
every wrinkle on her face is plainly visible
hair spray eyebrow pencil moisturizing cream a large drugstore
cashiers sit idly by the registers
the store is utterly devoid of customers
from across the street we see vicki headed down the sidewalk toward a museum
a gloved hand reaches for a pay phone
shes outside the fluegelheim
a bone white hand slams a phone receiver down
the joker is at his vanity
hes rinsed his hair black
hes applying pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face his puckered cheeks
in the right light he could almost pass for human
in all the city hes the only person still using cosmetics
a dreamy drugged voice intrudes jack
who was that
as he looks up at the mirror we get a quick glimpse of alicia behind him
the voice the long blonde hair are unmistakable
but for some reason alicias face is covered
by a shiny white porcelain dolls mask
were going out
a gotham landmark the fluegelheim looks like something frank lloyd wright wouldve dreamed up a large open atrium encircled by a stucco ramp which spirals up along the interior walls
to the ceiling four stories above
you walk up this gently inclined ramp to view the paintings
the upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy fern filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly matrons who work up an appetite looking at art
vicki enters camera bag slung over one shoulder portfolio in hand
im meeting mr
is he here
no but your table is ready
vicki sipping on a gin and tonic checks her watch
a waiter brings her a small parcel wrapped in brown paper bearing a single word urgent
miss vale this just arrived for you
as the waiter leaves she tears off the wrapper
inside is a small white box and a note scribbled in crayon
unsigned of course
vicki puzzled opens the box to find a miniature gas mask
she hears a strange hissing noise
a few feet away green smoke is billowing out of an air conditioning vent
trays of food crash to the floor as waiters pass out
art lovers drop forks go face down in their pasta salad
vicki hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth
within seconds shes the only one conscious in the room
green smoke plumes up toward the ceiling as we tilt down toward the floor of the atrium
patrons and security guards lie sprawled on the floor twisted at odd angles out cold
the mist is beginning to clear now
the doors swing open and in strolls the joker looking quite dapper in his street makeup and big purple pimps hat
a squad of goons enters behind him
some of them are carrying large cartons
they lock the entry doors place a closed sign in front of them and begin uncrating large the joker steps up onto the ramp examines the artwork with an appreciative
okay boys lets broaden our minds
he stops in front of an ingres odalisque
stands back a pace or two to get a better look
then pulls out a straight razor and cuts a long diagonal gash in the canvas
he ambles up the ramp stepping over collapsed patrons pausing at every fourth or fifth painting
monet water lilies a degas ballerina all get the razor treatment
behind him his cronies work their way up the ramp heaving black paint on every canvas the joker has missed
he cocks an eyebrow at edvard munchs the scream
i kinda like this one
vicki at her table still wearing the gas mask scared as hell
the overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark
the joker saunters over and pulls up a chair
i think its safe to take that off
vicki recognizes the deranged smile instantly
she removes the gas mask tries to gather her wits
youre quite beautiful
unfortunate but i think we can work around it
he sets a couple of candlesticks on the table and reaches for his lighter
a long jet of flame shoots out jerry lewis style as he lights the candles
youre vicki vale
i guess you know who am
is this your portfolio
he opens it begins leafing through the record of vickis career
newspaper photos from the globe at first
then fashion layouts magazine covers of celebrities
artier b w shots from vickis first couple of exhibitions
crap crap crap
now heres what caught my eye
hes come to the combat photos from corto maltese
the bloody skulls
the armless screaming fellows
you know the atrocities smirking somehow when you shoot it it all comes out so clean so lovely vicki is squirming but she doesnt think it wise to debate the
not with this lunatic anyway
i guess im just an old cornball but
i live for beauty
i look around at my little city it gets me down
indicating the photos we dont have anything like this
well it came to me that what this city needs
kind of a big makeover
enraptured miss vale i finally realized that one man can make a difference
you know the saying
in his image
created he them
vicki gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary getting more frightened by the minute
and you want a a visual record yes
a before and after kind of thing
leaning closer this could make your reputation
her first impulse is to get up and run
but she fights the impulse
she wont run
not until she gets this maniac on film
she reaches for her camera bag
maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist
people might like to see the face behind the makeup
momentarily puzzled behind the makeup
then it sinks in
by candlelight in the darkened restaurant with his pancake makeup and his black rinse job he looks practically normal vicki must think shes looking at his real face
i see what you mean
he finds a pitcher pours a glass of water and very carefully sets it on the table in front of vicki
then suddenly inexplicably he barks at her joker cont
silly little twit i cant take you anywhere
he sits back and grins expectantly
vicki is thoroughly nonplussed by this bizarre outburst
a moment passes
he obviously wants her to do something but she hasnt got a clue as to what it is
growing impatient now he points at the water glass joker cont
what are you waiting for
now vicki gets the point
she picks up the glass and hurls its contents in the jokers face
his hands go up
he shrieks like the wicked witch of the west dissolving
he reaches for a napkin to wipe his face clean
and begins to cackle
his awful white and green clowns face revealed behind the running makeup he leers at her
you see miss vale that was my makeup
leaning forward what do you think
vicki is repulsed but shes determined to tough it out
ive seen worse
strong stomach huh
i like that in a woman
maybe we can do business after all
he seems to have calmed down a bit
its almost as if hes coming on to her
but just then a tiny bell sounds behind them
and a voice intrudes jack
the joker turns
alicia steps out of a rooftop elevator and moves toward them drugged wraithlike
shes still wearing the porcelain dolls mask we saw earlier
to vicki christ its my girlfriend to alicia you said i could look at the pictures before you before you shucks honey i forgot
rolling his eyes at im in trouble now to alicia this is business sweetie
why dont you go outside and see how the boys are coming
vicki cant take her eyes off this strange figure drifting eerily through the abandoned tea room
hesitantly why the mask
come here have a seat
show miss vale why you wear the mask
alicia sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask
you see miss vale alicias beautiful
one in a million
a work of art in fact
were looking at alicias profile as the mask comes off
the side thats turned to us is indeed beautiful
but the side we cant see
sends vicki right over the edge
she makes you look sick vicki lurches out of her seat knocking it over her face frozen in horror
she finds her camera holds it out like a weapon as the joker advances on her
you sick filth
you did that to her
i improved her a little
vicki backs away snapping the shutter on her camera
he blinks as the flash gun goes off repeatedly
ill see you burn ill see you dead miss vale was it something i said
brightly do you want to sniff my flower
theres a bright purple boutonniere in his lapel
he holds it up for vickis inspection as he moves menacingly closer
the joker squeezes a concealed bulb
a jet of clear liquid spurts out of the flower narrowly missing vicki
bumps into a table
acrid black smoke rises from the floor where the clear liquid hit
acid come on miss vale
stop and smell he backs vicki into a corner
and then abruptly drops to the floor of the restaurant
and the joker is face to face with
on his wrist is a steel gauntlet
ha aims it at the joker like a weapon
then pivots suddenly points his arm and fires a metal spike into the adobe wall of the ramp joker cont
on the end of the spike is a cord leading to batmans belt
in the wink of an eye hes grabbed vicki dragged her out of the tea room and plunged over the ramp wall four the joker races to the edge of
his goons are stationed at various points along the ramp still defacing masterpieces
they pull their guns and open fire as batman and vicki plummet past
he holds the gauntlet overhead rope whistling through it
as we watch the gauntlet sprouts steel wings forming a bulletproof shield over their heads
two feet above the marble floor the rope jerks them up short like a bunjee cord
guns blaze as batman and vicki drop safely to earth and make for the exit
the doors are locked
batman spots the black closed sign on a metal stand
he heaves it through the glass doors
vicki hustles through
he points her to a side alley
vicki rounds the corner just as batman lobs a smoke pellet into the doorway of the fluegelheim
vicki suddenly feels quite stupid
because while there are many cars parked along the side alley there is only one batmobile
the batmobile is sleek futuristic and
imagine your own
vicki climbs into the passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning array of electronic gadgetry
as batman sprints down the alley a computer display on the dashboard registers his unique voiceprint
a tinny synthesized voice repeats the command ignition
the engines are revving up even as batman vaults into the cockpit alongside vicki
guns in hand the jokers goons are stumbling out of the fluegelheim hacking coughing blinded by smoke
they dive for their lives as the batmobile comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour
the joker emerges just as the batmobile careens off
the joker climbs into the back of a van labelled monarch playing cards
half his goons pile into the van behind him the other half into a second car nearby
sirens howl as police cars converge on the flugelheim
roaring out into city traffic
i called them
shouldnt we a police car whizzes past the batmobile
the cop car does a quick and sets out in hot pursuit of the batmobile
batman floors the accelerator in response
tight on the demented face of the joker
a goon calls out from the front of the van
there they are
the joker screams into a radio dispatchers mike
the jokers army
thugs in cars
creeps in italian restaurants
crooked cops at a coffee shop
lights flash beepers sound and within seconds theyre racing to the streets eager to join the chase
the batmobile streaks through an intersection nearly causing a pileup
the jokers van makes short work of a sabretts hot dog stand in its path
pedestrians gawk as the sleek supercar rips up the what about her
what about the girl
he wont kill her gritting his teeth theyre moving up on an empty block a night construction team
a huge piece of heavy machinery backs up slowly and inexorably blocking the intersection
and hits the brakes stopping inches short of a head on collision with a lamppost
he jumps out of the car
no chance to get through
the jokers van is two blocks back and coming up fast
onlookers and construction workers are beginning to form a crowd around them
cant we too many people
as she scrambles out the batmobiles computerized voice replies shields
with a series or clangs chrome steel plates slide into place across the cockpit over the tires leaving the batmobile an inert impenetrable block of black metal
batman and vicki sprint through the construction site vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble
three police cars red lights blazing overtake the jokers van and bear down on the abandoned batmobile
are they ours
i dont know
wed better get out of here
into radio mike westbound on th
do you copy
the van does a discreet u turn and rumbles off sedately down the street
batman and vicki zigzag past storefronts and candy stands dodging astonished pedestrians
four goons with guns
they spot batman and vicki coming off the side street
goon i the driver speaks into a radio we got em
over radio take em
i want his head batman and vicki race down the sidewalk
the car is gaining on them and then from behind batman and vicki are caught in a spray of bullets
drop behind a parked car
and dont come up
theyve ducked into a blind alley
hunkered on the pavement they watch the car glide past the mouth of the alley
vicki sighs in relief
batman still alert his muscles tensed puts a restraining hand on her arm
he looks overhead sees a catwalk spanning the width of the alleyway five stories up
how much do you weigh
a hundred and eight
he does some quick mental calculations
then the car reappears backing up blocking their only avenue of escape
batman unfurls a rope heaves a batarang upward and grabs vicki roughly about the waist
the jokers thugs pile out of the car
the batarang catches on the catwalk and batman triggers the spring action reel on his utility belt jerking him and vicki into the air
bullets zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line
one story two stories and then
they dangle in midair as the jokers goons advance
batman wriggles twists
they lurch upward another few feet and stop again
her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism theyre stranded two stories up sitting ducks
whatever happens dont let go
in the wink of an eye hes detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it around vickis belt
before she has a chance to protest he lets go
vicki rockets upward at blinding speed shrieking all the way
batman his cape billowing plummets downward
vicki slams up into the catwalk and bobs on the end of the line as batman lands with a loud crash overturning a row of garbage cans
the goons are on him in a flash one per limb
random kicking and flailing
batman manages to slam two goons into a wall but before he can get to his feet goon slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull
batman is down for the count
the thugs dust themselves off and circle around his prostrate form still wary
the lead thug holds his colleagues back draws his gun and fires two shots point blank at the yellow and black insigne on batmans chest
the body jerks
they move closer
no blood jesus
wait a minute
goon iii screws up his courage and crouches beside the body
he examines the batmans tunic
and rips it open
what is that
some kind of body armor hes human after all
take that mask off
five stories overhead vicki has pulled herself up onto the roof of the adjacent building
she watches transfixed as the thugs bend over to remove batmans cowl
but at this height and this angle she cant see his face
on a sudden impulse she reaches for her camera bag
peering down open mouthed at the unconscious face of bruce wayne
blood seeps from bruces left nostril
who is this guy
you seen him before
maybe hes got some kind of i
lets check his wallet
well worry about it later
beat in the head
goon ii draws his automatic
and at that very instant
a startled the thugs look up
another camera flash
goddam its the redhead
a chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the goons open fire
she ducks back behind the overhang holds the camera out over the ledge and keeps on flashing
shes used up her roll
the goons keep shooting as she reaches in her bag for new film
she finds it loads the camera with astonishing dexterity and then on instinct reaches back inside the bag for a telephoto lens
all the better to see you with batman
no response from vicki
they begin to relax a little
did you hit her
wax that freak
they turn their attention to bruce
a gloved hand snakes out with lightning speed grabbing goon i by the coattail and pulling him directly into the line of fire
goon ii bas pulled the trigger twice before he knows whats happened
in one fluid motion bruce heaves goon is lifeless body through the air knocking goon ii backward over a garbage can
goon ii falls and cracks his head on the nearest wall
goon iii takes a rabbit punch to the throat
hes on the way down when he catches a steel toed boot in the gut
four seconds after all this began bruce is alone in the alleyway with goon iv
goon iv has his gun pointed right at bruce but hes shaking too much to pull the trigger
goon iv screams and runs for his life
through all this vickis telephoto camera has been poised on the ledge snapping away
bruce looks up at the flash gun and shakes his head
he bends to retrieve his cowl
she finally dares to peek down at the alley
limp goons everywhere
and in addition the batman leaping up grabbing the edge of a fire escape climbing up to meet her
vicki thinks fast
she may have a clean shot of batmans face
she advances the film in the camera and removes the roll then drops it down her blouse
but batman is likely to want that roll so she straightens her skirt and scurries across the roof away from the alley
she should have a minute or so before be gets there
its a three foot drop to the next roof over
vicki clambers down and quickens her pace tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder every couple of steps
then somehow and shell be damned if she can figure out how she walks smack into the batman
not even a thank you
well i think you might consider thanking me you were good as dead
thats because you lied about your weight
a long pause thank you
vicki nods and tries to walk past him
he grabs her arm
ill have to ask you for that film
i just wanted to distract them
i wasnt trying to get a picture of you batman looks down at the camera hanging from her neck
the telephoto lens must jut out six inches
i wont let you have it
the batman is amused
he smiles menacingly
i know you can break my neck and take it
but the jokers on that same roll
i the joker is a murderer
and you were as good as dead
so look i appreciate what you did for me
but this is my job
and im keeping those pictures
all right heres a compromise
ill develop the photos
you keep the jokers and ill keep the rest
how do i know you wont keep them all
because ill take you with me
he reaches out holds her gently by the shoulders
his voice is deep and soothing
true vicki is a little dizzy from all thats happened but shes undeniably drawn to him
still cautious though
she reaches into her bag and hands over a roll of film
the original roll not the telephoto shots which are still stashed in her blouse
thank you vicki
where are you going to take me
she looks up into his mirrored eyes
he pulls her closer to him
brushes back her hair runs one hand delicately along the line of her cheek
and breaks a tiny capsule under her nose
vicki slumps into batmans arms
batman emerges carrying vickis inert form in his arms
he pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at the batmobile two blocks down
the car is still there the chrome steel shields intact
but dozens of cops and curiosity seekers are swarming all over the fearsome machine
batman snorts in frustration
an enormous three ton caterpillar winch rumbles up the street toward the batmobile
hes about to get towed batman takes a radio transmitter from his utility belt and speaks into it
two cops are crawling along the hood of the car
from within they hear the tinny computerized voice shields open
the steel plates begin to retract
over radio ignition
the stunned cops gaze into the batmobiles cockpit
theres somebody in there
they tumble off the hood as the turbine engines roar to life and the batmobile begins to move
cops and onlookers quickly clear a path
they stand there stunned as the futuristic auto picks up speed and advances toward the end of the block
the left turn signal flashes dutifully
and the batmobile vanishes around the corner
pandemonium breaks loose as the cops bolt for their cars
passersby stare slackjawed at the driverless batmobile as it tears down the street passing darting dodging buses and cutting off taxis all with a squad of cop cars in hot
batman sees the batmobile rounding the corner and approaching on the straightaway
he takes vicki in his arms and steps directly into the path of the onrushing brakes squeal
the batmobile stops one yard short of batman and vicki
a moment later batman is at the wheel
the cop cars are now visible behind them
batman floors the pedal the batmobiles powerful afterburners kick in and the hapless cops kill their sirens as batman zooms off into the night at mph
a deserted stretch of road lined by ancient tall pines on either side
the batmobile roars past
vicki is gradually coming to on the passengers side
how long have i been out
quite a while
i took the scenic route
gazing around her well ive certainly enjoyed it
hes just hit a button on the dashboard
at the side of the road a fallen tree surrounded by underbrush rises hydraulically into the air revealing a secret road invisible from the main thoroughfare
doing sixty the batmobile makes a hairpin turn
seconds later the fallen tree drops back magically into place
as they cruise down the hidden road vicki studies batmans face
knoxs words are very much on her mind
i meant to ask you
up on the roof how did you know my name
batman smiles in response
vicki smiles with him
how did you know
vicki frowns looks through the windshield and sees much to her horror an enormous sheer cliff wall wide eyed she looks at batman
still smiling he hits the gas speeding up
she lets out a scream
one second to impact
suddenly the cliff wall vanishes altogether revealing in its place the gaping mouth of the batmobile zooms through
a moment later the cliff wall which is nothing more than a holographic projection winks back into existence showing no trace of the cavern
we all know this place
although we havent had time to acquire the familiar mementos the dinosaur the giant penny the batcave is unmistakable
vast banks of blinking computers
a state of the art crime lab
a fully equipped workshop for hammering out new toys
its the biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for
batman climbs out of the car
he removes his cape strips off his bullet riddled jersey and his body armor
there are two big bruises on the center of his chest
vicki looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and picks out a fresh tunic one of four
she wanders over to examine the row of bat suits and the body armor
what is this stuff
its not on the market yet
it doesnt protect your head though
thats why i wear a target on my chest the batman takes obvious pleasure in showing her his futuristic bachelors pad
his tone is jokey almost flirtatious
behind the mask hes a lot looser more carefree than some guys we could name
like bruce wayne
vicki is to put it mildly awed
she wanders around gaping at millions of dollars worth of equipment
howd you find this place
stumbled across it when i was a boy
vickis head jerks up abruptly
in the dim recesses overhead bats are screaming
they dont come down here
theyre afraid of the lights
i dont like bats
not that kind
they used to terrify me
but i forced myself to keep coming back and smiling i guess i became the thing i feared the most
ill do your photos now
he goes to a high speed photo processing machine the kind they have at fotomat only better and loads the roll
vicki wanders over to the edge of a deep black pit
she kicks a pebble over
long seconds pass no sound
she looks up
suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of gymnasts rings
this guy is dedicated who pays for all this
i have sponsors
im running a check on the tainted products
there is a pattern
no more makeup
looks like well all be showing our true faces now
she looks straight at him
its almost a direct request
but batman is preoccupied with the matter at hand
ive tracked all the records
every shipment every warehouse every loading dock
no opportunities for tampering
somehow the joker is supplying tainted ingredients
at the source
you can just tap into any corporate database you want
i let the fbi do that
then i tap into the fbi
your photos are ready
he holds up a hand to vicki stand back
then he checks out the pictures smiling as he shuffles through the prints
you couldve killed him you know
you could have killed the joker
i had to save you vicki
turning to face her here you go
i think ill let you keep the whole set
she looks at the photos
and four shots of the batman in action
hes without his mask but theres no clean angle on his face
vicki doesnt quite know why but her head is reeling
care for an autograph
he takes one of the prints scrawls on it hands it to her with the inscription to vicki
now he turns to shut down the photo machine
vicki is trembling
her hand goes to her belt finds the telephoto roll concealed in her blouse
she steps up silently behind him reaches for his cowl
at the last second
he freezes in place for an indecisive moment
then are you talking to me
he turns in seeming incomprehension
and shows her a smile
the same crooked curious childlike smile she saw on bruces face that morning when she caught him singing
maybe weve had enough for one night
ill take you home
almost in a trance now she lets him lead her to the batmobile
as she takes her seat he reaches into his utility belt for another knockout capsule
do you want to do it this time
vicki doesnt move
she looks at the capsule in her hand as he walks over to the drivers side and gets in
dont be afraid
she takes one last look at the familiar smile beneath the mask
then breaks the capsule and breathes deep
flame erupts from the rear of the batmobile as the after burners kick in and batman screeches off
a fiery red glow fills the screen burning out the image as we the red glow resolves itself into a dreamlike street scene liquid weightless figures moving in a tinted
soundless cityscape as distant tinkly carnival music plays underneath
were outside a theatre watching first nighters emerge from the opening of a hit musical
in the crowd we pick out three figures dr
thomas wayne his wife martha and in thomass arms their young son bruce
bruce hasnt made it through the show
hes asleep head nestled peacefully against his fathers shoulder
thomas rouses the boy gently sets him down on the sidewalk
bruce rubs the sleep from his eyes as thomas puts an arm around his wife
together they begin walking
in a single cut the crowd has disappeared and the waynes are walking toward us up a deserted street
thomas and martha are laughing making jokes reaching down to tousle bruces hair
their faces as they draw closer are full of joy
and then without warning a handgun enters frame
the waynes freeze in their tracks
thomas steps protectively in front of his wife reaches for his wallet begins unbuckling his watch
he wont put up a fight
marthas hand goes involuntarily to the pearl necklace at her throat
the gunman sees it gestures for her to hand it over
but martha is paralyzed afraid to move
the gunman steps past thomas snatches at the necklace
the instant his wife is threatened thomas attacks
the pearl strand breaks in the gunmans hand as he drops toward the sidewalk
a silent burst of flame erupts from the muzzle of the gun
martha emits a piercing shriek a shriek we cannot hear a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame
bruce stands paralyzed in shock
the gunman scoops a handful of pearls off the sidewalk reaches for marthas purse and rises slowly his gun levelled directly at the boy
almost catatonic bruce stares down at the corpses of his parents
at their hands somehow intertwined
at the tiny glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around them
he looks up with a gaze so bleak so petrifying
that the gunman turns and runs
and we cut
to an exact reproduction of the pulitzer prize winning photo
the cops bent over the bodies the medics with their stretchers the boy bruce his arms wrapped tightly around the waist of officer gordon
theres only one difference
bruces head is turned away from us
we cant see his face and now a hand enters the frame
much like the gunmans hand but feminine beckoning
bruce hearing his name looks up then agonized ashamed he buries his face in gordons side
gordon gestures angrily at the intruder
but the hand keeps beckoning
and ultimately bruce turns
showing us the tear stained face from the famous photo face slack with horror
the horror of his parents death
and more importantly the horror that someone would dare to violate this most private and terrible of moments at last we see what bruce sees a woman crouched on the
the woman is holding a camera
the woman is smiling prettily at bruce
the woman is vicki vale
a flashbulb explodes
the screen with its blinding white light scorching out the image as a harsh ringing sound cuts through the silence
she sits up in bed tremulous distraught
the bedside phone is ringing
she reaches for it but her hand freezes in midair
she knows whos calling
three rings later she manages to lift the receiver
to her amazement she finds she cannot speak
finally she hears a voice at the other end of the line
bruce at a big mahogany desk in his somber book lined study
the room is dark but for a small table lamp
vicki ive been thinking about you
long pause i know its late
i are you there
yes bruce im here im sorry about the way things went between us
id very much like to see you again
i dont think
that would be possible
i wish youd reconsider
groping i didnt stand you up today
the museum was closed when i got there
her voice trails off
shes profoundly shaken
vi she returns the receiver to its cradle
he hears the click
his lips part slightly
he hangs up and sits there at the desk staring straight ahead
vicki stands before the bathroom mirror
she holds the opened roll of telephoto shots over the sink
then she strikes a match
ignites the film
drops it into the sink and with hollow eyes watches it burn
its four in the morning
vicki wrapped in a bathrobe still shaky pours her fifth cup of coffee
sitting across from her is a rumpled and stubbly alexander knox
vicki it all fits
the stuff youre telling me the car the equipment somebodys paying for it
i just cant the fbi
you know whos got the fbi computer contract
shaking his head the guys bats all right
hes bat shit crazy this is gonna be the most incredible but hes not
hes not crazy
knox slaps his forehead in frustration sprawls back in his chair
we got a wealthy millionaire here
who dresses up like a bat
he goes out at night and swings around in his cape on a rope throwing up his hands okay
maybe im crazy
he wants to tell me thats why he took me there
because hes trying to tell me
gimme a break
if he wants to chat he can talk to his car the joke dies
vicki stares dead ahead
knox looks on in utter disbelief as it all comes into focus hes lost her loyalty
vicki is in over her head with bruce
he has to tell someone
and im the one
hes trying to tell me
knox hurt in a way he doesnt fully understand gets up and pulls on his coat
he stares at her coldly well when he does you know my number
customers are lining up to buy the early edition of the globe which carries the full page banner headline batman joker in fluegelheim shootout in the midst of the hubbub
a delivery truck cruises past dumping a bundle of afternoon editions on the sidewalk
war of the freaks has been relegated to the lower right hand corner of the page supplanted by more pressing news product scare drops dow to biggest one day decline
in history bruce in a plush office suite downtown on the phone to his broker
behind his desk is a big plate glass window with a fortieth floor view of the financial district so he can wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down
it wont last
well ride it out
with exaggerated calm he hangs up
he lifts the receiver to dial another number then hesitates and hangs up again
bruce affecting an air of nonchalance strolls past a squad of secretaries at desks
phones are ringing off the hook
bruce ambles past a couple of colleagues
one of them is shambling catatonically down the hall bumping into walls
the other is wailing hysterically
a nine million dollar bath bruce nods in sympathy as they pass
he stops outside the door to a mens room looks around cautiously then enters
a small anteroom outside the bathroom proper with a bank of pay phones on one wall
bruce checks the bathroom to make sure its empty then digs out a quarter and dials a number
he cups one hand confidentially over the receiver the familiar rasp vicki
this is batman
i thought id call and see how youre doing
hesitantly i know its you bruce
im not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it
a little smile whos this bruce
are you trying to make me jealous
filter im serious bruce
we have to at this very moment a dazed financier enters from behind
bruce automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece
his face goes slack as he hangs up with vickis tinny voice still squeaking on the other end of the line
harvey dent at a big desk flanked by a number of we deal
i mean shaking his head if your first official act as d
is to cut a deal with a terrorist screw that ed
weve got a market panic of national proportions
weve got people dead beat i wont sacrifice one more life for the sake of appearing strong

harvey the police are working round the clock the feds are coming in
this thing could break any minute now
turning tell him jim
commissioner gordon reaches into his vest pocket for a cigar
he clips the end off lights it takes a long drag
and stares glumly at the floor
cut the deal
the mayor sits impatiently at a long table flanked by jim gordon harvey dent and other prominent officials
the room is packed with reporters and tv news crews
at city hall where the mayor is waiting to open negotiations with the clown faced terrorist known as the joker
it is now eight minutes past the appointed deadline and still no word from reporters cluster around a bank of four tv sets each tuned to a different station all
broadcasting from city hall
look at em sweat
cant wait for the next gallup poll
hey knox cheer up
it aint the batman but its pretty choice
knox who has recently taken up smoking responds with a grunt
sudden hubbub from the onlookers as a wave of video noise wipes half the screen away
on one side is the mayor
on the other sitting in a directors chair with a big yellow happy face backdrop behind him is the joker grinning fiendishly
can we talk
the mayor fumbles for his prepared statement
while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace
demands well gents this is kinda embarrassing but
im having such a swell time i just havent thought any up he shrugs
startled reactions from the city officials
but im a reasonable fella
if you want to make me an offer panicked the mayor and co
go into a quick huddle

more video static sweeps across the screen pushing the mayor clean out of frame
the joker leers at the camera
i might just think up some demands
and im gonna talk to all my friends and see what they want too
and then maybe well get together have a little party exchange presents waving goodbye happy birthday gotham
the shadow of your smile comes up underneath as the jokers transmission ends and the screen goes black
frantic activity as reporters rush to their telephones and typewriters
knox strolls slowly back to his desk
hes sitting on the biggest story of his career
and now as he realizes grimly nobody knows or cares
a tiny island in gotham harbor homesite of lady gotham the huge newly restored stone statue that welcomes incoming ships
her upper half is draped in a huge tarp prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this sunday
at the base of the statue workmen are assembling a big wooden platform complete with microphones amplifiers and spotlights
they raise a gigantic banner which reads a taxi pulls away from the wrought iron gate at the entrance to the estate
knox ambles up to a stone pillar glances up at a video camera mounted over the gate and hits a buzzer
through loudspeaker yes
gotham globe mr
wayne is out for the day
actually i wanted to talk to batman
pass that on to mr
wayne would you
knox starts cockily off down the driveway then stops
behind him the iron gates are sliding open
knox agitated drums his fingers on the edge of a big leather chair
bruce stands across from him
ive been expecting to hear from you
well thats how it is chum
she tells me everything
what is it you want
you know the score
one column and i can bring all this tumbling down
i can take you off the streets once and for all
a shaky pause i want you to hang up the suit
and i want you to stay away from vicki
i cant do that
not while the jokers still out there
then stay away from vicki
thats all i want man
i just want your word
bruce turns away evading his gaze
knox fumbles in his jacket for a cigarette
see i dont know how it happened shes a smart girl and you are an extraordinarily screwed up guy but shes in love with you
theres something i dont understand
if youve got the story why havent you printed it
because i beat because shed never speak to me again
knox is a bundle of nerves now
no longer cocky he stubs out his newly lit cigarette and begins to plead openly
come on bruce
what have you got to offer

batman and mrs
laughing bitterly gimme a break huh
whos gonna be best rodent
bruce sinks into a chair exhales sharply
he cant even put up an argument
the two of them sit there not looking at each other as alfred appears in the doorway
do you want a drink
yeah a drink
man to man right
alfred bring something for mr
ill have one too
the weekend long birthday gala is getting underway and gotham park is mobbed with celebrants enjoying a free concert
onstage five elvis imitators dressed in everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits representing the king in progressive stages of deterioration
shes on the sofa beside a disconsolate bruce
so we just pretend none of this ever happened
we never met
we frightened youre going to get yourself killed bruce
you know that dont you
it wouldnt matter much
i dont understand it
you can do so much good for people
as bruce wayne he sinks back on the sofa closes his eyes
hes had the same argument with himself a thousand times
money makes money vicki
the foundation runs itself
im extraneous to the process
youre one man
you cant save everybody
what it i could save a handful
what if i could save one
vicki is sick of watching bruce torment himself
she stands up almost crying now and accuses him directly bruce at the rate youre going you cant even save yourself
staring right at her sometimes
i dont know if theres enough of me left to save
vicki is totally drained
she heads for the kitchen
ive got to have some coffee or something a moments breather as bruce sits on the sofa reflecting
then suddenly a knock at the door
vicki reappears and moves to answer the door
bruce on his feet instantly grabs her by the shoulder
are you expecting anyone
she nods no
he goes to the peephole in the door
through the peephole he sees a delivery boy
package tor miss vale
set it down by the door
on the left hand side
the delivery boy sets the package down and wanders off tipless muttering something about cheap shits
after a moments interval bruce opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package
another brown paper parcel
addressed in crayon
he strides past her handling the parcel gingerly and sets it down on the kitchen counter
its just like the last time
he sent me a present before he very thoughtful
dont touch it
as vicki watches he goes into the living room and finds his alligator attache case
he opens the case removes a laptop computer and a handful of business papers
then lifts out a false bottom to reveal his utility belt
dont tell me you carry it around with you
i feel naked without it
he takes out a tiny ultrasound scanner rather like a stethoscope with a miniature sonar display where the earpieces should be and runs it over the package
not a bomb
but it could be rigged
wait in the next room
he takes a small gas mask from his belt puts it on then slits the wrapping with a steak knife
cautiously he pulls back the flaps
the box is full of styrofoam popcorn
bruce shoves a hand down into the popcorn
and extracts a human ear
in the doorway behind him vicki lets out a squeal
bruce grabs the box and dumps two dozen ears on the counter
theyre wax vicki finds a hand scrawled note among the ears
it worked for van gogh
lets make up
ill need you soon
whew lost in thought that does it
its going to be this weekend
the kitchen phone rings
vicki reaches for the receiver
her eyes go wide and she gestures him over
alicia in her porcelain mask on the phone
i thought you ought to know hes coming for you
faces pressed together as they listen in
bruce covers the mouthpiece with one hand
keep her on the line
where are you calling from
as vicki struggles to keep the conversation alive bruce rushes into the living room and crouches beside his laptop computer
he plugs it in flips open the screen punches up a telecommunications program
a moment later vicki enters from the kitchen
im sorry she hung up
what are finding out where she is
how can you do that if shes already off the line
ive had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum
massive computers click and whir
at bruces prodding information comes up on the monitor a number a name alicia hunt and an east side address
the same information scrolls across bruces screen
i have to leave a message
hes heard something in the hallway outside
elevator doors open on three thugs
one of them uses a key to lock the car in place on vickis floor
the key is on the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys
the key ring belongs to a doorman whos riding in the elevator with the jokers trio of thugs
hes dead alas
the thugs dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall and march toward vickis apartment
bruce is nowhere in sight
vicki is at the sink washing dishes acting nonchalant
she pretends not to hear the door unlocking behind her
she turns and faces the three advancing thugs
hi miss vale
lets not put up a fight huh
cause wed hate to have to bruce steps into the doorway behind them
with a single sweep of the arm he flings three drug tipped ninja wheels at the thugs catching one in the neck one in the shoulder one in the hip
they collapse in quick succession
theres a garage in this building
vicki nods yes
bruce all business now that hes in his element disappears into vickis bedroom
she peeks around the corner
he reemerges carrying a black nylon stocking which he stuffs into his pocket
vicki is full of question but he shushes her before she can speak
ive got to take him out now
he stoops down beside the thugs and pulls the elevator key off the key ring which he then tosses to vicki
pick an apartment and stay there and listen call the police
give them that address
every available man he starts out the door stops just long enough to take a dumbfounded vicki in his arms for a kiss
the jokers van bearing the monarch playing card logo
two armed goons lean against the hood
they watch as the elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out
bruce pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the thugs head down whistling
as he walks around the van his hand brushes against it leaving a magnetized homing device almost too tiny to notice stuck to the fender
he walks another six paces then stops short
he feels around in all his pockets making a big show of having forgotten something
the goons eye him curiously as he strides back toward the elevator
the doors are closing before it strikes them that something is amiss
hey boss somethings up
the elevators working
frustrated snarling ready to throw a tantrum
you cant get good help these days
lets move out
from high above the street we see the jokers van pulling out of vickis building
were up on the roof with bruce
he hits a button on his utility belt and a red signal light begins to flash
bruce clamps the utility belt around his waist
pulls the black nylon stocking over his head
and suddenly hes bounding across the rooftops in pursuit of the joker
the van turns right at the intersection
but for some reason pedestrians are pointing at the sky staring goggle eyed at the rooftops
far above them a man dressed in a suit a tie a yellow belt and a black stocking mask is gliding across the intersection on a rope
the van driver guns through a red light
brakes squeal on either side
in the back of the van the joker growls slow down you maniac as the van roars past a mounted policeman shakes his fist
his horse shies rears back turns in a circle
hes just about gotten the beast calmed down when a man in a stocking mask plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands directly behind him on the horses
bruce elbows the startled cop
now theres only one rider
the van turns left
bruce gallops straight ahead through the intersection hoping to cut the joker off
alicia peers out through the window
on the street below unmarked cars are converging
the joker and co
are two blocks away from alicias
they see a police swat team sealing off the building
theyve theyll be sorry
theyll be sorry bruce on horseback charging past elegant old brownstones drawing stares from passersby
we get a quick look at the flashing red signal light on his belt
a yellow vw bug rips up the street at mph
we cant see the driver
but we do see on the seat beside him a video display with a shifting grid map of the city and on it a flashing signal blinking in perfect sync
with the one on bruces belt
bruce sees the vw bug rounding the corner and streaking toward him
he reins in the horse it rears back on its hind legs in a classic western pose the bug zooms past and alfred the butler heaves out a brown laundry
bundle neatly tied in string
bruce snatches it out of the air gives alfred a quick salute and the bug is gone
the joker and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the southern border of gotham park
police barricades are everywhere the surrounding streets have been roped off for the birthday gala
horns honk in anger
cant you do something
its some kind of detour
theyre backed up for blocks
the joker snorts
he happens to glance into the side view mirror
what he sees there
curdles his blood
oh my god
how does he do it
on horseback passing stunned cops weaving in and around the stalled autos gaining fast on the joker
the joker climbing all over the driver
he hits the gas runs the van up on the sidewalk and at the first opening he sees crashes through a police barricade into batman is half a block behind
as he follows hot on the jokers heels two helicopters swing into the park from overhead
on the central platform where we saw the free concert earlier an emcee mans the microphone the most spectacular most death defying aerial stunt ever devised
tonight for the first time anywhere the flying graysons
he points up at the two approaching helicopters flying side by side in tight formation some forty feet apart
onlookers gasp as two trapezes drop from the bellies of the twin copters
dangling from the trapezes are the flying graysons a husband and wife aerialist team in spangled red and green suits
they begin swinging toward each other in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters
panic down below as the jokers van barrels through the crowd horn blaring
batman is moving up swiftly
on each wrist hes wearing a miniature rocket launcher
he lets fly with two salvos
the first explodes harmlessly against a tree
the second hits the rear door of the van driving it off the access road down into the brush where it nearly topples over sideways
grayson has just completed a double somersault in midair landing in the capable hands of his wife
now theyre swinging again building momentum as he prepares to make the return leap back to his own trapeze
in the bay of the helicopter stands a kid fifteen compact tough and wiry dick grayson
like his parents hes wearing a red and green suit
from the copter hes got a perfect birds eye view of the batman joker chase
ready to go dick
whats all the ruckus down there
the van bounces over rocks and bushes narrowly avoiding trees with batman in hot pursuit
at the foot of a hill the joker spies a truck
on its side in bright red letters a warning danger the joker reaches into the back for a highway flare
head for the truck
hovering over the chase scene dick catches sight of the joker
he gasps in shock as a lit flare flies from the back of the van
directly into the fireworks truck
the batman is thrown off his horse by the shock of a massive explosion
all at once the sky is full of the joker hangs out of the rear of the van looking up an expression of pure delight on his face
lurching and spinning in the sky as fireworks rocket past
one of them takes a dead hit on the rotor
john grayson falls to his death instantly a moment later the copter plummets into the trees with a resounding fiery crash
mary grayson hangs from the second copter as it bobs and weaves out of control
onlookers scream in terror
the jokers van bursts out of the park and speeds up a wide cordoned off avenue
overhead the second copter veers wildly out of the park now swinging dangerously close to the tall buildings along the avenue
dick grayson at the mouth of the bay hanging on by a canvas strap
he watches helplessly as his mother swings into a power line and drops three stories to the pavement
his face is contorted with rage and pain
the pilot struggles desperately to right the copter barely avoiding a collision with the nearest building
and then before the pilot can make a move to stop him dick has jumped with astonishing physical grace he dives
grabs a flagpole
executes a perfect somersault
flips onto a nearby fire escape
vaults to the next fire escape down
and leaps out over the street making a perfect two point landing on his intended target
the roof of the jokers van
the joker hears a thunk overhead
he casually lifts his gun and blows a hole through the roof of the van
the blast just misses dick
he sprawls flat yanks at the chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van and breaks off another shot through the roof
dick rolls forward hoists his chrome spear over the windshield
splintered glass flies everywhere as dick rams the shaft through the windshield
the driver dodges left and loses the van careens wildly toward an overpass
dick rises up into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads danger low clearance
hes about to get his head taken off
one second before impact a black caped shadow swings across the street and scoops dick off the roof of the van
batman and dick tumble to the pavement
the van knocks over a fire hydrant and stops
dick is already on his feet ready to charge the van when batman throws a powerful arm around his waist
the joker steps casually out of the van
two goons with machine guns emerge behind him
pedestrians scream as the goons level their guns at the crowd
dick is kicking screaming clawing biting
batman has his hands full restraining the kid
like your boyfriend
hes kinda hot glowering at batman hands off the belt
let the boy go
gosh i could kill you but then youd miss my party and id be real real sad if you couldnt make it
what are you talking about
dont you even recognize your old pal jack
cackling insanely you made me what i am today batman cocks his head in puzzlement as distant sirens blare
the joker and his hoods guns still aimed at the crowd back away and race off on foot vanishing into the night
dick breaks free and bolts after them
batman throws him to the street with a flying tackle
the boy is hysterical
batman flinches at the sound of the words
he reaches into his belt and mercifully breaks a knockout capsule under dicks nose
a taped report from the hallway outside alicias apartment
cops and forensics men mill about in the b
on a tip attributed to the mysterious batman
the apartment was booby trapped with the jokers laughing gas leaving policemen dead
beat also found dead at the scene was alicia hunt a former model camera pulls back to reveal that the tv screen is part of bruces bank of monitors deep
in the batcave
the other screens show the various rooms of wayne manor all empty
we move now to the video display of a computer workstation showing two faces side by side a mug shot of jack napier and a freeze frame of the joker
from one of his pirate transmissions
a graphics program abstracts the twin heads into three dimensional rotating topological grids and as we watch the two spinning heads collide and merge
except for the fearsome grin they mesh perfectly
yet another terminal bruces database
the same phrase flashes again and again scrolling up the screen ace and finally bruce himself slumped at a table his head in his hands
hes realized to his horror that he is responsible for the birth of the joker and frankly
he would just as soon be dead
dick grayson is sprawled on a huge four poster bed unconscious softly moaning
he comes to with a jolt
breaking into a sweat almost instantly he looks at his unfamiliar surroundings
a shadowy figure stands nearby
where am i
my name is bruce wayne
youre welcome to stay here as long as you want
bruce steps out just as alfred enters with a breakfast tray
dick makes a puzzled face
what the hell is going on here
beneath the statue of blind justice bruce and harvey dent march through the portico engaged in a heated argument
well send a team into ace the moment the warrant comes through
hell be ready when you do
remember what happened at the apartment
all right bruce what do you suggest
i suggest a nice big bomb good
on a blind tip from bruce wayne
we do have laws then for gods sake harvey cancel the anniversary celebration
weve told him well deal
what could he possibly have to gain by do you still think the joker cares about money i dont know
im just a d
i dont have access to all your expert sources mexican standoff
bruce stalks off fuming
dent hangs back a moment then turns down the hall
the ornate wrought iron gate which opens on the long driveway snaking up toward wayne manor
its bolted shut
a glass enclosed room which houses an enormous heated indoor swimming pool
dick grayson does a couple of laps then climbs out and towels himself off
he looks out at the estate tennis courts a riding stable in the distance
hes not happy
all this opulence could drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order
an open suitcase on the bed
dick fingers a gold ashtray bearing the figure of winged victory then shrugs and tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnasts costume
when he looks up he sees bruce in the doorway behind him
your butler wouldnt gimme a ride so i figured id hoof it
i cant let you leave
you cant keep me here man
if i let you leave youll do the same thing again
youll go after the joker
and youll wind up dead
turning to go hey man
look at you
you got everything you want
how do you know whats in my mind
bruce turns to face him
the little hellions eyes are filled with raw burning hatred
bruce knows the feeling
i dont care whats in your mind
bruce reaches for a key in his pocket
without warning the kid rushes him throwing a rock solid punch
with blinding speed bruce sidesteps him parries the blow and winds up spinning dick around into a wall
dick is stunned but he has to laugh
this rich boy has a move or two
bruce stands there silently challenging him
a second later the kid is airborne upping the ante with a scissor kick aimed squarely at bruces gut
in a blur of motion bruce checks the kick swings an arm into dicks chest and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back
alfred in his apron fixing a tray of snacks
he looks up curiously at the ceiling
from the sound of it a battle royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom
dicks body head down feet up flies through the air
he smashes into a closet door and slumps to the carpet
shaken now and sweating profusely he looks up at bruce
who stands calmly over him adjusting his necktie
a long tense moment passes between them
then youre him no reply from bruce
their gazes lock
dick and bruce look around
the puny mustachioed butler stands in the doorway feet spread in a dirty harry stance a
magnum trained on dick
its all right alfred
everythings under control
very good sir
alfred relaxes musters his dignity and turns to go
canned applause as the joker marches out onto a makeshift stage to give his quarterly report to the stockholders
ladies and germs im here to tell you
we have had one helluva quarter
he waves a pointer at three sales charts on portable easels
and fear fears gone straight through the roof you guys should be proud cause i couldnta done it without each and every one of you
more canned applause
the joker takes a bow
i feel its time to expand the joker line
i was askin myself what are the products that every consumer wants most
and thats when it hit me the water you drink and the air you breathe
strutting across stage now some of you have your eye on the profit margin
youre thinkin this boys too ambitious you dont approve
in fact some of you have been talking about turning me in to the cops
or knocking me off
glares out at the audience
but thats okay
not everyone shares my eye for beauty
and just to show theres no hard feelings im throwin a little shindig tonight and youre all invited the canned applause goes right off the meter
how bout it
is everybody happy
familiar faces all around the major players of the gotham underworld
but despite the enormous twisted grins no one here is laughing or applauding
no one here is living the joker is playing to a roomful of smiling corpses
one of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop
look at that folks
we got em rolling in the aisles vicki lies in bruces bed under the covers propped up on the pillows
bruce is in his robe over by the window looking out at his estate
all this apparatus vicki
this house and the money and the power
it was never mine
it was something i inherited
bruce wayne was something i inherited
pause all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce who could see me and not be frightened
im not frightened of you bruce
im frightened for you
in all these years
why couldnt i see how it would turn out
he turns toward her
his face is ravaged with guilt
now shes truly afraid
im responsible vicki
if it wasnt for me thered be no joker
tight on a tiny electronic device two cylindrical steel casings bracketed together topped by a digital timer
bruce makes a few adjustments with a jewelers screwdriver hits a trigger and watches the timer tick off seconds
at seconds bruce kills the countdown and clamps the device into an empty packet on his utility belt
he stands up wearily
hes in his bat suit minus the cape and cowl
behind him hanging back discreetly in the shadows is his loyal butler alfred
wheres the boy
hes quite docile
i know that feeling
it wont last
bruce takes a moment to survey the batcave as alfred looks on tremulously
hes a long way ahead of where i was at his age
taking alfreds shoulders i want you to treat him just as if he were me
hell be taken care of financially
you know what to do
dont let all this go to waste
their eyes lock for a long moment
alfred is unable to speak
finally bruce turns and starts slowly up the long circular stairway which leads from the batcave to wayne manor
on the third step he pauses bruce cont
as bruce disappears up the stairs a shaken alfred steadies himself against a lab table fighting back tears
bruce draws the curtains sets an alarm clock
the current time is pm
he sits cross legged on the floor slumps forward slightly and closes his eyes
he inhales exhales taking deep regular breaths
his muscles relax
ten seconds later bruce has plunged into deep sleep
the clock shows
at we track in on bruces unconscious face drawing closer and closer until his eyelids fill the frame twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of r
without warning his eyes snap open
hold on bruces gaze grim alert determined as the clock hits
an alarm sounds breaking the silence with its grating electronic whine
the trademark ace on the illuminated sign
from our vantage point high above we can see three cargo trucks rolling out the main gates
a half mile away the batmobile cruises up the waterfront approaching soundlessly its headlights off
preparing for a final showdown with the jokers forces
the jokers minions working late readying a huge shipment
at an open loading bay we find a dispatcher with a clipboard directing more unmarked trucks in the lot outside
boston philly loading bay one
the batmobile stops short of the main gate
engines roar and the supercar accelerates smashing through the gate and taking half the chain link fence with it
in the guards booth armed goons pull guns as the batmobile streaks across the parking lot and launches a rocket at the corrugated metal door which opens on the factory
a thunderous explosion tears a gaping hole in the door
the batmobile cruises through the flaming wreckage and skids to a halt on the refinery floor
the jokers men are everywhere
they take one look at the batmobile panic and pelt the car with a barrage of machine gun fire
cracks begin to spread across the batmobiles plexiglass dome
within moments the windshield shatters and bullets rip through the upholstered passenger seats
it doesnt matter
the car is empty
no ones driving track in on the computer console where a familiar tinny voice calmly repeats its pre programmed command detonate
a convoy approaches ace chemical gordons team preparing to raid the plant
inside each car special unit cops dressed in asbestos suits gas masks in their laps
all at once a brilliant red glare suffuses the sky
the jokers men running for their lives across the parking lot knocked flat by the force of six deafening explosions
for a few seconds everything is flame and fury
and then all thats left of ace chemical is a pile of charred rubble and a pillar of thick black smoke spiraling up to the sky
dazzling fireworks explode in the night sky over gotham harbor
searchlights sweep across the mammoth welcoming stone figure of lady gotham still wrapped in canvas ready to be unveiled
thousands of rubberneckers jam every square inch of andrews island
cops on horseback speak into walkie talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd
across the harbor ace chemical is going up in flames but as far as the crowd can tell with all the noise and excitement its just another part of the
at the base of the statue governor gilroy speaks into a microphone as governor of this great state it is now my honor to unveil for you a very special
lady a lady who stands tall for life and liberty americas favorite lady
lady the crowd begins to applaud rhythmically chanting lady gotham
its like times square on new years eve waiting for the big ball to drop
gilroy hoists a pair of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon hydraulic cranes kick into gear cables drop free and the canvas cover draws back from lady gothams face
to a chorus of screams from the crowd
suddenly in the midst of the hysteria the searchlights die
the stage lights blink out
andrews island is plunged into darkness
instantaneous mass panic the governor shouts to his aides as onlookers mob the stage
cops are knocked from their horses as the crowd stampedes
and across the harbor
block by block
gotham city is quick shots of four helicopters hovering at different points over the blacked out city
loudspeakers blare out a happy birthday gotham
heres a little token of my esteem
cause the partys on me
insane laughter echoes
cargo bays open wide
the jokers helicopters begin leafleting the city
anarchy in gotham as high denomination bills flutter to earth blanketing the streets
hopelessly outmanned cops try to maintain order as solid citizens trample one another in a paroxysm of animal greed
buildings empty as apartment dwellers race outside
all traffic stops as drivers climb out of their cars to snatch money from the air
in the pitch black subways terrified commuters are seized by claustrophobia
glass shatters doors break open as they claw their way out of stalled subway cars and spill out onto the tracks
on the streets above gothams criminal element is having a field day
the cops are preoccupied utterly helpless against the first waves of rioting and looting
punks race down the street carrying fur coats and color tvs
looters break through the display window of an electronics store and climb in among the goodies
only to fly out two seconds later on the wrong end of a in a crouch on the pavement snapping photos of the wild street action is vicki fearless professional
doing her job a battered ford escort cruises up behind her
vicki sees knox climbs into the passenger seat
hes wearing a big smile
theyre jazzed oblivious to danger
couldnt turn down the job huh
a girl could get hurt this way
deja vu what do you say
lets head for the lights
in the distance above the tops of the buildings beacons are sweeping the sky
stationed all up and down gothams widest thoroughfare are huge portable searchlights mounted on trucks with portable generators unaffected by the power outage
on the money covered sidewalks total bedlam
but on the street itself a bizarre parade is taking place just as if nothings wrong
rumbling up the avenue at two block intervals moored to floats are dozens of enormous balloons in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical figures
its like a hellish thanksgivings day procession
the lead off balloon is a gigantic grotesque clown smiling ghoulishly dressed in white pierrot frills
we tilt down to the float beneath it
and there atop a mountain of roses where the prom queen should be sits the joker smiling waving daintily at the rioters and looters presiding over the carnage like some
demented parade marshal
a desolate rural setting
moonlight glints on placid waters
we track in on a small sign bearing the legend gotham city reservoir
far off in the distance headlights are approaching
the three cargo trucks from ace chemical roll ominously toward the reservoir on their deadly mission
and then a streaking black shadow enters frame overtaking the trucks
a phenomenal ultralight aircraft swift sleek jet black and infinitely maneuverable it soars easily past the trucks swooping low just long enough to release a bomb over a concrete bridge
the bridge explodes blocking the trucks path to the reservoir
puzzled drivers climb out of their cabs and wonder what to do next
they spot the batwing in the distance banking doing a sharp
for a moment they gape in disbelief
then they head for the trees as the batwing dives directly at the trucks firing three armor piercing shells
and destroying the jokers lethal cargo once and for all
in the cockpit his jaw set not even looking back at the wreckage as his plane screams off toward the gotham skyline
frightened pedestrians race past overturned cars
a parade float run aground on the sidewalk begins to burn
above it a damaged balloon the cartoon character underdog is losing helium warping and buckling in on itself sinking down gently toward the flames
down the street knoxs ford escort is coming up fast
vicki snapping photos out the window as underdog drifts downward
flames lick up at his belly and the cartoon blimp explodes
so much for underdog
then as they drive past a second explosion
and all at once the street is full of deadly greenish gas
the ford escort windows up swerves out of a thick spreading cloud of green laughing gas threatening to engulf the entire block
vicki stares back at the green cloud
and sees up the street the jokers procession balloons by the dozen
oh my god
compressor tanks hes got the balloons rigged with compressor tanks jesus christ the guys a genius
batman at the controls gliding over the gotham streets
he looks down sees a billowing haze of dense green fumes
at its periphery looters reeling and staggering falling to the pavement laughing themselves to death
vicki staring through the windshield
overhead an aircraft streaks past
an aircraft with scalloped black bat wings
frantically allie the balloons
weve got to find some way to tell him
how they speed up the street toward the parade
suddenly knoxs eyes bug out
he slams on the brakes and skids to a halt
before vicki can speak knox has grabbed a tire iron from the back of the car and raced out onto the street
he flings the tire iron through a glass storefront
its a costume shop
in the window mannequins dressed in party costumes frankenstein
and that current popular sensation
as vicki catches up with him knox drags the batman dummy out of the store window
rips off its black cape
and waving the cape he vaults onto the back of a spotlight truck
vickis face goes slack
now she gets it vicki climbs aboard
they drape the cape over the face of the spotlight
then they put their shoulders to the swivel assembly tilting the spotlight aiming the beam
batman stares at the clown balloon dead ahead
on its massive distended belly
a burning yellow oval
and in the center of the oval
the black silhouette of a bat
batmans mouth drops open
he understands the joker reaches into a big sack and begins distributing miniature gas masks like party favors to his cronies on the float
then he pulls out a radio operated remote control device and points it up at the clown balloon
he hits a button
the clown begins to inflate
its joints bulge
its face swells up as the compressor tank concealed inside it releases its noxious contents
the joker is beaming a look of pure unalloyed joy on his face
when his parade float blows to smithereens beneath him
the joker and his men cartwheel through the air and tumble to the asphalt as the batwing whips past overhead soaring through the stone canyons of gotham at a degree
angle to the ground
as it rises rises swelling to grotesque proportions in the starless night
the tallest buildings are far below it now
finally it bursts and the deadly gas inside it disperses harmlessly in the wind
the joker on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the rubble of his float for the remote device
at last he finds it aims it up at the other balloons in the procession hits a button repeatedly
and howls in frustration
the damned thing is broken he heaves it to the street in a fit of pique
a screaming comes across the sky as the batwing swings back for another pass buzzing the joker at an altitude of twenty feet
sizzling laser fire sweeps the street
cables snap and balloons drift upward as batmans lasers sever their moorings
the joker can only look on helplessly in stunned disbelief
as hes watching his plans evaporate
his eyes fall on there
there a spray of machine gun fire shatters the bat signal
knox throws vicki to the street ducks down behind the spotlight and tosses her his car keys
the jokers goons are coming up fast as vicki reaches the ford starts it and comes roaring up toward knox
he jumps off the truck as vicki twists the wheel lays a track of rubber and noses the car back in the opposite direction
gunfire as knox jumps inside and they peel out
knoxs breathing is ragged but he breaks out in hysterical laughter nonetheless
the two of them are totally exhilarated
they cant believe what theyve just done
did you laughing wildly god yes allie
ive gotta say that was the ballsiest move i ever ecstatic holy shit holy he gurgles
an enormous gout of blood bubbles up between his lips and bursts
his hand goes to his stomach and comes away bloody
he looks down in genuine bewilderment
that quickly hes dead
vicki lets out an awful wail and slams on the brakes
she sits there in the middle of the street pounding the wheel tears pouring down her face
in the sky cartoon characters drift lazily out to sea
the joker and his boys running like hell down the avenue past the parade
they reach the last of the floats the one bringing up the rear then climb aboard and disappear through a concealed hatch
wood splinters as the top of the float begins to rotate mysteriously
the muzzle of a cannon breaks through the parade decorations
and one moment later
a rose covered tank is rumbling up broad avenue
batman sweeps past overhead
he sees the tank unleashes a burst of laser fire
it bounces harmlessly off the tank leaves a trail of smoking asphalt on the street
he swoops low overhead hits a button on his control panel as he streaks over the tank and into firing range
the joker and his men clap hands to their ears as an ear splitting ultrasonic shriek reverberates in the tank
the joker screams out commands to no avail
no one can hear him
he falls on the controls begins hitting buttons
the tank turret swings wildly
a heat seeking missile rips through the night narrowly missing the batwing
and blowing a hole in the side of a skyscraper
the blast all but knocks the batwing out of the sky
batman stabilizes the plane climbs for the clouds
when hes clear of the buildings he grits his teeth and rolls out
hes coming back for more the joker stares at a tiny blip on his radar screen
hell be back
hell be back
the black ultralight hurtles down broad avenue at full speed on a suicide mission
missiles streak past on either side
machine gun fire peppers the dome of the cockpit
the rear stabilizer wing takes a direct hit
and bursts into the batwing trailing thick black smoke bears down on the tank like a kamikaze plane
bomb bays open as batman dumps the last of his high explosives directly into the path of the tank
the batwing takes a hard bounce off the top of the tank and crashes to the street
and suddenly a gaping chasm opens underneath the tank as the bombs go off and broad avenue begins to split wide broken concrete slabs rain down on a subway car
stalled in the tunnel directly beneath broad avenue
support girders groan and give way as the street itself collapses and the front end of the tank drops through crushing the the rear end of the tank projects out
through the rubble
a hatch pops open
the joker crawls out through the smoke and pulls himself up to the street
hes down to his last three goons
he points to the batwing bent broken wedged on its side in the asphalt seam running up broad avenue half in half out of the tunnel
you do him
im outta here
the goons look on in dismay as the joker scurries off
they sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the batwing
through the cockpit dome they can see batman
inert in his harness beaten to a pulp all but dead
a jet of flame drives them back momentarily
they reach for their guns move in warily
the frightened goons turn in unison
an abrupt flurry of motion feet and fists flying quick flashes of red and green and three goons lie paralyzed on the street
the only one left standing is a fifteen year old boy garbed in a red and green aerialists uniform
batman slumps at the controls
beneath him asphalt shifts and buckles
the batwing lurches to the right drops a foot or two into the tunnel
metal braces collapse and the plexiglass dome of the cockpit shatters like an eggshell
tongues of fire lick at his face
hes helpless pinned in place
he manages to look up and sees through a dream like haze a hand extended toward him and suddenly dick is clambering down into the flaming wreckage
he gets an arm around batmans chest and with an extraordinary effort hauls him out of the batwing
they stagger across the ruptured street
batman grimaces in agony
his right leg shattered is like rubber beneath him
his ribs are crushed
hes barely conscious
now were even huh
how did you
hitched dick drags batman to safety as the batwing erupts into flame behind them
beat hes mine now dick snatches an abandoned
off the pavement
the batman tries to pull himself erect
the pain is unendurable
his body has finally failed him
he collapses on the pavement powerless to intervene as dick races off with murder in his eyes
a belltowers jagged spire jutting up into the night sky piercing the moon
down at street level the joker is scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old abandoned cathedral
he pulls a walkie talkie off his belt
come and get me
heavy paneled doors groan on tired hinges as the joker forces his way inside
then dick grayson appears hot on his trail sprinting up the steps two at a time
ancient and creepy
a huge pipe organ shattered stained glass windows row after row of mahogany pews
all forgotten covered with dust and cobwebs
the joker wanders about staring at the statuary the rusted icons
dick enters silently behind him
he kneels behind a rear pew brings up the gun and squeezes off three quick shots at the joker
the joker dives takes cover and returns dicks fire
in a crouch groping his way along the wall the joker finds what he wants a small door opening on a wooden stairway leading to the belltower
he ducks inside and starts up
dicks gun drops with a thud
his hand slips from the back of the pew
in the second before he slumps to the floor unconscious he sees a curious sight a tiny black ninja wheel imbedded in the flesh of his leg
behind him framed in the arched doorway a ragged black ghost begins his final unholy march down the center aisle of the old cathedral
a tiny stone chamber x open on four sides to the wind
the enormous church bell has long since been removed
the joker stands in an archway gazing at the gargoyles on the roof below
he hits a button on the walkie talkie im in the belltower
a pilot replies through his radio headset
the pilot swings the copter right in a wide swooping arc
broken beaten his right leg useless he hauls himself up the steps one at a time
he should be dead dried blood cakes his face his chest
dizzy exhausted his body strained to the limit he slumps against a wall to steady himself then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller and forces the capsule back
onto his dry swollen tongue
quaking all over he tries to draw himself erect
and topples over landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs
the stairway collapses turning to splinters beneath him
and suddenly batman finds himself dangling precariously in midair hanging by one hand to an upper step
it would be so much easier to let go
he looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway still falling vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell
then he looks up
at the trapdoor
a mere six feet away
his teeth clench in a monstrous grimace
and with an for a full five seconds hes blind with pain
a ragged wooden shaft is buried in his right shoulder
twitching trembling he reaches up and yanks it out with his last ounce of strength
the trapdoor is a foot above his head
it could be a mile
batman finally realizes hes not going to make it
he reaches down and rips open a velcro seal on his utility belt revealing the strange timer device we saw him making earlier
before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side
the batman is out like a light
the joker glances casually down at the trapdoor wondering what all the noise is about
he draws his gun moves cautiously to the trapdoor and lifts it a few inches
just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs
the joker stands there and lets out a little snicker
he looks out through the archway sees no sign of his rescue copter
then a look of curious amusement on his face he steps down through the trapdoor and lugs batman up into the belltower
he props batman up against a wall
still no sign of life
the joker crouches beside him and almost tenderly pats his face
the batmans lips part
but hes too weak to speak
i thought youd be more comfortable here in the belfry
chuckling to himself before i kill you id like to see who you are
would that be okay
batman emits a tiny low moan
the joker takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl
bruce wayne stares up with dulled sightless eyes
the joker reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief moistens it dabs at the caked blood on bruces face
oh my arent we pretty
brightening suddenly i know you
youre the rich boy
the joker is enormously tickled by this discovery
he claps his hands together in sheer glee
my goodness what in the world made you do it it mustve been something pretty terrible
hes practically dancing now
hes made a friend
you know we shouldve sat down and had us a little heart to heart
i bet we would have got on famously
well now youre not exactly the picture of mental health are you
bruce were both murderers
think how many people youve killed by letting me live
a spotlight cuts through the night sky
the joker hears his helicopter approaching in the distance
bruce reaches down furtively
finds the timer on his utility belt
flicks a switch
and the countdown begins
the joker pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly
i have to do it now bruce but it wont even hurt
the bats in his belfry alls right with the world
he has the razor almost up to bruces throat when bruce reaches out and grabs his lapels in a death grip
the joker is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection
why bruce then he hears ticking
looks down at the flashing digital display on bruces belt
he shrieks horrifically and drops the razor
bruce wont let go of him
finally he manages to lurch convulsively away sprawling on the floor of the belfry
bruce is wearing a great big joker smile
the joker reaches out for the ticking time bomb
thinks better of it and retracts his shaking hand
he can see the copter approaching now slicing through the clouds
he screams waves a flashlight in the air his signal beacon
the joker scans the belltower frantically
his eyes fall on the trapdoor
he races over flings it open starts down the stairs in a frenzy
there are no stairs theyve collapsed
screaming insanely the joker vaults through the door and makes for the open stone archway
the copter is directly overhead now
a rope ladder drops from its belly
the helicopter descends its whirling blades stirring up a windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral
dead leaves rise and swirl in the churning air
the joker makes a futile grab at the rope ladder almost losing his purchase on the archway parapet
he gestures wildly for the copter to make another pass
a maelstrom of swirling leaves
and now among the leaves roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of the old cathedral filling the air like a black cloud taking flight in blind uncomprehending
fury the joker leaps into empty space grabs hold of the ladder cackles in mad triumph and plunges into the night
six seconds remain
there is still time if he makes his choice now
surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings his body working on pure adrenalin he unbuckles the belt
lurches into position
heaves it out into the darkness
it snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder
the co pilot is hanging out one side of the copter just enough to see whats going on
its as if time has stopped
the world has grown suddenly silent
were looking down at the joker whose body lies splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the churchyard
slowly elegantly we have all the time in the world now we drift downward closer until his face fills the screen the familiar chilling grin still intact
sad clown a one crazy boy staring aimlessly at the stars
suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline glow
looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks bursting and burning spirals of color snaking through the sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence
its all so lovely
the jokers expression is happy almost childlike as he gazes up at this private show
gradually though the bright colors fade and the jokers face begins to relax the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness sets in
an anchorwoman delivering an oncamera editorial
as the details of the jokers heinous plan become known a citys gratitude goes out to the mysterious batman
his whereabouts remain unknown but batman if youre alive if youre listening thank you
vicki at a fresh gravesite
she places a floral arrangement in the urn at the head of the grave stands back to examine it then bends once more to reposition the drooping flowers
i loved you too
as soon as the words come out she begins to cry
then she gets hold of herself rises turns up her collar and goes
the headstone reads alexander knox
alfred in his apron on the phone
wayne is in thailand
im afraid hes quite unreachable
the glass enclosed room which houses bruces olympic sized swimming pool
outside snow is falling
in the pool on an inflatable rubber raft is bruce wayne
beside him waist deep is the water is vicki helping him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder
i dont know why im doing this
i half wish youd stay a cripple
you dont mean that
grasping for words i dont but
i do its just
i love you bruce
i taking her hand vicki
do you love half of me
or all of me
a hard question for vicki to answer
she thinks it over for several beats then smiles
i guess you did it didnt you
you saved everyone
for a moment he stares deeply into her eyes
then he pulls her over takes her in a tight embrace
i dont know how to explain this so it makes sense
but you saved me dick grayson stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and looks up at the gymnasts rings suspended overhead
he sets his jaw and then with only a moments hesitation his hands find the rings
he launches himself high into the air and does a spectacular triple somersault catching the rings on his way down
exhilarated he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the pit
a smile of pleasure comes to his lips
a dark moonless night
lights of the city sparkle in the distance
camera drifts across the rooftop settling finally on the broad back of a black caped figure poised at the edge of the roof gazing down on the streets below
a second figure enters frame
we get a brief glimpse of his red and green suit in the seconds before our eyes turn skyward
to the searing yellow spotlight sweeping through the clouds
in its center the vast black silhouette of a bat wings extended dominating the night sky
we hold on the glaring bat signal as batman and robin vanish over the edge of the roof plunging down toward new adventures
