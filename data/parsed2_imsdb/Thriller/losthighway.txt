lost highway a st century noir horror film
a graphic investigation into parallel identity crises
a world where time is dangerously out of control
a terrifying ride down the lost highway
david lynch june we see a clean moving pov illuminated by headlights
were floating down an old two lane highway through a desolate desert landscape
this gliding eerie pov continues as credits roll
when the credits end the headlights seem to dim and soon were moving through blackness
in the blackness a man fred is sitting on a bed smoking a cigarette
we see his back but with each glow of the cigarette ash we see his face reflected in a mirror on the wall across from him
in the darkness there starts the sound of a motor which draws curtains back across a large picture window just off screen
as the curtain moves hard edged light begins crawling across the room and we see everything clearly
fred is wearing a robe and pajamas its early morning
close up on freds face in the mirror blank expression face somewhat obscured or distorted by smoke from the cigarette
close up n freds actual face unshaven haggard look eyes seem empty glazed over
fred is years old with dark hair
the doorbell rings
fred looks up startled by the noise
he looks at the digital clock a
fred stands goes to an intercom on the wall next to the mirror
he pushes a button
a voice comes over the intercom
dick laurent is dead
fred leaves the bedroom and goes through the house
he is on the upstairs level
he looks through a narrow slot window but cant see the front door below
he goes further in the house to a picture window that overlooks the street below
there is nobody there
we can see fred standing at the picture window looking out
fred is dressed to go out black sport coat and slacks buttoned up white shirt
he picks up a music case
a woman comes into the room
this is freds wife renee years old dark hair dressed smartly a drink in her hand
you dont mind that im not coming tonight
what are you going to do
i thought id stay home and read
fred looks her over shes sexy without trying
read what renee
renee sits down on a couch and sips her drink
fred comes over to her kisses her on the neck which makes her laugh
its nice to know i can still make you laugh
i like to laugh fred
thats why i married you
wake me up when you get home
fred brushes her cheek with his fingers allowing them to linger for a moment on her face
a blue neon sign reads luna lounge
fred is on the bandstand
he takes a solo on his saxophone
fred plays hot hard neo bop
the band wails madly behind him
the patrons explode onto the dance floor making it a wild scene
fred is a lion now roaring away on his tenor driving everyone nuts
after the band quits to take a break female fans come onto fred but he moves away refusing their attentions
fred dials a pay phone
the madison house night we move through the empty living room empty bedroom etc
the ringing telephone goes unanswered
lose up n fpeds face as he listens to the ringing
sweat is still rolling off his face
his eyes are blank
freds car pulls up in the driveway in front of his house
fred gets out and goes into the house carrying his music case
fred puts down his music case goes to the bedroom and sees renee sleeping soundly
renee in a bathrobe opens the front door to collect the mail
she sees a plain clean manila envelope lying on the step
she picks it up
close up on the envelope no stamp no writing blank
she takes the mail from the box and goes back into the house
renee opens the manila envelope
shes noticeably nervous when she sees a videotape inside
she stares at it
fred enters also wearing a bathrobe
he sees renee staring at the videotape before she hears him enter
when she does hear him her eyes jerk away from the tape
whos it from
i dont know
theres no return address on the envelope
in fact theres no address on it
does it say anything on the tape
looking it over no nothing
fred walks over and picks up the tape
well lets see whats on it
fred takes the tape to the vcr
he inserts it into the machine and turns it on
fred goes toward the couch
to renee come on
they sit on the couch in front of the television
the tv monitor we begin on the tv then the videotape fills the entire frame
the videotape shows the front of the madison house the camera panning slowly over it
the picture is accompanied by an eerie droning sound
after the camera pans back to the front door the tape image turns to snow
fred and renee stare at the snow for a few moments
renee looks relieved
it must be from a real estate agent
we see a wide shot encompassing fred renee and the snowy image on the tv
renee is seated at the dining room table coffee cup and grapefruit in front of her
she is wearing glasses reading a book
fred enters and sees renee who does not look up or acknowledge him
fred goes into the kitchen which is just off the dining room
he comes back into the dining room with a cup of coffee and sits down with it opposite renee
he lights up a cigarette sips his coffee and looks at her
good book huh
she looks up huh
oh yeah it is
same one you were reading the other night
when you didnt come to the club
this is a different one
i called you know
from the club
you didnt answer
i must have fallen asleep
i was asleep when you got home wasnt i
you were asleep when i got home yes
renee goes back to her book
fred sips his coffee and smokes
without looking up i told you you could wake me up if you wanted to
renee looks up at him now takes off her glasses and stares at him
close up of freds face a disturbed expression
renee seems about to say something more but stops puts her glasses back on and resumes reading
fred is in bed waiting for renee
he hears noises from the bathroom bottles clinking drawers opening and closing
renee comes out wearing a robe which she sheds just before getting into bed
naked under the covers she switches out her bedside lamp
the only light in the room comes from the outside through the windows
fred moves closer to renee puts his lips to her cheek a hand on her breast
she does not respond
fred pulls renee to him and kisses her passionately
renee accedes to his demands but does not participate willingly
he makes love to her voraciously but her lack of passion disturbs him
fred cant stop however and when he comes she acts consolingly stroking him maternally while he calms down
he climbs off of her and retreats to his side of the bed
close up on freds eyes which express his horror and humiliation
they lie there in the dark silence for a while
fred turns back toward renee in the darkness
i had a dream about you last night
you were in the house
calling my name
but i couldnt find you
fred is walking slowly across the living room
freds pov moving searching
fred stops and listens
tentatively distant and off screen fred
fred where are you
the camera turns slowly back toward the hallway and as it drifts it rises up following along the hall and turning slowly into the bedroom
renee is lying below in the bed
then there you were
lying in bed
but it wasnt you
it looked like you
but it wasnt
the camera suddenly dives violently at renee into a tight close up
her face registers total fear
fred is lying in bed with renee who is now backlit by her bedside lamp
fred looks at her shadowed face but its not renees face
its a face fred has never seen before
fred quickly turns and switches on his bedside lamp and looks quickly back at renee whose face is now her own
fred are you all right
fred reaches out a hand and tenderly touches her face
renee covers his hand with her own and closes her eyes
renee finds another envelope on the doorstep
she opens it pulls out a videotape
a large dog is barking incessantly somewhere in the neighborhood
renee looks around to see if she can see the dog
renee brings the videotape upstairs with the rest of the mail
she is a bit puzzled and unsettled
she puts the tape down on a table
she stares at it
fred comes in
youre up early
that dog woke me
i lay there for a while then decided to get up
who the hell owns that dog
fred notices the tape and manila envelope on the table
yes i just found it on the step
fred picks it up
dont you want to watch it
i guess so
fred goes to the vcr and inserts the tape
he turns the television on
he is about to start the tape he looks up for renee
shes hanging back
well do you wanna watch it
again renee seems to be nervous about what could be on the tape but she hides this from fred and walks toward the couch
renee sits on the couch
fred starts the vcr and joins her
as before we first see it on the tv then the videotape fills the frame
this tape shows the front of the house as before then shows the interior of fred and renees house the eerie droning sound goes throughout
the camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into their bedroom where we see fred and renee
the tape image then goes to snow
fred and renee stare at the snowy tv picture
after a few moments of silence renee gets up and switches off the set
she is visibly shaken trembling
she stares fearfully at fred who seems less disturbed
weve got to call the police
renee is on the telephone
fred is pacing smoking behind her
yes ive been on hold for ten minutes
all right thanks
renee looks around anxiously
fred gives her his cigarette which she puffs on
he lights another and continues pacing
my name is renee madison
my husband is fred madison the jazz musician
we live at hollis street
near the observatory
someones been in the house
while we were sleeping
i know because they sent dropped off a videotape
to show us
the second one
shows us asleep
someone broke in and taped us while we slept
isnt that enough
yes well be here
renee hangs up
two detectives are coming out
two men in suits the detectives ed and al are seated on the couch watching the last part of the second videotape
the screen goes to snow and stays that way for several moments until fred shuts it off
lets have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom
all four of them go to the hallway where ed and al look around especially up toward the ceiling
the high angle shot on the tape
howd the camera get so high like that
almost no movement back and forth i mean
like youd get if it was hand held
this just glided along
the detectives enter the bedroom
fred and renee follow
this is the bedroom
the detectives look around without touching anything
do you always sleep here
in this room
both of you
this is our bedroom
theres no other bedroom
there is i mean i use it as a practice room
youre a musician
yes i thought my wife
whats your axe
shakes his head tone deaf
to renee do you own a video camera
fred hates them
the detectives both look at fred
i like to remember things my own way
what do you mean by that
how i remember them
not necessarily the way they happened
do you have an alarm system
yes actually we do
but we havent been using it
it kept going off for some reason
might be a good time to try using it again
anybody else have a key to the house
no one of us is always here to let the maid in
nobody else has a key
to al lets check the doors and windows
see if theres been a break in
they all leave the bedroom
ed is checking the door for marks
freds pov hes watching ed and al with renee who are outside the house walking around the property checking it out
ed and al are standing by an unmarked police car with fred and renee
the detectives are about to depart
well keep a watch on the house
as best we can
if anything else happens youll call us
al hands fred a card
ed hands renee a card
its what we do
ed and al get into the car and drive off
renee and fred look at each other warily then go back into the house
the fred is on the bandstand sweating and honking his saxophone
he handles the horn roughly braying like a beast as the crowd gathered in front of the stage gyrates as one swept away in the madness of the moment
at the back near the side door renee can be seen with two men only one of whose faces we see
the trio are going out the side door led by one of the men we see only the back of his head
renee glances briefly at the bandstand before she exits with the two men
close up of fred as he plays seemingly oblivious to his surroundings
his eyes open and shut as he clamps down on the horn
in the back of the club the side door slowly closes
fred is standing in the living room looking in the direction of the stairwell
we hear someones steps coming up the stairs
its renee who eventually comes into view
she is holding another manila envelope
she arrives at the top step
she and fred lock eyes
fred takes the envelope opens it and pulls out a third videotape
without saying anything fred takes the tape to the vcr
he inserts it very carefully slowly
he hits play turns on the television and he and renee sit down on the couch together and begin to watch with great apprehension
again we begin with a wide shot and then the tv monitor fills the screen we see the interior of the house at night
the camera glides looking down from a high angle along the hallway and into the bedroom where fred and renee are sleeping
again the droning sound plays throughout
in the bedroom where fred and renee are seen sleeping suddenly fred on the tape slowly awakens as the camera holds on him
he rises and turns unnaturally in the bed as if drawn up by his awareness of some strange presence in the room
he comes to a sitting position his head straining upwards looking in the direction of the camera
at this point the videotape image turns to snow
fred and renee are on the couch
the tv remains on showing snow
renee is very upset crying
what the hell is going on
equally horrified frightened i wish i knew
fred reaches over and tentatively takes renees hand in his
she trembles allows him to touch her but otherwise does not respond
suddenly she jumps with fright
what was that
on the tape
there was something else on the tape
fred gets up and rewinds it passing an image
fred runs the tape forward
we see snow then a half second long medium shot of fred on his knees near the bedroom wall on renees side of the bed
he is looking directly at the camera his face a ghastly grimace contorted
his eyes are wide with horror
fred runs it back again and freezes the tape there on his tormented image
this image fills the screen
he and renee stare at it
the detectives with fred and renee are seated on chairs and the couch
the three videotapes in their manila envelopes are stacked on a coffee table in the center
you dont remember being awakened
it looks like you were aware of someone
no i dont remember anything
it looks like i
i dont remember
why would anyone do something like this
has anyone made any threats to either of you recently
or not so recently
no not to me
al ed and fred all look at renee
well take the tapes with us if thats all right with you
ed looks at fred then renee both of whom nod their agreement
well see that the patrol of the house is doubled
i dont know if i want to stay here
i dont feel safe
where would you feel safe
i dont know
maybe a hotel
ed and al are watching this exchange between fred and renee with keen interest
there is a strained silence between them
did you use the alarm system since we were here last
the first night
not the last two
shrugs i forgot
anyway i hate the idea of acting paranoid
someone is in our house while were sleeping filming us and you dont want to act paranoid
i thought you set the alarm
fred gets up lights a cigarette paces
ill make sure the alarm is set from now on
but that doesnt solve the problem
who is doing this
ed and al rise from their chairs
ed picks up the envelopes
well find out mrs
renee stands with the detectives
fred stands apart his expression pained and bewildered
a swinging party is in progress at andys house the man whose face we saw at the luna lounge with renee
andy years old a slick guy is seen moving through the crowd making small talk kissing and being kissed
the people here are wannabe players the men mostly shady gold chain wearing slightly unsavory types the women dressed provocatively big hair and skin tight dresses
through sliding glass doors we see nude and semi nude people cavorting in a swimming pool
everyone has a drink in his or her hand
renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty glass to fred who walks away with it
andy grabs renee and dances with her
they laugh and talk
renee appears to be a bit intoxicated
fred who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on makes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks
when the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely then sets the empty glass down on the bar
then he swallows the other drink too and sets down the glass
a mystery man tall well dressed and groomed older than fred approaches him
weve met before havent we
i dont think so
where was it that you think weve met
at your house
dont you remember
surprised no no i dont
are you sure
in fact im there right now
incredulous what do you mean
youre where right now
at your house
the mystery man reaches into his coat pocket takes out a cellular phone and holds it out to fred
fred snickers like this is a bad joke
the mystery man puts the phone into freds hand
dial your number
fred hesitates puzzled
fred shrugs laughs dials his number
we hear a pick up as we stay on freds face
i told you i was here
fred still holding the phone stares at the man standing in front of him
how did you do that
the mystery man points to the phone
fred mirthful at first as if it is a party trick of some kind suddenly turns serious its obvious hes thinking now of the videotapes
he speaks into the phone
angrily how did you get into my house
you invited me
its not my habit to go where im not wanted
fred looks at the man in front of him but speaks again into the phone
who are you
the man laughs identical laughs both over the phone and in person
give me my phone back
the man in front of fred reaches out his hand for the phone
fred hears the line go dead and he slowly passes the phone back to the mystery man who takes it folds it and puts it in his pocket
its been a pleasure talking to you
the man walks away from fred
renee appears and comes up to fred
i thought you were getting me a drink
just a minute
he takes renee by the arm and goes over to the host of the party andy
he grabs andy and points across the room toward the mystery man who is engaged in conversation with other andy who is that guy
looking at the mystery man i dont know his name
hes a friend of dick laurents i think
yes i believe so
remembering something but dick laurent is dead isnt he
i didnt think you knew dick
how do you know hes dead
andy and renee exchange a worried look which fred does not notice
i dont know him
angrily dick cant be dead
who told you he was dead
fred takes renee by the arm away from andy
lets go home
were leaving now
i didnt want to come here in the first place
fred drags the reluctant renee out of andys house
fred is driving fast and recklessly
renee is drunk and is smiling at him
howd you meet that asshole andy anyway
renee stares out the front window thinks back
it was a long time ago
i met him at this place called mokes
he told me about a job
i dont remember
anyway andys okay
hes got some fucked up friends
fred and renees car pulls up in front of their house
fred jumps out of the car
stay in the car
fred enters the house careful to turn off the alarm first
there are only a couple of dim lights on the house is mostly dark
fred moves slowly and carefully through his house searching each room for a possible intruder
freds pov moving creepily room by room through the dark house past the telephone down the hall to the bedroom
there is no one there
he goes back outside for renee
renee is standing next to the car shivering
i told you to stay in the car
what is it
why did you make me wait out here
i thought there might be somebody inside
of course not
they enter the house
fred switches on more lights
its so odd
waiting out there i had the strangest feeling
like this had happened before
i mean your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that
fred looks at renee then continues to look around the house disturbed seriously disquieted
renee still tipsy follows him moving from room to room
fred and renee are preparing to go to bed
renee goes into the bathroom off the bedroom
fred takes another look out into the hallway
fred walks down the hallway
fred looks around the dark living room
then absentmindedly he begins to inspect objects
he picks up an ashtray and studies it lost in thought
renee is washing her face standing at the sink in her slip
fred is staring at himself in a mirror
renee comes in
fred is not there
she goes to the door and peeks down the hallway
fred where are you
no one is in the living room now but a shadow moves slowly across a wall
renees pov down the hallway
there is just darkness at the end of the hall
it is eerie
after a moment fred slowly walks out of the darkness toward renee
he walks out of the shot and the camera remains on the rectangle of darkness at the end of the hall
footsteps can be heard on the stairs
freds head appears at the top of the stairway
he comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope like the ones previously received
his expression is strained
he is alone
fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the vcr turns it on
he sits on the couch and watches
we go from a wide shot to a full frame shot of the video
on the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house accompanied by the droning sound
the camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom sliding at a high angle
the camera turns slowly into the bedroom looking down
blood is splattered over the floor bed walls
the camera drifts
the dead body of renee lies on the floor at the foot of the bed
she is badly mutilated
fred is hovering over her on the tape on his knees a horrified unbelieving expression on his face
on the tape fred turns away from renee his hands raised dripping blood her blood
his movements are almost mechanical constricted as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will as if feeling some enormous pressure
he looks directly at the camera his face a ghastly grimace contorted just before the taped image goes to snow
fred sitting in front of the tv shudders as the tape ends
he sits trembling attempts to speak almost chokes and finally releases a tortured warbly cry
fred looks up as if seeing something he starts to stand staggering partially paralyzed
shouting freds pov a big fist slams into freds face knocking him back in a chair
ed and al are standing in front of fred
stay put killer
the detectives pov freds face is a bloody mask
he is crying whimpering
i didnt kill her
tell me i didnt kill her
fred his lips and eyes swollen sits on a cot dressed in jail clothes
he studies his hands which appear crippled
he flexes the fingers slowly painfully
we are in back of the house tracking slowly past the bedroom and living room windows
inside the house investigators and forensic experts are moving around measuring scraping samples of carpet searching for fingerprints on furniture
renees corpse on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an attendant
the entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall
the attendant prepares for the impending autopsy laying out a rack of instruments positioning the corpse
as he is doing these things the medical examiner enters accompanied by his girlfriend
is dressed formally in a tuxedo
the young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap pearls spike heels
the couple are close she has an arm through his and she laughs nervously
he is smoking a cigarette
workin late tonight huh
party at the mayors house george
this is his daughter joyce
the attendant uncovers the body individual parts are wrapped like packages from a butchers shop and labeled l
arm head r
looking at the packages just like christmas
he begins to unwrap them
i dont know if i can watch this
tosses his cigarette down on the floor
the camera goes down on the smoking cigarette butt on the floor drain smoldering there among hair and flesh gristle on the drains filter screen
voice over leave any time you want lover
i wont take it personally
the camera stays on the drain as we hear the m
unwrapping the packaged body parts
joyces high heels enter the frame around the drain
she is stepping nervously like a spooked horse
the clatter of her heels is very loud
we hear the m
voice over easy girl easy
you talking to me or
laughs a corpse can tell you plenty joyce
the camera is behind a female foreman in the jury box
the shot begins on her shoes and travels up her body as she stands
over her left shoulder we see fred standing at the defense table
over her right shoulder the judge is seated
have you reached a verdict
yes we have your honor
please hand it to the bailiff
the bailiff goes to the foreman takes the paper from her then takes it to the judge
the judge opens it and reads it to himself then hands it back to the bailiff who returns it to the foreman
and what is your verdict
the camera moves to fred registering his tension
the camera goes to the foremans face
we the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree
fe is lifted up by his attorney and guards in attendance
fred revives slightly
fred madison the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree it is my order that on a date to be determined you be put to death
in the electric chair
we see freds eyes roll open as he cranes his neck around and upwards looking at the video camera high on the wall of the courtroom pointing down on him
marian and raquel two exquisite young women are looking over the merchandise
did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces
how could i miss it
the tv wont quit with that stuff
theyre gonna cook him
andys from utah
he says there you have a choice
you can die by hanging or by firing squad
which would you choose
marian holds up a black teddy to her body
andy would go for this dont you think
firing squad definitely
do they aim for the head or for the heart
the heart i guess
the brain would know whats going on
your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood blood pouring into the chest cavity
savage pain marian
raquel takes a red teddy and holds it up to her chest
oh thats hot
so youd rather be hung huh
they both giggle at the obvious joke
soon as your neck snaps you black out
it might take a while for the body to die but you wouldnt feel it
marian reaches for a pair of panties with a hole in the crotch
you might be right raquel
marian sticks a finger through the hole in the panties and wiggles it
the girls giggle
raquel sees andy walking into the store
he is sneaking up behind marian and motions with a finger to his lips to raquel not to say anything
when andy gets directly behind marian he puts his hands over her eyes
fred in the custody of guards wearing handcuffs and leg irons is being escorted to his cell
he appears zombie like as the guards open the cell door unlock and remove his shackles and lock him in
make yourself to home fella
the guards leave
fred stands near the cell door begins to look around at the four walls the single cot the wash basin and the toilet bowl without a seat
he hears the muffled distorted noises voices from the surrounding cells
lost voices the voices of death row
fred realizes where he is now
he walks over to the cot and slowly sinks down and sits on the edge
fred perched on the cot in his cell resembles a man adrift on a tiny raft in the middle of an ocean
a trustee is pushing a meal cart along the row
at each door the trustee stops and takes a tray off the cart
he shoves the meal tray through a slot in the door
we watch him distribute the trays down the long row of cells
the hallway is quiet distant sounds reverberate
fred sits on the edge of his bed a tray of prison food sits on the floor uneaten
fred lies awake on his cot he stares at the ceiling
the hallway is quiet distant sounds reverberate
this is a small narrow yard not the large exercise yard for population
this yard is for use by death row prisoners only to exercise in one hour each day by himself
fred is released into the area which is more like a dog run
the guards watch fred as he walks slowly up and down the exercise yard
there is more activity on the row tonight than usual
a couple of men in suits walk through with an air of authority
there is a building murmur among the prisoners
fred sits on the edge of his bed listening as sound of the prisoners builds
two guards are standing at the guard station
very quietly solemnly here he comes
several of the men in suits along with several guards and a clergyman a prisoner in the middle of the group enter the hallway
they proceed past the guard station down the hall
as the procession files by death row inmates come to their doors and talk to the prisoner
see you soon sammy
dont think takin a jolt is gonna get you outta payin me back the twenty you owe me
dont take it personal pal
un fuerte abrazo amigo
as the men march down the hallway they pass freds cell
his window panel is empty
the camera stops on freds cell door as we hear other prisoners talking to the inmate on his way to the electric chair
hang in there honey
keep an eye out for me sammy g
fred sits on his bed listening fearfully
the camera stays on fred as we hear show em you got big stones bro
the prisoner is strapped into the electric chair
behind a glass partition witnesses are seated
one of the men in suits the warden goes to a telephone on the wall and stands with his hand on the receiver
he picks it up
into phone line check
the warden hangs up the telephone and stays next to it
we see one of the condemned mans wrists being clamped with an electrical device
the other wrist is clamped
a metal halo is placed around the condemned mans head
a large electrical cable leads off from the halo
electrically conductive ointment is smeared around the areas where the clamps have been placed
the clergyman moves close to the condemned man continuing to give the man his last rites
when he is finished he nods to the warden
the warden approaches the condemned man
any final words sam
the condemned man shakes his head no
the warden and the others clear the room and the doors are locked
the executioner steps into place near a huge lever
he looks to the warden
the witnesses sit in silent anticipation
the hands of the clock on the wall have moved past midnight
the warden takes one last look through a window at the condemned man then nods to the executioner
fred sits frozen at the edge on his bed
a distant but loud electrical hum begins
freds head jerks upward to the light on his ceiling
it has dimmed to almost nothing
fred sits in the humming darkness
the guards release fred into the yard for his exercise
at first the sunlight is blinding and fred covers his eyes
he moves along the wall tentative his fingers feeling the way
fnally he slumps down on his haunches back leaned against the wall eyes closed letting the sun hit his face
very soon however the sun passes behind a cloud and fred is bathed in shade
fred stands up but is almost immediately hit by a searing pain in his head
fred holds his head with his hands sinks down to his knees
the guard who has been observing fred from the doorway comes over to him
too much sun i guess
you want to come in
still got forty five minutes outside if you want it
i want to go in
the guard assists fred back inside the building
fred is on his cot holding his head
he is obviously in pain
he gets up and staggers to the cell door
fred pushes a call button next to the door to summon a guard
the guard comes and speaks to fred through a double mesh opening
whats botbering you madison
the pain is getting worse
i need more aspirin
i cant give you anymore
ill talk to the doctor
the guard leaves
fred collapses to the floor of the cell writhing in pain
fred is brought in wearing handcuffs and leg irons a guard on either arm
he is placed on a chair in the middle of the room
the guards stand one on each side of him
a doctor enters
he is in late middle age with serious eyebrows
freds head is hanging down chin on chest
the doctor lifts freds head and we see dark circles under freds eyes his face is pale teeth clenched eyes tearing
the doctor takes a light utensil from his pocket and inspects each of freds eyes
he feels freds forehead
after this he allows freds head to drop down again
the doctor takes freds pulse
he drops freds wrist
he next takes freds blood pressure
you sleeping okay
strained whisper i cant sleep
the doctor goes over to a cabinet unlocks a drawer and removes a large blue pill
he fills a paper cup with water from a dispenser goes back to fred and places the pill in freds mouth
the doctor tilts freds head up and pours the water down his throat some of it dribbling down the front of freds shirt
the doctor looks into freds mouth to make sure he swallowed the pill
youll sleep now
to guards take him back to his cell
the guards lift fred by his arms and shuffle march him out of the infirmary
fred awakens on his cot
he turns and sits up in the darkness
a stream of light through the slot window illumines freds head the forehead of which is swollen and discolored
he staggers up and shuffles over to the call button which he leans on
a few moments later a guard appears on the other side of the mesh
what is it
i gotta have more aspirin
the doctor said not to give you anything
you can see him in the morning
but my head
the guard looks at fred through the window and what he sees disturbs him
the guard makes a strange face
the guard walks away from freds door to the guard station where another guard is sitting at a table reading a magazine
shit that wife killers lookin pretty fucked up
not looking up from his magazine which one
they both laugh
fred is on the floor lying on back
the camera comes slowly down at him from the ceiling like a weight pressing on his head
freds pain is demonstrably overwhelming him now
he moans and rolls from side to side in the dimness making grotesque otherworldly sounds
as the camera moves into a close up the last image of freds head shows the discolored swelling has increased
fred looks up sensing something
there is a for sale sign posted in front
the camera pans slowly as in the videotape across the front of the house
the interior of the house is dark but fleetingly we are aware of movement shadows inside
marian and raquel are in the living room attired in the undergarments they purchased at the lingerie store
hot music is blaring from a stereo
marian and raquel are dancing as sexy and wild as it is possible for them to be
andy is lying on his back on the rug dressed only in undershorts and socks the girls stomping feet stepping furiously around his head and body
his eyes are closed at first but when he opens them he sees their feet in a blur
he tries to get up but he is too strung out and he collapses again
marian and raquel take him by his hands and feet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance
andy is blitzed smiling moronically
the girls breasts tumble out of their teddies
raquel drops her end of andy turns up the music even louder and dances into a frenzy
marian drops to her knees andys feet on either side of her shaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around
andy makes another attempt to sit up he looks at marian reaches for her but falls back dead to the world
raquel and marian dont quit
fred is still curled on the floor but spasms begin to rock his body
he goes into convulsions blood gushes from his nostrils
his head is badly swollen
fred vomits repeatedly and drags around in his mess
fred turns straining upwards as weve seen him do before
his face and head are hideously deformed
fred brings his shaking tortured hand to his forehead
he pulls his hand down across his face squeezing it as it goes
as his hand passes over his face freds features are removed leaving a blank white mass with eye sockets
we move into the eye sockets and beyond
we see a clean moving pov illuminated by headlights
we are floating down an old two lane highway through a desolate desert landscape
this gliding eerie pov continues until the headlights illuminate a figure standing at the side of the road
this figure is a man pete dayton
pete turns unsettled as he looks directly at us as we move closer to him
the ghost image of a house appears behind pete
there is a girl sheila standing on the lawn in front of the house
she is afraid and is trying to communicate with pete
pete doesnt seem to hear her and continues to stare directly at us
now pete seems to move toward us as we move toward him
his head fills the screen
freds blank face begins to contort and take on the appearance feature by feature of pete dayton
fred madison is becoming pete dayton
we watch the sun rise outside the prison ascending over the strands of barbed wire above the wall
a guard is making his early morning rounds
he stops at each cell and looks in making a mark with a pencil on a piece of paper on a clipboard
when he comes to freds cell he is about to make a check mark but looks in again and appears confused
the man inside is not fred
who are you
what are you doing in this cell
the man in the cell sits still on the cot staring straight ahead
the man is thin younger than fred
the guard hurries over to the guard station
he picks up the telephone and dials
he begins to sweat
this is johnny mack at station
yeah look somethin crazys happened
no i mean madison aint in his cell
no theres somebody in there but it aint madison
captain hendersons comin
johnny mack hangs up
he walks back down the row and looks in again at freds cell
f u u u ck me

youll have to see for yourself
together they walk quickly to freds cell and look in
thats not fred madison
no sir its not

i couldnt say sir

captain henderson is standing in front of a desk behind which the warden is seated
a nameplate on the desk reads repeat that bill
warden its not him

of course its madison
who else could it be
i dont know
the guards say theyve never seen him before
where is he now
hes in the infirmary being examined
did you ask him who he is
he cant talk
it appears as if he cant talk anyway
if hes not madison then wheres madison
ive got men searching the building and the grounds now
the warden stands up and comes around the desk
i want to take a look at this man myself
the man from freds cell is just finishing being fingerprinted
the doctor with serious eyebrows dr
rogoff is inspecting the mans face
the warden enters with captain henderson
guards are standing by the door and at strategic spots in the room
what is this rogoff
i dont know yet
rogoff begins to draw blood from the mans arm
he takes several vials
the man watches the blood coming out of his arm but doesnt seem to understand where he is or what is happening to him
who is this man
hes just been fingerprinted and ill run these blood tests right away
well find out soon enough
rogoff opens the mans mouth and peers in with a pencil light
hes not madison
slowly deliberately not even close
rogoff stands up puts the light in his breast pocket
i examined madison last night marshall
he had a headache
i did a routine once over and gave him a sleeping pill
ive never seen this man before
neither have the guards
i dont think hes in the system
the warden moves closer to the man he looks closely at him
where the hell did you come from mister
close up of the man hes staring straight up
present are the warden captain henderson and two other prison officials
the warden is looking at a computer next to his desk
well gentlemen we know who the stranger is
his name is peter raymond dayton
hes twenty four years old
his birthday is april st
he was born and raised right here
he lives with his parents william and claire dayton at garland avenue
pete dayton was arrested five warden contd years ago for auto theft for which he was put on probation for one year
that was his first and only offense
no record since then
warden clements looks up takes a deep breath and stares at the men in front of him
how about madison
have we had even a hint of his whereabouts
theres an apb out on him
his photos been faxed nationwide
i had a call from the governors office about this
how the hell does she know
theres press outside right now
how the hell
one of the guards must have leaked it
whats the word on the street
only that madison has apparently escaped
nothing about the other guy
good lets keep it that way
keep a lid on dayton
nothing gets out about him
johnny mack walks down the row and enters freds cell
johnny mack looks around up and down the walls half peers under the cot then checking first to see no other guard is watching him he looks inside the toilet
bowl then gets down on his knees and really looks under the cot
he gets up and sits down on the bed
he rubs a hand over his face
johnny mack is clearly perplexed
a press conference is being held
present are reporters tv cameras et al
the warden and captain henderson represent the prison
i have a statement to read
fred madison an inmate being held on death row has apparently
an all points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide but nationwide
we are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon
no further details are available at this time
thank you very much
warden nobodys ever escaped from death row before
how did he get out
the warden and captain henderson leave the room without answering
petes parents bill and claire dayton escorted by a prison guard are approaching the wardens office
it is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office
the daytons are a middle aged san fernando valley couple
bill dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short sleeves rolled up
his skin is leathery tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck tail
hes working class ex biker
claire dayton was obviously a good looking chick whos gone to seed from too much sun cigarettes and booze
she retains the remnants of a good figure but its going fast
claire is wearing sunglasses
the daytons are ushered in by the guard
the warden is standing behind his desk
rogoff is standing to one side and next to him is captain henderson
the daytons stand just inside the room for a moment before the warden extends his right hand
im warden clements
this is captain henderson and dr
please sit down
bill and claire move to the chairs in front of the desk and sit down
the warden dr
rogoff and captain henderson all sit down
dayton as you were told over the phone your son peter is here
claire dayton removes her sunglasses
she and bill wait the warden is searching for words
he was discovered this morning
in a cell on death row
bill and claire look at each other bewildered
a cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named fred madison
the wife killer
how is this possible warden
the warden shakes his head
tell me what was peters condition the last time you saw him
bill and claire look at each other again briefly
what do you mean
his physical condition
hesitates same as always
pete takes care of himself
bill and claire look at each other once again
i saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday
hes a mechanic
look is he okay
can we see him
the warden looks at dr
he has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis
thats redness and swelling around the eyes
was he in a fight
these conditions dont indicate a fight
but what is the cause then
and how did he get in that cell
he cant talk
that doesnt sound like pete
your son has experienced some sort of trauma im afraid
we were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here
you dont know fred madison
only what was in the news
do you think pete knows him
i wouldnt know how
to claire you say you havent seen your son since the day before yesterday
when he went to work right
what about yesterday
he didnt come home
sometimes he stays at a friends
any particular friends
a girls a buddys
i dont know
hes his own man he comes and goes as he pleases
i want to see him
yes and we need to talk to him
if we can
rogoff mel lets get peter in here
rogoff leaves the room
while hes gone nobody talks increasing the tension
rogoff returns with pete dayton dressed in his own clothes jeans boots sport shirt
petes forehead is lumpy and his eyes are red and swollen
he can walk but unsteadily
pete looks around the room sees his parents
claire jumps up
she and dr
rogoff help get pete settled in a chair
bill is taken aback at the sight of his son but says nothing
pete can you tell us now anything about this
pete what happened to you
pete has a dazed look on his face
he starts to speak then stops
take your time honey
petes gaze drifts from his mothers face around the room and back to her face
afraid quiet where
the warden and captain henderson look to dr
youre in the state penitentiary
you were found in a cell on death row
my head hurts
pete rubs his head like its about to explode with pain
a man named fred madison was occupying that cell
were trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him
i dont know
do you know fred madison
there is a silence in the room as pete massages his throbbing temples
worried warden can we take him home
the warden looks at dr
to warden from a medical standpoint i dont see why not
we need to find out what happened here
standing up have you made any charges against him
then hes coming home with his mother and me
but you see our predicament
legally we cant hold him but he may be able to help us
for now hes free to leave
bill and claire help pete up and carefully escort him out of the wardens office
with a nod from the warden the guard accompanies them out of the room
the warden captain henderson and dr
rogoff stand but remain in the office
to warden you just gonna let him go
well get a tail put on him
bill claire and pete pull into the driveway of a bleached out s ranch style house on a street lined with many more of the same
bill and claire get out of the car first then help pete out and up into the house
bill and claire take pete to his room which has a bed desk two chairs and a sea of disassembled motorcycle parts belonging to a classic indian motorbike which pete
each part is shiny and clean
pete sits down on his bed and looks up at his parents shaking his head with confusion and embarrassment
just rest easy pete
youre gonna be okay
are you hungry honey
ill fix you something
i dont feel so good
i would like some aspirin
in the living room bill is drinking a beer and watching television
in the kitchen claire is finishing the dishes
she goes into the living room and leans down and whispers something in bills ear
bill nods and claire walks quietly down the hallway and opens petes door
she looks in on him sleeping
an unmarked police car pulls up across the street from the dayton house
in the front seat are the detectives ed and al
al who is on the passenger side is holding two styrofoam cups filled with coffee
ed removes from his inside jacket pocket a x photo of pete dayton which he props up on the dashboard so that it is visible for both himself and al
al hands one of the cups to ed
al studies pete daytons face in the photo
now well see what this son of a bitch is up to
ed and al sip their coffee and stare at the house
pete dayton is lying on a chaise lounge
his forehead is still swollen but his eyes are less red
he stares up into the sky a hot breeze blows over him
the camera moves slowly through the interior of the empty house cast with shadows
the refrigerator running is the only sound
pete slowly moves up to a sitting position then stands
he stretches and walks around the yard feeling the dry unwatered lawn on his bare feet
he walks over and leans over the neighbors fence
his eyes fall on a plastic toy boat floating in b childs plastic swimming pool
he watches the boat as the warm breeze blows it lazily in a circle
a small plane drones overhead
in the distance a woman finishes hanging out some wash and goes in the back door of her house
the slamming of her screen door sounds a thousand miles away
pete continues to observe these seemingly peaceful surroundings but something doesnt feel right to him
pete is eating a sandwich he is looking much better
claire opens a bag of chips and sets them in front of pete as bill comes in the front door
im in the kitchen
bill comes in and pops a beer looks around
out in back
you talk to him
here he comes
their gazes follow a path from the backyard into where pete has been sitting all the time
howre you feelin
pete looks at his parents he cant figure out what has just happened
unsure brow furrowed better
arnie called this morning while you were sleepin
they miss you pretty bad down at the garage
i told im you still had a fever
nice to know they cant seem to get along without ya
you really dont remember the other night do you
what night is that
the night before you showed up in the slammer
do you remember
bill and claire just stare at him
pete shakes his head and takes another bite of his sandwich but inside the worrisome feeling returns
pete is stretched out on his bed watching television
he hears the front door bell ring footsteps and a moment or two later the door to his bedroom opens and three of his friends carl lanie and steve v
where the fuck have you been
pete pulls himself up to a sitting position
you look like shit

hey lanie i heard you were out of it for a while too

winking hadnt slowed her down none
smacking him shut up bone head
then lanie laughs good naturedly

pete hauls himself up off the bed and throws on a black leather jacket
the four of them go through the living room where bill and claire are drinking and watching tv
to bill and claire goin out with these clowns for a while
do ya good
after pete leaves with his friends bill and claire look at each other
v drives a black beat up grand prix
carl and lanie are in the back seat and pete rides shotgun
the four of them
are cruising down van nuys boulevard along with many other muscle cars and low riders filled with kids looking for action
vs car is making a hell of a noise
i hate ridin in this fuckin car

look at that goin my way
v has seen a couple
of girls in short tight dresses walking up the boulevard
oh my oh my

v guns his car and it lurches roughly forward
the sound of the rough running engine reverberates in petes brain
this rod is a fuckin embarrassment carl
whatiya burn in this thing v
whats wrong with that

this is the boulevard
you cant hear yourself think
pete shakes his bead with disgust
v pulls the car off the boulevard into tops drive in
cars are lined up at the to go window and all along the side of the building where people are hanging out under a long metal awning
music is playing loud
v pulls into a parking spot by the awning
the headlights illuminate a group of hipsters some dancing some just hanging out
three or four girls hanging out together turn toward vs car
they see pete in the front seat and one of the girls sheila smiles and walks toward him
where have you been
pete talks to her through the open window while v carl and lanie climb out through vs door
v leans back in
to pete you want somethin

v walks off with the others to the take out window
sheila leans in closer to pete

sheila and her girlfriends jump in the car with v carl lanie and pete
v fires up the rough running engine and pulls out leaving behind a cloud of smoke
the bowling alley is divided into a game room area a bar restaurant area and a bowling area
pete and the group stroll into the bar and take a large booth
music is playing loud
a waitress takes orders for drinks
bowling pins clatter loudly in the distance
v takes one of sheilas friends and dances with her
sheila takes pete by the arm and pulls him up to dance
the music is fast but they dance slow
why havent you called me
sheila looks around and moves closer to pete
she whispers urgently worried
whispering whats happening to you

sheila pushes her mouth on petes and they kiss
pete breaks away looks at sheila serious

i dont want to talk about it
i really dont want to talk about it
ed and al sit in their unmarked police car watching the bowling alley entrance and vs car
pete fires up his souped up camaro and listens happily to the engine purring
he eases the big camaro out of the driveway and blasts off down the street
pete cruises into his parking place and cuts the engine
arnie comes rushing toward him sporting a big smile
wonderful to see you pete
how are you
climbing out of the camaro feeling good arnie
ready to get to work
alotta people pete
alotta people are gonna be very happy
arnie takes pete by the arm and they go inside the garage
other mechanics give pete the hi sign and yell their greetings over the din
arnie pulls pete closer and shouts
smith has been waiting for you and mrs
can you take care of mr
eddys called every day
can i call him to come in
bring em on im ready
pete walks over to a ford station wagon and pops the hood
a happy mr
smith comes out of the office to join pete at his car
ed and al pull to a stop down the street from the garage
ed kills the engine and they stare at arnies
pete is leaning down into the engine well of a chevy caprice working hard for mrs
arnies garage is busy
a large black mercedes pullman pulls into the garage
the mercedes pulls to a stop and mr
eddy and two of his assistants climb out
arnie waves to mr
eddy from the office
pete comes up out of the well and turns
when he sees mr
eddy he heads across ihe garage to greet him
eddy opens his arms wide and embraces pete
when he pulls away he sees petes face
somebody givin you trouble

its okay with arnie
come on lets go
ed and al dont notice that pete is in the big black mercedes as it cruises past them
pete is in the passenger seat up front and the two stone faced assistants ride in back
it only happens when im accelerating
i think its the carburetors
eddy pulls out after a light turns green and gives the car a stab forward
no its not the carburetors
pull over but keep it runnin
eddy smiles as he pulls over
best god damn ears in town
to the guys in back you guys are lookin at him
the man with the best god damn ears in town
when the car stops pete gets out pops the hood and disappears down by the engine
eddy sits smiling at pete as he works
pete pops up and gives mr
eddy the thumbs up and gets back into the car
give that a try
eddy carefully pulls out into traffic and accelerates when he gets the chance
beautifull smooth as shit from a ducks ass
lets take a ride
whatever you say mr
eddy hangs a right turn and heads up into the hills
eddy takes the big pullman along the scenic mulholland drive cruising smoothly
a silver gray infiniti is moving up fast behind the mercedes
eddy looks into his rearview mirror
is that what i think it is
pete turns and looks back
a car is tailgating them the silver gray infiniti
the two assistants in the backseat turn nonchalantly to take a look then they return their look to mr
eddy starts to take a slow burn keeps looking at the infiniti in the rearview mirror
the assistants look to one another take a deep breath
eddy slows slightly and then keeps the pullman steady at m
the infiniti moves up ten feet behind the pullman and blows its horn
eddy rolls down his window
the assistants are paying close attention they buckle their seatbelts
pete notices a tension in the car
he watches mr
eddy pulls slightly to the right of the road pastes a polite courteous smile on his face puts his left arm out the window and waves the infiniti by
the infiniti jets forward and swerves around the pullman
when the cars are side by side the irate driver in the infiniti gives mr
eddy the bird and flies past
close on mr
eddys right foot as it slams down on the gas pedal
the pullman catapults forward toward the infiniti
pete is thrown back he grabs on to the door handle and the seat for support
the pullman gains on the infiniti in a flash
the infiniti tries to go faster but mr
eddys pullman has much more power
clenched teeth this is where power and mechanical excellence pays off
eddy jams the pullman into the back of the infiniti and pushes it faster and faster along mulholland
the driver of the infiniti tries to brake and blue gray smoke streams out from beneath the infiniti with a scream of burning rubber
at a turn mr
eddy steers his massive mercedes and the infiniti ahead on a gut wrenching path off the road up a mountain and into a little glade of trees
dust and brush fly everywhere
eddy and his assistants leap from the pullman and make for the drivers side of the infiniti
eddy throws open the infinitis door and pulls the trembling and screaming driver out like a rag doll
eddy pulls out his
ruger blackhawk and pistol whips the driver to the ground
he smashes the butt of his gun across the mans face tearing a gash which starts to gush with blood
eddys assistants each draw
s and point them at the driver
eddy red faced with anger leans close to the man
eddy hits the driver in the side of the head with his gun
scared shitless i
i didnt say anything
tell him you wont tailgate
i wont ever tailgate
hitting the driver once again hard ill get a manual
almost a whisper and study it
kicking the man mr
eddy and his assistants return to the pullman get in and slam their doors
eddy throws the pullman into reverse and pulls back off the hill onto mulholland drive
he eases the car into drive and leaves the crying and beaten tailgater behind
eddy rotates his neck shaking out some adrenaline remnants
pete is visibly shaken by what he has seen
sorry about that pete but tailgating is one thing i cant tolerate
i can see that
ill bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at
eight nine car lengths
a hundred and sixty two feet
fifteen car lengths
about two hundred and seventy feet
to his companions in the reariew whatd i tell ya
eddy smiles and they continue along their way
the pullman pulls off the street into arnies
eddy and his assistants stay in the car
pete opens his door
wait a minute
eddy takes out a couple of one hundred dollar bills and puts them into petes hand
ill be bringin the caddy by tomorrow
eddy reaches into the glove compartment and takes out a videotape
he holds it out to pete
you like pornos
give ya a boner
no thanks mr
eddy tosses the tape back in the glove compartment
suit yourself champ
well ill see ya then
ed and al are staring at the pullman
they see pete get out
they notice the man driving the pullman
you recognize that guy
pete walks out his front door with a lunch box and jumps in the camaro
he fires up the big engine and heads off for work
ed and al follow
pete is on a skate working under a car
the radio is on and a tune comes on that begins to drive pete crazy it gives him a headache
the tune is one of fred madisons be bop saxophone pieces
pete gets out from under the car and goes to the radio
he changes the station
phil another mechanic working nearby looks at pete
whyd you change it
i liked that
well i didnt
pete rubs his throbbing head and when he gets back under the car he lays on the skate unable to work
a car horn honks and the sound reverberates inside the garage
pete looks up from under the car he sees the wheels of a cadillac roll up just outside the open garage doors
he sees a car door open and mr
eddys feet appear and walk in his direction
pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car
he stands as mr
eddy walks up to him then freezes as he sees back behind mr
eddy sitting in the passenger seat of the car a beautiful blonde haired girl who looks exactly like renee
close up beautiful girl she looks exactly like renee except she is about eight years younger
the girl is staring right into petes eyes
eddy steps between pete and the girl blocking her from pete
eddy smiles at pete not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between pete and the girl
im leavin the caddy like i told you
think youll get a chance to give her a once over today
regaining his composure sure
you gonna pick it up later or tomorrow
if you think you can finish it ill be back later today
itll be ready
youre my man pete
mr eddy pinches petes cheek which pete doesnt like but aliows
eddy gives pete a big smile then turns goes back to his car escorts the beautiful girl outside where the pullman is waiting
pete watches her walk and move
he watches her until mr
eddy drives her away
she steals one last glance back at pete before she disappears
when she is gone pete replays the scene of seeing this beautiful girl over again in his mind
the scene is accompanied by lou reeds version of this magic moment
pete is sitting perched unsteadily on the very edge of his bed
he hears a succession of highly amplified sounds at intervals with eerie stretches of silence crickets in fractured cadence a distant television a fly buzzing slowly in the room a
moths wings beating against light bulbs in the ceiling fixture the washing of dishes
petes reaction to these sounds is one of petrified confusion
underlying these sounds is a kind of unearthly steady drone
pete gets up off the bed unsteadily
he moves toward his bedroom door
as he moves the amplified sounds shift
he can hear laughter
the laughter seems to be loud but at the same time coming from people who are trying to contain the laughter to hide it
pete opens his door and peers out
petes pov down the hall toward the living room his mother and father have stopped laughing and are turned with guilty smiles in his direction
they are smoking a joint passing it back and forth
they are not looking directly at him
they seem to be looking but not seeing
petes parents pov down the hall toward petes room
there is no one there just an empty hallway
petes parents continue to stare but then turn away toward each other they start to laugh quietly again
petes pov the hallway and the living room there is no one in the living room
pete turns from the hallway and comes back in his room unsettled and confused
he can hear laughter coming from the living room
ed is behind the wheel
al is in the passenger seat
ed is looking at the dayton house
als head is bent looking down
at first we hear nothing then the sound of als piss streaming into an empty coffee cup
the camera stays on the top of als head until he has completed the last few spurts of his micturition
als head comes up and he opens the passenger side door and dumps the urine into the street
he closes the door and zips up his trousers
pete paces the room
finally he stops himself throws on his black leather jacket and opens his bedroom door
he looks down the hall
no one is in the living room
he walks out of the house
ed and al watch pete get in his camaro and drive off
pete drives through the night up ventura boulevard with the cruisers
he looks in the other cars and looks at the girls on the street
he drives past tops but doesnt see anyone he knows
he turns off the boulevard and drives through san fernando valley neighborhood streets
he pulls up in front of sheilas house and honks his horn
he lights a cigarette while he waits
in a few minutes sheila comes out and leans in the passenger side window
what do you want
you want to go for a drive
i dont know
sheila hesitates for a moment then gets in
pete and sheila drive along dark streets
sheila slides across and sits close to pete
pete puts his arm around her
she takes a drag from his cigarette and puts her head on his shoulder
pete pulls over into a dark shadow under a tree and stops the car
he cuts the engine turns to sheila and kisses her
she breaks away
why dont you like me
i do like you sheila
sheila puts her lips up close to his and whispers
pete kisses her and she kisses him back
they start to feel each other and sheila takes off her tight sweater
shes wearing no bra and pete begins to feel her breasts while she unbuttons his shirt
they continue to kiss hard throughout
ed and al are stopped a half a block behind pete and sheila
theyre watching the couple as they make love in the front seat of petes car
pete and sheila are naked in the front seat
sheila clings to pete as they make love
shes hopelessly in love with him
pete and the other mechanics are working in the garage
the clock on the wall reads p
some of the guys are cleaning up washing their hands putting tools away
pete is ragging off some grease from his hands when he notices a cab pull up to the front of the garage
the beautiful blonde steps out of the cab and comes up to him
petes heart races she smiles at him
im alice wyatt

pete gets out and leaves alice in the car
she waits and watches him go into the office
ed and al are watching pete and alice
they watch pete come out of the office and take alice into one of the motel rooms
fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat
al shakes his head with anger mixed with a lot of envy
pete and alice enter the room
there is a double bed a little desk two bedside tables with lamps a floor lamp and a bathroom
they dont notice any of this
just inside the room alice takes petes hand and they turn to each other
alice puts petes hand between her legs
she moves up close to him and closes her eyes
they kiss tenderly at first then hotter
whispers take off my clothes
pete and alice are naked on the double bed in just the glow of the motels neon lights coming in between the window curtains
theyre up on their knees right next to each other
they look in each others eyes as their hands move and touch
alice smiles with a wild dreamy look in her eyes
pete puts his hand between her legs and alice kisses him with a frenzy
they fall back on the bed
pete and alice make violent love on the bed
alice is hungry
alice and pete are dressed
alice is still breathing hard
she moves up close to pete by the motel room door
her hand is shaking as she touches his cheek
whispers i want more

ed and al watch pete and alice leave the motel room get in the car and drive off
ed starts his car and he and al follow them
pete and alice are riding side by side alices head is on his shoulder
alice looks up at pete as he drives she smiles
the light from headlights behind them catch alices attention
her eyes dart back to a car that could be following them
fear is that car following us
pete glances in the rearview mirror sees the headlights
at the last moment he pulls a hard right and accelerates down the street
the car follows they both see it
ill lose em at the light
alice steals a look back
i dont recognize the car
at a tralfic light pete revs up the big camaro and expertly peels out between on coming cross traffic
he swerves between two cars going in opposite directions blasts up a block and hangs a hard right disappearing from view
ed and al go out into the traffic after them but the swerving screeching cars braking around them form a barrier and trap them
angry drivers lean on their horns
pete and alice have lost them
close up on telephone it starts to ring
voiceover ill get it
pete enters the kitchen where his mother goes for the ringing phone and gets to it before she does
into phone hello
phone voice its me
i cant see you tonight
i have to go somewhere with mr
i think he suspects something
we have to be careful
i miss you
pete is silent
ill call you again
alice hangs up
pete throws the phone back down on the cradle
it bounces off and he has to hang it up again
he slams it down
whats the matter
pete kick starts his big harley and roars angrily out of the driveway
pete rides his cycle fast through neighborhoods
pete rides up the boulevard with the cruisers
he spots vs car parked at tops
he pulls in beside vs car and shuts down the engine
the usual crowd is at the drive in including sheila
pete goes up to v and carl and says hello
he lights a cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the awning above
v and carl both notice that pete is in a bad mood
sheila is over with her girlfriends
she hasnt seen pete arrive
suddenly sheila looks over in petes direction
she looks like shes seeing something yet not seeing anything
she keeps looking staring
sheilas pov she sees v carl and a lot of people but pete is not there
pete looks at sheila
hes unsettled and confused by her staring but not seeming to see him
he watches her turn away and take one of her girlfriends hands leading her out to dance to the loud music
pete watches her dance
suddenly he cant see her
he thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the building out of view
he moves to look and his head is struck by a violent pain
he grabs his head with his hand and leans forward
v grabs his arm
you okay man
whats wrong pete looks up at v
he doesnt seem to recognize him vs head is a featureless blur
pete shakes his head trying to drive out the pain
he looks over again for sheila
he sees her there dancing with her girlfriend
pete stands back up against the post turns to v recognizing him
sure im okay
some drunk guys move over to sheila and her girlfriend
they cut in on the girls
the guy with sheila puts his hand around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind
she tries to push him away but he holds on tighter laughing with his buddy
v and carl look at pete as he pushes off the post
pete crosses quickly to the man dancing with sheila
he slams his fist into the mans nose almost snapping the mans neck in the process
the man goes down bleeding
pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready for a fight
he hits the man in the gut the mans head goes down and pete brings his knee up cracking the mans face
the mans torso flies up with petes knee then continues on as the man falls to the floor
pete picks him up ready to hit him again but the crowd pulls him off
pete stands and turns pulsating with anger
sheila is there beside him
whered you come from
ive been here
you were lookin right at me
sheila sinks into his arms
i didnt know you cared
pete takes her to the harley and they blast off
pete is making desperate love to sheila in the same room the same bed as with alice
whispered pain pete
pete keeps on harder obsessed
when he comes he crashes down on sheila who wraps her arms around him tight
she doesnt know what is going on with him
her eyes are open wide as she listens to his frantic breathing
she doesnt know what to say or what questions to ask
ed and al are staring silently at the motel and the harley parked out in front
what a fuckin job
his or ours
pete enters through the front door
his parents are sitting as if they have been waiting for him
sit down a minute
pete sits in a chair opposite bill and claire

he opens his coat and pulls out his
ruger blackhawk and holds it up in front of petes face and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth

eddy becomes cool he holsters his pistol and smiles at pete

the phone rings in the kitchen
voiceover ill get it
pete moves into the kitchen and picks up the phone

ill be there in twenty minutes
alice hangs up
pete stares at the phone for a moment then hangs it up slowly
pete pulls his camaro into the parking lot
when he gets out of the car he hears a voice and looks
pete takes a stairway past a coke machine and meets alice in front of a second floor room where the door stands open
i already got the room
pete follows alice into the motel room and she shuts the door
ed and al are parked across the street watching
pete and alice are sitting on the bed dressed
a bedside table lamp is on
hell kill us
are you positive he knows
im not positive
so what do we do
i dont know
we should stop seeing each other
alice moves closer to pete and melts into him
she places his hand on her breast and looks in his eyes
i dont want to live without you
she kisses pete and pulls up her sweater to let him feel her bare breasts
pete kisses her back lost in his longing for her
alice breaks away
we have to get away
we have to get some money
pete just stares at her

he pays girls to party with him
he always has alotta cash
alice puts her band up to petes cbeek and lets it drift around

and we could get away

alice kisses petes lips over and over looking in his eyes

inside pete goes crazy with jealousy

it was part of the deal
he works for mr
whats he do
he makes films for mr
howd you get in with these fuckin people
howd it happen alice
it was a long time ago
i met someone at this place called mokes
we became friends
he told me about a job
i didnt know what
he set up an appointment for me to see a man
we see alice wearing a sexy tight dress in a plain room
it feels like we are inside of a large building maybe an office building
alice is waiting nervously
a slickster in shiny shirt and pants is leaning against a closed door
there is another door off the room which is open onto a room where a muscle man in tiny briefs is doing bench presses
no one is saying anything
voiceover i went to this place
they made me wait forever
there was some guy guardin the door
i started gettin nervous
in another room i could see some guy liftin alice contd weights
both these guys gave me the creeps
they never said anything to me
so i just smoked cigarettes and waited
we move in on a nervous exhale of smoke to a close up of alice waiting
we see a close up of the man guarding the door
we see a close shot of the man bench pressing a lot of weight
suddenly there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door
the slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack
he talks quietly to someone alice cant see then he turns opens the door and gestures for alice to go through
alice puts out her cigarette her hand is shaking
she walks over past the slickster and enters a much larger room
there are about fifteen men in the room all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls
there is only one chair in the room mr
eddy is sitting in it
no one says anything to her but one man nods his head and from this nod alice feels she should walk to the center of the room
she does and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair
they all just stare at her silently
she looks around nervously her eyes return to mr
suddenly a man steps quickly up to her draws a pistol and cocks it against her head
alice goes weak in the knees
her eyes fill with fear
the men continue to stare
eddy gives alice a small gesture as if to say well
somehow she knows what they want even though they havent asked for it with words
alice starts to undress slowly in as sexy a way as she knows how
the men just stare without expression
when she is completely naked mr
eddy gestures her over to him
soon she is on her knees in front of him making herself available for whatever he wants
eddys pov alice looks in his eyes
she reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek
alices hand reaches up and strokes petes cheek
why didnt you just leave
alice doesnt say anything
she drops her hand looks down
you liked it
if you want me to go away ill go away
the feelings shift inside pete
alice looks in his eyes
i dont want you to go away
alice smiles a little leans in and they kiss
whispers i love you pete
they kiss some more
desperate whisper i love you alice
they start to make love undressing each other and kissing all the while
so should i call andy

alice reaches down between their legs
they start to go at it again at first slowly and tenderly then wildly
alice tears herself away and looks up at pete
are you my man
getting hotter yes
are you gonna be a man about this pete
pete looks at her starting to understand what she means
pete stares at her then nods
pete drives up and parks his camaro in the driveway
when he gets out of the car he sees sheila standing by the front step
she is looking in his direction but doesnt seem to see him
she suddenly turns and looks up the street she total horror as she yells she starts to look around wildly then her eyes follow the path the camaro took into
the driveway then the path pete took to where he has been standing all this time
her eyes find pete and she stands by the front step
she heads toward him
sheila what is it

youve been fucking somebody else havent you
you fuck me whenever you want
you dont call
tell me who she is
sheila has come up and is grabbing pete by the front of his shirt
whats the bitchs name
go home sheila
sheila starts beating him in the face and chest
she starts crying and hitting him harder
sheilas screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood
inside petes mind the sounds are even louder
bill comes out of the house
claire is behind him waiting on the front porch
sheila beats pete and trips him to the ground
she is sobbing as she tears at him
bill comes up to sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders
sheila jerks around and looks up at bill
why dont you two come inside and talk things over quietly
come on in sheila
sheila gets to her feet crying
she looks down at pete who remains lying on the front lawn
for pete every word and every sound is loud and distorted
the droning sound returns
to pete you are different
to bill the phone inside the house starts to ring
claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it
i dont care anyway
im sorry mr
i wont bother you or any member of your family again
sheila runs off crying
pete and bill watch her go
claire comes to the door
theres a man on the phone
hes called a couple of times tonight
pete pulls himself up
who is it
he wont give his name
pete walks slowly inside stares at the phone and picks it up
phone voice hey pete
how ya doin
who is this
you know who it is
bill and claire have stopped in the living room watching pete
pete is going crazy with mr
eddy on one end and his parents staring at him on the other
he waves his parents away but they leave slowly and reluctantly
how ya doin pete
youre doin okay
thats good pete
its late mr
im really glad youre doin okay pete
pete doesnt know what to say
you sure youre doin okay
everything all right
thats good pete
i want you to talk to a friend of mine
pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone
there is a long silence
pete can hear breathing
weve met before havent we
his mind is scrambling
i dont think so
where was it that you think weve met
at your house
dont you remember
no i dont
we just killed a couple of people
pete can hear mr
eddy laugh in the background
you heard me
we thought wed come over and tell you about it
pete is getting pale with fear
whats goin on
in the east
the far east
when a person is sentenced to death
theyre sent to a place where they cant escape
never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head
it could be days
or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced
this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation dont you think
its been a pleasure talking to you
pete can hear the phone being passed again
i just wanted to jump on and tell you im really glad youre doin okay
the phone goes dead and pete sits fearfully pondering his fate
he hears a noise and turns
down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him
close up on parents staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something but not seeing
parents pov the hall and living room beyond
there is no one there
a city bus pulls up to the stop
the doors open and pete climbs on
pete rides along in the empty bus
he stares at his reflection in the dark window
the bus stops and pete gets out
he starts walking
we see a street sign saying deep dell place
pete walks up the street looking at numbers
he finds deep dell place andys house
he stares at the house from the sidewalk
lights are on upstairs and down
the hot wind moves big shadows of trees over the front of the house
pete looks at his watch
it reads p
he walks down the driveway crosses through some bushes and comes to a fence separating the front yard from the back
he stops and listens
he pulls himself up and over the fence but crashes on something on the other side
he freezes listening
he hears the wind blowing through the trees and distant music from inside a slow jazz piece
he hears echoing sounds of love making
he makes his way around back goes up the stairs and tries the back door
pete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living room
pete stops short and stares
a movie projector is running in the living room
a porno film is being projected on a huge screen at the far end
alice is in the porno film
a man is fucking her from behind with loud slapping sounds of flesh banging flesh
her face is in the foreground
her eyes look out directly at pete
she is loving every minute of it
inside pete jealousy starts to rage out of control
he looks around
he sees clothes scattered about
he picks up a girls sweater and smells it
he looks up the stairs
feet appear at the top of the stairs
they start down
pete runs for the bar
along the way he grabs a heavy bronze figurine of a well stacked woman off a rectangular glass topped coffee table and ducks behind the bar
he can hear andy approaching
he can hear andy gather two glasses
he can hear alice being fucked harder in the porno film
he clenches his teeth with rage
suddenly andy moves right in front of him
they see each other
andys eyes widen pete leaps up and thwacks the bronze figurine down on the top of andys head
the breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his forehead
alice is coming quickly down the stairway naked except for a pair of panties
lipstick is smeared around her mouth
she is carrying a half filled pillowcase
her porno film is playing on the wall behind her
these images jump and spin in petes mind
he moves unsteadily toward her
you got him
still holding the figurine alice i
pete starts to tremble
he drops the figurine
he tries to embrace her
there is a crashing noise behind him
pete turns and sees andy staggering blood streaming from the wound in his head then charging full speed at pete
andy hits him hard and pete goes down
when pete hits the ground he pushes andy up and throws out his arms
this and andys momentum catapult andy into the corner of the rectangular glass topped coffee table
there is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into andys forehead
close up of andys head impaled on the sharp corner of the table his chest area suspended his legs and stomach touching the floor
amazement no feeling wow
pete pulls himself off the floor
pete moves close to alice they drift to the glass coffee table staring for a few moments at andys dead body
while pete stares unbelieving at andy alice hurriedly picks up her sweater and puts it on
on the sofa next to it lay andys trousers
she goes through the pockets finds a roll of cash bound by a rubber band
alice hands the roll to pete
put this in your pocket
alice kneels next to andys body and quickly removes his rolex wristwatch a couple of rings and the gold chain dangling from his neck
these items she puts inside the empty pillowcase
alice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the living room and puts them on
pete watches her trembling unable to say anything
she comes back to pete who starts breathing irregularly hyperventilating
you all right
we killed him
you killed him
alice slides up close to pete
it was an accident
accidents happen every day
pete clutches her eyes squeezed tight as if he is holding on for dear life
pushing back we gotta get the stuff and get out of here
alice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase
pete opens his eyes he sees alice move as a blur
he looks around the room which spins in and out of focus
his eyes land on a photograph in a frame on the wall
this photo troubles him
pete squints then points to the photograph
is that you
are both of them you
close up of the photograph four people appear in the frame andy renee alice and mr
alice stops and comes back
she looks at the photo walks closer to it and points at herself
she turns to pete
pete is staring at the photograph at alice and renee in the photograph
his nose is bleeding profusely
pete starts to reel blood from his nose soaking his shirt
wheres the bathroom
up the stairs down the hall
pete runs up the stairs about to get sicker
alice watches him go with a nuance of disdain
pete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the hallway
the hallway suddenly becomes hazy different and pete wanders down this changed hall
on his left he identifies a door with the number on it
he pauses for a moment in front of it then goes on until on his right he comes to a door with the number on it
he enters through this door
inside is a woman in front of a mirror with a man
her arms are resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her from behind
the mans face is blank featureless and is buried in the womans back we cant see it
pete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version of alice shes looking at petes reflection in the mirror
hes looking at her reflection in the mirror
petes head is pounding
to pete did you want to talk to me
pete rubs his head the pain is severe
laughs did you want to ask me why
pete staggers out of the room
he closes the door
the hallway has changed back to andys hallway
the doors no longer have numbers
pete walks unsteadily back down the hall faltering
he starts down the stairs
pete comes downstairs to the living room and sees alice at the desk in the corner filling the pillowcase with cash and jewelry
she has a pistol in her hand
alice turns when she hears pete and they study each others face as pete makes his way to her
his head is still throbbing with pain
his focus goes from her face to the gun which is pointing right at him back to her
dont you trust me pete
she laughs and hands him the pistol
stick that in your belt
she shows him the pillowcase filled with loot
going through the loot look at all this shit
i know a fence
hell give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car
looks up at him we can go anywhere
alice grabs petes arm and hurries him toward the door
come on baby
alice takes pete to andys car and throws him the keys
alice jumps in andys car and tosses the bulging pillowcase in the back
pete takes the revolver out of his belt
he opens the drivers side door of andys car and slowly sits inside
he sets the pistol on the seat between them
he looks up at her
she smiles wildly
pete slalms the door starts the car and they drive off
alice and pete pull up into the driveway of a house at the end of a street at the edge of a desert
alice gets out into a hot wind
pete stays in the car as she goes up to the house
petes pov he watches alice ring the doorbell
she waits in front of the door for a few moments her hair blowing in the wind
a houseboy opens the door
alice says something to him pete cannot bear anything that is said even though his drivers side window is down
all he can hear is the hot wind blowing
the houseboy moves out to where he can see pete waiting in the car
the houseboy and alice exchange information
the houseboy points out toward the desert
alice turns back to the car
the houseboy watches her
alice gets into the car
pete starts the car and begins backing it out the drive
the houseboy is still standing watching them
we have to go to the desert
hes at his cabin
pete and alice drive off
the houseboy continues to watch them
we see the clean moving pov illuminated by headlights
were floating down an old two lane highway through a desolate desert landscape
pete and alice pull off the two lane highway onto a barely discernible dirt road that cuts through the dark desert
pete and alice drive up to a one room cabin built on stilts next to a dry lakebed
they both get out and go up the stairs to a porch where alice knocks on the door
there is no answer
alice opens the door but there is nobody inside
well have to wait
the hot wind continues to blow
alice and pete walk back down to the car
the headlights are on and alice reaches in through the window and switches on the radio
she cant get anything in but static with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out
she hits the seek button
the radio starts to search
pete is standing in the glare of the headlights watching her
alice walks slowly to him
the camera captures this from a back seat perspective then drifts toward them
why me alice
why choose me
the radio sticks on a particular tune a tune filled with longing
alice begins to dance
she takes petes hand and pulls him close to her
so we can be together
you still want to be with me dont you pete
alice gives pete that wild smile
more than ever
she kisses pete over and over
he begins to kiss her back
she starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare of the headlights the hot wind caressing them
the scene is out of a dream
alice and pete help each other undress as they dance in and out of the light and the wind whips at their bodies
they sink down on the soft ground and start making love
the lights from the headlights combine with the starlight bathing them in a pristine glow
the music fades and the radio begins to seek through static for another station
the music it finds now is loud and alice her hunger appearing now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with pete
she is the aggressor highly charged she wants more and more taking not giving insatiable
the headlights flare their bodies in blinding light
they become amorphous glowing shapes burning in the light
pete is trying desperately to please her to have her
the driving music fills with cracks of piercing static
the radio strains to hold the station
petes white hot body clings to alice
he chokes with emotion
i want you
i want you
with a burning smile alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness
the wind billows a black cloud of dust around them
alice pulls away from pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear
youll never have me
alice glides away from pete and stands up looking down at him from above
she turns and walks naked to the cabin where she disappears within it
pete turns face down on the ground in the darkness
hes holding his head and shaking
as he starts to stand he turns into the glare of the headlights and we see that it is not pete but fred
as fred stands up the cars lights dim and the radio fades
fred looks at the car
he sees some movement inside
fred looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat
close up of the man its the mystery man from andys party
fred turns toward the cabin and sees the mystery man now standing in the doorway
fred turns again to the car but this time its empty
he looks back at the cabin and sees the mystery man still in the doorway
here i am
fred is dizzy with fear and confusion
he pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to the cabin toward the mystery man who goes inside
fred stops in the doorway
he looks around
fred looks around again but there is no one there except the mystery man standing in the center of the room
fred stares at him
her name is renee
if shes told you her name is alice shes lying
filled now with anger fred freaks scared to death
he bolts down the stairs to the car stumbling more than once
fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical charge by the use of the headlights and radio
the mystery man appears in the doorway of the cabin
he starts toward fred
the starter motor moans as fred twists the key frantically
the smiling mystery man is almost at the car the engine catches
fred revs it throws the car in reverse and peels out away from the mystery man whose hand is reaching for him
fred swerves the car around throws it in drive and takes off across the dark desert
fred pulls up onto the two lane highway
an old rusted roadsign is posted there
it reads lost highway
fred is driving along the two lane desert lost highway
the wind is picking up even stronger than before
a big storm is blowing in
fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads lost highway hotel
the sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it
fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it
he gets out of the car tucks the pistol in his belt under his shirt and enters the hotel which is an old two story building
fred walks up to the registration desk where a clerk is smiling at him in a half baked way
you just got in before the big storm hits
fred pulls the roll of bills from his pocket
i need a room
the hallway is strangely similar to petes vision upstairs at andys
fred comes to the door numbered looks at his key which says and unlocks the door and enters
fred takes the revolver out of his shirt and puts it under the pillow on the bed
he sits on the edge of the bed
he takes a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket and lights it with a match from a book of lost highway hotel matches
fred smokes the cigarette listening to the wind blow
lightning cracks outside the window
fred crushes the cigarette out in the ashtray on the bedside table
as the last of the blue smoke drifts away fred falls back on the bed
fred closes his eyes
the camera moves in on the door numbered
renee is in bed with mr
he and renee are feverishly making love as the storm rages outside
a criminal investigation is under way
ed and al are present among a fleet of law enforcement personnel who are busy dusting for fingerprints and examining the murder site
hey al look at this
al walks over to where ed is looking at the photo on the wall
al looks at it

weve got pete daytons prints all over this place
you know what i think
whats that ed
theres no such thing as a bad coincidence
renee is sitting half dressed on the edge of the bed pulling on her stockings
eddy laurent is asleep next to her
renee stands up finishes dressing then leans down and kisses her lover while he sleeps
renee leaves the room closing the door as quietly as possible behind her
as the door clicks mr
eddy laurent wakes up
he sits up and gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table shakes one out lights it with a book of lost highway hotel matches and smokes it while
seated on the edge of the bed
fred still fully dressed is waking up as if in a trance the same attitude he had on the videotape
he strains upwards and looks eerily around the room
he gets up and crosses slowly to a window
he takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back
the view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel
freds pov he sees renee down below walk over to a car get in and drive away
fred walks back to his bed picks up his revolver from under the pillow crosses the room to the door and walks out
fred crosses over to room and knocks softly on the door
eddy laurent is standing almost dressed when he hears the knock
he goes to the door and opens it a crack
as the door opens fred smashes the gun into mr
eddy laurents face and pushes his way inside the room
fred hits mr
eddy laurent viciously again with the gun barrel
eddy laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose
what the fuck
whats going on
pointing the gun at him youre coming with me
fred puts the pistol up against mr
eddy laurents head and marches him out of the room past the cameras eye
the camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window through which we see fred and mr
eddy laurent appear down below in the back lot
still watching out the window the camera sees fred knock mr
eddy laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car
fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the drivers side of what is obviously mr
eddy laurents car the mercedes pullman
as fred drives away a hand appears in our window foreground
the hand moves the window curtain further to one side
the camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the mystery man
the mystery man leans fully into the frame and watches fred drive off down the lost highway as day breaks
fred is driving along the road
suddenly he pulls the car off the road and drives over the dirt and brush to a deserted spot stops and gets out
fred opens the trunk
when he does
eddy laurent charges up and attacks fred knocking them both to the ground
eddy laurent tries to strangle fred but freds anger is too great
fred tears loose and gets mr
eddy laurent in a hold bending his head back
freds hand reaches out behind him feeling searching
a knife appears
it comes into freds hand from another
fred slices mr
eddy laurents throat and throws him down
eddy laurent squirms on the ground his hand grasped around his throat trying to hold his neck together
blood is flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of him as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound
fred stands facing him his pistol out now pointing right at mr
eddy laurents forehead
close up on mr
eddy laurent he lifts his head and stares at fred
blood is rushing out of him
wet and jagged what do you guys want
the camera pans around to fred we see that the mystery man is standing beside fred and it is the mystery man who is holding the gun not fred
the mystery man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a little watchman tv
he turns it on and hands it over to mr
eddy laurent who manages to take it
eddy laurent looks down at the small television screen
eddy laurents pov as he watches the tv screen we move in until the screen fills the frame as with the former videotapes
the full frame of the tv screen reveals we see the movie screen on a wall in andys living room
marian raquel and renees images are being projected on this screen simultaneously involved in pornographic acts with two men
watching this movie in andys living room are several people in shadows behind the light of the projector
among them we see renee and mr
eddy laurent standing next to andy
eddy laurent and renee are hot kissing his hand is up under her skirt
they are watching the porno film
they are watching murky images of sex turning to violence
in a close up we see renee and mr
eddy laurent in the shadows looking out at the film both half smiling stoned aroused
the image on the watchman changes now
on the watchman tv screen mr
eddy laurent sees an image of fred and the mystery man staring at him
the mystery mans image speaks
on tv screen now you can hand it back to me
eddy laurent sees the mystery mans image reach out a hand
eddy laurent looks up
the mystery man has his arm outstretched just as it was on the video image
eddy laurent hands the watchman back and locks eyes with the mystery man
wet and jagged you and me mister we can really out ugly the sumbitches cant we
the mystery man unloads the pistol into mr
eddy laurent who jerks and dies in the dust
the mystery man then leans close to fred and whispers in his ear
the camera moves in past the mystery man to a close up of freds eyes as he listens
the camera cuts back wide to reveal fred holding the gun
he is standing alone there is no mystery man
fred turns to go back to the car
fred drives up to his house in mr
eddy laurents mercedes pullman and stops in front
he gets out of the car goes to the front door and rings the doorbell
there is a beep sound
into intercom dick laurent is dead
as fred finishes this sentence we see the cop car containing ed and al pull in to the curb just up the street from fred and renees house
fred turns and sees the cop car
he jumps in his car fires it up and peels out
the cops give chase
fred is behind the wheel of his car
behind him are the cops
close up on freds face through the front windshield
the shot is wide enough to reveal the cop car in hot pursuit
freds face begins to change again grotesquely contorting as he races into the vortex
his tormented scream blends with the howling siren of the police car gaining on him
