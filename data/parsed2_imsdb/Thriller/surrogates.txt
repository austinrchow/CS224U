written by john brancato michael ferris based on the graphic novel by robert venditti october a distorted image of downtown city streets at night
this is not a fisheye lens but the reflection in the mirrored surface of a helmet visor
a near future motorcycle stops near a dramatic high rise residential building
the rider clad in black leather climbs off his machine
well call him the assassin
he flips up his visor
his face is scarred stubbly
he conceals himself in an alcove eyes never leaving the buildings entrance
a uniformed doorman opens the high rises lobby door for a handsome young man in a tuxedo and trenchcoat
the assassin has been waiting for this
he removes what looks like a rifle scope from his jacket aims it at scope pov focusing on tuxedos face magnified
a digital readout scanning
then a long serial number reads out and the name lionel alexander canter along with other personal information below
the assassin puts away the scanner scope satisfied
he reaches a hand into a pocket withdraws a mysterious device
the size of a first generation cellphone it has a military look with a clear sliding panel over safety switches and buttons
the assassin hurries toward tuxedo but before he can a sleek futuristic limousine pulls up and tuxedo gets in the back
theyre gone in an instant
the assassin frustrated dashes for his motorcycle
he starts it and pursues the limousine
the motorcycle pursues the limousine along the potomac d
landmarks visible in the distance
formal crowds a red carpet signs for an opera
the limousine approaches
tuxedo leans forward to the driver a muscular handsome man in a suit named armando
im not really in the mood for opera armando
armando nods knowingly pulls back into traffic
you read my mind
lets not mention this to my dad
as he speaks he passes a few bills over the seat
the limo moves through this seemingly deserted area pulls up near a steel door with a spray painted x
tuxedo emerges sans jacket and tie his dress shirt open
i can find my way back
armando nods and pulls away
tuxedo moves toward the entrance says a word into an intercom with a surveillance camera
the door opens within moments he disappears inside
the assassin parks his bike a few steps behind
tuxedo has vanished through the steel door before he can catch up with him
the assassin takes off his helmet tries the door
it wont move
he buzzes the intercom
the door slides open a crack the bouncer is a huge bald man with jet black skin red eyes and teeth that glow fluorescently
the throbbing beat of music within
the bouncer narrows his eyes
this is a private club
i just need to talk to the steel door has already shut in his face
bodies slam together in a brutal mosh pit men and women
all are young some beautiful others extremely decorated and pierced
they tear at each other brutally trying to do real damage
on the edges of the pit individual fistfights go on
an incongruous chandelier overhead gilt edged mirrors on the walls the fighters slam into and shatter them
a hard core band plays on an elevated stage
the musicians are heavily punked out in outlandish clothes with pierced faces tattoos and body make up
in a vip area a balcony elevated above the stage numerous beautiful people at tables
many are making out gay straight threesomes orgies happen up here
tuxedo sits by himself
he raises a glass tube attached to a cord one of a few leading into an electronic device on the table
as he brings the tube close to his own neck an arc of electricity jumps to his skin
his features go slack a shudder goes through him
then he lowers the tube with a smile
hes using a jacker a sort of electro shock hookah
a shout over the music mind if i join you
a stunningly beautiful blonde in edgy dramatic clothes stands nearby
tuxedo recovering from the hit gestures graciously for her to sit
she picks up one of the cords gives him a sly smile
she opens her mouth sparks fly to her tongue and
rain pours down as tuxedo and the blonde burst out the door laughing
he pushes her against a brick wall they grope each other hungrily hands inside clothes getting drenched in the warm downpour
with the assassin wearing his helmet with the visor up as he approaches the entwined couple
tuxedo hears him get lost meatbag
angle on the alleys mouth as we hear the blondes scream
seconds later she staggers out clutching her head and collapses to the pavement
we hear an engine start from the alleyway
the assassin emerges on his bike rides directly over her body unconcerned and roars into the night
camera pulls up to an aerial view of the rain swept city some futuristic high rises amongst the recognizeable landmarks
also a great number of super cell towers and dishes considerably larger than the ones we see today
camera picks up speed moves quickly to a run down part of the city tenements and vacant lots
move down and through a third story window of a dark decaying hallway
a man and a woman move stealthily up the stairs laser sight guns in hand
the man is thomas greer the woman jennifer peters
both are about handsome athletic
greers spent his life in law enforcement
hes smart and able wants things to make sense but as the world changes around him he feels hes losing the thread
peters is junior to greer her attitudes professional but rigid by the book
greer in the lead waves peters up
they approach a door at the end of the hall
we see now that their windbreakers read fbi
greer kicks open the door lit by candles and kerosene lanterns smoke hangs in the room
we glimpse bodies hanging from the ceiling in chains
greer and peters train their lasers around the place disturbed by the scene
a flash of movement in a bedroom and a crash the psycho who lives here has kicked over a lantern fire spills across the floor
we glimpse a surprisingly good looking guy grinning maniacally
he dashes across the greer squeezes off a couple of shots
the psychos too fast he leaps through a cracked window
rain has let up
the psycho falls thirty feet into a pile of soft dirt and trash
he rolls to the bottom gets to his feet and runs
greer looks down from the broken window
peters is beating at the flames with a towel sees greer is preparing to jump
lets call for back up
s the sport in that
greer snorts and leaps greer hits the dirt hard and rolls
he reaches the ground and sets off after the psycho at top speed
play a frantic foot chase both men scramble over chain link fences leap over trashed cars
greer pursues the psycho around a corner into a passageway between buildings wherethepsycho gets the jump on him swings a length of pipeathis head
greer ducks fast the blow catches him inthearm he drops his gun
the psycho moves to pick uptheweapon but greer tackles him against a dumpster
greer slams the dumpster lid on the man repeatedly
you have the right to remain silent but the psycho has grabbed something from the trash manages to squirt bug spray in greers eyes
greers blinded temporarily the psycho squirms away running from between buildings across a street wham
hes hit full on by a semi his body flies through the air
he lands hard on cement but amazingly is still alive
he tries to get up but greer plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast against the ground
greer still wiping at this eyes points his weapon at the psychos head
stay with me asshole why would i do that
the psycho grins then his head lolls back eyes empty
peters is by a womans body on the floor holding a pocket scanner close to her head
this small device resembles an iphone
theres tape over the womans eyes and mouth which peters peels away as she speaks into a tiny cellphone earpiece
is this kathy welles
my name is jennifer peters with the fbis surrogate crime division
on scanner the name kathy welles reported stolen contact information below
on greers scanner new u rental agency with an id number but no name
greer kneels beside the psychos body pockets his scanner
hes angry but resigned he was half expecting this
the semi driver is still behind the wheel of his rig
he calls out to greer am i in trouble
waves him off nah go back to work
greer rises as his phone chimes he touches his earpiece
in bg the driver pulls away
hes a rental
he disconnects reaches to turn the psychos head to one side
the back of his skull is smashed
instead of gore and brains we see torn gray plastic and dense circuitry oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck
were in a world of surrogates remotely operated synthetic humans also known as synths
these are not artificially intelligent robots each is linked directly to a human being miles or hundreds of miles away
surrogates are distinguishable from flesh and blood humans primarily by their physical perfection ugly surrogates are rare
on closer look their eyes may have an inhuman quality
without a human mind sending and receiving impulses they are completely inert
suddenly the psycho comes to life spins his head around at an impossible angle and bites greers hand
he wont let go
greer stomps on the psychos head reaches with his other hand into the back of the skull to wrench out a circuit board
the psycho finally stops writhing disconnected
peters talks on the phone while scanning a severed head
i dont recommend reconnecting ms
the woman on the floor twitches her eyes open
she sits up on her elbows looks down to see her legs are gone
the bottom half of her is missing her tattered t shirt covers the damage soaked with dark green and pink liquids coolant and hydraulic fluids
aw crap im totalled
your insurance ought to cover it
greer trudges toward the building on his cell leaving the body behind
he turns the circuit board over in his fingers
trash pick up on maple and th
coulda just called it in wed a shut him down from here any id from the rental agency
yeah got a name from their office in miami
ness harold p
dont be in a rush to get home tom
two surries down outside the pit hard core club on f street
greer picks up the pace heads out of frame
start on the blonde eyes empty face against the cement
or something happened to the operator
greer and peters stand over the corpse a uniform stands nearby
greer holds his scanner near her head
registered to a cameron michaels out in clarksburg
you call her
left a message
greer is leaning closer to the dead blondes face
x close cracks in the glass of her eye
we see greers fragmented reflection as he peers at this
optics are damaged
musta cracked when she fell
theres a second
the uniform leads greer and peters past the blonde into the alley
tuxedo lies on his side eyes closed
we can hear music throbbing from within
couldnt get an id from this one
greer kneels by tuxedo looks at his fancy cufflinks
kind of over dressed for a jacker joint
greer pulls out his scanner
by tuxedos face the scanner reads no signal
greer seems surprised
peters looks over his shoulder
maybe hes real
little too pretty for that
greer lifts one of tuxedos eyelids close shattered glass electronics visible within
hes synth all right
looks like the optics exploded
greer reaches behind tuxedos head pulls out a small specially shaped tool and pries up the panel at the back of tuxedos skull
he pulls out the circuit board melted and scorched
so much for the identity chip
ill call for a pick up
maybe diagnostics can make sense of it
greer stands up looks toward the blondes body
clarksburgs just up the lets talk to our witness
a glance at her watch you always work these kind of hours
got something better to do
greer is already on the move peters reluctantly follows
a slightly futuristic sedan speeds through light late night traffic
we hear the voice of the prophet you feel you are free
you can be what you want do what you want nothing can hurt you
but you have ceased to live
peters has her eyes closed in the passenger seat
the voice on the radio continues in bg through scene
you think you control your surrogates but it is they who have taken over your lives
you lie in your cells pale and fat prisoners while the puppets walk and dance and make love
peters blinks and comes to
re the radio are we actually listening to the prophet
we oughta lock this guy up and throw away the key
off greers shrug so is this know thine enemy
the human coalition isnt the enemy
youre kidding right
the dreadsve gotta be behind half the crimes against surries nationwide dreads
they dread the present they dread points at radio you know this jokers calling for an uprising
in denver we got the go ahead to jam his broadcasts
sounds like theyre doing a bang up job out there
whyd you transfer
s the heart of the action right
plus my ex and i were in the same office it got a little uncomfortable
you get along with your last partner
till he retired
had no idea he was that old
but this i promise soon the abominations shall fall where they stand
and on that day of resurrection the dead shall rise
move across the facade of a suburban apartment complex
a red glow suffuses most of the windows all of which are barred
in this warm light we glimpse operators in reclining chairs motionless
they could be watching tv but no sets are in sight
move to find greer and peters as they exit the sedan and pass a sign surrogate ready units available
greer and peters walk along an almost prison like corridor surveillance cameras heavy doors
they follow an empty faced walking mannequin in an ugly pantsuit
this is the landlady
her mouth moves like a ventriloquists dummy as she speaks self consciously i been having problems with my surrie this is just a loaner
is there some kind of trouble
nothing to worry about
cams a good tenant yknow
pays the rent on time never leaves the apartment
pounds on a door cam
wake up the police are here to talk to you
the landlady undoes the multiple locks on the door of a small one room apartment
she opens it and lets greer and peters inside
a red glow from the far end of the room greer flicks on overheads
the landlady hovers by the door as they move into the place
its minimalist nothing on the walls
empty pizza boxes
skirts stockings high heels strewn around haphazardly
we also glimpse a large charging cradle contact points embedded in the foam inside shaped to accomodate a curvaceous female body
a fat hairy arm hangs over the side of a high tech chair
the two feds move quickly to see cameron michaels a ish overweight bald male in his underwear
blood runs from his nose his face twitches slightly he lies in a stim chair
stim chairs resemble oversized massage chairs contoured to the body with padded head supports
they vibrate and electronically stimulate the user to prevent atrophy
a sensory projector sits beside the chair
this device looks like a computer tower
its linked to an elaborate headset with contact points around the skull
theres also a monitor screen which displays the operators remote pov
oh my god cameron greer quickly detaches the headset rips a small electronic sleeve off of camerons fingertip
he checks the mans pupil response and pulse
call the paramedics
while peters calls in bg greer moves to the projectors monitor screen and taps a touchpad
on screen static
greer rewinds to povs at the hard core club
fast forward to the alley making out with tuxedo
this is a recording of recent experience as seen through the eyes of the blonde
greer switches to real time
tuxedo breaks the kiss and turns to look os
get lost meatbag
as tuxedo turns back to camera we hear a hideous electronic screech tuxedos face contorts in pain
and his eyes burst fragments of glass and electronics fly
the pov reels we hear the blondes scream and static again fills the screen
greer is disturbed by this looks again at the unconscious quivering face of the man in the chair
a mostly empty car scattered surrie passengers ride stiffly zoned out empty expressions
except for a long haired dread one of the anti surrogate fanatics
hes disheveled hippyish shouts into the empty faces of the surrogates
he moves to a young couple both slack faced on standby
wake up and smell the piss
he starts to unzip in front of them
the dread turns greer is holding up a badge
the dread scowls zips up and moves away from greer plunks down at the end of the car
greer pockets his badge calmly
greer approaches an urban apartment complex on foot carrying a bag of take out food
high fences security cameras and scanners all commonplace in this world
we see the red glow from a few windows
greer moves tiredly down a long hallway to his apartment
he punches in a code at the door
greer enters crosses a living room thats been decorated in a spare modern style
greer sets the bag down on a table fills a glass with water and moves down a hallway to a bedroom
greer enters the bedroom places the water glass on a bedside table beside the real greer
he looks five years older twenty pounds heavier than his surrogate
hes in a stim recliner attached to a sensory projector like the one we saw on cameron michaels
red light suffuses the room
greer a surrogate we now realize undresses puts his clothes aside in a closet which also contains a foam filled charging cradle
down to his underwear he backs into this seems to relax
we hear a low hum and the real greers eyes open
he disconnects the headset and fingersleeve the red glow is replaced by white light
he sits up yawns and sips the water
he rises wearily stretches runs a hand through his thinning hair
he moves to shut the closet door on his synth unit
as it closes greer the real one sits at the table in a bathrobe finishing the food his surrogate brought home
as he empties the remains into the trash maggie enters
shes greers wife a stylish young woman looking ridiculously good for someone whos just gotten up
maggie starts at the sight of greer begins to retreat
its as if shes stumbled upon him in the bathroom
oh sorry its ok
come in but wheres your
put him up
i was about to get some sleep
maggie enters the kitchen not looking directly at greer
she puts some bread in a toaster prepares coffee
you just get in
some poor cross sexual had an aneurysm while he was online had to get him to a hospital
maggie winces disturbed by her husbands job
she flips on a small flatscreen tv volume low
news and weather
i think i need a new stim chair
want me to take a look
no thanks its just some irritation
well theres room on the credit card
its been a while since
weve actually been together
are you talking about sex
no i just meant because i think were doing just fine
but thats our surrogates
its not the same
i wish that instead of working every night you would come out with me go dancing we used to have such a good time i was thinking more like a
an island somewhere
likes the idea bridget said she got an amazing deal on a surrie rental in tahiti she looked just like a native
i mean a real vacation just us
leave our synth units home
and get on a plane
her toast pops up
maggie takes it with her coffee out of the room
she shakes her head amused at greers crazy ideas
she takes her breakfast through a door in the hall just off the kitchen we cant see inside the room
we hear the door lock behind her
greer looks after his wife a bit dejected
in the quiet he registers a voice from the tv remember
it wasnt long ago
on tv the sign air quality unhealthful
pedestrians with surgical masks and even gasmasks
the sign quarantine
bodies in a mass grave
the sign terror alert high
a busy city street
suddenly a massive explosion a car bomb going off
from the blast bleach to white
a better world
a beautiful girl enters frame turns to camera and smiles
behind her more happy healthy handsome young people in an abstract white space
wider there are thousands of them
virtual self industries
on tv the logo for vsi comes on the screen
do what you want
be what you want
a wood paneled hallway of an ivy league dorm two male undergrads pimply glasses overweight clearly not surries knock on a dorm room door
maybe hes still hung over
hes gonna miss the exam
they try the door unlocked
as soon as they enter the undergrads choke on the stench covering their noses
in the bed is a young male corpse a sensory projector attached to his head the red glow
overhead lights flick on to reveal goopy blood at his nose and ears the pillow soaked
tuxedos operator turned up student at yale name of anthony canter
cluttered with papers two desks
greer sits before a terminal staring at his screen
theyre uploading his memory file
seems were dealing with an actual homicide
peters at the other much neater desk leans in to look over greers shoulder while the file uploads
you sound pleased
well you get a little tired of property crime vandalism
thought you took your job seriously
surrogates are extensions of peoples selves what are you quoting vsi
the supreme court
anthony stone greers boss has entered greers office during the above
hes silver haired friendly in perfect shape another surrogate
hes clearly heard this argument before
synthetic units have the same rights as biologicals
fact is most of the people you refer to as dreads are just too poor to afford a synth
you think they like living on reservations
thats humanist propaganda
the restricted areas were their idea they hate being around surries
get a room you two
he leans between them hits a button on greers computer
on screen a new haven pd logo at the top of the screen indicating this is an evidence file
in a large window tuxedos pov recording plays
we now see the foreplay in the alley from the other perspective
footsteps tuxedo pulls away from the blonde and turns to confront the helmeted assassin
tuxedos get lost meatbag
the assassin narrows his eyes then white light fills the screen the blondes scream cuts out as the audio goes
then static and blackness
greer peters and stone react to this
pathologist said his brains looked like soup
what could do that to someone
lightning strike according to forensics
a massive power surge shoots through the network
two people in a narrow alley surrounded by fire escapes cell towers
got a better idea
in any case lets be discreet about this
therell be panic in the streets if the public gets the idea that using their surries can kill them
greer is rewinding the image
he points to the face of the assassin partly shielded within his helmet
they only get a partial of his face it enlarges and is he the perp or just some lookie loo
hes a meatbag all right
look at those scars
an intercom beeps greer hits a button
what you got
next of kin
you sitting down
kids father is lionel alexander canter
the lionel canter
greer peters and stone take this in stunned
stone leans closer to the intercom
under no circumstances do you discuss this matter with anyone inside or outside the bureau
greer disconnects the intercom stone moves to leave
you still thinking lightning
elegant traditional decor
armando the limousine driver from the opening sequence is posted amidst the mirrors and plush furniture
an elegantly dressed clerk is at the lobby desk checking on a computer screen
greer and peters wait
canter is expecting you
but no weapons are permitted in the penthouse
were federal agents
youll have to leave them with me
at greers nod peters takes out her holstered gun
greer does the same
the clerk locks both the agents guns in a drawer then comes out from behind the desk
the clerk passes him a key
i work for dr
his private elevators this way
they follow him toward an alcove in the back of the lobby
youre the one who drove anthony canter that night
i gave the police a statement
at a private elevator while armando turns a key a scanner automatically swings out on a cantilevered arm
is this necessary
light flashes in their faces as theyre scanned
the elevator doors open and the three of them get on
close on scanner after theyve entered the elevator small head shots of greer and peters vital stats below appear one after the other on the screen
greer turns to armando whos staring straight ahead
kid liked the wild side huh
did his father know
armando doesnt answer this is getting too personal
the elevator opens into a marble entrance area
its traditional tastefully opulent artwork sculpture
a small automated vacuum cleaner moves along a persian rug
armando moves ahead of them to announce their presence
greer and peters speak quietly
canter must get a piece of every surrogate they sell
canter emerges from a study
his face is young but theres some grey at his temples
otherwise he looks identical to the dead tuxedo
greer takes this in
youre with the fbi
yes we are
he leads them into a traditional study wood paneling books
windows lead to a balcony
armando remains in bg throughout scene
were very sorry for your loss sir
what progress have you made with the investigation
i cant help noticing your surrogate its very similar to the unit your son was using
canter pauses then moves to a door and opens it
lights inside flicker on revealing a walk in closet with a half dozen charging bays
four surrogates here all versions of the man weve just seen canter at different stages of life from youth to almost elderly
two of the charging bays are empty
i allowed tony to borrow one of my surrogates when he wanted to spend time in d
i encouraged him to take advantage of the cultural wait how is that possible
arent your surries locked to your neural signature
closing the door i wrote the code that remains at the core of all surrogates
it wasnt difficult for me to make my synth units accessible to my son
like getting the keys to dads car
the coroner says that tony was online when it happened
why hasnt the surrogate been returned to me
were still analyzing the damage it was attacked
we really cant get into the details of an ongoing investigation dr
canter we dont know of any way to kill an operator remotely
no but at the beginning all of us at vsi were worried about it
its why every surrogate has a built in fail safe they disconnect before they can transmit a potentially dangerous signal
can you think of anyone who might want to harm your son
the sad fact is tony and i were just getting to know each other
he grew up with his mother in california
canters voice drifts off hes starting to look far away pained
he sits slowly behind his desk
if this wasnt an accident
then its because of me that hes
youll have to excuse me
before greer and peters can reply canter goes rigid eyes blank hes disconnected
guess the interviews over
can you imagine what its like to lose your only child
greer scribbles something on a business card
you got kids
shakes her head jim and i talked about it but
lot of that going around
he starts to place the card on the desk before the immobile canter
armando steps forward warily greer shows him the card before putting it down
if he thinks of anything else
ill show you out
as they move back toward the lobby elevator we remain with the motionless canter a beat
then the camera moves quickly from the study and through a wall to find a small private area bathed in red light with a very fancy elaborate sensory projector
real canter is much older than his surrogate his face stubbly
his body is twisted and nearly useless his head held up by a brace
a victim of some horrible degenerative disease canter only has the use of one arm via an elaborate electronic armature
hes just disconnected his headset
there are tears streaming down his cheeks
his projector screen faces him with his working arm he calls up an old memory file
the kid we saw dead pov on eighteen year old tony canter in the dorm room as he hauls up a sail in the front of a boat
he looks toward camera and smiles
greer and peters move from the entrance to canters residential high rise
so were talking mistaken t
someone targeted canters surrie got the wrong operator
they get to their car parked in a red zone
greer curls his lip at a meter maid a drone surrogate on wheels no ears as it rolls calmly away from his car
im sure the guys got enemies he never even heard of
my moneys on the dreads
off greers look excuse me the humans
greer rips the ticket from the windshield tears it in half and throws it in the back of the car as they both get in
move over a display depicting the history of surrogates
models are arranged chronologically from primitive looking obvious robots moving stiffly to animated mannequins like the landlady to the modern units almost indistinguishable from human beings whose repetitive movements are
smooth fully articulated
greer and peters in plainclothes move past the display
greer stops in his tracks seeing
a display that reads breaking the minds code
a video loop shows a young canter much like his surrogate seated at a worktable with electronic gear beside a subject lying on a table hundreds of wires affixed to
these lead to a crude mannequin which turns its head rolls its eyes moves its mouth
we hear a video narrator volume low
lionel canters breakthrough experiments led to the technology for decoding brain impulses and transferring the signals to synthetic humans
why didnt i think of that
the two of them move on to an elevator bank
a gorgeous assistant with plenty of cleavage enters with two cups of coffee
she takes them to greer and peters who sit at the table in this dramatic conference area
welch will be with you in a minute
shes a little over the top
just advertising the product
sips his coffee ugh
its delicious if you want it to be
adjust your interface
right i keep forgetting that
they rise as
victor welch enters
like most everyone else hes ish handsome a slick pr man in a suit
behind him are a male and female lawyer unsmiling
all wear id badges around their necks with the vsi logo
agents greer and peters
im victor welch vp corporate relations
he shakes their hands
thanks for taking the time to see us
do you happen to know andy stone
our immediate superior
do give him my regards the male lawyer cuts him off leaning across the table to shake hands
were from the legal department
hope you dont mind if we sit in
not at all
i didnt get your names
you might be interested in a free software upgrade were offering to all law enforcement officials better night vision for your synth unit improved pursuit capability
any idea what could cause a surrogates head to explode from the inside
on the table in a plastic evidence bag is a fried circuit board along with a pair of shattered eyeballs
greer passes this to welch who barely looks at it
welch isnt qualified to answer that question
youd be better off speaking to one of our technicians
welch smiles pleasantly
what does the operator say
a massive brain hemmorhage it happened while he was online
im sorry to hear that
but i can assure you it has nothing to do with vsi products
if a man suffers a heart attack while driving he doesnt have a case against the automobile manufacturer
welch nods in agreement
greer gamely continues to address his questions to the vp
no ones talking lawsuit
wed just like to know is there any precedent for an operator being killed by signals from his synth unit
the idea is absurd
if it were possible it would defeat the purpose of surrogacy
surries have jumped from bridges been shot or blown to bits without the least harm to the operators the fail safes always kick in
every case thats been brought against vsi has been shown to be the result of user negligence
we cant help it if customers forget to eat sleep or take their medicine
welch shrugs and rises followed by the lawyers
if thats all
a pleasure talking with you
there is one more thing
the victim was anthony canter
the son of one of your companys founders
greer studies them as they process this news
kind of a strange coincidence
canter has retired but well be sure to send our condolences
greer and peters move from a glass corporate tower across beautifully manicured gardens
greer carries the evidence in a briefcase
whats our take away
i used to be able to read people back when they were people
you mean before they all became lawyers
you made a joke
maybe theres hope for you peters
they head for a manufacturing complex
an overhead conveyor carries plastic ribcages and spinal columns containing electronic parts fluid sacs and tubes
arms and legs elaborate hydraulic apparatus are attached by robotic assemblers
theres no skin yet just the exposed machinery made mostly of plastic and microcircuitry
a window overlooks the factory floor
here technicians sit at computer stations monitoring the processes below
greer and peters stand before waters who looks like a basketball player hugely tall african american tattooed in casual clothes
greer waves a hand up in his face trying to get his attention
greer checks the mans id badge a photo of a pudgy bearded white man with glasses the name seth waters
suddenly waters snaps out of it looks down at the two agents
despite his appearance his manner is nerdy
i was in the can
we were told you could help us with some technical issues
to whom am i addressing myself
were with the fbi
he studies the badges they hold out
x close on the dense blackened and partially melted circuit board a labyrinth of lines and patterns
waters peers into a huge electronic microscope in this laboratory
computer monitors mysterious equipment
heat build up like this
every circuit musta fired at once
greer and peters hover nearby
waters turns his attention to the shattered eyes picks one up
ever seen anything like it before
but last week we got a truckload of gi joes back for reconditioning
couple a the surries were missing optics
may we take a look
waters opens the doors and flips on fluorescent lights
they blink on to reveal row upon row of surrie templates naked hairless and robotic not yet personalized with faces and skin
they stand packed like sardines ready for shipment
waters leads greer and peters to a caged in corner of the warehouse unlocks the gate
inside are stacked bodies in the uniforms of different services
many are battered and scarred from battle even in pieces
all are wrapped in clear plastic
old soldiers never die
he consults a hand held computer checks code numbers on the bags
the soldiers faces are all eerily similar
no reason to customize cannon fodder
here we go
he peels back the plastic on another identical soldier whose eyes are missing
the body is otherwise undamaged
no bullet holes no blast damage
not a scratch
greer moves waters aside looks the body over
brand new camos no mud no dirt
this things never seen combat
name and unit insignia removed
let me check out the motherboard
didnt come back with one
i thought it was a little weird
greer stares into the empty eyesockets of the soldier
he hooks a finger in comes out with a glistening shard of glass on his fingertip
a firefight in a bombed out desert town somewhere in the middle east
a grunts pov as a small group of surrogate soldiers the generic gi joe types we saw at vsi clean up an insurgent outpost
pulaski a gung ho surrie soldier charges into machine gun fire and is blown to pieces
a wider shot reveals that this pov is one of many being displayed on battlefield monitors in a warehouse sized space
each hangs above a flesh and blood soldier in loose marine uniform in stim chairs hooked into sensory projectors
the room is bathed in red light
real pulaski bolts upright in his stim chair a white light goes on as his screen turns to static
im down im down
a controller works quickly at a board
colonel brandon a flesh and blood career military man in uniform moves past pulaskis stim chair gives him a warning look
damn things arent free pulaski
take the snipers from behind this time
back on line
pulaski lies back in his stim chair red light up
the pov on his screen switches to the back of a van the doors open and his new unit charges out past other replacement soldiers still in charging bays
colonel brandon moving on touches his earphone
yeah ill be right over
he claps a captain on the shoulder as he moves out
keep an eye on bravo company
we will kick some ass sir
hangars boxy buildings humvees soldiers marching in formation
brandon walks with greer and peters
the united states has the largest surrogate army in
why on earth would the defense department want to develop a weapon that could wipe out our own troops
so no such thing exists
if it did id know about it
those soldiers we saw
a bit impatient we routinely remove motherboards and optics for analysis
now if youll excuse me were in the middle of a peacekeeping operation
theyve reached their car
brandon turns on his heel and heads back for a hangar
greer and peters look after him for a moment
think hes telling the truth
not when his lips are moving
greer shakes his head as they both get in the car
with brandon out of earshot of the feds he speaks into a small earpiece
bill we may have a problem
is it possible one of our ods is loose
canters image on a computer screen
its his surrogate face seated at his desk
this is a video phone connection
tell me have you made any progress whatsoever
reverse angle greer and peters sit before the screen
sir we are not at liberty to comment on an ongoing investigation
dont blow me off like im some goddamn reporter
i have resources of my own do i have to do your jobs for you
greer bites back his anger rises and moves away from the screen before he says something hell regret
he sits at another terminal returns to work
peters takes his place attempting to sound reassuring
were exploring every avenue dr
canter i promise you that were doing everything we can
close on greers terminal an inset of the image of the assassins face no helmet on its much clearer than the one we saw before this being the bouncers perspective
at the door of the club
we hear canter and peters continue in bg
what are you doing
i understand youre grieving im a target for assassination
i assume youre at least aware of that
with peters she looks briefly over her shoulder at greer with a help get me out of this expression
he remains focussed on the image of the assassin she turns back to canter on the screen maintaining her placating tone
i appreciate your concern and frustration obviously we all want immediate results but ive heard enough of your condescending pap
the people who did this are going to be punished
canter disconnects his angry face vanishes
peters rises and moves quickly toward greer
you handled that well
points at screen whered you get this
the freak who was working the door at the club
got a look at our perp dead on
on screen the assassins features highlight the words reverse angle greer types peters watches
try narrowing the search for dread affiliation
on screen a digital rapsheet the name jack strickland
a rotating d mugshot of strickland covering all the angles of his face
eighty seven percent match
close enough for government work
greer and peters quickly scan the mans rapsheet
jack strickland one of the prophets groupies
torched a surrogate display at a department store and they let him off
no known address
not a problem
greer and peters walk along a windowless underground hallway reach a security scanner
ever come down here
its like being inside gods head
the door unlocks and they enter
greer and peters go down metal stairs into a sprawling high tech surveillance center
computer workstations are arranged radially at the hub is a central command station with large screens facing in all directions
greer and peters move toward the center
at first we see just the head and shoulders of scattered figures staring at the monitor screens
on screens these are pov shots from thousands of surrogates the feds can have a direct surveillance feed from any surrogates eyes
we glimpse pov shots of driving drinking in a bar intimate conversations watching an old movie a sex partners face
the figures before the screens are watcher drones specialized surrogates a head and shoulders mounted on a wheeled contraption attached to tracks
this enables them to move and stop at any monitor quickly surveilling dozens of surrogates
males and females but all have the same faces
peters stares in wonder at this voyeurs paradise
greer grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a watcher tracks past
the watcher ignores them intent on work
they mount stairs into the raised hub that overlooks the work floor
an extremely corpulent human being bobby sanders sits on a reinforced rolling chair which he keeps in almost constant motion eying the dozen screens up here at once
on screens povs of actual criminal activity frantic running across a park a burglary in a darkened jewelry store packets of drugs changing hands
bobby eats candy guzzles soda waves them off for a moment speaking rapid fire into his headset
burglary in progress charlie romeo sierra need a warrant to shut him down
bobby gets a message from his headset kicks his rolling chair across the room to a special terminal
this terminal displays surrie serial numbers
as bobby types the selections narrow until only one is on the screen c r s
he can cut off operators from here
ssh dont tell anyone
its a gray area legally
peters isnt comfortable with this
relax were the good guys
on the burglary screen the pov image tumbles to the ground freezes there and turns to static
greer nods impressed
bobby eats an entire candy bar in one bite
youre not a surrogate are you
bobby wheels closer
with his mouth full no maam youre looking at the genuine article
he extends a greasy hand which she shakes lightly
theyve been trying to puppet bobby for years points at his head aint built the machine yet that can handle this baby
recognition search caught your dreaddie screen
they move to a screen numbered bobby taps a control
on screen slo mo a city street jack strickland a moving pedestrians pov
stricklands leaning on his bike helmet off talking on a cellphone free hand shoved in his pocket
the image freezes
the bikes license plate highlights along with stricklands face
greer peers at the time stamp
ten minutes ago
baltimore corner of eastern and decker
got a feeling hes headed for the reservation
stay here keep tabs on him
what are you doing
on the move getting a chopper
peters takes this in calls after him you need to get approval
greer makes a jerking off motion and is gone
bobby lets out a belch and winks at peters
with strickland finishing his cell call
maybe im not done with the o
maybe youre not gonna get it back at all
guy could have a lot of fun with your little toy
oh you can do better than that
ill be in touch
he tosses the cellphone in a trashcan pulls on his helmet starts the bike and peels out
aerial shot camera tracking over the chesapeake bay and into the city late afternoon
a small black chopper with doorless openings on either side enters frame
greer is beside a pilot a handsome hispanic surrie named lopez
greer shouts over the blade roar were close
lopez nods hits a couple of switches
the loud throb becomes a barely audible whirr
we hear peters voice over the radio got a hit on the bike half a mile from the rez check your screen
on the chopper dash a gps display of the nearby neighborhood a blinking dot a short distance away
baltimore pds sending back up
you cant fly over dread territory you know
we dont greer clicks off the radio turns to lopez
ignore her lopez
get us as close as you can
lopez grins and pushes the stick hard the chopper banks and swoops almost silently
bobby glances over at peters as she monitors a gps screen and various inset video feeds
he continues to work as he flirts with her
you really look like your surrie
peters throws him a glare turns back to her work
dont be so touchy
im engaged to b down there
he points to one of the many identical female drones buzzing along the tracks
strickland moves briskly on his bike
he glances in his mirror and sees a couple of squad cars catching up with him
he hits the throttle
another cop car roars around the corner ahead of him squawks the siren
strickland changes direction veers into a narrow alley
lopez and greer are directly overhead watching strickland maneuver his bike quickly into the alley
the alley is a dead end a fence blocking the exit
strickland skids the bike into a crashing stop knocking over piles of garbage
a squad car barely clears the walls on either side pursuing
it stops at a narrowing space cops squeeze out either door aiming guns
strickland stumbles away from his bike into an alcove
the cops approach guns ready
strickland yanks off his helmet pulls his ominous device from his pocket
without poking his head out he aims it in the cops direction
he presses a button
a row of red diodes glow on the device as he sweeps it across the alley but it emits no projectiles and makes no sound
cop is closer his glass eyes shatter
cop drops his weapon staggers backward and falls clutching his head
greer has seen this horrified
jesus what is that
strickland is on the run again scaling the fence
he hasnt spotted the chopper
greer looks in the direction hes heading a huge chain link fence topped with barbed wire stretching across the whole city just a hundred yards away
portraits of the prophet the man we heard on the radio long haired and bearded adorn the fence
theres a gate with two guards checking those entering one or two people are waiting
he gets through the gate we cant touch him
greer readies a rifle with a scope loads a tranquilizer dart into the chamber
lopez maneuvers to give greer an angle out the choppers side
strickland looks up to see greer taking aim from the silent chopper
he leaps for cover behind a dumpster as greer fires a dart which ricochets off the dumpster
strickland scrambles around a corner
lopez turns the bird forward to pursue as greer reloads
they round the corner
no sign of strickland on the pavement
greer looks to his left beyond the pilot strickland has scaled a fire escape aiming the device right at lopez
greer sees whats about to happen pull up lopez pull up
lopez shoots the bird upwards but strickland raises the device to track lopez and hits the button we see the red diodes glow and lopez is hit his eyes fragment
shards of glass fly
greer is close enough to get a partial hit crouches in agony
sfx an awful screaming noise inside his head screaming noise continues as real greer spasms in pain in his stim chair in the sensory projectors red light
the chopper pilotless and out of control heads over the chain link fence
beyond are vacant lots with tents and makeshift hovels small buildings
greer regains his senses just in time to see the chopper careening down toward the dread encampment
the chopper crashes on its skids at an angle amidst lean tos and tents greer is thrown out his side with the impact
comes right at him and chops off his left arm at the elbow burning fuel spreads and ignites his back
lucky thing hes a surrogate
less fortunate dreads run screaming we hear the cries of wounded
greer lies in the dirt in flames motionless
then his eyes blink and move taking in the sight of strickland illuminated by the fire horrified at the carnage
hes starting to move away from the wreck
with supreme effort greer gets to his feet still partly in flames
his stump of an arm sparks and leaks hydraulic fluid
he reacts at the sight of a corpse on the ground an older man crushed by a hunk of debris from the chopper
but its not the corpse that interests him his dart rifle lies nearby thrown from the chopper during the crash
greer grabs it in his right hand
he pushes past dreads who move to help their injured fellows panic in the fire lit no mans land
he spots strickland running into the distance
greer supports the rifle with the stump of his missing arm and fires strickland is hit in the back the force of the shot knocks him off his feet
greer strides over to strickland seemingly oblivious to the crowd of dreads collecting around him pointing at him angrily
strickland twitches and moans partly paralyzed
greer stands over him lets the rifle dangle
strickland has some trouble speaking
oh my g god why
what do you people want from me
youre a killer they were just surries
you really dont know
a double barreled shotgun blast throws greer backward away from strickland
the dart rifle flies from his grasp
a heavyset female dread wields the sawed off shotgun
she gets between greer and strickland who manages to crawl away vanishing behind other dreads who are gathering around greer
greer tries to get up a hole has been blown in his chest exposing sparking wires and electronics spraying green coolant
hes lost control of his legs which crumple beneath him he falls to his knees
hes surrounded now by angry disenfranchised dreads all of whom regard him with hatred
the female dread ejects the used cartridges and reloads the shotgun
greer stares at her coldly
im a federal agent youre an abomination
the woman pumps the shotgun again points it a greers head
just as it goes off greer lurches out of his chair yanking the sensory projector off his head the red light switches to white
he stumbles out of the room into the hall
greer bangs on the door to maggies bedroom rattles the knob
a red glow from beneath her door
hes clearly in pain clutches his temples
blood begins to gush from his nose
greer slides down against the door unable to stand
the door rattles we hear greer calling please i need your help
open the door
camera moves through the red lit room to show the wires of a sensory projector a partial view of maggies head
maggie her surrogate in a tailored business suit enters the apartment with bridget another gorgeous high fashion surrie in party clothes
were talking turquoise
i wouldnt carry a purse that color much less a whole new skin
brb i just gotta change
little black dress or red bustier
maggie almost trips over greer unconscious on the floor
oh my god
start on a mailbox with the name peters as carlights catch it
as the car turns up the dirt road in this rural area in the rockies it flips its lights off
a pleasant rustic home
jennifer peters somewhat less perfect than her surrie disconnects from her sensory projector
she looks concerned very tired
she rises from her stim chair and moves into a kitchen
pull back were watching her through a window with a very large and powerful looking stalker later peters in bed fast asleep
a shadow crosses her doorway but moves on
at her sensory projector the stalker is scanning through her hard drives memory
on screen fast forwarding rapidly through peters pov we see greer in the alley with the fallen surries
the stalker face illuminated by the screens glow looks expressionlessly toward peters bedroom then back to the images
his eyes have a silvery inhuman sheen
strickland sleeps fitfully in this gloomy dingy space
he comes to startles at the sight a man sitting at the foot of his bed
hes very tall imposing bearded dressed in black this is the prophet
strickland is cowed this isnt a man you get a lot of face time with
youve been keeping secrets jack
two large men now move into view flanking the prophet
call them bud and miller
theyre scruffy bearded not surries
no prophet i this is unfair to your brother humans
strickland tries to get out of bed bud pushes him down
please i havent done anything
i know what youve done
what i dont know is who hired you to betray us
i want a name
i i swear to god i dont know jack
he never said his name we talked on disposable cellphones ive never even seen his face
i couldnt tell you who he was if my life depended it
on the prophets disappointed even sad expression
close on a medical monitor high tech imaging of a human move down to find greer the real one asleep
an iv bleeping monitors
uneaten lunch on a tray
maggie her surrogate that is sits in a chair beside the bed her hand resting on greers
he stirs she pulls her hand back returns to her fashion magazine
a tv plays above his bed greer blinks squints at this
on tv a small boy climbs a very tall tree above a suburban sidewalk pleasant music
suddenly a branch breaks the boy tumbles with a cry
greer winces distastefully
on tv now we see the boy again perfectly fine standing beside his mother
she strokes his head with a smile
they look down at his broken surrogate on the ground beside the fallen branch
imagine a world where children are safe
greer watching the screen addresses maggie
would you do that
not looking up hm
get a surrogate for our kid
our hypothetical kid
theyre getting cheaper all the time
a world where every child is secure and fulfilled
on tv a little girl swings back and forth a blissed out smile on her face
free of pain fear and anxiety
in slo mo she releases at the top of the swings arc and flies into the air
that world can be real
thanks to vsi
our software for growing minds screens out destructive negative feelings
the little girl lands hard but gets up laughing
making every childhood a happy one
greer shakes his head
it just seems weird to me
our grandparents thought seatbelts were weird
she nods toward the image of a smiling child on tv
not like its an issue
on tv the vsi logo
do what you want
be what you want
at the door peters hovers making up her mind to enter
she steps into the room
greer blinks at her
its me peters dont you recognize me
almost to himself i thought you mightve been telling another joke
peters seems relieved
maggie waits for an introduction but greer seems withdrawn shy peters has never seen his physical body
im maggie toms wife
a pleasure to meet you
a glance at greer his new partner
to greer brightly you should have mentioned her
i need to get going anyway ill let you two talk business
im a beauty engineer
drop by the shop sometime ill give you a free consultation
as maggie leaves i think
you look just like your unit
except older and fatter
sorry if i seem a little out of it
youve been through a lot
theyre calling it a concussion felt like my head was going to explode
with a brisk rap on the doorframe stone enters
how ya feeling greer
greer shrinks back in his bed
you tell me
stone sighs looking him over
quietly the pilot
they found him dead in his stim chair
same with one of the baltimore cops others in a coma
four dreads were killed on the ground half a dozen wounded
greer closes his eyes in misery
its not your fault
you were doing your job
stone pulls up maggies chair sits as he speaks
i would have to disagree
you requisitioned that chopper without authorization
you violated our treaty with the dreads were expecting retaliation
those poor cops had no idea what they were up none of us did
we still dont know
i dont think strickland even knew he thought he was just taking down the abominations
im sorry greer
but youre suspended pending further action
greer nods slowly knew this was coming
peters takes a step back looking on carefully
greer takes his laptop computer off the bedside table opens it so that stone can see it
ive been going through my memory files of the crash
ever seen anything like this before
on screen a magnified close up of the device in stricklands hand as he points it upward at the helicopter
its the murder weapon
greer nods stone studies the laptop sets his jaw
its more than that
it means nobody is safe
the dreads want us all to be like them living in fear no better than animals
and weve only just freed ourselves begun to explore our true potential
we need to get this guy
our way of life will be protected whatever it takes
an attractive surrie nurse enters the room
good news mr
the doctors say you can go home today
nervous thrown they said the end of the week insurance you know
she smiles putting his clothing by the bed and disconnecting him from the iv and monitors
just take some time to heal
what about my surrogate
hasnt been recovered
im afraid we cant supply you with a new one until this matter is resolved
peters make sure he gets home in one piece
peters nods looking at greer sympathetically
greer sinks back into his pillow anxious
on medical monitor the image of greers brain shuts off with a blip
peters strides from the doors greer follows dressed in casual clothes
then slows his pace breathing hard
greers pov cars zipping past on the street rushing pedestrians paramedics pushing a body past on a gurney
from greers now human perspective surrogates seem artificial appearance too perfect eyes empty of souls
this should be reeling vertiginous
peters pauses seeing greer is having a panic attack
he has trouble speaking
i havent been out without a surrogate in a long time
nothings gonna happen
they wanted to give me something for the anxiety
they call it corporeaphobia
just take my arm
he shakes his head takes a deep breath and moves out onto the sidewalk
peters stays close
greers pov surrie pedestrians moving quickly seeming to come right
one bumps into him greer staggers the surrie moves on as if he hasnt even noticed
greer moves toward the curb to get away from them stumbles peters has to pull him out of car traffic a horn honks
hes sweating terrified
we need to get you a replacement
she takes his arm forcibly and moves him away
a low end place bodies displayed in the windows in their charging bays signs reading hurry a surry
giant peters guides greer inside
coffin sized boxes sensory projectors and stim chairs stacked willy nilly
bright lights video screens running promos
a slick blond aryan salesman approaches with a grin
he sizes greer up instantly recognizing signs of withdrawal
he speaks with an incongruous asian oh you poor guy out in just your skin can be scary
no worries i got perfect surrie for you
he leads them deeper into the store
he wears a clip on id badge with the smiling face of a dark haired asian
racks of attractive male and female bodies in skimpy bathing suits differing heights and degrees of muscle
greer looks these over
i like to see my own face when i look in the mirror
fine you no buy off the rack we customize on premise less than one hour
as they move on we glimpse celebrity look alikes on the rack marilyn monroe and elvis presley
later on computer screen a d rendering of greers face rotates shows expressions smiles frowns and speaks
a voice print runs below
testing one two three
the salesman works the computer greer lies in an uncomfortable stim chair attached to a sensory projector red goggles over his eyes and a camera pointed at his face
he seems uneasy
peters looks on from nearby
no worries we make you good deal no payment til next year
just try one on for size
you like we lock in your neural code plastiform your face you good to go
the salesman hits a couple of switches slips a small sleeve over greers finger its wired to the projector
take a whirl
greer touches his fingers together his body instantly goes limp and a pale hairless surrie template in a speedo steps out of a charging bay
its head is unfinished a mechanical version of a skinless face
around its neck is a sign that reads off
the voice is a tinny far away sounding version of greers
suddenly off twitches and stumbles bumping into a display
try touching your nose
off pokes himself in the eye
takes some time to break in
base model come with vision hearing other senses optional
the surrie freezes in its tracks
and slowly topples over as greer pulls of the projector headpiece
the salesman sets to righting it greer heads for the exit
wait wait wait
i throw in super sex software package fifty percent off
we can try a department store if moneys a problem i can front no
im a grown man for chrissake i should be able to walk down the street without completely freaking out
a bartender puts a soda water and a glass of scotch on the bar in front of peters and the shaky greer
well you made it a block
lifts his glass heres to self medication
he takes a sip and spits it out
the bartender turns
are you all right sir
what is this
the bartender gives him a once over
we dont get a lot of thats synthohol
just a cpu inhibition blocker in a non corrosive solution
as the bartender speaks greer looks around the dark bar in the back every couple is gazing into each others eyes clearly hooking up
greer continues to watch the other patrons
you have any real booze
no liquor license
the bartender shrugs and moves off
peters sips her soda water amused
come here often stranger
you know they really dont look human
you cant tell when youre inside them but
greer turns to peters studies her like the others
i dont like the way youre looking at me
but im not really looking at you
yeah yeah this is just a lump of aluminum and polystyrene
tell you what next time youre in colorado look me up for real
we can have a beer together
id like that
peters blinks greer has suddenly gotten sincere on her
he looks away
you know when we started working together i thought you were kind of a stiff
new job i was defensive
its more than that
or maybe i am
greers embarrassed shrugs it off
he puts down a bill and rises
you probably oughta head back to the office
i can get you home
ill be ok
he moves toward the door she tags along
im thinking you should double check stricklands records go back to the hard copies
see if you can find out why they dropped charges
you seem better already
its like riding a bike
subway greer and peters walk he spots a sign for the changes direction to head for the escalator
where you going
its a lovely day
thought id take a trip to east baltimore
he pauses at the top a hit of vertigo
was it always this steep
jesus tom the rez
since im stuck in my skin i oughta take advantage of it
hell as long as strickland has that device im safer this way
he clutches the handrail starts moving down
he nods and waves as he disappears down the escalator
peters enters this large lobby bustling with other agents and officials
she moves toward a desk jockey security scanners
she reacts to the sound of screams and screeching tires from outside the building
peters looks toward a large window to the street and immediately dives for cover as a battered suv spray painted with anti surrogate graffiti smashes through the plate glass
surrie pedestrians are plastered across the grill and embedded in the windshield
the suv slams into a few surries in the lobby sends them flying or runs over them
it spins sideways into a wall with the fbi seal overhead
the driver leaps out armed with a machine gun
hes clearly a dread angry and deranged
he starts shooting at anything that moves
peters crouches for cover as bullets shatter glass and smash marble around her
an army of agents burst from an elevator in kevlar and riot helmets armed with automatic rifles
they instantly bring the dread down in a barrage of gunfire
the agents move to the dreads body hes very dead pouring blood from dozens of bullet wounds
one speaks into his headset secure
any biologicals here
a small flat panel tv in the back of the cab plays news of the attack on the fbi building
piles of surries removed on carts one body on a stretcher
twenty seven surrogates irreparably damaged
only one dead the attacker himself
his motive is unclear at this point but may be a response to the recent incident at the baltimore human reservation
greer in the back seat takes in this news grimly
the cabbie has been glancing at his own monitor in front
sure you dont wanna change your mind
greer emerges from a taxi near the same gate we saw earlier
greer wobbles steadies himself against the car as he pays the cabbie a drone surrogate built into the seat
you ok man
just a little carsick
the taxi pulls away greer heads for the gate
at the gate metal signs read humans only no surrogates
greer goes through a big
old fashioned present day metal detector the light flashes green
a dread guard waves him past
greer gestures toward one of the many images of the prophet to be found in the rez
where would i find the the what do you call it the temple
ten blocks that way left on bloomfield
eyes the grim area catch a lotta surries tryin to sneak in do ya
as greer crosses the rubble strewn no mans land he pauses sickened as he sees the burned out helicopter hulk now sprayed with grafitti
pigs die etc
and just beyond this whats left of greers surrie half the head blown off with fried electronics hanging out
its been lashed to a makeshift crucifix made from the bent chopper blades
the clothing is shredded the remains spray painted
greer wary of being recognized continues on
greer walks through a poor but surprisingly pleasant neighborhood rowhouses gardens
very few cars
dreads look like ordinary working class folks
a barbecue a group of residents laughing and drinking
greer inhales the smoke as he passes smiles to himself
a couple of friendly dogs trot curiously after him for a moment then return to the barbecue
greer not paying attention brushes past an elderly male pedestrian
smiles and nods no problem
a playground a short distance on
lots of kids shrieking and running
greer pauses here taking this in
these are the first children weve seen outside of a tv ad
a cloud of diesel smoke from a decrepit bus
greer chokes on this but doesnt seem displeased
his body language has become more relaxed as he gets further into the rez getting his land legs back
a cavernous convention center thousands of folding chairs face a raised pulpit at one end
behind this is a supergraphic of the prophet hands raised in benediction
greer enters takes this in
he spots a cleaning lady an older woman sweeping up amidst the rows nearby
you wouldnt happen to know a jack strickland
im told he worked here off and on
youre here for the service
its in the park
greer moves down a path in this expanse of greenery
he comes to an open lawn with a fairly large crowd gathered illuminated by a flaming torch
the prophet is speaking
he stands before a platform atop wooden scaffolding firewood piled below
a formidable ring of bodyguards stands between him and the gathered throng of dreads
serving faithfully beside us in the cause of humanity
i had the privilege of hearing his confession shortly before his death
greer has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a look at the body atop the funeral bier
the corpse atop the bier is that of jack strickland eyes closed hands folded
and i know he would have rejoiced in the day of resurrection the day for which we are all preparing the day i promise you is close at hand
so saying the prophet lifts the torch and touches it to the base of the pyre which erupts in flame
close on strickland as the flames lick up around him
later the bier consumed in fire the mourners dispersing
the prophet is moving away handlers surrounding him
greer tags along but one of the prophets goons bud gets in his face
who are you
what happened to jack strickland
he slipped and fell
friend of yours
greer starts to move around him bud gets in his way
id like a word with the prophet
you and everyone else
miller and adams another goon now join them
strickland was carrying a weapon
if it isnt recovered there could be serious consequences for all of you
in bg the prophet and handlers head toward a large rv
you some kinda cop
wheres your puppet
greer shakes his head raises his hands
frisk me if you want
no thats ok
with that he throws a sucker punch to the gut
greer doubles over
he seems amazed at the sensation the pain
but he recovers throws a wild punch at miller an d misses by a foot
violence for greer in human form should have a very different painfully visceral feel unlike when he was a surrogate
adams cracks greer across the back of his head
greer falls to the ground
bud kicks him once
greer chokes and groans in pain
hurts doesnt it
its a bitch being real
greer lets out a primal cry and lunges at miller driving his head into the mans torso knocking the wind out of him before the other two can pull greer
i think he likes it
catching his breath so give him some more
outnumbered three to one greer takes a beating continues to throw mostly ineffective punches that just cause the men to redouble their efforts
finally hes limp in their arms
miller plucks greers wallet and badge from his pockets examines them
as he does so greer spits blood on the mans face
miller seems about to whomp him again but stops himself
not gonna give you the satisfaction
to bud and adams get him out of here
miller tosses greers id at him then moves toward the rv leaving greer gasping in the clutches of bud and adams lit by the flames from the funeral pyre
a spartan interior
the prophet stands with a couple of handlers
some fed named greer he wanted to talk to the prophet
about that turkey shoot in dc
didnt come up
said they wanted stricklands weapon
well maybe ill just have to bring it to their doorstep
in the prophets hand we now see the mysterious device with which strickland killed his targets
greer is half dragged half carried back the way he came flanked by bud and adams
greer sucks on his bleeding lip works his tongue around in his mouth
he touches parts of his bruised body carefully
guy like you oughtnt be out in just your skin
im starting to see your point
at the gate greer leaves trying to muster as much dignity as he can
the dread guard calls sarcastically after him
come again real soon
greer trudges along the seedy streets
he looks a mess torn clothing bloodstains bruises
suddenly hes shoved from behind falls to the pavement
the assailant is a freak surrie extra arms wheels where his feet should be
a moment later greer is surrounded by three rich freaky
theyve customized their surries in completely bizarre ways in addition to the usual tattoos and piercings
besides wheels theres a hairless teen with six eyes scattered around his head
a girl has spikes sticking out of her skull and flesh and reptile skin
watch where youre going meat
what are you doin off the rez
she bumps against greer as he picks himself up he shrinks from the spikes
she shoots a small blast of flame from her nostrils then giggles
im not a dread
then you oughta return that surrie looks like shit
wheels comes at greer again greer moves and trips him but he just lands on an extra arm and rights himself
hey it wants to play
eyes lowers his head and moves to butt him
greer dodges it looks like a bullfight
they turn hearing a screech of tires
a limousine has pulled up
a year old boy climbs from the back and approaches
would you like a ride
the kids voice sounds like a childs but with mature cadences to his speech
check out richie rich
the driver of the limo steps out its armando from canters lobby
he lets his jacket fall open revealing a holstered sidearm
we got a problem here
the freaks retreat with dirty looks
the boy moves back toward the limo
re the freaks so many unforeseen consequences to the surrogate revolution
i suppose i should apologize
who are you
as greer climbs in the boy hands him back his own business card the one greer left with canter
you left this on my desk
armando has gotten behind the wheel starts moving
greer looks at the boy amazed
its not safe for me to use my usual surrogates
this is one of vsis
not that the market will be that strong the birthrate being what it is
youre having me followed
you know how important this investigation is to me
the man who killed your son is dead
boy canter absorbs this
i want you to tell me everything
i suppose you deserve that
the limo drives along the potomac near the city
greer holds ice to his swollen face
this strickland character
i dont believe he could have been acting on his own
you stand for everything the humanists hate then why would his own people murder him
hed outlived his usefulness
with me all over his ass he was becoming a security risk to kill someone remotely it would take a virus presumably one that could get past every firewall protecting
a surries circuitry then once in the cpu override all the fail safes and cause catastrophic brain damage
were talking about an technology dont you think
the dreads didnt come up with it they dont even like to use cellphones
maybe weve got our heads up our own ass maybe thats exactly where you should be looking
greer takes a second to absorb this
so now youre the victim of a government conspiracy
i think this is your stop
the limo stops a light rain now falling
greer gets out and closes the door the rear window rolls down
somebody hired strickland
youll know who that is when you trace the weapon
you really dont need to do my job for me
boy canter takes in greers disheveled state
yes i can see youve got things under control
the limo pulls away
greer pauses looks up at the sky letting the rain wash over his face
an electrical arc jumps from a glass tube to a male wider the guy taking the jolt is a lanky male model named brian
his face goes slack
maggie and bridget are squeezed together on the couch in greers apartment with brian and a french hunk named andre who speaks with a slight accent
everyone is pretty high
andre closes one eye then the other pupils turned inward
think my nose is too big
im going to have it replaced
while youre at it i am so sick of twelve inch dicks
on the coffee table before them sits a small jacker like the one we saw in the underground club
the foursome pass a single electrical tube around attached by a cord to the device
andre and bridget have clearly coupled up brian touches maggies leg casually from time to time
what do you want were men
coming out of it why is that
why do we all have to be men and women
id rather be i dunno a lion
or an eagle
or a cloud
she lifts the hair from the nape of her neck moves the glass tube there
brian holds her close
the electrical arc maggie gasps with pleasure transported
a moment later andre notices that greer has entered quietly during the above staring at the foursome
dont look now
some homeless meatbag just wandered in
maggie has blanked out for the moment
thats maggies husband
she gives him a little wave
greer moves past them toward the kitchen and disappears
maggie comes out of her trance blinks and sighs
she hurries after him
brian shrugs grabs the tube and starts to unzip his pants greer has removed an old yellowed first aid kit from under the sink during the scene he cleans up
cuts opens his shirt to check his bruised ribs etc
what happened to you
i thought you were spending another night in the hospital
you know i dont like you jacking in the house
he finds an untouched dusty bottle of scotch sniffs it and pours a drink
maggie looks him over
somebody beat you up
how could you go out like that
as maggie speaks she moves to his side touching his injuries gently truly concerned
greer flinches back
what were you thinking tom
couldve been killed
just finding out how the other half lives
greer takes a long drink gestures toward the living room
so whats his name
oh please grow up
i suppose it doesnt matter
since as you keep telling me it doesnt mean anything
greer pours another drink
i dont expect you to understand this
but once in a while i like to be around people who dont hate being alive
is that what they are out there
she shakes her head and returns to the living room
maggie bridget brian and andre are still partying in fact bridget and andre are starting to make out when greer re enters in a raincoat hes a little tipsy
the bottle pokes out of a pocket
you really a g man
greer pauses stares at the man
can i ask you something
is it true you guys are tapping into our surries
watching everything we do twenty four seven
of course not
greer starts to move across the room again heading for the door
brian smirks speaks quietly thinking only the others will hear
as he touches maggies leg wouldnt want him spying on us tonight
greer spins near the door and without breaking stride returns to the couch
brian turns starts to rise
greer grabs the man and hurls him backwards onto the glass coffee table which shatters
the other three back away
after a stunned moment brian starts laughing very hard obviously he hasnt felt a thing
tom the table
greer steps over the couch calmly and begins punching and kicking the surrie on the floor working off pent up rage
brian just keeps laughing
soon greers hands are cut and bleeding hes panting exhausted
maggie finally succeeds in pulling him away
brian sits up his face is dented the plastic skin stretched and torn
could we do it again
oh man your face
i was getting sick of it anyway
as brian picks bits of glass out of his plastic flesh andre suddenly realizes his jacker is smashed examines the pieces with a moan
guess the partys over
maggie follows greer to the door
they speak in hushed
what was the point of that
does everything have to have a point
greer takes a breath bows his head
i just want us to to connect again
to have a family to have a life
grabs her arms we cant do it through this wall of plastic
maggie pulls away his bloody hands have left marks on her blouse
im sorry too
but this is my life
she looks at him sadly and returns to her guests
after a beat greer heads out the door
greer walks in the rain through nearly empty streets toward the modern headquarters in washington
there are boards over the shattered windows in front
quiet at this hour
a desk jockey looks up as greer approaches careful to conceal the bottle
is that you greer
in the flesh
he takes in the damage to the lobby the police tape the attackers chalk silhouette
you missed all the excitement
saw it on tv
he passes the surrie scanner and holds his hand over a fingerprint machine which confirms his identity
a plexiglas door unlocks automatically
says here youre on suspension
just cleaning out my desk
yknow youre thinner on top
nice of you to notice
you remember where the rest rooms are
they mostly use em for storage
think the one on four still works
greer nods and continues in
dozens of surrogate agents are lined up against the wall in here in their foam charging bays
camera finds peters in their midst
her bay hums and she blinks becomes animated
she steps out of the bay
greer has his feet up on his desk the bottle beside him
there are cardboard boxes of documents nearby
peters enters greer looks up at her
got your message
hope i didnt wake you
after what happened here today i couldnt sleep
you tell anyone i was going out to the rez
canter for example
of course not
greer studies her a beat decides shes sincere
peters sits on his desk studies him
you look terrible
not half as bad as i feel
greer refills his coffee cup with scotch holds the bottle out to her questioningly
just pretend to get drunk with me
peters shakes her head with a smile
greer shrugs takes a long drink sighs and rubs his sore neck
feel like ive been asleep for years now i wake up an old man
rip van frigging winkle
peters moves behind him begins rubbing his shoulders a massage
what are you doing
you look like you need it
im not sure how kosher this is
its not me its not a woman touching you its just a machine
does feel good
better than a stim chair
he allows himself to enjoy it for a moment bows his head
you ever feel like its
the stuff that used to make the world make sense
that made us
i dont know morality love
yeah yeah they were probably saying that back in ancient rome
we always think technologys going to improve our lives but
a beat greer sits up and pulls away from her touch
he holds up a hand and lets it fall
this has become obsolete
someday soon well all just be brains in jars
i have a feeling people are going to come to their senses eventually
shaking his head you cant unring a bell
turns toward her thought you were the one all into the brave new world
peters is staring at her own plastic hand
she looks up at greer changes the subject
i found out about strickland
she gestures to the boxes of documents
all the chaos i was able to waltz right into the records department
the case files were removed but there was a paper trail from payroll
strickland was an informant
who was running him
wasnt in the paperwork
but he mustve been selling intel on the prophet
greer has risen moving restlessly around the room
so the prophet has him killed
and we have to assume he now has the power to kill anyone he wants
close on a photo of the device in stricklands hand
the image has been enlarged giving a pretty clear view of the weapon
whered you get this photo
greer sits opposite colonel brandon at the mans desk a flag and other military memorabilia on display
greer eyes the colonel knows somethings up
its from my memory
damn thing put me in the hospital
wish i could help
killed a couple of cops as well
we believe this weapon the one that doesnt exist is in the hands of the human coalition
brandon is finally losing his composure
if this is true
were going to have to do everything in our power to recover it
do you have any idea how serious this is
i was hoping youd tell me
brandon looks conflicted finally opens up
this is absolutely off the record
off greers nod its called an overload device or o
theyre brand new only a handful exist
but i checked ran every serial number all accounted for
not this one
maybe it never got to you guys in the first place
who makes them
its a darpa design subcontracted to pierson defense
the idea was to create a non lethal weapon that could disable every surrie in the field
you beam a software virus straight to the cpu
the fail safes kick in and the operators are cut off
circuits all melt down in seconds youre left with a field full of scrap
you win the battle with one shot
let me guess
you found a way around the fail safes
just a few lines of code the connection stays open
we tried it on soldier volunteers
the virus caused every neuron to fire at the same time
melted their brains
so its an assassination tool
at the flick of a switch
close on a womans face being carefully peeled off the mechanical underpinnings
funky music plays
wider bridget leans over the body putting the old face aside
a row of exotic new faces on a rack nearby
bridget begins manipulating the underlying musculature changing cheekbones etc using delicate tools
she wanted blue eyes the size of golf balls bee sting lips and a tiny ski jump nose
boop oop a doop
nearby maggie works on a brown skinned hand
she stares through a mounted magnifying loupe embedding tiny jewels in the skin of the fingers
she uses tweezers and a tiny blowtorch
after a moment we realize the hand has been disconnected from the body mounted on a brace
you talked her down i hope
yes thank god were doing a modified audrey hepburn
maggie glances over at bridgets work admiringly
id love you to raise my cheekbones a half inch but tom would go ballistic
the door chimes bridget looks up
speaking of the ball and chain
as greer approaches a few of the beauty engineers glance up then return to their business
this place is a cross between a beauticians and an auto body repair shop
surries in chairs that maneuver into all kinds of positions
not only are they having nails and hair done but legs lengthened breasts enlarged etc
operators check in their bodies and leave them there for modifications
i didnt hear you come home last night
id really like to sit down and talk with you
i can take a break no maggie face to face
the two of us for real
bridget is getting uncomfortable
these smile muscles need to set
she exits with a look at maggie
maggie stops working and turns to greer speaks passionately
tom dont you get it
that body in our apartment the one you call real it isnt me
im right here
honey if youre worried about the way you look it doesnt matter it never did exactly
what matters is who i choose to be
as the conversation gets more heated co workers pointedly turn away while eavesdropping
i married a person youre choosing to be a thing
and im so sick of being surrounded by things young beautiful things
well thats your problem isnt it
if you can be young and beautiful and feel good all the time why would anyone choose anything else
because its bullshit
because were human like it or not
you sound like a dread
maggie turns back to what she was doing
greer has trouble swallowing his anger
i may just have to kick down your bedroom door
not looking up id never forgive you
then maybe i should just move out
do what you want
thats a commercial
greer turns and exits
maggie glances after him with a mixture of anger and regret then returns to her work
establish a dreary place near the highway
a red glow from a number of windows
find a window illuminated by white light
we see greer within
a bland room a low rent chain
greer unzips a suitcase opens it
on the top is a wedding photo of maggie and greer much younger
he places this on the bedside table moves for the bathroom
greer in a towel now having finished a shower
he wipes steam off the mirror and takes a hard look at himself his worn face and battered very human body
on a computer screen american flags the logo for pierson defense
a corporate website
push close in tiny letters at the bottom of the screen a division of virtual self industries
greer takes this in
hes at his computer first thing in the morning with a cup of take out coffee
peters is going through the box of documents we saw earlier
when she glances toward him he clears the screen
what you working on
just checking e mail
i think you hide things from me
dont be ridiculous
takes a sip winces this stuff is awful
hescalling up a new file on screen the name lionel canter followed by the words classified scan required
a moment later we see greers image a light flickers from the webcam on the monitor frame
then the words unauthorized user
greer sits back frustrated
what does aos stand for
i keep coming across it on these invoices
advance on salary
greer thinks a moment of revelation
he moves to look over peters shoulder
what do you suppose vsi has against canter
hes one of them
course since he owns the patents on surrogate technology they must have to pay him billions
shakes his head he dies they still have to pay his estate
wait a minute
you think vsi hired strickland to kill canter
there was a middleman
as he moves for the door he points at her paperwork
to authorize informant payments agent in charge has to initial
as he exits peters looks back down at the documents
the scrawled initials aos on an invoice
close on a nameplate outside a door the words andrew
greer approaches the open door moving through a hubbub of agents working in open cubicles
agent nakata sits at a desk by stones door
thought you were on leave
just cleaning out my desk
a moment later stone pokes his head out
youve been cleaning out your desk for two days
you should be home recuperating
just about done sir
greer starts to move away turns back
i almost forgot
victor welch sends his regards
stone shakes his head feigning incomprehension im sorry
guy at vsi
you looking forward to moving to the private sector
nakata is listening curiously
stone angrily gestures for greer to come into his office he doesnt want to have this conversation in public
greer keeps speaking as he heads inside
will you finish out the year
were sure gonna miss you around here
stone slams the door
greer keeps speaking calmly as if there were no tension in the air
i know its hard to resist better hours better pay welch told you about this
beat grins no
i was just fishing
youve suffered brain damage greer
lets hope it isnt permanent
all surveillance on the prophet goes through this office
jack strickland was one of your stoolies
why the hell didnt you say something
stone just stares at him narrowing his eyes
two cops died
you knew he had the i have no idea what youre talking because you gave it to him
vsi makes them they hand one to you and you chose the trigger man
your own little black op
if anyone looks they blame the dreads
but strickland didnt follow the plan did he
he didnt give you back the
like he was supposed to
are you done with this paranoid fantasy
what i cant figure out is why
why kill canter
stone stares at greer angry and defiant
he moves to his desk types into his computer
greer approaches slowly
im issuing orders for your detention
your mind isnt right youve become a threat to national security
greer slips a letter opener off of stones desk as he nears
his hand is shaking
suddenly stone yanks open a drawer and lunges for a gun
but before he can bring it to bear greer stabs him in the back of the head skewering stones cpu
stone freezes hunched over his desk gun in hand
greer just stares at what hes done for a moment amazed
then he waves a hand in front of stones open eyes makes sure hes out and carefully pries off a plate and removes stones motherboard places it on the desk
greer pulls the gun out of stones hand rolls him back in front of his desk propped up to face the computer
greer crouches behind him operating the keyboard by reaching around his boss body
on computer greer types in a request for a file on lionel canter
the words classified identity scan required appear
greer pushes the chair a bit closer to the computer ducking down lifts stones head by the hair
the monitor momentarily displays stones face
a light goes on in the corner of the frame scanning stone
authorized user appears
greer peeks up again continuing his work
on screen a headshot of canter reams of classified info
greer hits print
greer emerges a stack of papers in his hand
he gives a nod to nakata who nods back as he answers his ringing phone
before he can even say a word this is stone
nakata looks toward the office starting to rise
what do you need sir
the real stone a good deal heavier than his surrogate is sitting in boxer shorts at the edge of his stim chair a phone in his hand
sonofabitch greer disabled my surrie stop him
greer takes a couple steps at a time
hes on his phone
just meet me in the garage leave the trunk open
as he rounds a corner he comes face to face with a pair of agents each carrying a handgun
they approach from below
tom we dont want to hurt you
greer nods and raises his hands resigned he still clutches the papers
as agent nears greer suddenly plants a foot in the mans chest sending him crashing into agent
both men topple down the stairs fire their guns wildly
greer has also lost his balance and dropped some papers which he has to scoop up as he claws for the
doorway and dashes through
peters waits near an idling sedan the trunk open
greer dives inside she slams it and gets behind the wheel
she peels out going up a few levels
at an exit gate an fbi guard looks inside
theyre looking for tom greer
you seen him
she shakes her head he presses a button to open the gate and waves her through
the fbi sedan drives down a curving forested road
peters drives greer in the passenger seat poring over the papers
ever hear of the human defense league
sure the extremist wing of the anti surrogate movement
according to this their number one supporter is lionel canter
the father of surrogacy
says hes funneled billions into their organization
not to mention direct support for the man who calls himself the prophet
canters bought him land lawyers
and enough weapons to start a war
the dreads emerge from tents and shacks at the sound of a nearby rumbling
angle through fence bulldozers tanks uniformed national guardsmen all surrogates with the same face are assembling on the perimeter of the dread reservation
they carry non lethal taser wands and rifles
an officer moves to the front carrying a walkie talkie
in response to a command he turns and signals to the troops behind him and the bulldozers start plowing down the fence
as guardsmen move past him the officer calls out
we all know what were looking for
remember these are biologicals do not fire unless absolutely necessary
paperwork spread on a table before peters
swiss accounts anonymous wire transfers unattributed testimony this isnt proof
wider greer lies in his clothes on the bed bone tired a flat screen tv plays silently
not enough for a courtroom
but vsi knew that if lionel canter suffered a mysterious brain hemmorhage the powers that be wouldnt be terribly upset
hes not some kind of monster you know
canters initial research was in prosthetics for amputees quadriplegics
people with degenerative diseases
maybe he feels his technologys been perverted
maybe it has
greer studies her with interest her tone is strangely passionate
i had no idea you were such a humanist
peters looks away then reacts to something on tv grabs a remote and turns up the volume
on tv screen hand held footage as national guard troops move across the dread reservation no mans land using taser wands to subdue resisting dreads frisking them and rifling through
possessions as they upend dwellings
units of the maryland national guard moved into the east baltimore human reservation this morning in a search for contraband weapons
greer knows what this is about
colonel brandon didnt waste any time
theyre looking for the
isnt that what you called it
what does it stand for again
she nods and turns nonchalantly back to the paperwork
as she does so greer cocks his head and studies her
protecting brands confidence he never told her what the device was called
so what do we do about stone
i call and tell him ill take early retirement with full pension benefits
in return for keeping his little secret
that isnt funny
im not laughing
i dont believe you they killed canters son a college kid his whole life ahead of him
dont we owe him something
shes genuinely upset
greer wont meet her eye
cant bring him back
they will come after canter again but youre just going to deposit your pension checks look the other way and let him die
looks at her maybe hes got it coming
i thought you were a cop
i thought you were a human being
peters marches out of there and slams the door on the way out
greer waits a few moments his mind racing then he moves for the door himself
greer moves from a desk with a pretty rental agent working at a small hand held computer
logos for global our nearest rental office is just outside denver the car and phone will be extra im only gonna be there a couple hours
she leads him toward a curtained booth one of many here
red glows emanate from a few
do you want to customize
she pulls back a curtain to reveal a stim chair and a
the prophet stands with a mic before a large crowd packed into the place sounds of chaos from outside
guardsmen are moving into the temple methodically searching those inside
have no fear the day of resurrection is at hand
a team of guardsmen move to surround the prophet his bodyguards struggle with them
do not resist
the oppressors shall soon fall never to rise again
ignoring him some bodyguards pull handguns and fire on the surrogate guardsmen who immediately return fire with automatic weapons
bud and miller the prophets right hand men both take bullets and go down
the prophet manages to escape out a side exit during this gunfire but a stray bullet catches him in the back as he flees
as he runs from the building the prophet is tackled by a guardsman
he turns the man over the prophets eyes are empty his head lolls back
a blood curdling scream from nearby as a young female dread takes this in
theyve killed him
theyve killed the prophet
other dreads nearby react the cry spreading
with the guardsman examining the body
the prophet is already rigid
and green coolant is spreading from an exit wound in his chest
a guardsman rips open his shirt pokes at the wound electronics and torn plastic
the guardsmans amazed gets on his walkie talkie
captain youd better come see this
nearby guardsmen react to the furious dreads massing around them
a grenade lands nearby guardsman throws himself on it his surrie blows up
gunfire erupts nearby a molotov cocktail sails through the air
we need to clear out
late in the afternoon
rolling green hills trees a rural area
a white compact car pulls up a dirt road past the mailbox with peters painted on it
the compact pulls to a stop
generic greer climbs out of the car
hes blandly handsome in a business suit with perfect hair that looks glued in place
his movements are stilted this is a cheap model and hes not used to it
generic greer steps onto the porch knocks on the door
he tries the knob locked
match cut pov of peters door on a sensory projector real greer in a rental stim chair bathed in red light
his face twitches slightly as if having a bad dream
his voice is deep again generic
its me tom greer
he moves along the side of the house peers in a window
angle through window a stim chair sits empty
dangling wires the sensory projector and hard drive have been stolen
generic greer smashes the window with his fist and climbs inside
generic greer moves quickly through the house peters
are you here
he tries a couple of doors finds a locked one turns the latch steps leading to the basement
generic greer flips a light switch at the top of the stairs bare bulbs come on angle down the real peters lies at the base of the stairs in her
stained torn nightgown motionless
a pool of blood from her head
her neck is twisted at a strange angle
greer winces with the shock of this
generic greer hurries down the stairs to real peters
oh my god jennifer he can see her neck is broken he cant move her
her eyes are closed lips parched hair matted with blood from a gash in her scalp
generic greer leans close takes her pulse
suddenly her eyes open
she speaks with difficulty
who are you
there wasnt time i rented a how do i know
prove youre greer
hes already dialing on a cellphone
you cant stand me im old school seat of the pants connects on phone yes i need an ambulance at mountainview theres a woman i think her neck is broken
how long have you been down here
three days i think
theyre on the way
somebodys been using your surrogate
you its been showing up to work every day
no i the night your chopper went down
i woke up and somebody was here
i fought with him but he was so strong peters is getting distraught
generic greer gently her brow
ssh relax he tried to bring me down here we fell
he took my memory the whole investigation
he said he was going to do my job for me
their eyes meet as the realization hits generic greer
under his breath canter
it has to be
oh god im so cold
she clearly had been fighting to stay alive just to tell someone what happened
wouldve been nice to meet you in person
she now closes her eyes
peters hang on please it wont be long
he rises finds an old blanket to put around her
generic greer quickly fills a glass of water from the tap
he hears sirens in the distance as he hurries back into the basement
generic greer kneels down to dribble water on real peters partially open lips
we hear a vehicle arrive outside
theyll be here in just a minute
he brushes her hair back from her face real peters eyes are half open vacant
generic greer lets out an anguished cry
angle up stairs surrie paramedics rush down with a stretcher
they take in the sight of two motionless bodies
and l ass lass generic greer kneeling over her body head bowed g still in hand checked out
real greer comes out of the curtained booth in a hurry moving for the door
hes talking on the phone
whos on duty in surveillance
sanders great put me through hes pursued by the rental agent
sir sir sir you havent returned your unit greer ignores the woman hes out of there
she calls after him angrily
you signed a contract
a handful of dreads are storming down the street smashing windows and bowling over any surries who get in their way
a scrolling electronic news crawl on the side of a building prophet shot reported dead
greer is walking fast on the phone steering clear of the angry dreads
its an emergency you need to connect me now
tight on bobby the overweight controller at his station
he looks nervous wearing his headset
responding to a subtle beep in his ear he makes as if to scratch himself opening the connection
we hear greers bobby its greer i need a remote shutdown
youll have the surries digital address on file agent jennifer peters
camera moves to reveal that peters the surrie is holding bobby at gunpoint a grim expression on her face
she doesnt realize bobbys on the phone
bobby are you there
bobby looks toward the special terminal that displays the surrie serial numbers
numbers are cranking through fast all highlighting
bobby looks at peters but speaks for greers benefit
peters have you gone insane
put the gun away what the hell are you trying to prove
peters ignores him watching the terminal screen
wider now we see that all the surrie watchers have disconnected theyre stationary on their tracks
the glowing monitors remain on showing random scenes unwatched
movement at the elevated entrance peters spins and fires her handgun in that direction
the intruder retreats
we now see a couple of surries have already been dropped here sprawled on the staircase leading down bullets in their heads
peters spins on bobby whos whispering frantically into shes into the entire surrie database i dunno what shes peters yanks off bobbys headset and throws it aside
greer has stopped stunned
then realizing whats happening he takes off at a sprint in a different direction
he makes another call
maggie please pick up damn it you have to disconnect as soon as you get this message get off line abandon your surrogate
youre in danger everyone is maggie is hard at work hot gluing a new head of streaked hair around the motionless face of a beautiful surrogate
she glances at a small cellphone sitting on a work tray nearby
it flashes close thomas greer scrolls on the cellphone readout
maggie wants to pick up but both hands are occupied
she sighs returns to her work
a group of agents in riot gear are gathered here weapons ready
one turns to see stone approaching his surrie is operational again flanked by a couple of other agents
shell only speak with you sir
why the hell dont you just move in and take her down
shes got a human hostage
stone pauses takes a breath
that fat ass sanders
he self consciously rubs the back of his head where we now see electrical tape holding shut the damaged latch
greer face red out of breath is displaying his badge to the clerk who checks his computer
im sorry youre not on his list
i wouldnt be
im here to arrest him
armando moves closer at this
do you have a warrant
listen to me
canter is committing a crime via surrogate right now
if you dont cooperate and let me up there you become an accomplice
without a warrant im afraid i cant help you
armando takes greer by the arm in a painful grip
youre gonna have to leave sir
armando escorts greer none too gently to the door
easy im only human
as armando relaxes his grip a bit greer flexes his left arm then gasps and clutches his chest as if having a coronary
he stumbles falls to his knees
armando bends over him are you ok
greer suddenly thrusts his hand beneath the mans jacket
armando reacts begins to struggle with greer bang bang beneath his suitcoat
armandos arm spasms wildly
he takes a few steps back sparks and hydraulic fluid coming from his chest
greer is holding the mans gun now aimed at him
i just made the last payment
greer rises and hurries to the clerk points the gun at his head
the elevator key
im calling the police
the clerk goes stock still hes checked out hes obviously making the call from home
greer shoves the inert body aside it falls flat
he reaches for the elevator key snatches it up when armando wraps his one good arm around greers throat from behind choking him
they stagger backward greer aims the gun behind his head and fires blowing a hole in armandos forehead
green coolant fried electronics fly from the exit wound
they topple to the ground together
greer struggles from the frozen surries grip clutching his ear deafened by the guns loud report
as greer gets to his feet the doorman enters takes in the tableau the gun wielding man the two surries on the ground and dashes outside again
greer hurries for canters private elevator
he turns the key no light nothing
he makes a frustrated noise and dashes for a nearby door to the stairwell
stone enters warily looking toward peters and the captive bobby
its me andy stone
hands in the air stone moves down the stairs stepping gingerly over the fallen surrogates
peters finishes cuffing bobbys wrists to a chair with plastic cuffs
she moves to get a look at stone across the expanse of glowing monitors
shes holstered her gun
who was it stone
who was it at vsi that hired you to kill me
stone blinks trying to process this
did you feel even a second of remorse when you found out youd murdered an innocent boy
he was eighteen
i dont believe it
just tell me what i need to know
stone considers this a bit smiles
we spend years trying to nail you for funding the dreads and now you hand yourself over to us on a silver platter
hijacking an agent destroying federal property creating a hostage situation
peters pulls her gun and points it at bobbys head
he cowers in his chair
i wouldnt add homicide to that list
as it is youre going to prison for a very long time
he turns on his heel begins walking back up the stairs for the door
peters lowers the gun reaches into her pocket and pulls out the q
an eye for an eye
she points it at the back of stones head and stones eyes go wide in agony and explode
he goes tumbling back down the stairs smoke pouring from his head body twitching crazily
greer is gasping for breath as he reaches an upper landing
ahead of him is a heavy steel door with a keypad lock
he tries the handle kicks the door once then pulls his gun and aims it at the lock turning away as he shoots
the bullet ricochets about the narrow area scaring the hell out of him
the lock is intact
he moves to a narrower staircase with a sign roof the riot agents pour in now guns firing
peters drops behind a bank of terminals for cover
bullets rocket past one catches her in the arm but barely phases her
the riot agents move in military style surrounding peters fiddles with the o
close she slides back a panel hits a couple of tiny switches the red diodes go to blue
peters points the device over the terminal sweeps it in the riot agents all freezein place for a second and then drop at once
unlike with stone theres no twitching smoke or exploding eyeballs
the sudden silence is eerie
peters rises and moves to stone the grotesque empty eyed surrogate
her expression is grim but shes accomplished an important part of her mission
bobby looks around at the many fallen bodies
are they dead
re the riot agents theyre fine
the phone is ringing
move from it to stone in his stim chair projector on his head
eyes rolled back dead
blood begins to seep from his ears
greer has come out on the roof
theres an enormous cell tower and dish up here
he moves to the edge peers over warily
angle down forty stories down to the street
greer flinches back reeling with vertigo
he moves along the edge looking for something
angle down the balcony outside canters study just inside the roof overhang a fifteen foot drop
greer squeezes his eyes shut steeling himself for what he must do
he lowers himself to hang onto the edge trying not to look down
he swings his body to get the momentum going the right way but his grip gives a moment too soon greer plunges from the roof to the balcony rail hitting
the railing hard starting to fall off the wrong way
but he manages to grab onto the metal
he hauls himself up and collapses onto the balcony lying on his back
his leg has been injured in the fall the pants torn blood
greer breathes audibly in pain and exhaustion
on the terminal numbers still highlighting flying past at incredible speed
move to find peters with an open toolbox
shes expertly wiring the o
to the keyboard cutting splicing and reattaching wires
bobby wheels closer tries to kick the o
without flinching peters knocks him back across the room the chair falls over and bobby moans
greer shoots the glass elbows out the shards and reaches in to unlock the balcony door
keeping his gun ready he limps painfully into the empty room
quick cuts as greer hunts for canter flinging open doors into bedrooms a living room bathrooms
the clerk reactivated leads a squad of uniformed police toward the stairwell
greer has almost given up hope when he starts at a noise and spins ready to shoot at the automated vacuum humming around a corner
as it moves past his feet greer registers a thin strip of red light at floor level
after a moment he begins rapping at the wall realizing its false
the clerk taps a code into the keypad of the bullet dented door
we hear a heavy latch disengage
greer hears footsteps of the approaching cops as he tries desperately to find a way into the hidden space
he discovers a latch at waist level the wall becomes a pocket door
he lets himself in and closes it behind him the police and the clerk round the corner
eerie red light a narrow snaking passageway
greer listens as the footsteps pass outside turns to see the stalker the hulking silver eyed surrogate who broke into peters place
hes inert in his charging beside him is the boy who picked greer up in the limo
wider a dozen surrogates different ages and sexes lined up in their charging bays
clearly canter can become anyone he wants to be
greer is momentarily stunned to see the prophet a spare surrogate in a charging bay
greer moves carefully onward
around a corner he sees a projector display screen
its peters pov on the fbi surveillance center a glance toward the motionless riot agents to bobby struggling on the ground
peters pov settles on the numbers highlighting on the terminal
is connected to the keyboard blue diodes flash the jerry rigging complete
real canter is visible from behind in an elaborate prosthetic wheelchair a sensory projector on his head
greer moves toward him and rips off the headgear
real canter opens his eyes startled
peters is frozen in place by the terminal
bobby on the ground realizes somethings happened
he strains to see the numbers screen
on screen the numbers have stopped scrolling
a dialogue box full database selected uploading software to network with a bar moving up slowly
canter squints up at greer from his wheelchair and brace
he speaks with an electronic aid his voice slightly artificial sounding
is she shes dead
i had no intention of hurting her
im truly sorry
you bastard she was my partner i cared about her did you
you barely knew her
it was me you came to care about shut up
greer clenches his fist if the man wasnt in a wheelchair he would beat the hell out of him
struggling to control himself mind reeling how many people are you
youre really the prophet
i had to fight vsi any way i could
as canter speaks his eyes flick toward the projectors the image of the o
device uploading software from peters pov
canter tries to block greers view theres nothing you can do greer pushes canters wheelchair out of the way violently
greer sits on the floor leaning against the wall
he takes a breath and puts on the projector headset
he slips on the fingersleeve presses his fingers together and peters is suddenly reanimated stumbles a bit where she stands as greer gets his bearings in this new body
he moves to the keyboard and rips the o
from the jerry rigged connection
peters turns to bobby
how do i shut it down
bobby this is agent greer
on the catwalk a human agent hes a sniper in black creeps into position readying his rifle
peters greer helps bobby up so that he can see the computer screen
bobby remains cuffed
the number is counting down
the software from that things already in the system you have to abort transmission
hit control escape f
as peters greer does so this can really send a virus to every surrie on the network
sure but it has to disconnect the operators first
pauses surprised so people arent in any danger
their surrogates are
the projector screen shows the words yes
move to greer in the sensory projector his face tight
canter stares at greer seeing that greer realizes whats at stake the fate of humanity
peters greer reaches for the keyboard again hesitates
a moment of internal conflict
bobby stares confused
a clean headshot drops peters greer in her tracks electronic goo sprays the computer screen
bobby spins in his chair
he tries desperately to reach the keys himself but on screen disconnecting
hes too late
greer yanks off the headset breathing hard eyes wide with shock
canter regards him from his wheelchair
hes been watching the monitor knows what just happened
you could have stopped it
you know why
i wont be responsible for the death of humanity
i like the way you put it unringing a bell
greer puts his head in his hands realizing the enormity of what hes just done
you created them
i only sought to give people like me the chance to live normal lives
but my partners at vsi overrode me
they saw a much larger market surrogates for everyone
a world without risk without pain
nothing at stake
nothing to live for
greer rises shakily
whats going to happen
the day of resurrection
as he speaks he raises a small white capsule to his lips
before greer can stop him canter bites into it and swallows
greer tries to get the capsule from canters mouth but the man is dead within moments
bobby kicks at the computer frantically crying out
the sniper reaches him cuts his hands free with a knife
its ok sir youre alright its freed bobby lunges at the keyboard hitting keys in a frenzy but on screen disconnecting changes to operators disconnected
then quickly transmitting
late afternoon golden light
dreads have been herded together here national guardsmen surrounding them
suddenly the guardsmen all drop at once
crowded rush hour lots of traffic and noise
then pedestrians fall in a wave
cars veer out of control smashing into each other careening onto the sidewalk rolling over fallen surrie bodies and smashing into storefronts
the feds are all collapsed over desks or sprawled flat
a car full of commuters some slumped in their seats or hanging from straps others lying on the floor
the car stops automatically the doors open with a hiss to reveal a platform littered with bodies
all employees and customers of the beauty shop are motionless
camera finds maggie on the floor among them staring sightlessly at the ceiling
angle down on the suddenly quiet street
the surries have dropped throughout the city
pull back to reveal greer looking down on this
he limps quickly back inside stepping over the bodies of the fallen cops
he moves for the elevator hits a switch to power it up
the moment the dreads have been waiting for
with a mass cry theyre charging over the fallen bodies of the guardsmen and over the flattened fences
wide as thousands of dreads run out of the reservation into the streets of the city
greer hobbles through the dreadful aftermath smoking auto pileups bodies everywhere most fallen in their tracks a few remain on their feet
car horns alarms in the distance
a few disheveled dreads are here taking it in with delight and amazement
they whoop as they tip over a couple of the standing surries
greer passes a car on the sidewalk its driver slumped against the wheel the radio blares the massive surrogate shutdown appears to be nationwide
fallen surries all over the grounds
armed dreads are rushing into the place past the motionless sentries
theyre making for the factory
rioters presumed to be members of the human coalition seem to be making coordinated attacks on across the country
the robotic assembly line still running until boom
a dread shoots an rpg into the machinery
surrogate parts are blasted in all directions
fire spreads across the rows of surrogate templates packed together tightly
close on a melting face the deforming plastic skull and electronics within
citizens are asked to remain in their homes
greer makes his way toward his place
greer enters moves immediately for his wifes bedroom
he knocks gently then tries the door it isnt locked
the room is dim theres a form huddled in the bed sobbing covers pulled up
greer moves slowly toward her speaks in a soothing voice
maggie its me
she pulls away from his touch at first struggles
please no dont look at me
greer pulls away the covers to reveal the real maggie
shes pale emaciated and malnourished tears running down her face
she shrinks away from him
no tom i dont want you to
it doesnt matter to greer he takes her in his arms and holds her close
its ok its ok
no its not
its just us now
slowly she puts her arms around him weeping against his chest
pull back and
out the window
move to show exterior doors opening and greers neighbors emerging blinking in the unfamiliar sunlight
most wear robes sweatclothes
theyre all ages some overweight others homely its almost a relief after all the young perfect people
down the street others emerge regard each other warily like people after an earthquake
some begin speaking to each other for the first time in whispers at first others take in the sunset which bathes the neighborhood in orange light
