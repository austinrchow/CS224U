by james cameron kathryn bigelow from the screenplay by w
peter iliff we are in the belly of a wave
light refracts in a constant collision of water
slow motion the hallucinatory prisms like liquid diamonds taking flight dreamlike
backlit against a flaming sun a solitary surfer glides across the green glassy peak
time is stretched until his movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world
total zen concentration
body weight centered eyes forward and on the next section
slow motion on a black sedan
creeping along store fronts
past a winchells
people splash steps down rain washed sidewalks in dream motion
the sedan turns past the first virginia bank and into an alley
two men and one woman in suspended time put on overcoats and hats
under their hats strips of scotch tape stretch taut from the base of their nose to their forehead hideously distorting their features
makes them look like human pigs
silvery in this light almost metallic as if from some future scape
the lone surfer shreds a long endless right wall
accelerating into real time as he stares into the pit digs in drops into the sweet spot on the wave hunkers down
his moves becoming aggressive frenzied an m clip is smacked into place and cocked with a cachack
ammo clips are snick snicked into handgun butts and a long clip is sssnicked into an uzi
watches are checked
the pig nose people nod to each other
pig nose steals into position near the glass doors slams his back to the wall weapon to cheek breath fast
fast now the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face of the wave
the surfer trims down the line pivoting the board and going straight down carving the bottom
he slashes viciously back toward the lip and in a radical inverted air attack sails six feet above the wave in an explosion of water glass doors explode open and
pig nose spins inside
he fires a burst into the ceiling
everybody on the floor
two bandits handle bank employees and customers another pig nose watches the door pig nose moves behind counter uzi and canvas sack in hand
monitors show slow scans of the bank interior
two men wear headphones and black windbreakers with fbi stenciled on the back
one watches with binoculars
wheres the big college quarterback
are you with us utah
a man in his twenties
his head spins revealing rain slicked hair and face eyes wide bright
an edgy handsomeness to him
he pops a stick of wrigleys in his mouth rests a shotgun on one leg and leans against the wall
he wears a headset
through which we hear the fbi guy yelling for him
this is johnny utah
utah where the hell are ya
utah takes his headset off
pig nose leaps over the counter holds a canvas sack filled with booty from tellers drawers
fuckin shake it
pig nose nods with his snubby nose hurries toward the exit
the bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the alley where they jump into the sedan
the driver the woman pig nose punches it and the tires whirrr on the slick pavement
the sedan launches down the alley
like a freight train
splashing through a cross alley
he doesnt break stride as he slams his shoulder into a large steel garbage dumpster
driving it like a football training sled into the alley where the sedan locks em up seconds too late as it skids and slams into it crunching into the brick
wall and still alive grinds into reverse back down the alley headlights smashed it guns it backward as utah leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car
he has a brick in his right hand
he cocks it back
johnny heaves the brick thirty yards and smash
the brick explodes into the windshield spiderwebbing the glass
lady pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into her face
son of a bitch
the car slews backward onto the street slamming a parked car
lady pignose slams the thing into drive cuts the wheel hard and punches it skidding on wet pavement
utah hurtles from the alley
he leaps somehow tackles the drivers door handle and is dragged along the street
he pulls himself up reaches inside the window and whips the steering wheel hard right
the sedan fishtails into a parked toyota
utah bounces forward slamming into the asphalt
glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere as radiator steam whistles hot
pig nose riding shotgun is trapped
cant get his crushed door open
the driver pushes open her door
gropes for her pistol
utah springs no respect for a lady
he slams the door pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops
utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain
pig nose bails out and runs across parking lot
utah leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the shotgun
pig nose spins
we sense reckless anger
he raises the uzi
utah squeezes the trigger
just buzzers and flashing bulbs
pig noses flak vest lights up like a pinball machine
utahs laser weapon hit the kill zone
pig nose rips the tape off his face and the fbi cadet shakes his head in disgust
observers step forward
all fbi personnel
medical staff offer the woman driver assistance
pig nose heads for johnny but is subdued by other agents
i wanna say just two words to you asshole simu lation
johnny fuckin utah
guys like you will do anything to win
utah stares back in defiance
the surveillance van pulls up nearby
binoculars runs out and pinches two fingers together right in johnnys face
this far utah
youre this far from being the most overqualified guy burger king ever had
johnny gestures to the car
i did stop the perpetrators
utah turns to go
as he passes he casually raises his laser shotgun and re triggers pig noses flak vest
pig nose explodes
more agents restrain him
screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys
utah walks off down the simulated street past a sign which bears the fbi seal and reads combat village quantico virginia
a luminous pacific
five foot faces
a lineup of surfers wait outside the break
silhouetted bobbing like a pack of sea mammals
a flood of orange through the windshield as the cab crawls down ocean park to the sea
camera handheld from the back seat
the driver turns to us
you dont care
ive just never seen the ocean before
johnny utah trudging across the sand holding his shoes
garment bag and a big duffel over his shoulder
he looks silly in his dark suit tie loosened wearing a turned around baseball cap
he wiggles his toes in the sand looks around like a kid
a pack of bouncing beauties jog through frame
utah grins reaches up and turns his cap around
it reads i love l
looking down the face of the concrete monolith at wilshire and veteran
ant like johnny utahs tiny figure moves toward the entrance
day one in la special agent utah
you may have been top two percent of your class at quantico but you have exactly zero hours in the field here
you know nothing
supervising agent ben harp leads utah across the bullpen
rows of desks
agents sitting at computer terminals
looks like he got a job at xerox
you know less than nothing
if you even knew that you knew nothing at least that would be something but you dont
utah is wearing a suit carrying a briefcase
harp is mid thirties confident of stride tanned of skin perfect of hair
eating solid breakfasts utah
all the food groups
i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness
we stay off hard liquor cigarettes
poker face i take the skin off chicken
harp glances at him eyes narrowing
they reach a glassed in compound of small offices
harp swings the door open and the other agents look up as utah enters
this is us
and youre in the bank robbery capital of the world last year in la county
up percent from the year before
and we nailed over a thousand of them
we did it by crunching data
good crime scene work good lab work good data base analysis
nobody had to tackle a car once
you getting the signal special agent
zero distortion sir
he picks up a donut from someones desk a succulent glazed jelly
i love these things
he looks right at harp
takes a big fuck you bite
youre a real blue flame special arent you utah
i dont know why they sent you to la
must be an asshole shortage
not so far
a blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines
a figure rockets down into frame in a curtain of bubbles
a gawky agent in less than stylish fbi trunks flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom of a pool
the pool casts wavy distortions upon two dozen men all grumbling as they stand in line wearing t shirts with fbi logos sweats and sneakers
we hear a splash and the men shuffle forward
the dolls love this baby
it brings them luck when they rub it right between their buttons
close on tape measure wrapped around a generous belly
pull back to reveal veteran agent corey measuring the ample waist of angelo pappas
this year old silver haired greek stands rubbing his belly like a zulu chief
angelo we need a bigger tape
just read the goddamn number
maybe we can cinch it down wear a girdle screw you and this holistic fitness crap
at least my arms dont flap in the wind
corey secretly squeezes his bicep as
a whistle blows
a broad shouldered man wearing an fbi cap barks at the greek
okay pappas lets put on the blindfold
wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom
johnny utah enters the pool area in the distance
says something to one of the agents
is pointed toward us as corey ties the blindfold and guides pappas to the edge of the pool
ive been in the field years fired my piece times in the line of duty and i got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with
being a special agent
johnny has walked up
pappas blindfolded turns directly to utah as he continues thinking its corey
added to which indignity i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner
some quarterback punk johnny unitas or something
the shit they pull huh
pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool
huge backblast of water
the other agents hoot and holler
corey swears and wipes off his clipboard
johnny steps to the edge looks down
we see the blindfolded pappas groveling along the bottom
the other agents cheer as pappas heads for the surface
here he comes
hold up a fish hell take it right outta your hand
pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters for breath
he grabs the edge and angrily slaps two bricks on the tiles
he rips off the blindfold looks up and frowns
a hand enters frame to help him up
pappas takes it and johnny hauls him on deck
hey shamu this is your guy
pappas eyes the new agent warily
extends his hand
grinning welcome to sea world kid
ecu sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the seconds
magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun
velcro straps of second chance body armor are fastened
white gloves are pulled snug over strong hands
a silk tie is straightened
a shotgun slide is cocked
the sweep hand approaches the twelve
a latex mask is pulled over the back of a mans head
the little hand says
the mask turns into full close up
it is ronald reagan
lets rock and roll
business as usual
the scene so normal you know something is about to happen
an exiting man stuffs bucks into his wallet reaching for the door which slams inward
he is hit by a wall of ex presidents
reagan charges in with his buddies richard m
nixon lyndon baines johnson and john f
reagan throws the poor guy skidding across the floor
nixon buttstrokes a guard hard in the nuts with his gauge
the other guard goes for his holster finds himself facing three shotguns and one very large handgun
reagan sights down the pistol
use a gun go to heaven
the guard freezes
white and sweaty
tricky dick slips up to him and collects the pistol
kennedy covers the stunned customers
johnson backs up against the door jam watching the street and the sedan idling at the curb
all tellers step back from the counter
hands on heads
nixon and reagan move quickly to the counter as the tellers comply
everybody else on the floor
on the floor lets go
suck linoleum bitch
you got earwax
nixon grabs a stunned woman by the arm and hurls her to the floor
she lands hard
everyone is on the deck by now
the presidents move fast
reagan leaps onto the counter
stands up where he can see all
nixon hurdles to tellers side and they start moving down the line together
reagan controlling the room as nixon quickly empties the tellers cash drawers into the sack
his hands move like lightning
just stay cool
everybody stay cool
the moneys insured tight on money flying into the sack
its not worth dying for
another seconds of your time
then whoa tricky dick
nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and tosses it to the bank manager
who reflexively catches it
then drops it like a hot potato just before it explodes into a cloud of blue ink
the manager is dyed blue
burnt money showers on the terrified customers
lbj looks at his watch and whistles
the bandits sprint for the front doors
kennedy exits first followed by reagan
lbj pauses under the surveillance camera drops his trousers and moons
thank you is written across his white butt
high angle distorted wide shot
lbj hoists his pants and splits followed out by nixon who exits backward with the famous double peace sign held high overhead
victorious nixon grainy
something from a time warp
the image suddenly goes into high speed reverse
the bank robbery sequence zips backward
twenty seven banks in three years
in and out in seconds
nobody ever gets shot
were talking solid professionals
utah pappas are watching a monitor in the glassed in office
the robbery replays on grainy black white videotape
the bandits barge in raise shotguns and order everybody to the floor
yeah they control the room well
stick strictly to the cash drawers
video tape utah is reverse scanning
the bandits walk backward into the bank
the explosion of blue ink is sucked back into the pack of money then leaps back into president nixons hand
they dont go for the vault
never go for the vault
they never get greedy
you burn time in the vault
reagan usually drives
stolen switch car they leave it running at the curb looks parked from a distance
when they run they dump the vehicle and vanish
and i mean vanish
utah stops the video now fast forwarding it stopping where president nixon separates the exploding dye pack planted with the money before he tosses it aside
look at them separate the dye packs
dick and ronny know their jobs
the ex presidents are the best ive seen kid
outside the windowed partition police officers interview frightened customers
hotshot agents munoz and cole enter from the main floor of the bank
think theyre very slick
anytime you two are finished jerking off watching mtv i need to get a look at that tape
sloppy grin hey pappas you tell the kid your theory on the presidents
just take the tape cole
now munoz starts to smile
hang ten pappas like totally rad
to utah i gotta tell ya the department loves it
whats he talking about angelo
harp raps glass
cole and munoz look sharp
harp enters addressing pappas and utah
they found the drop car up on mulholland

supervising special agent harp

the greek rises like a proud bull
how about your office
your office need vacuuming
we could do that too
pappas and utah move toward the door
its a tight squeeze as they pass cole and munoz
read as fuck you
the diamond field of la glitters below
the small parking area off mulholland is filled with squad cars
red and blue disco
a flock of uniforms milling about a non descript chevy
flashlight beam prowls the interior stopping on a small printed card folded like a pup tent left upon the bench seat
it reads sanitized for your protection
they love to fuck with us
utah pappas pull their heads out of the sedan
forensic expert halsey stands behind them
dont tell me let me guess
the switch car was stolen this morning
halsey is nodding his head they vacuumed and d the interior did the windows emptied the ashtrays
yeah the usual drill
utah pulls on a rubber glove and lifts the card off the seat
talks to halsey like halseys the one that just out of quantico not utah
couldve taken their gloves off before setting that card
laser it for prints
maybe held it to his teeth check the edges for saliva
a beat today was a scorcher
this chevy doesnt have air conditioning
sweat secretions in the seatbacks
you through mr
let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while youre at it
looks at his watch hell its only
the nights still young
you can solve this case and start on another one
well whatre your ideas on these guys
forget about it kid
let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it
see im almost
so i must be senile right
they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public
it would look bad for the bureau right
so youre gonna coast to retirement when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity
you watch your fucking mouth
pounds his chest mr
hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here
the two men glare at each other
utah looks away
that was thirty years ago anyway
stares out at the bright horizon l
s changed a lot since then
the air got dirty and the sex got clean
after a beat so you want to nail the ex presidents
be a big hero
whats your theory
the fucking punks are surfers
ex presidents charge into bank raise shotguns
image stops then fast forwards to the end
dark lit by the tv at the far end of the bullpen
pappas and utah sit in front of the flickering sony in the big empty room
angelo punches a button on the vcr
lbj turns his back to the fish eye lens drops trousers and moons the camera
angelo freezes on lbjs butt
im tellin ya kid its in our face
lookit the tan on this guy
the young agent looks forward
stares at the white inscribed butt bracketed by deep bronze tan lines
oh well he must be a surfer
shutup you might learn somethin youre not careful
so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over
there was a soil sample
non specific mud traces of asphalt oils blah blah
so i became a wax expert
theres some uses for this stuff something like five hundred products
he tosses utah a ream of computer printout
utah scans lists of brand names
could be anything
guys waxing his mustache at the beach
gets sand in it
wipes it off with a shoe
shoe scuffs the counter
the lab made three possible matches this was one of em
pappas opens his desk drawer takes something out and throws it to johnny
a pastel blue hockey puck wrapped in cellophane
a block of mr
zogs sex wax
reading sex wax
youre not into kinky shit are you angelo
surfers use it on their boards
they rub sand into it for traction
thanks for the tip
i needed this knowledge
pappas shoves a thick file folder toward utah
now lookit the dates on the robberies
this is strictly a summer job for these guys
johnny leafs through it
june to october
same the year before
another month and we dont see em again til next summer
utah stares at angelo as it dawns
theyre traveling the rest of the year on the money going where the waves are
pappas starts to smile
suddenly he jumps up onto his desk gets down in a speed crouch arms extended
to one and all the ex presidents rip off banks to finance their endless summer
johnny watches grinning
the night security guard walks in
utah turns to the guard shrugs
i think he needs a vacation
the guard nods understanding
long stack up rack of gleaming surfboards
a hand reaches in pulling out a board from the middle of the deck
johnny utah hefts it
sights along it
trying to look familiar with alien equipment
behind him is a whip thin year old salesman
nut brown with platinum hair jammed day glo shorts sleeveless t shirt unlaced ug boots
highest performance very kind
if you want to get aggro man this stick can handle your best rage
where you surf
thiss a tri fin squash tail thruster
youd eat major shit on this dude
across the room we see pappas trying on purple wraparound sunglasses
the salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish firebird paint scheme
like a lowrider flame job
the logo reads dance with the universe
here you need a rhino chaser like this one to learn on
i mean for a pig board
utah hefts the board
hates anything hes not great at
pappas sets his purchases on a counter the glasses some plutonium pink shorts t shirts sun block
the girl behind the counter is sixteen barely contained in a macrame bikini top and dolphin shorts
angelo picks up a package of sex wax from a rack
reading the label best for your stick huh
this might not be enough
i better get two
the girl stifles a grin
thinks hes cute
at the other end of the counter is ringing up utahs board
hey man guys your age learning to surf its cool theres nothing wrong with it
im twenty five
see thats what im saying its never too late
utah picks up the board and moves to leave
hope you stay with it
surfins the source
itll change your life
swear to god
utah and pappas walking back to the car
two fbi agents in suits and ties walking with a day glo orange surfboard
the ocean shimmers in johnny its the only way
why cant i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned
ask a few questions
angelo stops at the railing points toward the ocean
look at them out there
long lens on packs of surfers sitting outside
hunched like sea birds
waiting for an unseen sign
disappearing and reappearing beyond the break
theyre like some kind of tribe
got their own language
you cant just walk up to these guys
youve got to get out there
learn some moves
get into their head
pick up the speech
angelo this stuff is for little rubber people who dont shave yet
its all balance right
how hard can it be
johnny is clobbered by a wave
hes flipped off his board and hits the water face first as the wave crashes over him
other surfers steer clear
pappas lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink shorts purple vuarnets and a t shirt emblazoned with surf this across the chest
a picnic basket sits close at hand
he winces at utahs wipeout
shouts from his beach chair
i think you gotta hit them straight on
out of breath got it
utah holds the tip steady gouges the face of a wave and squirts out the other side
another wave rises and utah glides up over the hump
he clears the swell and the ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake
triumphant over having made the lineup he sits up on the board and falls over
pappas slices a green apple some feta cheese and eats off the knife
utah climbs back on his board
whistles and hoots sound as surfers spot a new swell
utah watches as the regulars start catching rides
suddenly he feels like a lost dog on a busy freeway
a young local in a neon wetsuit slashes past him inches away
outta the way you dick
another shredding viciously is blasting toward him
move it kook
johnny paddles rapidly ducks under
sees another bigger wave coming
at himself at the downy cheeked hotshots at the frustration he turns his board around and starts paddling hard
he somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the top of the board then struggles up
hes standing sort of
arms pinwheeling he topples in a nasty crash
right in front of a shaved head surfer on full afterburner
johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray
his board it smashes sideways into razorhead
the guy does an ugly endo
utah comes up gasping for air arms flailing
his board floating a few feet away tugging at his ankle
he drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath
razorhead already back on his board paddles over
points to a small dent in the fiberglass
you dinged my board kook
utah looks up in apology as knocks him under
razorhead pulls a knife from a sheath held by a thong around his neck
as johnny surfaces razorhead slashes in a vicious arc severing utahs leash close to the board
his flame job surfboard bobs away
politeness counts asshole
the surf punk plunges under a wave disappearing
goddamn son of a before utah can finish another wave engulfs him and he tumbles to shore razorhead nowhere to be seen
on pappas as johnnys flame job board washes in at his feet
he calmly picks it up as utah staggers into frame out of the knee deep whitewash
johnny rubs his jaw
kid maybe this aint your sport
utah grabs the board out of pappas hands and stalks off across the beach
johnny dead asleep
he jacknifes up like he just took volts
his eyes read panic
he rolls up legs scissor against tangled sheets and he collapses over empty boxes
he stumbles like a blind man through the mess until he finds a tiny indianapolis colts football helmet with a digital clock for eyes
johnny emits a drawn out groan
deafening boom as a monster wave crashes below a sky the color of slate
a distant pacific storm has brought the swell
glassy green walls the size of houses beckoning from beyond the soup
a lone figure bobbing out beyond the break
the surfer disappears behind the swell
then reappears grinning across the smooth offshore barrel
utah wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard craning forward to get a better look
the surfer is a woman
she moves with liquid grace in perfect harmony with the sea long hair flying out behind her
she undulates like a dancer
dipping carving slicing making it look sooooo easy
johnny shakes his head
oh man if she can do it
he stands grabs his board and heads out into the icy foam
a horizon of whitecaps churn behind him
he lies on his board rising and dropping with the swell
so far so good
he spots a wave
a fluid gray green house rising forever rising
the house catching him lifting him high upon its roof
utah is committed
he gets to his feet as his board slices along the lip
he peers over the falls down the face holy shit
it looks like niagara
he loses balance and spirals airborne falling bullseye into the impact zone
the entire force of the wave crashing upon him plunging him down into the where he spins like a whirling dervish lashed to a slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of
he is held prisoner in a grey green churning nightmare like a six ton pit bull has him by the neck shaking him
he looks around
cant tell up from down
his head slams into the bottom rocks and sand
stunned he struggles toward the light finally bursting to the surface
gasping for breath
the good news is hes breathing the bad news is hes surfaced in the impact zone
another wave crashes down stuffing him back into the washing machine
leaving no sign of life in the white froth
the orangeade surfboard launches high into the sky spinning like a misfiring trident missile trailing its broken leash like a kite tail
in the washing machine utah tumbles in a cold green hell
his chest is convulsing needing air now
suddenly a figure lunges down into frame
a hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him toward the surface
the woman surfer bursts through the foam
grabs her board for leverage
hauls utahs head above the water with one strong arm
he is choking coughing slapping fatigued arms against the surf panic registering in his movements
yelling above the roar swim goddammit
the woman gets her board under one of his arms for support and sidekicks fiercely into the wave holding him in a painful grip
with powerful strokes she helps utah make it to calmer water outside the break
the big waves just forming up lift them and drop them as they pass
muted thunder when the waves hit the beach
she drags him half onto her surfboard
practically slamming his face into the board
hes coughing out saltwater
on the woman our first good look at her
she is exquisite
hair slicked tight to her high cheekboned face she looks sleek and feral with eyes that burn bright
especially when shes pissed
look crazy son of a bitch
you wanna commit suicide you do it someplace else
she undoes her leash and swims rapidly off returning in a few seconds with johnnys board
he takes it from her and flops over it still coughing
wipes at the salt snot running out of his nose
there is a cut over his eye from when he re arranged the rocks on the bottom
look at this pig board piece a shit
its still got the price tag on it for chrissakes
whatd you do buy it yesterday
youve got no business out here whatsoever
still gagging and gasping johnny manages a goofy grin
well i saw you and yeah you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it a big strong stud like you shouldnt have any problem
well you figured wrong dork
she yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away from him
uh how do i get back in
without turning carefully tough guy
yelling now my names johnny utah
im telling you so when you look back on this moment you can think
there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no
business being in whatsoever
when i could have easily helped him
johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore
thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him
hes stoic in the face of certain death
over his shoulder gamely bye
swimming back to him youre fucking crazy you know that
you go in there youre gonna eat it on the rocks
here follow me
the woman paddles parallel to the shore and utah pumps along behind her
she gets him away from the rocks then starts watching the incoming swell timing it to the lull between sets
go when i say
but stay down
just lie on the board
alright lets go
utah paddles rapidly following her watching what she does
he is borne up by a low glassy wall
he bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak
stands unsteadily grabbing his board
runs clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes sucking water out
on terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick out gracefully and disappear beyond the wave
he flops on the sand
the woman is peeling off her wetsuit next to a bathtub porsche that needs a paint job
her board is propped in the passenger seat
stereo is pumping
utah watches through binoculars from yards up the road
the woman in a bikini towels off briskly
long muscular legs
lean and mean
she jumps into the car without bothering to open the door
looks at her watch her manner is late in a hurry
through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something else not too concerned about the morning traffic right next
she pulls on a t shirt and them performs a houdini act to extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole
utah watches impassively
he starts his car and pulls out onto pch to follow as the bathtub porsche zooms past
utah cruises up slowly pulls off the road
up ahead the porsche turns into the parking lot of neptunes net a coast highway hangout that serves high grade steamed sea critters and beer to low grade road trash
bikers and surfers
lean and mean wearing jeans and t shirt jumps out of the porsche
she hurries to the door of the net unlocking it for a couple of mexican cooks helpers wearing expressions like they wait like this for her every day
utah puts down his binoculars and jots the porsches license number down on a tastee freeze bag
green glow washes the intent faces of utah and pappas as miss deer data specialist enters cdh into her computer
she is purebred american indian strong featured and beautiful
the screen freezes and the hard disk churns
the dmv rap sheet scrolls down the screen
this is your surfer contact
hmm not bad utah
tyler ann endicott
the rap sheet scrolls and scrolls and scrolls
there is something frightening about the length of this file
reading from the screen exhibition of speed
indecent exposure inside moving vehicle
hot very hot
see adjoining file
he types quickly kidnapping
pappas crowds over johnnys shoulder reading
this is great
she ties some guy up
leaves the scene and fails to return for hours
gotta avoid the rope tricks johnny
utah gives her a very funny look
more data scrolls forth
what else they got on her
i still havent found anything i can really use
i gotta find an approach a way in here we go
he reads both parents deceased
a fat biker pulls out on a loud harley like theres any other kind
the place is almost empty in the weekend lull between lunch and dinner
utahs car pulls in off pch
tyler endicott is working the counter
she jams an order on the wheel and turns to us
reverse on johnny standing there
her only customer
what do you want
shrimp and fries
i mean what do you want
what are you doing hanging around here
very serious i need you to teach me
gimme a break

shes looking at him
this guys nuts

see all my life ive done things for other people
in high school i played football because my old man expected me to
then my parents always figured id go to law school so i did
graduated phi beta kappa this gonna take long
wait so im a big hero to my folks right
he leans forward a little awkward but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals
and i hadnt been living my own life
so i wanted something for myself
something that maybe didnt make any sense
you know what i mean
tylers smile has faded during this
hes managed to touch her break through the tough waitress act
now shes looking him right in the eye
i came out here from ohio a month ago
never saw the ocean before
i didnt think it would effect me so much
like im drawn to it or something
i want to do what you do
its the truth
if youre a minute late im gone
hes grinning and stud
i didnt take you to raise
i can show you a few things but after that youre on your own
thatll be four fifty
he plunks down a ten and backs out the door grinning
keep the change teach
utah tyler walk across the sand
tyler drops her board
she turns to him do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it
utah pops into frame arms extended one leg in front of the other torso bent at the waist classic surfing stance
suddenly he drops out of frame
we pull back revealing utah on his board on the sand
do it again
tyler is making him pop up to his feet
again and again
gawkers stop to watch
utah fights humiliation
he pops again
on the next pop we pull back to reveal utah on his board in a wave
he is surfing
for about three seconds
he flies off the deck ass over teakettle
on the splash we start tyler and utah straddle their boards outside the break
she nods as the set comes mellow right tubes
utah digs in arms pumping
he feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and starts down the wall
tyler shouting at utah as he fights for balance
he flies off again
blinding bright sunrise
tyler next to utah in the lineup straddling boards
she moves her hands like a fighter pilot explaining a dogfight maneuver
utah watches intently
utah backlit in glorious slow motion tries a little turn and feels his feet slip out
he slams down butt first on the board flips over feet sticking straight up out of a blast of diamond spray
tyler cringes giving a look like its hopeless
tyler and utah at their cars skinning out of their wetsuits
utah looks exhausted downcast
she snaps her wet towel at his ass cheering him up
tyler jumps out of her porsche and sees utah sitting in his car
she goes to him opens the door and starts pulling him out
come on you pussy
utah and tyler wait their turn in the lineup
rain pelts their faces
the waves are depressing inside mushers under a gray sky
utah starts to paddle
tyler shakes her head no
utah is committed to the iface
tyler stifles a laugh
to the other surfers im not with him
johnny gouges the lip pops and begins the drop
suddenly miraculously he catches an edge and still standing is carried along the tiny wall
the wall begins to sag
utah shoots along the mush hooting and continues hooting madly as he thrashes all the way to shore
he turns and grins foolishly out to sea
tyler bursts out laughing
utah board in arm follows tyler out of the whitewater onto the beach
its closing out completely
lets call it
his eyes track the unruly break
a lone surfer slashing through the pilings of the pier
a real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind him
silhouetted against a crimson sky and backlit spray the figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion that is somehow balletic
laying out bottom turns torquing his body and blasting the lip a few times moving so fast his long dark hair stands straight back as if he were leaning out
a car window on the freeway
they call his the bodhisattva
utah watches as the bodhisattva gets vertical with a snap trims down the volcanic wall carves the bottom pivots pumps to the top gouging the lip getting six feet of
gawkers howl and shout praise at the manic surfer
the modern savage
guys even crazier than you johnny utah
they start to walk
the sky darkens as the sea finally closes out completely
the bodhisattva seems to levitate through the shapeless mush to shore
suddenly a football whistles through the air above utahs head
he watches as the bodhisattva board under arm walking out of the whitewater makes a one handed chest catch
a few yards away two teams of surfers play football
utah gazes down the beach at the bodhisattva
almost years old his body lean and hard as a tree trunk
hardness in the face accented by long comanche hair
bodhi pumps his arm
tyler jogs back for the catch
she shoots bodhi a look
something crosses her face
then it passes
she chucks the ball to utah
who drops his board and makes the catch in one move
he spins the football on his fingertip drops it on his foot kicks it up into his hands
he grins evilly
rimmed by a dozen car headlights at the edge of the sand
utah crouches waiting for the snap from nathaniel ponytailed and powerfully built
facing them on defense are bodhi tyler and three others roach gonzo and spiked haired
and thin as a stick and rosie a biker with piggy eyes and arms blue with tattoos
montage style utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling passes
every one picture perfect
nathaniel scrambles z out left turns and the ball is practically waiting for him
bodhi stares at him curiously
utah enjoys scrambling ducking left and right twisting her into a pretzel
play after play
utah tosses another touchdown but tyler keeps coming
they lie together in a heap laughing
bodhi fakes a pass then runs ball tucked in his arm
utah tears after him
flat out speed run
roach attempts a block
utah hits him like a freight train
roach hits the sand face first
grommet and rosie the biker in a squeeze play
utah fierce now blasts between them
utah cant play for fun
we see his expression
something scary there
what we will call juggernaut mode
tyler just steps aside
bodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the beach
sees a demon shooting up roostertails of spray behind him gaining
pours it on
both of them pistoning through curtains of water
not a game anymore
closing on the endzone
utah is airborne
slams bodhi like a sam missile
they crash and burn together in the surf
the other surfers run up
whos this newcomer that just centerpunched their main man
industrial strength tension
the fuck you doin man
you fuckin crazy
bodhi flashes a million dollar smile
you know who this is
ohio state all conference
to utah rose bowl three years ago
tyler looks at him no shit
johnny fuckin utah
yeah i remember that game man
you were on fire
they could not stop your ass
head butt dude
johnny gestures please no
enthused by the concept grommet turns to nathaniel
their foreheads crack together
they stumble backwards in giddy euphoria
nathaniel laughs like pee wee herman
you got nuked in the last quarter
yeah my knee got folded about degrees the wrong way
and thats why you never went pro
two years of surgery
i missed my window
limped through law school instead
a lawyer huh
like its a disease too bad
but at least youre surfing now
so your lifes not over yet right
utah in shorts and t shirt carries his flame job surfboard past surveillance cameras and portraits of bush hoover and webster
special agent cole walks by
eyes the board
like totally rad stick dude
utah tries to act casual as he carries the board to his desk on the other side of the room
he has to walk past the entire gauntlet to get there
rip it up
harp comes straight for him like a homing missile
how was the beach
surf conditions okay
a little mushy
a little mushy
you think the taxpayers would like it utah if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls
the correct term is babes sir
uh this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech
otherwise penetration is not possible sir
of the social infrastructure i mean
harp inhales through his nose
a bad sign
where is pappas
utah points across the room
pappas sitting behind his desk in his surf this t shirt and pink shorts lifts the purple vuarnets like tom cruise in risky business
looks directly at harp
type a suppressed rage
utah and pappas endure harps wrath
special agent utah this is not some job flippin burgers at the drive in
yes the surfboard bothers me
yes your approach to this case bothers me
and yes you bother me
you two have produced squat in the last two weeks during which time the ex presidents have robbed two more banks
do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me
caught my first tube this morning
pappas signals unseen by harp for utah to shut the fuck up
johnny and angelo walking
what you couldnt have just left the thing in your car
it sticks out so i cant lock it
look angelo you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf
this was your lame o idea in the first place
you gotta back me up on this
johnny all i can say is we better come up with something real soon
johnny cocks an eyebrow and opens the door to the computer room ceremonially like a doorman at the ritz carlton
miss deer looks up as they enter
tight on crt as a lab report scrolls up the screen
gas chromatography and spectroanalysis
columns of elements and compounds listed as percentage of sample
encino savings loan guard grabbed lbjs ponytail
we recovered one hair
wider showing utah and pappas over her shoulder at the terminal
yeah yeah i remember last year
guy got his jaw broken for it
one four centimeter strand
hell whatre we waiting for lets go pick the guy up
angelo pay attention
theres gonna be a test afterward
lab is showing traces of toxins
selenium titanium and arsenic
guys the toxic avenger
utah is excited as he fits the pieces together for his partner
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills right
and surfers are territorial
they stick mostly to certain breaks
if we can get some hair samples and get a match to a certain beach wed know which break the ex presidents surf
you buyin this
but lets do it anyway
its gonna bug the shit out of harp
department of health sign reads beach temporarily closed
beyond it crashes a wasted northwest swell
two frustrated teenage surfers huddle underneath a towel
marijuana smoke seeps upward
a sandaled foot enters frame and taps their leg
angry heads poke up from beneath the towel nostrils and mouths billowing smoke
the two wear t shirts which read passion for slashin and psycho stick
pappas smiles standing there in his beach wear trying to blend in
when you two are done makin out i need to talk to you
hey i aint no butt bouncer dude
were from the valley
mall babes n shit
the kids proudly high five
i just want to know if you surf here a lot
shit yeah like totally everyday when its jammin
what is this fucking narco entrapment or what dude
pappas flashes his fbi star
he whips out a pair of scissors
brandishes them like some over the hill jason
not exactly dudes
row of surfmobiles parked along a cliff facing the ocean doors open stereos blasting surfers hanging sitting on hoods
utah moves along the cars looking surfed out
hes tanned relaxed
hair starting to bleach out
one of the tribe
whoa brah easy now
utah bends close reaching for surf rats ear got some huge sucker crawling into your he plucks at a tuft of hair got it
leave some fuckin hair man
utah squashes then inspects the mysterious creepy crawler hidden in his palm
he wipes his hand on his towel which he keeps balled up in his other hand
what was it
saved your butt bro
utah shivers in disgust then coyly turns and walks away
the surf rat desperately pats his ear for traces
a long series of envelopes are displayed on a desk
each has the name of a southern california beach and is attached to a forensic printout
halsey inspects each envelope
naw this isnt it
utah holds up an envelope with a skinny woven ponytail sticking out
halsey picks up an envelope marked latigo beach
pcbs selenium titanium arsenic
the percentages look right
heres a match
pappas grabs the envelope studies it crooks his head
surfs up ace
extreme long lens scans the beach from a height
a gray miserable day
beach crowd thin except for diehards
the image drifts across faces bodies
surfers walking with boards
talking sitting with pubescent girls
the image settles on johnny astride his board bobbing beyond the break
on pappas scanning with powerful binoculars from his car
close on utah out among the flock of hardcore surfers
ostensibly waiting for a wave his eyes search the others around him clicking methodically from face to face
finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a ride
the modest wave carries him toward the beach as he balances tense and style less
he passes someone weve seen before
the razorhead from the first day
in concentration johnny doesnt see the guy
but razorhead definitely sees him
johnny reaches the beach and jogs up the sand
he picks up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair
a glimpse of the walkie talkie hidden beneath
big zippo so far
how about you
itll be subtle if its here at all
pappas watches as johnny crosses toward the outside shower next to the public restroom
long lens view of utah passing out of sight behind the building
at the shower johnny sets down his gear and opens his wetsuit to the warm salt free jet of water
tracking slowly in on him as he lets it pour over his face
a hand enters frame shutting off the water suddenly
tight on utah his eyes opening
reverse revealing razorhead and three others
they are powerfully built surf nazis
scalps shaved on the sides
hair military short on top lengthening into pigtails in the back
tone archbold and warchild
the one who socked utah before is bunker
they spread out flanking him
this the guy
good natured okay so this is where you tell me all about how locals rule and yuppie insects like me shouldnt be surfing your break and all that right
waste of time
were just going to fuck you up
as they lunge utah grabs his board and swings it in a whistling roundhouse
its edge slams warchild in the gut and folds him double
the bad news is
warchild gets an arm around it and brings a pile driver hammer punch down
the board splits into two pieces
utah drops his end as the others close
a flurry of punches and kicks most of which he blocks
but hes lost the offensive
bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate style side kick
tight on utahs towel talking with pappas voice
angelo gets out of the car fast
he jogs twenty feet and raises the binoculars
catches a glimpse of the carnage around the edge of the building
breaks into a run massive legs pistoning
johnny hits the ground hard
he rolls and comes up fast
the razorhead brothers are a little surprised
the dude can fight
warchild grabs utah from behind
gets him in a headlock
archbold and tone pin his arms
bunker starts working him like a practice bag
at this moment johnny is getting the proverbial shit beat out of him
suddenly a new figure blurs into frame
bodhi seizes bunker and flings him aside
he spins with remarkable agility and drives his heel into warchilds face
utah breaks free staggering back on the sand
the fight is still there in his eyes
bodhi is at his side holding the others at bay with a raised hand and an evil look
just let it go
stay outta this bodhi
hes with me
now back off
just do it
they relax slightly you alright warchild
holding his bleeding nose fuck you
everybody has backed off a bit panting
utah steps toward bunker
like hes maybe going to shake hands
whats your name
well listen bunker
im actually kinda glad you found me
johnny answers with a lightning roundhouse that hits with a crack
they can hear it in pomona
bunker hits the ground
tone archbold and warchild lunge like dogs
bodhi yanks utah out of the line of fire
hold it ladies
give it a rest
to utah lets go
he literally turns utah around
they begin to walk stepping over the pieces of johnnys board
under his breath do me a favor johnny just keep walking
tone starts to go after them
archbold grabs his arm
they help bunker up
warchild holds he bleeding nose
utah and bodhi start up the stairs turn a corner and run head on into a huffing pappas
the big man clocks a battered but intact utah
we see him shift gears in his head in tenths of a second
out of breath uh you guys seen a kid maybe running with a car stereo
stole the fucking cd too you believe it
utah is grateful for the cover
no but there are four guys back there you might check out
he shoves on
bodhi and utah weave among the cars and motorcycles beach types coming and going
friends of yours huh
the one you decked is bunker wiess
the big one is his brother warchild
the other two always hang
they think theyre some kinda death squad around here
whats their program
their brains are wired wrong
they hurt surfing because they give nothing back and they have no respect for the sea
they just want to get radical
its mindless aggression
theyll never get it the spiritual side of it
you always talk like this
youre not gonna start chanting or anything are you
beat so i was up the beach
i saw it going down
you didnt hesitate
they never backed you up an inch
thats rare in this world
thanks for stepping in
bodhi keeps on walking as utah reaches his car and stops
five paces on he stops and turns back
a moment of decision
gonna be some people at my house tonight
maybe you can make it
come with tyler
bodhi turns and saunters away
utah considers his last words wondering how well tyler and bodhi know each other
utah is struggling into a t shirt as pappas drives intently following a beat to shit jeep
paramilitary olive drab and full of surfboards
ten seconds youre out of sight
johnny is equipment juggling now
cradling a cellular phone at his ear while steadying pappas binoculars in front of his eyes
youre losin them
into phone thats right
two denver four sam niner five niner
late seventies jeep
long lens johnnys pov through binoculars
bunkers jeep weaves aggressively through traffic ahead
tone flips off the driver of a toyota
look if youre gonna go leavin your piece and your shield in the car you can damn well stay in sight
low rent street off washington
extreme long lens on jeep as it pulls onto the dead front lawn of a brown stucco house with bars on the windows
the razorheads get out pulling boards and wetsuits from the jeep
they are dressed now in ripped jeans gi boots sleeveless megadeth t shirts etc
watching we become aware that two of them have brown hair in a radical style
shaved sides and a short ponytail
the jeep is registered to a bradley wiess
guys got quite a sheet
into phone yeah yeah
skip all that
gimme the greatest hits
misdemeanor possession of cocaine
utah on the cellular pappas behind the wheel as they slide to a stop half a block from the stucco house
felony b and e three months in juvey
postgraduate work at chino
im lovin it
what about the brother
utah is grinning great
another model citizen
these guys really fit the profile
remember all bank robbers are losers but not all losers are bank robbers
long lens pov of razorheads house
through the windows we see the four moving inside
tone throws archbold and bunker a coors from the fridge
archbold shakes his and opens it in warchilds face
warchild in no mood slams him against the wall
we feel the revved up chaotic energy of the group in silent pantomime
bunker is met by a girl coming from the back of the house
she is wearing only panties and a black leather vest
short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin
bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace and slides his other hand under her vest
tone pulls the curtains
these are the guys
i can feel it
i say we lay it on harp
telephoto view of house
bunker and archbold have partially disassembled the engine of a kawasaki parked in the living room
they are drinking beer and arguing about the carburetors lit by the blue glow of the tv
warchild is watching a living dead movie on tape
he replays the gory parts
not a happening night at the razorheads
reverse as binoculars are lowered revealing cole
wider to show the dynamic team of cole and munoz glowering in a plain sedan utah leaning in the side window
this is bullshit
this is a bullshit lead
this is totally bullshit
harp must be fucking desperate if hes listening to you two flakes
see you bright and early guys
pappas walks up with a grease stained box
jams it through the window
its great for breakfast
pappas pulls away from the curb roaring past the other agents sedan
utah and cole flip each other off perfunctorily as they pass
when did harp say theyd have the warrant
hes pushing it through first thing
you better get some sleep tonight it could be an interesting morning
a bunker like structure built of stone and glass on a cliff overlooking the pacific
surfmobiles and motorcycles parked in front
a strong backbeat thumps through the open front doors
tylers porsche pulls into the driveway
she and johnny get out and head for the entrance
he rents it for the summer
bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around
most a these guys cant keep a job
when the swell comes theyre gone they have to ride
tyler leads utah through the steady flow of surf rats and other pch nomads toward a large outdoor deck where a barbecue is in progress
moonlit waves pound the shore eighty feet below
they are immediately distracted by the small crowd gathering around grommet who has his nose pressed flat against the center of a dart board
his eyes swivels back to roach standing fifteen feet away dart in hand getting ready to throw
do your worst man
roach drains a beer in one gulp spies the sharp needle point of the dart then squints at the target
rosie moves through the small crowd collecting bets
suddenly roaches arm snaps back
a collective hush
in a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is airborne
centimeters from flesh
grommet secretly exhales
roach howls as rosie rains money on his head
the crowd goes wild
bodhi stands nearby with his arm around a beautiful woman
pleased to see utah he motions him over
dont you gamble
only make bets i cant afford to lose
only way to be committed
with that bodhi smiles then he and the woman vanish into the crowd
utah watches them go turns to tyler
whos the girl
catch of the day
that sounds personal
people are expendable to bodhi
meaning you were expendable
shrugs we went out for about five minutes
which is four minutes longer than most of them
but you cant hold it against him hes
sure hes the bodhisattva
she chuckles yeah he thinks hes evolved to a higher plane of existence or something
thoughtful maybe he has
youve seen him surf
it seems like anger
its the energy of lovemaking
the sea is the woman in his life
shes his only true lover
utah studies her a moment
hes caught the faintest hint of regret in her voice
but also the straight ahead pragmatism
he looks down at the waves pounding mercilessly against the rocks
all she does is beat the shit out of me
lingering surf rats stoned and drunk
nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck corona in hand gazing out at the black water
he grins sloppily body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a surfing stance
beer soaked speech okay so youre in the face its twenty five feet straight down your balls are about this big
like hes holding up two bbs and the whole things moving right roaring like youre stuck to the front of a freight train
there aint nothin like it man
the ultimate rush
forget about sex it doesnt even come close
you lose it right then youre history
the fishll be pickin you outta the coral
nathaniel cackles that absurd pee wee herman laugh
he starts to flail arms pinwheeling
utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him back
nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck
matter of factly thanks brah
tyler sits next to johnny sipping a beer
bodhi is not in sight
see its all dynamic its all in motion
you cant just stop and walk on in to the beach if you dont like the way things are going y know what i mean
you gotta ride it out man all the way
you ride the monsters you gotta know youre ridin a line between life and death
there aint no forgiveness
so whats the biggest
no bells beach australia
bodhi glides into the group and sits his expression dark and enigmatic
the beautiful girl kneels behind him massaging his neck
he seems not to notice
i remember that day
gnarly fuckin ass
was your birthday the set was northwest
jacking up like a fucking mountain of gray glass i made that one mistake you pray youll never make you shoulda fuckin seen it
it was like he fell for ever
then the curl crashes down and hes gooone held down in the washing machine man
it was severe we couldnt see nothin thought it was all over for sure nathaniel howls
tyler watches utah watching bodhi
notices how he is mesmerized by these war stories
bodhi smiles unexpectedly
not tragic to die doing what you love
you want the ultimate thrill you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price
draining a corona hell i aint gonna see
he and nathaniel slap a warm brotherly handshake
utah notices that tyler is giving him a dark look
she gets up suddenly and walks away from the group
to the surfers covering uh
i need another beer
he heads out after tyler
johnny moves through the house looking for her
as he passes the den he sees tyler standing inside and goes into the dark room
it is the only personalized space we have seen in the house
a kind of shrine to the bodhisattva
shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels
maori masks a blowgun a skeletal shark mouth two feet across a huge fossil ammonite
an unbelievable variety of tribal artifacts and marine specimens
the books include political literature eastern religion philosophy
a strange hodgepodge of titles and authors nietzsche marx the tao steal this book the book of five rings frederick forsyth thrillers
tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and johnny walks up behind her
shots of bodhi surfing a monster wave mountain biking skydiving flying an ultralight airplane bungee cord jumping cliff diving
every kamikaze activity in the book
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies
i hope youre not buying into this banzai bullshit like the rest of bodhis moonies
what are you talking about
ive seen that kamikaze look johnny
youve got it
and bodhi can smell it a mile away
hell take you to the edge
and past it
she looks past johnny sees something hey bodhi
bodhi is in the doorway
johnny has his own demons dont you johnny
bodhi seems to stare into him
utah breaks the look
turns back to the photo gallery
bodhis eyes swivel
he ponders something
looks at tyler
roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway wondering what happened to their leader
he turns to them
gentlemen its time
hoot and cheers
everyone bursts into motion
yelling and running through the house
whats goin on
swells here johnny
bodhi always knows
bodhi returns from another room with
an all black surfboard
it gleams like obsidian
near the tip in small gray letters it says stealth fighter
bodhi thrusts it into johnnys hands
the others whoop maniacally
johnny feels the challenge
the pull of the tribe
lets go utah
time for a little stealth mission
six dark figures walk toward us out of shafts of light
the headlights of bodhis chevy wd and tylers porsche
the figures are bodhi johnny tyler and the other surfers
rosie hangs back with the idling vehicles tattooed arms crossed
he puffs on a cigarette
a wide shot matte of the beach shows a pool of light from the headlights beyond it a vast silver ocean under a black sky
the full moon casts the world in cold monochrome
the little figures reach the sea
a voice in the distance gaping barrels
way overhead man
closer as moonlit figures run into the water
utah stands on the beach hoping his eyes will adjust
i can barely do this in broad daylight
at least no ones gonna see how bad you are
johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the water
he strokes powerfully out through the black swell
utahs ebony board pierces the wave and he slides down the backside to where the others are waiting
roach and nathaniel silhouettes nearby see one they like and take off yelling
johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him
i gotta be fucking crazy
yeah but are you crazy enough
grommet gets a ride slicing across in front of them
a ghost moving off into the silvery distance
tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one
its johnnys turn
footballs a man made game
you keep score with numbers
but in this theres no field no rules no opponent
just you and the wave
i know that part
tell me something i can use here
ive watched you once or twice
you surf like its some kind of street fight
you jerk along from moment to moment fighting everything that comes at you
always trying to win
a flaw im working on
the only way to win out here is to surrender
you have to feel what the wave is doing accept its energy get in sync
just feel it all moving in the blackness
you dont need to see
yeah right vision is highly over rated
bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline
without looking back he senses the incoming swell
this ones got your name on it johnny
huge glassy face perfectly formed
black and terrifying
bodhi digs in with both hands driving himself forward
johnny starts grabbing water right behind him
the wave picks them up
shit im gonna die
im gonna die now
johnny uses the patented tyler pop and makes it to his feet
suddenly hes going like a shot
he moves back on the board trims out slowing down
maintains a fragile control
on pure adrenalized instinct heart pounding he falls in behind bodhi taking the same line along the roaring black face
bodhi is like the silver surfer ahead of him in the moonlight
not wanting to drop too far behind johnny walks a little forward on the board
the nose dips picking up speed
johnny starts letting the speed work for him learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face
feeling the water under his feet the tons of water piling up behind him
feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it
the silver surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night
utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face
bodhi looks back
gives him a thumbs up
then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom slashing back and climbing
utah tries it feels the drop like freefall
feels the speed
he makes his bottom turn nearly falling
the grin dropping off his face
he falls in behind bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing
tyler paddling back out watches them shoot past her
utah raises his arms above his head and howls like a gonzo wolf as they go by
she grins to herself watching him
knows hes gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life
rosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement firepit
angle through the heat haze above the flames
tyler punches through a few feet away
she paddles toward him coming alongside
you had enough
i just want to sit out here for a minute
he watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle swell between sets lifts and drops them
his face is somehow childlike
a slow grin spreads itself across his face
look at you
well usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration like youre doing this for a school project or something
i dont know like somethings driving you
she puts her fingertip to his forehead see its gone
if i didnt know better id say you looked almost happy
i dont know
i cant describe what im feeling
smiling you dont have to
her face seems luminous in the moonlight
the ocean silver
the shore a shimmering line of gold
the sky black velvet
utah turns to tyler eyes exploring her as in a dream
water beads on her dark skin like crawling diamonds
he glides closer holding her board like an uneasy horse alongside his
he runs his fingertips down her arm
she leans closer and he rubs his hands up and down her arms warming her
his hands stop on her shoulders
he pulls her to his mouth
her tongue meets his
she wants this
he is surprised by the fierceness of her kiss which overwhelms his
tight on the zipper of her shorty wetsuit as johnnys fingers draw it down
slowly down to where it ends between her legs
he spreads the front and slips his hands inside along her ribs
those are cold
warm them up
she moves his strong hand onto her breast
his fingers massage her cold stiffened nipple
she moans and grabs his wet hair in her other hand pulling him into another intense kiss
looking up from the bottom we see the silhouettes of two boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight
camera tilts down to show the bottom
the dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks
a big shark browses gracefully ignoring the lovers
their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored
tylers porsche stands alone in an empty lot
her surfboard sticks up in back next to utahs stealth fighter
rosies fire is burning low
tyler half wrapped in a blanket from the car straddles johnny on the sand like she straddles her board
the blanket slips down
naked silhouettes in the firelight
she arches her back as they move together in prefect sync
grips his shoulders and stares into his face her teeth bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain
she makes love like she does everything
with honesty and intensity
utah surprisingly is gentle and slow
he strokes her hair after she collapses onto him
ecu johnny as he cracks one eye open registering the dawn light
he bolts up looking around
tyler is asleep beside him with the quilt from the car pulled up tight to her chin
she looks radiant in sleep
he grabs his watch out of the sand and looks at it
long lens on utahs sedan fishtailing through the alley narrowly missing dumpsters and parked cars
he pulls up next to several unmarked fbi sedans
no one in sight
utah jumps out tucking in yesterdays shirt stuffing his beretta into his waistband
he also shoves a small leather case into his belt
utah pulls open the door to one of the unmarked cars and rips a walkie talkie out of the charging rack on the front seat
running he passes a gate
his pov four men huddled behind a garage
cole munoz and two other agents
all with guns and walkie talkies
whispering you guys need any help
not amused youre late
we hear pappas voice over the radio
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up
grinning right here partner
pappas has his shirt hiked up as another agent babbit tapes a microphone transmitter to his stomach
pappas talks into his top button
good of you to join us hotshot
to babbit watch it
i told you not on the hairs goddammit
babbit moves the transmitter putting the tape on differently
im ready to rock angelo
where you want me
cole and munoz are going in the back door
babbit is backing me
so i want you at the side window by the hedge
youre strictly backup got it
get into position
pappas pulls the loose hawaiian shirt down over the radio mike gear and his stalwart
he steps out from behind a fence and walks along the sidewalk toward bunkers house two doors down
he is wearing polyester shorts and sandals and carrying a dog here scooby
where are you boy
you furball piece of shit
cole and munoz snap around the corner of the garage and sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house
utah circles back out through the alley
tracking with him as he makes it to the neighbors back hedge and crab walks toward bunkers house
babbit and another agent make it to the front corner of the stucco house staying out of sight of the windows
angelo is walking up to the falling down porch of this low rent roach hotel
johnny is elbow crawling between the house and a tall hedge
he slides quietly in below a bedroom window
he pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband
removes something from it
a dental mirror
moving slowly he raises it above the window sill angling it where he can see inside
tight on dental mirror johnnys pov
we see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind
tone is lying on the bed wearing headphones
cranked up speedmetal
his eyes are screwed shut and his fists pump to the beat like karate on volts
the door to a bathroom is open and the black haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass
tight on doorbell as pappas rings it
utah jumps at an explosion of sound
he spins in a microsecond pistol aimed at
a lawn mower
through the hedge we can just see the neighbor sixtyish and polyester clad as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from johnnys face
utah exhales and lowers the gun
wipes sweat from his eyes
tight on pappas smiling open faced and goofily charming as
the door opens revealing a girl we havent seen before
she has hair like bleached fiberglass black eye makeup and nails
ramones style wardrobe
she looks tense and wont open the door very far
have you seen a little dog
kind of a cockapoo lookin thing
about this big
utah blinks at what he sees
his pov in the little mirror
like a silent pantomime under the roar of the mower he sees bunker and warchild come flying into the room
they are hyper and manic
bunker leaps clear over the bed
grabs a combat shotgun from the closet
throws it to warchild
tone is oblivious
bunker thumps him in the chest and tone leaps up like an overwound toy gaping what the fuck
we read his lips saying
bunker grabs a steyr assault rifle white knuckled while tone fumbles around and comes up with a
into his headset babbit
get angelo out of there
theyre pulling out a fucking arsenal
babbit you copy
dont let him pull his badge
cole and munoz push their earpieces in deeper
utah say again
to cole i cant hear jack shit over this lawnmower
in the bedroom bunker looks through a slit of door at fiberglass
we hear pappas just outside
and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard
my wifell kill me if i lose the little bastard
me i could care less
whole house smells from its liftin its leg all the time
bunker looks like hes on paranoia overdrive
somethings goin down man
this aint right
freaked no man its nothin
will you shut the fuck up
check the windows
utah sucks up against the wall as warchild looks furtively out the window
we see them both but warchild doesnt see johnny plastered right below him
johnny closes his eyes and grits his teeth
pappas at the front door is bobbing his head trying to look inside
you sure he isnt out back
you mind if i go take a look
look i dont know anything about your dog okay well is there anyone else here that might have seen him
theres nobody else here
warchild slams into the wall next to bunker
theres two guys by the back door
were fucked man
that fat fuck comes through the door im gonna pump him up
swear to christ man im gonna blow the dude up
scared and vicious like a cornered dog
we believe him
bunker jacks the bolt on the steyr
warchild cocks the shotgun
johnny is pissing himself
he can see it all going down
so fast he doesnt have time to think
he goes into motion slipping rapidly along the wall to the next window
the bathroom window
pappas at the front door makes his move
he pushes the door open breaking the security chain and jams his fbi shield in the girls face as he grabs her arm
now lets take a look around bunkers eyes bug out as he sees pappas coming through the door
he snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder
suddenly johnny is behind him half in the bathroom window pistol gripped double handed like they taught him in quantico
bunker whips around
squeezing off a wild burst
b b b it rips the plaster next to johnnys shoulder
shatters the shower door behind him
the black haired girl screams
johnny flinches firing rapidly
bunker drops hit
warchild lets go with the gauge
takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by johnnys head
deafening in the confined space
johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe
tone just splits
down the hall like a greyhound
pappas is on one knee his piece drawn fast holding fiberglass in a neck lock with one massive arm
bunker wild eyed and bleeding is on his knees in the bathroom doorway
he raises the steyr
years in the field tends to show
bunker is off the planet
munoz kicks the backdoor in like they do in the movies
he and cole charge into the rancid kitchen
badass fbi agents
johnny hotwired and hyperventilating pops out for a shot around the doorframe
he gets a glimpse of warchilds back disappearing into the hallway
his shot is wasted punching plaster
suddenly a pink freight train hits him
he forgot about the girl in the shower
naked except for her tattoos she bodyslams him face first into the wall
as he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and hammers his head into the medicine cabinet crash shattering the mirror
then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her
she drives her elbow into his back as he drops
freight train lands knee first on his gun hand and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot
it skitters under the bed
shes cut up from flying glass
demon eyed and wired her body lithe and muscular under white skin
she sprints across the bedroom leaving utah slumped heaving for breath
in the hallway tone is hidden behind a doorway
white knuckling the forty five
a wild eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it
he hears footsteps pounding behind him and spins
its warchild running with the shot gun
move it man
lets get the fuck out of here
off guard tone is slammed by the door as munoz drives into it with his shoulder
pounded between the door and wall tone is wired so tight he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own right foot
he screams and drops to the floor
munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on warchild who dives into a doorway
cole drives past munoz who has tone pinned and pounds down the corridor
cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on warchild
freight train appears behind him from another door
she raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt
pulls them out going for another stab when pappas spins her around and slams her face first into the wall
utah in the bedroom sees warchild blur across his field of vision
on pure instinct he kicks into overdrive
johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic
his flying tackle catches warchild at the window
the window explodes outward in a spray of sunlit glass
utah and warchild crash to the ground
the razorhead with pounds on johnny rises like a bull
bleeding from superficial lacerations warchild plows through the hedge
johnny dives after him
the polyester neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him
he is knocked flying and the roaring lawnmower is flipped onto its side
utah and warchild are locked together
the shotgun lies nearby out of play
warchild jerks a inch knife free from its sheath hanging from a thong around his neck
he trusts straight at johnnys throat
johnny deflects the thrust into the whirling lawnmower
the knife is hammered out of warchilds hand
whistles away spinning
warchild grabs johnny as they scramble and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade
utah catches the rim of the mower with both hands stopping himself inches from the rotor
warchild puts all his weight on johnny
pushing him face first toward the blades
johnny feels the wind on his face
the engine is roaring full throttle
he aims the
the little briggs stratton dies young its casing shattered
the rotor spins to a stop
warchild looks up into the black eye of pappas gun
two inched from his face
speak into the microphone
the razorhead sags the fight going out of him
babbit kicks him off johnny face down onto the lawn
utah dry heaves over the sink
turns the faucet on full blast and hoses his head
he lifts a dripping face wipes water out of his eyes stops on the reflection in the mirror
pappas is there
its always been lasers and paper targets until today right
utah looks up at him and nods
he glances through the doorway at bunker dead in a pool of blood
tone is wailing as paramedics work on his foot
cole is being taken out on a stretcher
no difference utah
just a little more to clean up
squeezes the rookies shoulder its alright
you did good today
across the bedroom agent babbit rips the back off a big speaker unit
behind it taped to the woofer are two large packets of a white substance
utah stares at the dope
tight on warchild manacled to the chair screaming his head off
we cannot hear him through the glass
it looks like pantomime
utah and pappas watch through the one way observation window
the two taped packets slam the wall inches from utahs right ear
johnny snaps his head around
stares into the face of dietz who looks like warchilds meaner brother
and hes pissed as hell
you know what this is
two keys uncut crystal meth
what the hells your problem
dietz manically grabs a clump of his stringy hair
you think i like this haircut
my wife wants me to stay at ramada i been working on these guys for three months
finally finally nodding to warchild i get dickwad in there wantin to play wheel of fortune so i can find out their supplier
harp emerges from the interrogation room we hear a sliver of warchilds battle cry
he spies utah
this is agent dietz dea
hes got a record of your suspects movements every day for the last three months
stabbing the air with the packets all i wanna know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up tarzana city national on august nd when they are in
fort fucking lauderdale august nd
not an easy thing to do is it utah
nice tattoo dietz
we hear a faint buzz growing louder as we
the doorbell buzz shrieks through the room
a ghostly dawn finds utah and tyler sleeping peacefully limbs entwined like vines
johnnys eyes snap open
spies the clock
tyler stirs beside him coming out of sleep
johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to the door
bodhi stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin
behind him nathaniel roach and grommet hoot from the pickup
cmon brah theres a righteous swell
tyler comes into the room wrapped in a sheet
utah sees her knowing smile
he does this
a misty predawn bled of all color
steel gray tones
the ocean vanishes in the fog a few feet from shore
tyler and johnny carrying their boards walk toward the water
come on utah
everybodys out there catchin all the good rides
she realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her like a great weight has dragged him to a halt
whats wrong johnny
goes back to him youre like a different person
he stares at her
his expression dark
wrestling with something
i am a different person tyler
he lets out a long breath and looks away out to sea
the water receding into a backlit wall of mist
figures appear faint silhouettes in the fog
shades of gray in the gray
in slow motion they weave hypnotically across the screen their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other
stacked up by the extreme long lens bodhi roach grommet and nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical grace
in suspended time we see them hooting and grinning at each other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other
challenging each other in mock combat
so good their boards slash past each other with inches to spare
there is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration
bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art
for the first time we see the core group of bodhis tribe by themselves
it dawns on us
there are four of them
and at that moment nathaniel drops in front of bodhi laughing at the near miss and drops his pants in a nasty wig wagging moon
tracking slowly in on johnny staring mouth open
watching the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride toward him
in slow motion bodhi grins as he slashes past nathaniels shining white butt
on johnny as he reacts to the dawning certainty
he feels weak dizzy
like the ground is moving under him
you look like you saw a ghost
shock cut angelo turning toward him at the drop car scene
the sound of his voice ringing
forget about it kid theyre ghosts
back to johnny as he backs away from tyler
still in shock recoiling from the situation
i gotta go
whats going on
i dont get it
did i do something
i have to go
ill call you later
he sets off running up the beach
tyler stares after him
confused and hurt
utah pulls into the driveway
when he kills the engine we hear greek music from inside the house
at the entrance johnny finds the door ajar
he pushes it open a little to reveal pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt off holding a glass of ouzo
facing away from the door the ample greek hears utahs tentative knock
without breaking from his dance or turning he calls out hey babe
get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark
pappas howls like a bloodhound then twirls around
we see the startled pappas at a loss for the first time
uh you uh
should call first you know
hey where the hell were you all day
you gotta at least call in or something
angelo we gotta talk
pappas moves toward him kind of subconsciously herding utah back out the door
if youre okay can it wait till tomorrow morning kid johnny hears footsteps and turns
miss deer comes through the door like its not the first time carrying a bag of groceries
angie they didnt have the kind of wine you like but i got
oh hi johnny
her icy office persona obviously got left there
her hair is unbound and flows around her shoulders and in halter top and jeans she looks delectably off duty
angelo looks at utah like dont you say a fucking word
a few minutes later
utah and pappas leaning on his car
the younger agent seems to have regained his hunt down fever
so i started tailing him
this zen master surfer
im on him all day right
he goes here he goes there he goes to tower records and buys come cds he has lunch at patricks road house
mock casual he goes into the assured trust savings and loan
did he rob it
he was inside for about minutes
the other guy roach waited in the truck
they were scoping it out right
yeah or cashing a check
then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit
load it in bodhis truck and take it to a public storage unit
summers almost over
theyre gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow
the next day at the outside latest
i got a feeling
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man which i always hate because it looks bad on the report
im right this time
we can still win this one
angelo looks at the conviction in the other agents eyes
pappas sighs and puts a hand on johnnys shoulder
banks are closed
nothings gonna go down tonight right
so well be on these guys like white on rice
first thing tomorrow morning
pappas starts backing up like a long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him back into the house
long lens pov scanning bodhis house
there is a for rent sign out front
the driveway and carpet are empty
no vehicles in sight
son of a bitch
we missed them
utah lowers his binoculars
hes standing next to the car while pappas sits on the hood sipping coffee from a thermos
theyre on their way to maui
utah jumps in and starts the car
pappas is screwing the cap on the thermos
johnny puts the car in gear forcing angelo to scramble in as the car starts to roll
jesus christ kid
the banks dont open till nine
johnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters
long glittering lines and heat waves
i say we call it in
get some backup
but you gotta do it
harp wont listen to me
ill just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious
shit hell probably call out the national guard
i say we dont call it in
under no circumstance are we to call this in
look we handle it ourselves for right now okay
we cover the bank whatever
you and me
that way if nothing happens or more accurately when nothing happens
i dont get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are
slow pan from the facade of the bank halfway up the block to utahs sedan in the tight f
head flopped back over the seat angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page over his face
johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth time
whole lot of nothing going on
angelo slides the sports page down to his chin without otherwise moving
time for lunch
angelo its eleven thirty
that place up the street has meatball sandwiches
get me two
utah slides out of the car
feeling a little exposed he pulls his dodgers cap down a little tighter and adjusts his sunglasses
he trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the fast food stand nearby
pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun
on a long lens very stacked up we see johnny standing at the grody pick up window
he keeps looking at the bank visible b
the pick up window opens and food appears sliding out
utah turns pulling out his wallet
two meatball one tuna on wheat two lemonades
totals seven eighty four
as johnny is counting out the bills a burgundy thunderbird pulls up in front of the bank
the doors fly open
the ex presidents jump out
they sprint for the entrance
all this out of focus b
johnny misses it as he picks up the food order
the presidents disappear inside
johnny looks toward the bank again
there is no movement
reverse as utah walks back toward his car
pappas is still under the paper
he slides it down when he smells food
here yours is the one that looks like a road kill
utah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into pappas lap
still standing next to the car
heres your lemonade
he looks down the street did you see that t bird pull up
pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag unwrapping one end
without looking damn i could eat the ass out of an elephant
i shoulda had you get me three a these
what t bird
pappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls out of the end of the sandwich
it lands on the seat next to him
he looks at it
picks it up
pops it into his mouth and freezes mouth open
eyes focused on
the ex presidents in living color flashing through the doors of the bank feet away
johnny is so astounded he doesnt do anything for about two seconds
pappas coughs out his meatball eyes bugging
the presidents are piling into the car
johnny reacts characteristically
he whips out the beretta and yells fbi
nixon spins raising his shotgun
but reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand
shoves him into the car
then reagan jumps behind the wheel
the back wheels light up smoking as the t bird launches
he puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry
the t bird peels out into traffic clipping a subaru which locks them up and spins
come on kid get in the car
pappas reaches across starting the engine as johnny jumps in the drivers side
utah buries the throttle into the firewall and charges aggressively through the medium traffic
their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler fishtailing
it straightens out
no t bird in sight
the hell are they
they took a left at the next light
utah is totally wired
the adrenalin is kicking in flashing through his system
his brain is on turbo boost reacting a thousand times a second as they hit sixty through the traffic which seems to be standing still
i got em
i see em
im on it im on it
high speed slalom through cars and trucks
the world passes by in a hysterical blur
you even watching the road
a car pulls out straight ahead
utah swerves wildly mostly gets around him
the guys bumper and front grille are removed
utah does a smoking skid recovery
doesnt even slow down
the late model t bird is weaving manically
it makes a sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the fbi agents
utah cuts the wheel into a huge ralphs parking lot
utah center punches a weeks supply of groceries in a cart
the presidents hold on desperately as reagan white knuckles it through civilian traffic
theyre looking all around trying to see where utah went
where are they man
i dont see em
we lose em
through the windshield we see an airborne utah hurtling from a ralphs entrance
the sedan lands on the street tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the undercarriage
an instant later it hammers into the side of the t bird
the two cars spin out of control
utah cuts the wheel slamming into them again
side by side demolition derby
utah hits them again
the presidents lose control jumping a curb losing the right front tire in the process
utahs car starts to swap ends
hit the center island broadside
the sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass
screech of steel on concrete as it comes to rest
hanging upside down pappas is mightily pissed off
nice fuckin work hotshot
they can see the t bird still moving
it slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on flapping rubber
johnny shimmies out of the wreckage sliding on his back in broken glass
pappas is packed in upside down wriggling to get out through the side window
a tight fit
the presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing tire
here we go
the t bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a smoking stop at one of the pump islands
the presidents explode out of the car in a blur
reagan bodyslams a teenager putting gas in his mustang
he flips his big pistol to lbj as the other presidents charge past him
nixon jumps behind the wheel of the mustang
lbj and jfk pile in
reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car
he pulls out a zippo lighter
reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it
he flicks the flame
then pulls the trigger on the nozzle
like an impromptu flame thrower the nozzle spews a twenty foot jet of fire which engulfs the t bird in an instant
any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated
customers are running screaming
nixon has the mustang fired up
move it ronny
ronnys eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the scene with the jet of fire
you can see it getting good to him
in a second hes going to blow up the whole block
but hes getting his rocks off
he sets two other cars on fire
in a flying tackle utah catapults reagan off his pins
they roll skidding across the oily concrete
spraying wild the fire swirls around the pump island
out of the black smoke pappas charges like an angry bull his snubnose held high
nixon sees him and floors it
the mustang smokes out of the gas station as pappas shots blow out the back window
utah and reagan roll away from the blaze
johnnys pants are burning
he gets to his knees in time for reagans kick to take him square in the solar plexus
he folds in half
drops to the cement
reagan kicks him again and takes off running
the president is burning
his suit jacket is ablaze
he shucks out of it as he runs
gasping johnny rapidly slaps his jeans
puts himself out
he comes up running pulling his beretta
sees the back of reagans head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station
a non descript l
commercial buildings on one side walled suburb on the other
two men running all out
a recent president and a wild eyed cop trailing smoke like a crashing jet fighter
beyond the buildings behind them a fireball explodes skyward
we hear sirens and shouting which recede as the two pelt along the alley
it gets quieter
just the machine gun slap of the shoes on pavement and the hard breathing of the two men each in overdrive going all out in long blurring strides
reagan looks back
sees the demon cop behind him gaining
utah has become an engine a running machine
ahead of them a black and white swings into the alley
reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off its hinges
utah whips through the gate a second later
diving into suburbia
it becomes a blur
pure kinetic energy
two meteors rocketing through a low rent suburb
and god help anyone who gets in the way
reagan crosses a cluttered backyard
broken field run through toys swing set stacks of god knows what
he runs through a mr
turtle pool in an explosion of spray
crashes through a hedge
through the narrow gap between houses
utah powers into the tight space behind him
blurring along between stucco walls
they emerge into the front yard
a woman watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and falls down
reagan and utah both hurdle her
ahead kids on bikes racing along the sidewalk
reagan dodges the first utah slams into the next two
he crashes rolling tangled up in bikes and squawking teenagers
he comes out of a pile up somehow still in high gear
reagan flashes across the sunlit street
dodges in front of a garbage truck which locks up the brakes
it stops so fast one of the guys falls off the back
the guy is getting up as utah whips around the back of the truck
knocks him sprawling
utah doesnt stop
doesnt look back
like he doesnt see anything in the real world but the figure running ahead of him
like its some kind of hyperkinetic video game
everything is a blur
suburbia smeared into staccato impressions
the house across the street is blocked by fence on both sides
a man is picking up his mail
reagan pounds past him
right through the front door of the house
panting as he sprints down a dark hallway
a woman with a basket of washing screams as reagan blasts past her knocking her flying
utah leaps over her sprawled legs
cats blur underfoot
utah crunches down on a tail
a cat explosion
screeching merges with the womans shrill shouts as utah slams the back screen door off its hinges
across the back yard
reagan looks back
sees utah still behind him like in a bad dream
he enters the next house
sliding glass door
utah sees reagan pull it closed
without breaking stride johnny grabs a potted plant off a patio wall
heaves it ahead of him
the glass burst into a wall of diamonds
utah blasts through a microsecond later
topples the kitchen table
furniture and crockery crashing everywhere
he sprints down a hallway after reagan
a fierce woman in a housecoat shouting at them as they pass holding a vacuum cleaner like its shot gun
get the fuck out of this house
what the fuck do you think youre doing around a corner
a vicious snarling sound
utah sees something flying at him
reflexively catches it
reagan has thrown a pit bull
the fierce womans fierce dog
utahs pov the snarling little demon right in his face
he drop kicks it like a goddamn field goal right through a doorway and runs on
another explosion of sunlight
sprinklers this time
reagan and utah running through sunlit walls of rain
they crash through another hedge
the ground drops away
slipping and sliding on iceplant they skid down a steep slope
reagan reaches bottom
a ten foot retaining wall dropping off like a cliff to pavement below
reagan falls landing on his feet
panting now feeling it he stumbles up and runs on
utah rips down through the iceplant like a human lawnmower
slides over the edge
falls lands hard
tight on his knee and slow motion
taking the impact
we hear something go
utah crashes to the pavement his face contorted with pain
he grabs his tortured knee with both hands
reagan runs on
they are in an enclosed storage yard of some kind
ten foot chainlink all around
utah struggles to get up and run
he sprawls forward biting back a howl of pain
we see the incredible will driving him on
he gets up and again hobbling
trying to run
reagan reaches the fence
he is heaving for breath
holding his side
utah stumbles gets up clutching his knee
his eyes wild the veins in his neck bulging
reagan starts to climb
utah collapses to his knees
he cant go on
reagan reaches the top of the fence
he looks back
twenty feet away
the muzzle rock steady
he cant miss
they both are frozen panting
locked into the moment
you want me theres only one way
pappas reaches the top of the hill feet away panting like hes about to collapse
he sees the tableau
ecu utahs finger on the trigger
rack to his eyes
blinking water running into them
god he wants to
ecu reagans eyes through the mask
locked with utahs
utah suddenly snaps his hand up and fires vertically
slumping back his shoulders slam down onto the concrete
straight arming the beretta he fires rapidly
bulleting the blue sky
high angle looking straight down on the tableau
reagan leaps off the fence and runs out of frame as utah empties the magazine straight at us the shots merging with his agonized howl echoing as we utah sits
next to the dispatcher waiting for news like a sailor in a storm
his leg is popped up on a chair with jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around his knee
his face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises
he drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen
pappas comes through the doors wiping the remains of dinner off his mouth
the dispatcher talks into his headset glances up at pappas shakes his head
go home kid
get the hell outta here
get some sleep
you look like shit
they get anything even resembles your guy im on your beeper
you like feta
he smiles warmly handing his younger partner a brown paper sack
managing a weary smile
lifts his body out of the chair turns to go
angelo ponders something
looks back at the man
all i wanna know is one thing why didnt you just take the shot
johnnys gaze turns inward
i dont know
utah sits on the bathroom floor as tyler dabs betadyne antiseptic over his wounds
betadyne doesnt hurt
youre kneeling on my hand
she laughs shifts her weight and keeps tending him
so whatd the other guy look like
never saw him was your basic hit and run
but you look like you been in a train wreck howd he just drive away
utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth wont quite form the words
tyler dabs his face touches a finger to his forehead
johnny what is it with you
you have that look again its like youre about to tell me something and then you dont
or you cant
whats going on
johnny searches her eyes
she stares at him becoming fragile suddenly
what do you want to tell me
utahs brow unfurls
the thought has passed
he slowly cups his hand over hers
gently pulling her close
im glad you pulled me out of the water that day
he presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead
a kiss to each downcast eye
searching out her mouth with his own as his hands glide down the small of her back
their reflection in the mirror as utah slowly lowers tyler to the bathroom floor
she clings tightly in a breathless kiss
a buddha in the moonlight bodhi sits crosslegged upon the cliff staring at the ocean
camera circles around him focusing in upon his eyes
utah asleep flopped in a spread eagled x
we hear the bedroom door opening see a slash of light fall across the bed
johnny doesnt stir
a shadow appears on the wall moving toward him
an outstretched arm holding a gun
utah snores softly sleeping like a baby
camera tracks in on his peaceful face
a single eyelid flutters
total silence until
the pillow beside him explodes into a blizzard of goosedown
johnny rears up eyes wide mouth agape
tyler stands above him recovering from the kick of the smoking mm beretta in her hand
you lied to me
she throws his fbi gold star at his face
look tyler i can boom
tyler squeezes off another round
cascading goosefeathers falling like snow
utah flinches sideways
jesus christ johnny youve been using me
your jackets on the floor in the bathroom this goddamn things half out of the pocket
oh god its all part of some case isnt it
tyler put the gun down
you tell me the fucking truth johnny
did your parents really die in a car crash
she waves the beretta in his face
they live in columbus ohio
tyler lowers the pistol slowly the strength leaving her
her face begins to flood with tears
i work bank robbery

i needed you at first but not fuck you johnny utah
dont you have a soul
goddamn you to hell
she goes limp as the sobs rack her body
the gun flops from her grip
utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot
he moves to gently comfort her
she bolts at his touch running from the bedroom
utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her
from the living room we hear a rattling of keys the front door opens and slams shut
he hobbles to the door favoring his knee
we hear the porsche screeching away
utah sags the breath coming out of him long and slow
utah on the bed staring up at the ceiling
phone cradled listening to hi its me
leave a message
he rests the telephone on his chest letting the tape roll a moment before he speaks
look i fucked up okay
i know i fucked up
i wanted to tell you but i couldnt i was afraid youd leave
good guess huh
grimacing fuck why cant i ever say what i really mean
i lied to you
im an asshole
but i need you tyler
i want you to know that ive never known anyone like you before in my life
i hope you change your mind
he cradles the receiver looks out the window
black of night
utah asleep telephone still perched on his bare chest
the rasp of the doorbell
johnny is airborne phone flying across the floor
hunting for his pants realizes they are already on limps in fast motion to the door
wait i whips it open
bodhi standing in the doorway smiling like an excited child
nathaniel roach and grommet are there behind him
they look like sentry dogs
bodhi walks past utah into the room
cmon get your gear on were rollin
cheerful hardly able to contain his exuberance
he moves through the room grabbing johnnys shirt from a chair a pair of sneakers on the floor
utah sees his fbi shield sitting on the dresser in plain sight
he palms it when bodhi is turned away and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it
what going on bodhi
bodhi plucks a couple socks off the couch hands them to utah
spying johnnys cut face hey what happened
ya cut yourself shaving
johnny meets bodhis cold stare
i dont think i wanna surf right now
bodhis face takes on a crazy glow
naw this is different johnny
this is something totally different
youre gonna love this
he winds an arm around johnnys shoulders guides him toward the door
cmon lets go lets go
times wastin brah
bodhi claps utah on the back ushering him outside
nathaniel roach and grommet fall into step beside them
the door closes behind them
camera drifts back through the apartment coming to rest on the mm beretta on the floor under the bed
the pickup is a funnel of dust along the desert road
black mountains against a silver sky
the tapedeck blasts
bodhi and utah sit inside the cab
through the rear window we see nathaniel roach and grommet in the flatbed
bodhi swivels his eyes to johnny lowers the volume
lifes sure got a sick sense of humor dont you think so johnny
face splitting into a shit eating grin
how you figure
slight laugh news last night
those guys the ex presidents
they robbed my bank yesterday
and i was just there the day before cashing a check
he takes a beat up checkbook off the dash and flips it to johnny
utah opens the cover and looks
assured trust savings and loan
i was picking up some bucks cause were leaving town
if id waited a day id been right in the middle of it
kinda sorry i missed it
id liked tove seen them
a long pregnant pause
utah breathes deeply remaining calm his voice carrying a chilling bravado
takes guts to rob a bank
all that adrenalin pumping waving loaded guns taking out the guards getting everybody on the floor never knowin whos gonna burst in
looks right at bodhi wondering what its like to take a bullet
must be some ride
utahs smile is a personal challenge
bodhi sits perversely intrigued
the mental warfare escalates
banks are insured brah
long as nobody gets shot its really a victimless crime
just gotta scare em a little would be my guess
ponders something now if i was gonna rob a bank with all those guys wearin body armor these days know what id carry
bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat
he pulls out a huge holstered handgun rests it in his lap draws and holds the gun up against his cheek
most powerful handgun on the planet
muzzle velocity of feet per second
twice the kinetic energy of a
bodhi stares at utah then flashes his signature smile
utah says coldly
one shot stopping
laughs one shot stopping
good very good
i like you johnny
i like you because youll sacrifice anything to win
i respect that
it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise
here hold it
check out the weight
he twirls the gun grabs the barrel and extends the handle to utah
johnny takes it slowly
now its aimed at bodhi
you got the muzzle pointing right at me brah
he casually pushes the barrel away looking back at the highway
johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a round into open desert
the recoil blows johnnys arm back over the top of the truck
practically breaks his wrist
thunder rolls across the dark hills
from the back of the pickup nathaniel howls
grommet and roach high five
johnny turns to bodhi breaking slowly into a feral grin
he hands the smoking weapon back to him
as if to say two can play this game
bodhi stands challenged
each snared in the others power
bodhi takes the weapon back casually
slips it under the seat
its a special day johnny u
a very special day
utahs gaze travels beyond the windshield
where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky
tight on a turbo prop engine roaring
wider reveals a big cessna twin
the pilot a weaselly guy we havent seen before fires up the second engine
the plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light
a desert airstrip near palmdale
a couple of aluminum siding hangers and no tower
a few other planes around but no activity besides bodhis rock steady crew
utah watches grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of bodhis truck and starts tossing out parachute packs
roach tosses one to bodhi who chucks it to utah
ever done this before
pure adrenalin right
the ultimate rush
other guys snort for it jab a vein for it all you gotta do is jump
sure its a blast but listen i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday yeah i noticed you limping
grins but dont worry about it brah
dont worry at all
were not gonna land on land
bodhi grabs his sleeve ushering him into the plane
oh well thats fine then
i feel so much better
utah sits wearing a day glo jump suit hugging the chute in his lap
next to him is the gaping door
a spectacular down sunburst at feet
roar of wind and engines
utah watches bodhi nathaniel grommet and roach wriggling into their colorful freefall suits
nathaniel pulls on a pair of purple shorts over his suit
looks real dorky
grommet has on duck feet
bodhi apparently is going to jump barefoot
nobody has their chutes on yet
johnny hefts his as if weighing it somehow judging the contents
his brain is racing
bodhi shouts over the roar
its a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer
one last speedstar
uh who packed my chute
whats the matter
dont trust me
you gotta earn trust
then well earn it together
here take mine
bodhi swaps chutes with johnny
utah looks at the new chute uncertainly
is this a game
did bodhi anticipate this step
you dont want bodhis man
his pack jobs suck
they only open half the time
take grommets man
roachs grin is evil as he grabs grommets chute out of his hands and switches it with johnnys
keeps that one and gives his to grommet
whoa unfair dude
grommet grabs his chute back and hands johnny the one he had which was roachs
johnny looks at the pack in his hands
then at the grinning faces
russian surfer freefall roulette
bodhi studying him
some kind of test
utah starts putting the damn thing on
we gonna jump or jerk off
multi colored figures explode from the plane
leaping into freefall
tumbling end over end
wearing headsets they hurtle downward
utah you copy bruddah
ill take that as a yes
one by one they stabilize
falling face down knees bent they angle their hands and feet minutely to move laterally
utah flails the last to trim out
but hes holding his own
grommet working his duckfeet pitches himself into a wild spin rotating like a dervish in a head down dive
he flares out and flies back to the others
rocketing through the void at mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world almost unmoving
on a separate plane of existence
a hurricane of wind
despite his terror johnny has to grin at nathaniel falling butt first like hes sitting on a big inner tube in the pool
whip it out dudes
cheap sex with the cosmos
ten thousand feet
lets do it
the group stabilizes moving together
first bodhi and roach link arms trimming constantly
nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and maneuvers toward them
he grabs roachs arm
grommet works his way next to nathaniel
they need utah to complete the ring
four faces beckoning to him distorted by the hurricane wind
come on johnny
get in here
johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily toward them
bodhi and grommet grab him
a perfect five man star
i got you i got you
righteous ass speedstar dudes
you diggin this
johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought
screaming down through the dawn sky at
locked into the ring
part of something
connected to these guys far above the planet
less far every second
bodhis chest altimeter reads feet
purty thirty and were meat waffles folks
see ya downtown
he releases roachs arm and the star disintegrates drifting apart
bodhi stays with utah falling parallel to the horizon facing each other holding hands
grommet pulls his ripcord
he seems to be jerked upward by a great force
suddenly he is far above a brightly colored disc of fabric
utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him
nathaniel pulls then roach
they shoot upward disappearing
bodhi and utah fall on alone
you gonna pull
after you alfonse
bodhi looks at utah
a slow grin
the meter on his chest harness reads ft
seconds to valhalla
dont screw around man pull it
you do it
one thousand feet
pull the goddamn cord
bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls utahs ripcord handle
he waves goodbye as johnnys canopy deploys
utah is jerked upward
he feels his weight hanging brutally in the harness
johnny looks down
impossibly close to the ground
bodhis canopy bursts out an explosion of color
below him is the shimmering mirror of a large reservoir
two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack
an explosion of white water marks bodhis impact
low angle at water level as utah hits
in slow motion a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts skyward
molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn
utah surfaces sputtering and shucks out of the harness
he floats like a jellyfish gasping for breath
i gotta be losin it
bodhi walks toward us dripping wet and grinning
he wraps his arm around utahs shoulders as the others walk up
theyre all soaked and stoked
i told you johnny u was gonna be just fine
roach and the others clap him on the back
a moment of acceptance into the tribe
utah isnt sure what it means yet
theres something you need to see
bodhi leads him toward a plain utility van parked nearby
it was there earlier but utah had no reason to notice it
bodhi opens the rear doors and motions johnny inside
utah puzzled and suddenly alert steps in
the interior is empty except for several canvas duffel bags and a small portable vcr
it is one of the new sales presentation models with deck and monitor together in one tiny unit
now this is going to sting a bit but its for your own growth brah
utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny screen
tight on screen
a night shot
rosie the biker has tyler in a powerful grip
her hands are cuffed behind her and her mouth is taped
he has his switchblade up to her throat
her eyes are wild but with rage not fear
shes trying to struggle out of his grip kicking at him viciously
he controls her efficiently
bodhi stops the tape
shes a wild one isnt she
special agent utah
utah lunges pinning bodhi to the wall of the van
an elbow across his throat
youre a fucking dead man gasping for breath whoa whoa
think it through
im the only one knows where they are
just let me talk for a second
johnny pulls back
barely in control
shell be fine rosie wont do anything
at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time about
he looks at his dive rolex six hours from now
utahs voice sounds kind of strangled
you call him
and tell him to let her go
sorry cant do it brah
hes on the road
and where theyre going theres no phones
damn i hate this johnny i really do
i hate violence
see thats why i need rosie
i could never make this thing work myself
no way i could hold a knife to tylers throat man
she was my woman once
we shared time in this world
but rosie hes kind of a
once you set him in motion he wont stop
thats his gift a kind of
noon comes straight up hell gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes
nothing i can do unless i get there
utah blanches as he takes this in
knows bodhi well enough now to know he means business
so that makes us partners doesnt it
because now we both have the same goal
to get me where i need to go
utahs expression turns suddenly cold as an executioners
were wasting time
thats what i like about you man
youre just sharp as a razor blade
bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others gathered nearby
he addresses the pilot first
get the plane down to santa monica and top up the tanks
to the others lets go
lets saddle up
a stylized long lens shot stacks the cars into a dreamlike mirage
the van weaves slowly among them with predatory stealth
all im askin for is ninety seconds of your life johnny
extreme closeup on the velcro straps of second chance armor
tanned fingers cinch it tight
a shell slides into the cylinder of the casull
a shotgun is cocked
its basic dog psychology brah
if you scare them get them pissing down their leg they submit
you control them
if you project weakness you draw aggression
thats how people get hurt
wider revealing that bodhi is in the back with utah and roach
nathaniel and grommet sit up front
the duffels contents are strewn around
theyre all pulling on suit pants and jackets
slipping on white gloves
bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his body armor
utah is fumbling with his armored vest
he works with vicious jerky moves
his jaw locked
fear causes hesitation and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true
you project strength to avoid conflict
peace through superior firepower babe
bodhi conspicuously empties all the shells from a pump pockets the shells
tosses the weapon to utah
here you need this
you cant be comin through that door with your dick in your hands right
i cant do this
sure you can
you may even like it
its a killer rush
hey dont i show you things johnny u
bodhi this is your wake up call man i
wild aint it
see we exist on a higher plane you and i
we make our own rules
why be a servant of the law johnny u
when you can be its master
ninety seconds man door to door
a small price to pay for someone who loves you
he looks up she does you know
its not her style to fall so hard
i dont think she did with me
he pulls the ronald reagan mask over his head smoothly
roach pulls his on
nathaniel becomes kennedy
grommet transforms into lbj
bodhi looks in the bag no more masks
guess you dont get to be president
johnnys pov the back doors of the van
and the promise of what is beyond
bodhi enters frame
looks straight at us
rock and roll
boom the doors bang open revealing still in pov handheld we hurl ourselves from the dark van into blasting daylight
bodhi is ahead of us in the sprint for the bank doors
dizzying forward momentum as we hammer through the doors into the handheld pov continues as we follow bodhi a wolf plunging among the sheep
a fat guard inside the doors
he turns to us just as bodhi butt strokes him hard in the gut
ahead of us grommet lbj covers the second guard with his gauge
dont fucking do it man
the guy has his hand on the grip of his pistol but its like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons he cant seem to lift it from the holster
roach nixon slips up next to him and helps him with it
the guy is visibly trembling
a young jock makes a move to run
our shotgun comes up like a reflex right in his face
roach nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair
ahead of us bodhi is in action
moving to the counter shouting all tellers back away from the counter
hands on your heads
you know the drill
its like a replay of the robbery utah saw on video
but hes right in the middle of it like in some kind of nightmare
were still in pov the image whipping wildly from side to side as utah scans the room
we whirl dervish among the statuary of the customers and bank employees
our gaze drifts across the floor manager a short guy in a brown suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back
all customers on the floor
on the floor
roach and grommet are pushing them down
utah stands stiffly with the shotgun
he seems dazed
he catches the eye of a customer
in a tenth of a second we see johnny see the customer see his uncertainty
fear has them both hyper aware
johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun
on the floor asshole
whats your problem
i blow your fucking kneecaps out youll be on the floor
the guy hits the deck like a sack of cement
bodhi reagan floats beside johnny scanning with the casull
he speaks without turning his head
kick in the ass aint it
gonna be kinda hard to explain though
when they play the tapes back down at the bureau
could look bad on your monthly evaluation
johnny looks up at surveillance camera
hes quite fucked
can we just get the goddamn money and get out of here
thats the spirit
to the room heads down
just a couple minutes of your life and were gone
bodhi leaps to the counter commanding the room
but at this point they diverge from their time proven plan
roach isnt going for the drawers
hes sprinting for the vault
reading a name tag miss jennings
of new accounts
be a dear and open the inner gate for my associate
he he he has the keys
whatta say mr
wanna give her the keys or do i pick through the blood and chunks for them
duggan the bank manager is surprisingly calm as he takes the keys from his pocket
holds them out to the terrified woman
do whatever they say terry
miss jennings hurries to comply
she unlocks the steel cage inside the big vault door
roach nixon and grommet lbj take her inside with them
a customer lying on the floor near the fat guard catches his eye
the guard face jammed against the linoleum blanches as he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal the butt of a pistol
the customer mouths the words im a cop
the guard is hyperventilating
at the front doors a woman comes in out of the bright sunlight
jfk pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor
then goes back to watching the street
johnny is next to bodhi reagan
youre blowing it man
youre breaking your own rules
pulling too much time
jfk how we doin
all clear man
inside the vault grommet and roach are pillaging rapidly
their hands blur as nice fat stacks of s and s are dumped into canvas sacks
on the main floor the off duty cop slips his hands slowly around the butt of his pistol concealing the move with his body
he signals with his eyes to the fat guard glancing at the guards ankle
tight on the guards ankle where we can see a sliver of back up gun a tiny
auto in an ankle holster
the guards eyes are pleading with the hard on cop
dont make me do this
the guy is sweating shaking
a yellow liquid spreads across the tiles next to his quivering hips
hes actually pissing himself hes so scared
tight on the off duty cop
watching like a ferret
he cocks his
ecu guards eyes wide with terror
it happens like lightning
the cop pops to his knees straight arming the
the guard goes for his ankle holster
the cop fires
reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact
he crashes onto a desk on his back
slides off scattering papers
a teller screams
the cop spins toward utah
johnny throws down the shotgun
shows his palms
hes holding out his gold star
the cop fires twice
two in the chest
utah is hurled back
slams into the tellers counter
nathaniel lbj lets go with the gauge
the cop spins hit by some buck pellets
the guard caps off like a maniac
blam blam blam all of them wild but serving to get nathaniel pinned down behind a check writing island
roach nixon leaps the counter and lands behind the guard
the guards shoulder explodes as roachs gauge detonates
he pitches onto his face screaming and holding the wreckage of his upper arm
grommet lbj is coming over the counter behind roach as the off duty cop spins and fires
roach takes it in the chest
staggers back firing into the floor
trips and drops his shotgun
grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his fingers
in slow motion reagans face rises above the counter
the mask is askew
in order to see bodhi pulls it off
the casull comes up in a slow deliberate arc as the cop turns terrified now whipping his gun around nightmarishly slow as bodhi cocks the casull in dream time and
the worlds most powerful handgun proves its claim at feet per second
a gout of hamburger explodes out of the cops chest
he is lifted off his feet
hits and slides across the floor leaving a two foot wide red smear
echoes slap the walls
then all is still
plaintive whimpering and moaning
the air is blue with smoke
johnny is trying to catch his breath
he rips his shirt open to see two deep indentations in the second chance vest
slugs caught in the kevlar mesh
but no blood
bodhi drops over the counter near utah
the two men look at each other
bodhis eyes seem lost
he stares around at the carnage he has wrought the bloody wreckage of his ego game
his expression changes to something new truly crazed now
we feel that the madness which has been held in check so long has been let off its leash
dont anybody fucking move
roach clutching his side moves to grommet who is on his knees
beneath lbjs stony countenance a river of blood flows down grommets chest
roach pulls off the mask
revealing a terrified kid
grommet pulls his blood drenched hand away from his throat stares at it bug eyed
oh no oh my god oh god
its all comin out man gotta stop it
its all gonna come out
hes trying to hold it in with his hands
this doesnt work
a paste white frightened kid
eighteen years old
suddenly realizing that this is not some video game
that death is real
he slumps back losing the battle for consciousness
freaking to bodhi we gotta bug out man
were eatin it bad on this one
bodhi reaches down and picks up johnnys fbi shield off the floor
he considers it for a long time
then looks up at johnny
his eyes seem to ask for forgiveness
a moment before he smashes the casull into johnnys skull
johnnys pov as he drops to his knees
everything going dark as we see bodhis face distantly his mouth moving slowly
the floor rushes up and smashes us in the face
a view of shoes running away from us leaving bloody footprints
then total darkness
ten minutes later the bank crime scene is in full swing
uniform cops are everywhere trying to get statements from sobbing witnesses
harp munoz cole and pappas represent the fbi contingent
cole has one arm strapped to his body in a fairly elaborate sling and he moves slowly
harp is barking orders to everyone in sight
outside visible beyond the doors its total pandemonium with cops and ambulances and of course a huge crowd of rubberneckers
a minicam crew shows up
harp starts shouting at them
cole with evident pleasure cinches down a pair of handcuffs on utahs wrists with his good hand
johnny has a deep cut on his forehead and the blood is trickling into his eyes but he seems not to notice
not to hear munoz speaking monotonously if you so desire an attorney will be provided for you free of cost
do you understand these rights i have explained to you
pappas charges through the crowd pushing munoz aside
he knows his goddamn rights
looks at utah jesus kid
i knew you were getting too close to these guys
turns to the other agents gimme the goddamn key to these things cole
he gestures to the cuffs still cutting into johnnys wrists
cole hands him the key
harp storms toward them
dont take those off
just leave them on
your partners an accessory to murder
you realize that
harp spins johnny by the shoulder to look at paramedics carrying the covered body of the off duty cop
beyond still on the floor is grommet his eyes staring in death
he was right about not making thirty
three men dead
one of them a cop
hows that sit in your gut utah
cold and scary take your hand off my shoulder right now
harp pulls back instinctively
utahs eyes burn into him
looks like johnnys not in the fbi anymore
dont turn him over to the uniforms like some punk
let me ride him in
you two screw ups deserve each other
thats why i put you together in the first place
christ pappas youre as bad as he is
talk about the blind leading the blind pappas steps close to the supervising agent
harp let me tell you something
i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you
angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his pounds behind it
harps head snaps back and he flops in a heap
respect your elders
he takes utah by the arm lets go kid
harp struggles to sit up rubbing his jaw as pappas stuffs utah into his car
harp is so shocked he doesnt say a word
they drive for a couple of blocks in silence side by side
utah in disgrace
i know where theyre going
figured you did
angelo flips johnny the key
johnny lets himself out of the cuffs
he sits rubbing his wrists
only problem is
we cant arrest them or shoot them
on pappas what the fuck
expression we long lens shot through a forest of small planes as pappas sedan glides into frame
it moves sharklike among through the cessna forest
slows to a stop
through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see pappas get out of the car and start working his way among the aircraft
utah slides behind the wheel and drives on
tight on turboprop engine roaring as it warms up
the same aircraft as before
bodhi and nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open back door as the pilot completes his pre flight checks
the ex presidents suits have been removed along with the body armor and no guns are in sight
just a couple of guys getting ready for a charter flight
bodhi looks up and stops his work as
the fbi sedan stops about feet away
nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels
utah gets out
he holds his hands out from his body and turns completely around
without his jacket on it is evident that he is not carrying a gun
he walks forward
im not armed
but youre not alone
theres a gun on you right now
bodhi feigns casual interest
he cant see
moving cat like behind a row of service vehicles
he gets his snubnose
propped on the bumper of one with a clear shot at bodhi and nathaniel
listen im in kind of a hurry johnny u
what can i do for you
you gotta tell me where she is
and let my policy expire
look bodhi man
people are dead
the ride is over
i say when its over
the guy you killed was an off duty cop
if you get out of here theyll nail you wherever you land
they have a new thing called radar
maybe youve heard of it
though he cant hear whats going on
the pilot has clocked the tension between the two men
and the shotgun in nathaniels hands
he blanches and starts to shut down the planes power
by his reaction we see that hes obviously not in on it
roach comes out of the hangar building nearby
neither utah nor pappas see him
but he sees pappas drawn down on bodhi
he drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel he was carrying
tight on duffel bag as it opens
the pistol grip of a gauge riot gun sticks out of lots and lots of money
roachs hand slides the gun out slowly
utah is very close to bodhi
i know you man when they fall on you you wont back down
theyll have to burn your ass to the ground
and i cant stop them
im the last person theyre ready to listen to right now
thanks to you
shit may or may not happen
look you got a death wish you want to ride to glory
but dont take her with you man
im begging you
tell me where she is
then i walk away
weve earned that much trust havent we
the pilot opens the door and is climbing out when nathaniel wheels on him
the pilot goes cross eyed staring down the muzzle of the gauge inches from his face
to the pilot back in the hotseat campadre
behind the trucks pappas senses something
his head snaps around
roach is behind him with the gauge
pappas hurls his weight sideways as the buckshot punches into the truck fender
some of it catches pappas in the hip
he hits the ground hard and whips up the
roach flips onto his back
the shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck
pappas is on the ground totally exposed feet from the others
nathaniel fires once wild
his shot blows a divot out of the asphalt next to pappas
he pumps the slide chambering another round
then pappas fourth and fifth rounds drill into him
he slams back against the cessnas fuselage
two red smears on the white aircraft
bodhi lunges for the fallen gauge
pappas takes aim
one round left
utah sprints between them
kid get outta the way
utah is blocking bodhi with his body
bodhis fingers are poised frozen a few inches from the shotgun
he snaps the pistol up aimed at the sky
pappas stands panting
enraged and frustrated
pain searing his leg
everything is tense and electrified
pappas chest explodes with a spray of blood
behind him roach is lying on one elbow in a pool of scarlet
he cocks another round into the chamber and fires again
angelo drops to his knees holding his ruined body like hes hugging himself
johnny lunges toward him his face distorted with shock
angelos eyes meet his for a moment
in his dilated pupils is the great question
then he slumps forward and lies very still
the breath leaves his body and doesnt go back in
johnny moves toward his friend in a daze
drops to one knee beside him
roach aims the shotgun at him coughing blood
utah doesnt notice
or is beyond caring
bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction
roachs finger relaxes on the trigger
utah puts his hand on angelos white crewcut hair
he hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge
roach is working himself to his knees
his breath is sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the customary breathing orifices
bodhi crosses to him and helps him up
he covers utah with the shot gun as he half carries roach to the plane
the pilot is white with shock
hed run if he could remember how
i aint flyin you guys to san phillipe man forget it
not now thanks for telling the nice fbi agent where were going
roach works his way up into the plane
he waves the shotgun at the pilot his face a vicious blood flecked mask
get in the fucking plane
bodhi stands behind johnny the shotgun aimed at his head
their expressions are lethally cold
we see that utah hates this man who was his friend his teacher more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate
were gonna ride this out all the way johnny
you and me
johnny nods slowly as if accepting that this was all somehow pre ordained and that they both knew the game would take them this far and beyond
he stands and walks to the plane
pov of the ground racing below us at mph
reverse preceding the plane as it rockets through barren canyons
as close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it
under the radar
the aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and banks wildly
bodhi has the casull aimed at the base of his skull from the jump seat just behind him
roach holds the shotgun on utah seated across from him in the rear seats
roach is a pale sweaty mask
he is propped against a bulkhead seemingly collapsed in on himself like a discarded coat
his entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood
but his gaze is steady and the shotgun is aimed into utahs guts
no one talks or moves on this grim hell ride
the sun blisters a landscape out of time
the white cessna rockets above the saguaros its shadow pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some manic alter ego below it
it wooshes over us raising dust devils
the pilot yells over his shoulder to bodhi
look we been in mexico the last half hour
can i quit mowing the lawn here or what
im getting more brush in the wheels than i usually like you know what im saying
yeah get some height
take her up to eight thousand on this heading
the pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs
bodhi moves back next to roach whos fading
were gonna pop up on their screens
doesnt matter now
were almost there man
here let me help you get your gear on
bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to roach and starts helping him into the harness
roach keeps the shot gun pointed at johnny
youre gonna be fine
johnny toss me that money bag will you
easy does it
utah hefts the duffel
weighs its contents and their price
youre cold because all the blood is running out of your body roach
youre going to be dead soon
he tosses the bag i hope it was worth it
roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a teddy bear
glares at utah
he hooks the strap of the duffel over one shoulder
hey johnnys just trying to psych you man forget it
just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin you back to health
come on amigo lets get you set for the jump
bodhi props roach next to the open door and takes a walkie talkie from the seat keying it
rosie rosie this is air force one do you copy over
a burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear voice
copy you air force one
we have a visual on you
tell him to release tyler
why should i
what if your chute fails bodhi
rescind the order
let her off the hook shes served her purpose
do it man you owe me that much
let me hear it before you check out
bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of seconds then keys the walkie
rosie listen carefully
surgery is canceled is that clear
repeat it back to me
surgery is canceled
im lettin the bitch go
bodhi looks out the doorway
gauging distance airspeed the geography below
he looks at utah aiming the casull at him
johnny stares back at him like a pit viper
i know its hard for you johnny
you want me so bad its like acid in your mouth
but not his time
he braces roach at the door lets go
bodhi signals the pilot and utah feels the plane drop as the engines are cut back to an idle
bodhi slaps roach on the shoulder and roach slumps backward out of the plane
bodhi braces to jump looking at johnny for a last split second
you lose campadre
he chucks the casull onto the seat beside the door and bails
bodhi tumbles out into space
utahs knuckles are white gripping the seat
theres a dynamo spinning out of control in his head
he leaps up in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a bulkhead
looks around like a rabid animal
utah grabs the casull off the seat and dives out of the plane
utah without a parachute but carrying a very large gun rockets downward
he presses his arms to his sides and falls head down building speed
three hundred feet below him is bodhi freefalling in a spread eagle position
utah moves his feet and hands angling toward him
bodhi doesnt see him
falling flat he tops out at terminal velocity for that position
utah slashes downward at mph
the gap between them closes
utah is almost blinded by the windstream
his eyes burn
his lips are peeled back by the blasting air
bodhi is eighty feet below him
feet to terra firma
utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration
hes only going to have one shot at this
bodhi is right below him
utah is closing like a sam missile
he trims a little and
slams into bodhi in a mid air tackle
bodhis eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble together
utah has made the grab and locked his arms around bodhi in an iron grip
he pulls the casulls muzzle up to bodhis head and screams in his face
pull the parachute
bodhi looks at the gun
looks at utah
pretty radical johnny
even for you
why dont you pull it
no games bodhi
pull the cord
naw you pull it
utah looks down
the earth is rushing at them
go on johnny
but you gotta drop the gun first
you use your other hand what you gonna hold on with
pull it right now or ill blow your fucking head off and pull it myself
well thats the only way its gonna happen man
come on you want to do it
youre gonna die johnny
five more seconds
the ground is close enough to see details
they rocket past the bright yellow canopy of roachs chute a hundred feet away
you fucking crazy
theyre right in each others faces
taking it way beyond the edge
bodhis eyes are wild
a gleeful adrenalized madness
his pupils are the entrance to hell
utah flings the casull away and pulls the rip cord so hard he almost loses his grip anyway
the canopy cracks out
full and round and bright red
the ground roars at us
utah and bodhi hit
they slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a cloud of dust
rocks and debris clatter into silence
nearby roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll
he moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his eyes stare without blinking right at the sun
next to him the money satchels contents are spilled right into the sand
roachs lifeless hands lie limp among the bills that caper in the desert wind
utah and bodhi are both completely still as the dust clears
finally they groan and stir
necks move hands move legs move
bodhi rolls to his knees
he is cut and scraped the blood running bright down his dust covered skin
utah looks around blinking
surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red hot mexican desert
bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him
wild ride huh
gasping jesus christ bodhi
utah tries to rise and grabs his knee in agony
we see by his mask of pain that its totaled inside
that pesky knee huh
he looks up at the sound of an engine
bodhis pov of his big four by roaring toward us with a meteor tail of dust
it slides to a stop next to them
rosie gets out of the drivers side and stands calmly with a sawed off over his shoulder
utah blinks through his sweat and pain at tyler running toward him out of the dust
she kneels next to him and puts her arms around him
bodhi limps to the truck
through the swirling dust we see him look back
you had me worried there for a second johnny u
he swings up into the four by and guns the engine
rosie hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward roachs billowing gravemarker
johnny touches tylers face tenderly leaving a smear of blood
he gives her a wan version of the johnny utah grin
hold on the truck moving off in a heat shimmered cloud of dust becoming a mirage then a memory as we an enormous wave which fills frame seeming to rise
endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray
an unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a storm sky
wind whips sand across the narrow beach road throwing it against the front doors of the lighthouse pub
a snarling crocodile head is mounted above a tapper of guinness stout
a koala bear with plastic eyes holds a fosters
a bartender with leathered skin washes glasses
at the bar a single disheveled customer
gust of wind blows open a shuttered window
the bartender moves to close it
gonna close early today mate fore the bloody storm hits
johnny utah swivels toward camera
his tanned face is barely recognizable jaws hidden underneath a slight beard long bleach out hair swept behind an ear
his muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey
the man seems deadly focused
storms already here
its bringing me the swell
johnny stares into his drink
another blast of cold as the front door opens
johnny turns at the sound
tyler takes a step inside
her hair is different more bleached out frazzled from the sun
her eyes adjust to the dark room
john theyre here
utah downs the drink and slides off his stool
he has a pronounced limps as he crosses to tyler at the door
they exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which reads lighthouse pub bells beach australia utah and tyler walk out onto the roadway as several australian police cars converge
a dozen uniformed officers step out
the ranking officer a fortyish lieutenant walks up to utah
dyou see him mr
but hes here
now look i know you used to be a federal agent up in the states and all that but youre a citizen now so just find him and well handle
it from there
just give me a couple minutes with him first
johnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone
wall of solid water five stories high crashes straight down in a holocaust of spray
rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky roll the most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen
they close out pummeling the ocean floor casting a shockwave up the shore
surfers gather on the sand gaze out to sea
jesus almighty the bloody sands shakin
the beach sounds like a mortar range
johnny passes among the brahs
totally closed out
its fuckin death on a stick
on bodhi sitting crosslegged in the sand arms folded around his knees
he stares pensively out at the waves
his hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard lying next to him
i knew you wouldnt miss the fifty year storm bodhi
bodhi smiles the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates the cunning of his opponent
utah sits beside his prey and stares at the ocean
bodhi stares with glittering eyes at the heaving ocean before him face splitting into that feral deaths head grin
and i always knew i could count on you agent utah
im not fbi anymore
you never were
i asked them to give me a couple minutes
utah calmly glances over his shoulder
bodhi follows johnnys gaze to the cops watching from the road
it went bad brah
smiles inwardly i just felt it was time
a booming roar sounds from the ocean
bodhi just stares at the waves with awe and perhaps fear
time to dance with the universe
he turns to utah i could never handle a jail cell
youll do this for me wont you johnny
havent i earned this much
utah doesnt move to stop him as he stands hefting the longboard
he half smiles then turns toward the water and starts walking
bodhi doesnt wait for a reply
he walks to the waters edge and never looks back
he throws his board into the foam and paddles the riptide pulling him out
the monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the trough of the holocaust
utah stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver final justice
the cops are running clumsily across the sand too late to stop bodhi
tyler steps up behind johnny and puts her hands on his shoulders
bodhi is nothing more than a speck as he shoots across the lip of the colossal wave carving the board downward an unthinkable forehand blast sends him into a degree
slide straight down the enormous face eyes wild his mouth opens in a soundless howl bodhi and the outer limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious moment in perfect harmony perfect symmetry perfect union
there is no fear in his face only awe as the mountain of water closes out burying the bodhisattva in a whitewater grave
pieces of broken surfboard explode upward only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish
utah remains pensive eyes fixed on the riderless surf
tyler lowers her head
a fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand
the wind gathers force
johnny finally turns to his woman curls an arm around her shoulder gathering her close
tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea
he rode it all the way
camera pulls back and up rising high above their heads as the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the australian shore
