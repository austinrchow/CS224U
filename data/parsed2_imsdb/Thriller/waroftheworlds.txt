screenplay by josh friedman david koepp submitted by tyler resized to fit on minimal number of pages showing pictures of city life no one would have believed in the early
years of the st century that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own
that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they observed and studied
like the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
with infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe confident of our empire over this world
yet across the gulf of space intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant with envious eyes
and slowly and surely drew their plans against us
ray in his s short hair rough groomed almost always wears his new york baseball cap raggedly dressed looks like he hasnt slept in days is moving cargo boxes from
the ship to ground loading brackets
shots show him inside the control room operating the levers
as the last car is loaded he is seen walking down the stairs

ray throws the ball at robbie hard enough to knock dust off his mitt
robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth in pain
thats half of what ive got

ray throws the ball and robbie purposely misses shattering a window behind him
robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up the stairs back into the house
ray stares at rachel who stares back

ray takes off his shirt seems to loose his cap with it and takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep
int rays house living room day rachel is flipping tv channels as ray walks down the hall after his nap
he sits down and sees rachel picking at a splinter
rachel has his hard hat on
whats the matter

no response robbie
ray takes a bite of the food sitting on the coffee table in front of him having no idea what it is
with the disgusting food in his mouth what is that
from the health food place
i kept one of their menus last time we were here
ray gives rachel a this is gross look and she gawks at him
uh you said order
laughs i meant order food
where is robbie
he went out
i dont know
he just took your car and left
ext rays house front driveway day he glances at his open garage door with the car that should have been in it
he runs across the street to search for his car
as he sees everyone else looking at the sky he looks himself to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of it
the cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned
you ever see something like that
scratching his chin in the springtime maybe
not this time of year
come on we can see better from the back yard
continuous ext rays house back yard day ray runs by the fence to his back yard
as he runs the wind starts to pick up
that is so weird
the wind is blowing toward the storm
that is weird
winds pick up faster
rachel wanna see something cool
rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear
pan up to view the storm that appears to be lighting up with multiple colored lights
wide angle shot of clothes blowing in the wind
suddenly the wind dies down to nothing
lightning hits the pavement about feet away
i want to go inside
i want to go inside
okay you go ahead
the friends baby starts to cry
thats enough weather for me
begins walking inside i dont want to go by myself
lightning hits the ground more rapidly and louder now
rachel and ray run towards the eves of the house
the lighting continues
kind of fun aint it
oh come on
its like the fourth of july
no its not
ray begins singing as
the lightning gets even louder and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house
half the car alarms go off in a block radius
another few car alarms go off
louder and louder the lightning continues
int rays house kitchen day ray and rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs into the kitchen
the lighting continues again and makes rachel scream
it hit right behind our house
yeah well its not gonna hit there again because lighting doesnt strike twice in the same place
it hits again and makes ray jump
they both get under the table for safety as the lighting continues
they both begin panicking
the lightning goes on with no apparent end
ray and rachel both scurry on the floor under the table as the lighting goes on
i dont know
is robbie okay
no response are you okay
the lighting continues
wheres the thunder
why wont it stop
pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all is silent
with hesitation is it over
ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the lightening came from
ray climbs out from under the table to get an idea of what just happened
where are you going
just checking things out
just wait wait there
are we going to be okay
i dont know
you dont know
rachel please just stop asking so many questions
just wait here
ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything is okay
the power is off
after saying just wait here he then walks into the living room
nothing in the living room has power
he checks his phone which doesnt work
he tries his cell phone which also appears to not work at all
he sees his watch which has also stopped working
pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots
ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working
by now we get the picture emp
he walks out onto the sidewalk where he is joined by his friend
you believe this ray
every single car
ray walks past her onto the street where he sees robbie walking up the street towards him
ray begins running towards him
worried oh jesus
the car just stopped and
interrupts him youre okay
are you okay
and the lighting started hitting about a block away over and over again
and me and this other guy we
getting angry where the helld you go
over on lincoln avenue
by the church
did you see it
were you near it
times we counted
over and over the lighting started hitting
it opened up this hole or something
okay well youre okay
good because your sister is in the house i want you to go in that house and i want you to stay with her
break as he starts running down the street and the next time you take my car with no drivers license and no permission i call the cops
you better be there when i get back
robbie doesnt move in fear
ray gets angry that he is not going
snaps his hands together ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards away
what is it dead
all of them everything look at this
taps the starter motor starters fried
lightning hit it
not even close
i thought if i changed it
you got any idea whats going on
im on my way to find out
try changing the solenoids
right to accompanying mechanic right see i told you that the solenoids
everyone whos car is fried is checking their car to see what went wrong
ray joins about people walking down to where the lightning started hitting
rays friends join him
cops walk by
let us through
let us through here
hey what up ray
joking i should of known you two were behind this
hey gods pissed off at the neibor hood can you blame him
you see it
yep you got power where you are
its the cars though
thats the thing
solar flare thats what this guy told me
a solar flare
yeah the sun shoots off blobs of plasma they turn into solar flare flashes
its the only thing that can kill all of the electronic stuff
can i say something
the sun does not cause lightning okay
bro im just telling you what that guy said he heard
i know but it just sounds dumb saying that
ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where everyone else is gathered around
i never seen anything like this before
that many strikes of lighting in one spot
the cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole
is this the only place
ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt crumbs
he switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold to hold in one hand
is it hot
the police officers and the other people gathered around feel a vibration under their feet
what is that
you feel that
yeah i feel that
what is it the subway
theres no subway here
path train maybe
that cant be the water main
theres nothing else down there
the water main doesnt run through here
well theres something down there and its moving
the pavement starts to crack into a wider circle
people start running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger
windows start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even more
entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone on the road to loose their balance
shots of more shattering windows
the church starts cracking apart and moving with a giant circle of pavement that moves
the pavement lurches up and then caves down
a few cars go tumbling in
something throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole
the police continue trying to move people away
the engines of the ship start coming out as they power up
the entire ship comes out and begins dusting its self off
ray and his friends hide behind a building
oh my god
ray begins walking out from behind the building
ray no stay man
the machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to other robots
it arms its disintegrator beams and opens fire
people can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the beam
the beams when fired make a zap sound
people start exploding into dust and their clothes are blown away
ray misses numerous beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store
again ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches
he runs his ass off trying to escape the robot
disintegrator beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path
ray hides behind a building as the machine walks by
ray walks into the house where he is met by rachels gawking eyes out the window
robbie stands in the background looking at the doorway
ray walks past rachel then robbie toward the kitchen
rachel and robbie follow him into the kitchen
with anxious eyes robbie begins to say
ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the kitchen not responding
whats going on
robbie squats down next to ray as rachel rests her elbows on the stool at the island
dad whats the matter
whats all that stuff all over you
ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards robbie
rachel reaches through a leg of the island to pull at rays hood on his shirt
ray jumps and jerks his head toward rachel fast enough to make some of the white powder poof off as if jerked back into reality
robbie jumps as well in fright
whats all the stuff
ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder
he gets up and begins heading for the bathroom
still unresponsive to the questions he was just asked
he looks in the mirror to see that he is covered in the whit powder human ash
he quickly does his best to wash it off realizing what it is
after washing it off he begins mentally planning what to do
walking back into the kitchen
were leaving this house in seconds
ray grabs an old penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it
he shoves the box into robbie who grasps it as to not fall over at the force ray used
i have no idea whats going on
while robbie asks
all the food from the refrigerator and the cupboard put it in here
i think we are having a bit of a shock here
whats going on just tell me
just do it
ray runs toward the table grabs a flashlight and begins to try to get it to work
dad youre really scaring me
i need you to get your suitcase
the one that you brought bring it to me okay
ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the refrigerator for batteries
hastily grabbing the package he realizes they are probably dead due to the emp
can you do that for me darling
ray runs into his room while rachel and robbie are downstairs
he hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains a hand gun
he tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds his shirts over it
street sidewalk evening ray rachel and robbie are walking at a very fast pace down the sidewalk with about other people around them
rachel is clutching rays hand and robbie is carrying the box of food
shh shh i cant tell you now
weve only got about another minute
ray sees the car that manny was working on just as mannys apprentice closes the hood
please please please
people are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction
ray robbie and rachel approach the car
just keep it down
ray im standing right beside you
can you please answer me
ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys
just get in the front seat robbie
ray loads rachel in the middle row of seats as robbie gets in the passenger seat
whos car is this
just get in
whos car is this
ray throws rachels bag in the row of seats behind her slams the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car
he is caught by manny walking
hey hey ray
you were absolutely right
i had to change the sole
manny sees ray has loaded his whole family into the car
manny walks over to the passenger side as ray and robbie watch him
ray who did no such thing sits there
robbie looks at ray wondering what hes going to do
open the door come on
open the door ray reaches over robbie and opens the door
what are you
interrupts him get in
thats funny you gotta get out of the car
you cant take it
ray tries to get manny to calm down from the panic he is in
its not my car

interrupts him i dont have time to expl
interrupts him youre busting my chops
i got a shop to run
you know how many people
interrupts him get in
no ray get out of the
rachel begins crying as she says
what do you mean
a dead silent pause falls on everyone
robbie stares at ray in fright as ray and manny stare at each other
all right get out of the truck
im not kidding now
get out of the car rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame at a nearby tree
ray and manny continue as rachel looks at the flaming tree
im not fooling around i got a busy day ahead of me
to robbie close the door
ray helps robbie close the door on manny as they begin speeding away
manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator beam
camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding to smithereens
trying to outrun the beams
is this the terrorists
ray grabs robbies collar of his jacket and shoves him toward the floor
high shot shows the bridge behind rays house being blasted away
the expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses below
one of them rays
an explosion is seen as a fuel tanker falls on rays house that obliterates houses
flaming debris flies all over behind the van
the van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars are scattered all over the road broken down
the van speeds by them honking the horn every few cars
where are we going
we gotta go
we got to be the only working car around here
im not stopping until we are clear
we gotta go
rachel begins frantically crying
after a few seconds she begins hyperventilating
rachel youve got to keep it down rachel
after honking his horn a few more times she has only gotten worse
shut up rachel
i cant think
with a vein driven face you are freaking robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm rachel
he thinks of an old technique he was taught
okay slapping his arms together on top of each other demonstrating put em up rache
rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation
make the arms
he grabs her elbows so she holds the position
he begins to calm her down this space right here this is yours
robbie stares directly into her eyes
she takes deep breaths to regain control
she is able to open her eyes and stare back into his eyes to maintain contact
this belongs to you right
panting but keeping eye contact yes
reassuring her youre safe in your space
keeping eye contact im safe in my space
reassuring her youre safe in your space
nothing is going to happen to you in your space
ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at robbie able to do what hes doing
im really scared
im gonna go to the front seat to talk to dad
reassuring her i will be two feet away
rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing while robbie grabs her hand as reassurance
will you hold my hand
are you gonna be okay
relatively calm yes
robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front
taking a breath to calm himself i want to know everything you know
ray looks into robbies eyes who is looking straight forward on the road
this thing this machine it crawled out of the ground and started torching everything just killing everybody
what is it
break is it terrorists
no this came from some place else
you mean like europe
ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the drivers side
that machine it was already buried
ray looks into the sky
what for is unknown
maybe it came down in the lightning storm
wait a minute
you just said it was buried
no the machine im talking about was buried
but what came down in the lighting storm what operates it
robbie jumps back into the passengers seat as rachel scoots forward in the back seat
robbie is looking toward the sky
why arent there any helicopters or airplanes
how you doing there girl
to robbie how she doing
how you doing
to ray shes good
hey what was that thing you did with her
she gets claustrophobic
hey rachel i want mom
you feel better
i want mom
yeah tell me about it you know
take me to moms
listen i just need you to hold it together for me okay
when you start screaming like that you know i cant really
robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the arms process with her to calm her again
thats where were going right now
still in the car
come on hurry up dad
as soon as the van stops robbie gets out and opens the door for rachel
robbie get the door
she knocks on it robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as rachel begins running up to the front door
begins and continues once in the house begins and continues once in the house ray remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is kids are shouting for tim
rachel and robbie are shouting for mom and tim as ray walks through the door
rachel and robbie meet ray in the entry from different parts of the house in their search
is she dead
shes not dead
shes just no here
theyre never here
how do you know
because they are on their way to boston
the camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by robbie
then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next to the phone
it has ray missing who is replaced by tim
and so they just kept on going theyre probably up to your grandmas house by now
dialing the phone im gonna call her
how come the lights are on here and not at your place
because nothing bad happened here
robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out of the phone
so were safe here
remembering robbies calming arm technique
this is your area
okay you are safe in your area
thats not how it goes
okay well you hungry huh
ill get you some food
im gonna feed you
get something to eat
digs into the box what do we have here
busy signals one of the fast ones
you think all the circuits are down
continues ketchup mustard ahh tabasco barbeque sauce
this is really good robbie
i said pack food
what the hell is this
thats all that was in your kitchen
no its all right its all right
robbie takes his hat off and sits down as ray searches the box for food
he finds peanut butter
getting the bread okay were gonna have
well just get some sandwiches
ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole loaf on the counter
he taps his hands together to try to calm rachel and robbie
you ever see me deal
wanna see me deal
okay theres two for you two for robbie two for me he has one extra in his hand
one for the house
laughs ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the cooking utensil holder on the counter
maybe after we get done eating i will take you down teach you how to play some poker
a little five card stud
a little blackjack
im allergic to peanut butter
laughs since when
with a snotty look birth
robbie shakes his head yes to her statement
okay well umm here hands her two pieces of bread you can eat the bread
im not hungry
robbie and i are going to be eating peanut butter sandwiches
to robbie you want jelly on this sandwich
im not hungry either
youre not hungry either
well thats fine
ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window
one with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides off
everybody just relax okay
because we are here now and were safe and were gonna stay
and in the morning your mom and tim are going to be here and everythings gonna be fine
no responses okay
rachel and ray are running down the stars carrying their own pillows and blankets
robbie follows slightly behind them carrying his own and a few extra pillows and blankets
if everythings fine why do we have to sleep in the basement
weve got perfectly good beds
its like a slumber party
what are you afraid is gonna happen to us
walks over to the weight room corner of the basement nice basement
i want to sleep in my bed
ive got back problems
you know on the weather channel when theres a tornado and they tell you to go to the basement for safety
its like that
theres gonna be tornadoes
rachel no more talking
robbie puts his hat on rachels head and ushers her over to the spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out
ray walks over to the chair about five feet away from the bed
could you be a little nicer to me
rachel and robbie are heard in the background
wanna stay here
good night love you
love you rache
ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa as he sits down
so robbie and rachel wont notice
bushes are heard rattling against the window
they become louder and louder against the window
eventually they become just shy of loud enough to wake ray up
a strike of lighting gets rays eyes to roll back around and open
the second flash is loud enough to get robbie who is now in the seat next to ray to jump up next to him
a few more flashes and the lightening starts like the first time
every strike of lighting lights up the entire downstairs
rachel gets up and looks thought the stairs
a close up shot of robbie
with every lightening strike his breathing becomes more erratic
is the lighting back
no this is something else
just as ray finishes an ear piercing noise from a jet engine begins
the howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls
robbie and ray wince at the pain in their ears
rachel runs up to robbie and hugs him in security
things fall off of shelves everywhere
a shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even louder
whats that sound
the lighting grows more intense as does the sound
robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows rachel down the stairs who runs
robbie goes back to get ray
ray realizes he has forgotten his gun
ray and robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through the windows
flaming debris follows after
ray gets the first door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one
he manages after a struggle to get the metal one closed on the inside of the furnace room
the door closes and the room is completely black
in the dark you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around them
are we still alive
ray is looking out the window at the top of the room
he is holding on to the metal wire conduit
seeing hardly anything he judges it to be safe to go outside the furnace room
he walks by rachel who is sleeping in robbies arms who is sleeping against some copper piping
holding his slightly burned arm in pain ray exits the room through the charred doors and finds most of the basement in ruins
the ground floor is now the top floor because the second floor was completely torn off
the camera pans out to find a winding down burning airplane engine
panning out further we can see ray walking through the remains of different sections of an airplane
ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue cart through the aisle
the man continues hauling the cart
were you on this plane
are you a passenger
the cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps down the floor to the ground
hey how you doing
wanna help me open this
the news reporter comes rushing out from the side of the news van in the background
are you a passenger
the shell went off right beside him
the camera on his shoulder saved his life
to max you hear that max
your stupid camera saved your stupid life
they succeed in jimmying open the cart and begin bagging all the water and food they can
where were you
out there in the pine barrens
we were attached to a national guard unit the rd mechanized
they moved to one of those things around midnight
theyve got some kind of shield around them
we cant see it but everything we fire at them detonates too early before we can get close enough to cause any damage
when they flash that thing everything lights up like hiroshima
she begins eating one of the meal packages
theres more than one
you gotta be kidding me right
we were feeding new york but new york went dark
so we patched over to d
they went down l
chicago uplink to london
even called the affiliates to try and get them to catch the feed but nobody answered
the reporter looks at tapes to find the one shes looking for
when she does so she jams it into the vcr which promptly begins playing it
its the same everywhere
once the tripods start to move no more news comes out of that area
she shows him a tape of about tripods destroying a city
oh my god
you aint seen nothing yet
she wheels her chair around to show him the next piece
i saw that storm
i was right in the middle of one of those
no you didnt see it like this
those machines come up from under the ground right
that means they must have been buried there a long time ago
so whos driving the god damn things
pointing to the monitor watch the lightning
watch the lighting
she slows the footage down so he can get a good look
she advances it slowly
she points out an alien capsule like object running down the lighting bolt
what is that
that is them
they come down in capsules riding the lighting into the ground into the machines right
a vibration noise is heard by an approaching robot
they both jump at the noise
you hear that
were getting the hell out of here
the camera man has his hands full of meals as he loads into the van
the door almost closes on ray as she stops and opens it again

ray shakes his head no
oh thats too bad it would have been a really great story
she closes the door on him
black blend to ray is talking to rachel

rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes

camera follows robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment of the devastation
ray starts the car and turns it around to pull out
robbie get in
robbie does not react at all
ray becomes agitated
why are you yelling
ray gives him a mean look as robbie realizes that they must go
to rachel its okay
to robbie get in
they pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey
ray is reading the map while robbie looks out the window
they are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them
why the hell arent we on the turnpike
because i dont want everybody to see weve got a working car
going over the plan well stay along the hudson until we find an open bridge or ferry then were gonna cross the hudson
then take the back roads across connecticut all the way to boston
where is everybody
i dont know
running hiding hiding in their basements
if we had any balls wed go back there and find one of those things and kill it
yeah well why dont you just let me make the big decisions okay
ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry at robbie
which would be when
nevers about your speed
okay enough robbie
enough with the ray shit
its dad sir or if you want mr
that sounds a little weird to me but you decide
i have to go to the bathroom
rachel shakes her head yes as he pulls the car over
ray grabs robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car
he glares at rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat
tugs at his shirt sleeve which ray has a hold of i gotta go
not so fast not so fast all right
now there are two things we have to watch out for and the second is people who might want our car
theres nobody around
i gotta go
robbie breaks free of rays grasp on his sleeve
robbie and rachel both get out of the car
ray follows the both of them to supervise the whole event from the van
rachel thats good right there
points to a spot away all right then just go where i can see you
im not gonna look
just stay in sight
rachel is about feet away entering a patch of bushes
robbie has already found a spot about away next to the stream under the road
every time you dont listen to me im telling your mother okay
im making a list
reinforcing im making a list
rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking for a half way decent spot
she sees the river and looks at it in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it
more bodies start coming at a huge rate
bodies floating down the river
rachel begins to hyperventilate again as ray comes up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs her
i told you to stay where i could see you
ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van
army trucks can be heard crossing by the van
robbie whos only interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity to do so
robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting
some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly
robbie is getting soaked as the tanks tracks roll over the large puddles of water
robbie is not giving up hope that one may let him on
watch it kid
youre gonna get yourslelf ray sees robbie trying to get on with them
he has had enough of robbie and goes up to him to tell him
robbie who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop
ray and robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each other as the tanks continue rolling by
robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline keeps him fighting at ray
they both can be seen with the air from their nostrils flaring like a bull
rachel rushes in as an attempt to get robbie to realize what hes doing
rachel begins to cry as robbie looks at her in sorrow
rachels last line almost brings robbie to tears as he picks her up and starts walking over to the van
ray stands next to the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the divorce of their
robbie is staring out the window in the exact opposite direction of ray
the radio is broadcasting the emergency alert test
ray turns off the radio and says
if i close my eyes why dont you drive for a bit
i dont have a license
since when has that stopped you
robbie is driving into a city
ray is sleeping in the passenger seat
the streets are crowded with people walking
robbie gets worried and gets ray to drive
no response ray
no response dad
ray wakes up and robbie tries to get him to take the wheel
you think you could
you think you could
dont take your foot off
i got it
i got it
wheres everybody going
i dont know rach
but we do right
yeah we do
they continue driving through the crowd as they become more and more mad at ray for not letting them on
they begin banging on the glass
whyd he do that
the man continues hitting the windshield
why is he doing that
he wants a ride
everybody just wants a ride
can we give him one
just sit back and put on your seatbelt
robbie put on your seatbelt
rachel is busy looking at all the people who are now begging for a ride
put on your seatbelt rachel
the three of them fasten their seatbelts
people bang on the windows louder as they shout give me a ride
im sorry i cant
please get away from the car
a police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window
stop the car
you could carry people in there
rachel is panicking and starts to do the arms process to stay calm
ray hits the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side of the van
ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it
rachel screams in panic
oh hold on
robbie and ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding a baby
they swerve to miss her
seeing a telephone pole oh god
the van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches about feet
the transformer on the top of the pole begins to arc and spark
the crowd is now rocking the van from side to side shouting at about a riot level
are you okay
rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted open by a crowd member
the driver and passenger side windows are then promptly busted
robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass
a man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the hole in the front windshield
he is so desperate to get in the van he rips his hands to shreds
a crowd member suggests to push it
he does so and the glass falls through
the passenger side door is opened and robbie is pulled out by the rioting crowd
ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him out of the drivers side window
a man from the crowd runs up to rachels window breaks it and tries to grab rachel
ray pulls the man out and throws him back into the crowd
grabs guy get out of there
ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hits the drivers side door
ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him back into the crowd
ray wrestles another man trying to grab rachel
the man gets tossed to the ground
just as ray stands up
ray is hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat
the blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to ray
grasping his head in pain ahhh
another man grabs ray to try to fight him
women in the crowd yell to stop them but nobody does so
the man who is strangling ray yells to get in the car
robbie fought off the men who pulled him out of the car comes over to rays side and begins choking the man who is choking ray
robbie hits the mans head against the car
the man releases his grip on ray the man and robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view
a man gets into the drivers seat and tries to start the car
through a choking grip rachel get out of the car
get out of the car rachel
ray just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond frame
rachel tries to get out but there is an overflow of people barreling into the car through the windows
she is surrounded by people in the car
robbie and ray are getting beat in the crowd
ray manages to pull out his gun
he fires off two rounds into the air
the crowd instantly moves away from him
one man yells take it easy
no sign of robbie
pointing the gun at the people on the roof of the car get off the car
get men start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening ray
continues get off the car
realizing robbie is nowhere in sight
wheres my son
you dont need that man
put the gun down man
its not me
still determined to find robbie robbie
ray is able to pull robbie out from the crowd
robbie has a running bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach
he is fighting to catch his breath because he had it knocked out of him
the camera moves from robbie to ray then pivots on his face to reveal a man holding another gun at rays head
okay man now listen
put down the gun
im taking the car
my daughters in the car
shaking the gun nervously put down the gun im taking the car
all i want is my daughter
ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street
ray then puts his hands near his head to avoid being shot
please all i want is my daughter
surprisingly calm im taking the car
i just want my daughter
please just let me take my daughter can i
all i want is my daughter
okay go ahead take her take her yeah yeah
ray grabs rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the drivers seat and closes the door
robbie who has managed to get to his feet hunched over walks over to ray
ray with rachel in his arms and robbie walk to the diner on the street
the man backs up the car just as the camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street
the man picks up rays gun and looks at the man in the van
the three of them are walking to a booth in the diner
ray with rachel in his arms is beginning to bleed from his head wound
he walks with a slight limp
rachel is panic stricken
robbie lets go of his bloody nose and with both hands clenches his chest in pain
he is still fighting to catch his breath
they are all soaked from the rain
they all sit down at the booth
the power is flickering on and off
as they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had gunshots are heard
ray jumps and catches his head in his hands as it throbs
robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach
robbie turns around to see the man with rays gun firing at riot man
one more gunshot is heard
rachel scurries over to robbie who despite his pain grabs rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort
the van drives away
rachel sobs as ray also starts crying because nobody knows what to do from here
robbie looks at ray for some comfort
he has none
walking down the street dusk they are walking in a crowd of about
some men share their stories of assumption
one man says
europes got it the worst
while another man says weve got it the worst
while some people dont give a shit who it is
looks like the powers still on here
yeah powers still on because nothing bad has come up from under the ground
a rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and lights start going off
the people stand behind the guard just like cars
a train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter with a robot
the entire train is flaming and burning
the train as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash
the bars go up as the train completes its crossing
the people continue walking
random pointless music is playing over the pa system as people are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat
a blood bank woman says over a megaphone
unless you are o positive and rh negative thank you but we already have more blood than we can use
repeats message shots of the herded people boarding the ferry
solders are heard and seen saying this way and keep it moving folks
please move forward calmly the boat can make more than one trip
please move forward calmly take your time dont rush
ray and sheryl hug as they are re united
oh my gosh are these your kids
yes this is rachel
hi im sheryl this is my daughter nora
ray sheryl nora and rachel exchange handshakes
hi ive heard about you nora
rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from the boat
robbie meets sheryl with ray
this is my son robbie
hes just like dad
rachel continues watching the gulls
how you doing
you look like shit
rachel is now fully into watching the gulls
ray sheryl and robbie are engaged into small talk
rachel sees the gulls flying around something over the horizon behind the city
to herself the trees are funny
were gonna move some cars out of the way to make more space
give us a few minutes
rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something gets brighter on the horizon
rachel grabs rays finger and he realizes that she wants him
ray turns around to see what rachel wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon
robbie sees ray looking that way so he too looks that way
a robot puts its last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people
it makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody
the crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the ship for safety
the captain sees the overflow and prepares the ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow
to soldiers no more people
no more people
were taking the ramp up
the soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for quite a while
as the crowd starts to collect the soldiers start to bulge forward from people pushing them
three robots now switch on their lights to look over the crowd of people
a moving crowd of about people is now collecting on the soldiers who so far are withstanding
ray now in the front next to a soldier tries to get them to let him and his family through
they say there is no more room
to sheryl you just stay with me
grab my jacket
i got you ferrier
trips oh jesus
oh my god
the harbor master hits the switch to start the ramp motor to begin folding up the ramp
soldiers shove empty cars off the ramp
sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of rays jacket
they run faster and sheryl falls farther behind
robbie makes a grab for her hand but a soldier stops sheryl just short
the ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and latch on to it
ray looks back for sheryl
theres room on the boat
rachel screams as ray runs to the bow with rachel in his arms
robbie is soon to follow
stay with me
stay with me robbie
robbie runs right past them and up to the captains deck
robbie panting hard looks at the inclining ramp and sees there are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp
he starts running to the stern of the ship
the captain pushes the throttle all the way full
the propellers start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the dock
pulling away at its ties to the dock the ship begins pulling away
seeing robbie running to the stern robbie
robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded up ramp
climbing to the top he begins helping those who are hanging on the back side of the ramp
here grab my hand
i got you
camera turns or rays face
ray looks at robbie helping people in admiration and proud ness
the captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into a hole
the ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole being sucked in
oh my god
passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges from the whirlpool
hundreds of gallons of water are tossed up with the robot
the water in the air turns to snow as it falls on the ship
the robots engines howl in the air
fearing danger to his son robbie
the robots claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one side and finally tip over on its side
robbie is already running towards ray
at the turn of the ship the three go into the water
cars start coming towards them
a car comes right for them
the car hits the water where they are instantly pinning robbie and ray to the front of it
rachel is holding on to robbies back also going down
the people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water
as the ship completely capsizes people are thrown or washed into the water
cars sink down people float and the ship bobs in the water
ray is able to un pin himself and pulls robbie out
they all begin swimming to the surface
rachel lags behind and robbie grabs her and helps her up
at the surface they meet
a ship propeller at full power
they begin to swim away from it
claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and pulling them into the robots holds
ray is heaving rachel up to shore
robbie is not far behind
they are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for so long
ray can no longer haul rachel up the beach
help me with her
robbie almost slips as he gags still fighting for breath
pulling each other up the hill
alert sirens can be heard coming from the city
ray pulls the two of them
yells in pain ahhh
they all lay on the hillside gasping for air
in the distance they look
two robots are still picking people up out of the water
two more robots have joined and are picking up people off the streets
many people scream
with jaws clattering rachel looks toward the other hillside on the other side of the river
shivering ray and robbie look there with her
three more robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people with their disintegrator beams
many more people scream
rachel in fright runs towards the bushes behind ray
ray sees her and runs with her
robbie runs with them
they stop and squat down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill to join the three
robbie running with clenched teeth stops
his jaw drops as we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing falling from the sky
they continue running through the woods where clothes fall like snow
pasture fence line dark robbie is walking ahead of ray and rachel along a fence line of a pasture
gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about yards away
robbie who always wanted to help in the fight begins walking faster toward the gunfire
robbie slow down
robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster
robbie slow down
robbie who is coming closer to the hill sees army trucks rolling down the road and up the hill
seeing this robbie walks into a slow run along the fence line
ray and rachel try to keep up
we got to stay together robbie
robbie getting closer runs faster faster
ray and rachel duck as a missile comes extremely close to their heads
jets speed by them overhead
robbie in a full scale run runs with the army trucks that have now taken to the hills
ray and rachel run as fast as they can to try to stay with robbie
robbie runs with the trucks with all his might
ray and rachel are now searching for him
sets rachel down next to a tree now dont move
for gods sake calling out for him robbie
ray sees robbie about ahead of him
robbie is held back by two soldiers
robbie gets thrown back by them where ray grabs him and pins him to the ground
robbie fights to get back up
soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over the hill
radio people are telling their officers no effect on target
robbie is watching all he is able to see while ray tries to get his attention on him
robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over the hill
ray gets fed up with robbie
he grabs his shoulders and flips him over on to his back
robbie looks at ray in fright that he did that
ray grabs his coat shoulders and climbs on top of him pining him down to the ground
rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over the hill
rachel is approached by people
they think shes alone so they try to talk her into coming with them ad lib
robbie tries to fight to get up but ray keeps him pinned to the ground
ray sees the couple trying to get rachel to go with them
for a second ray doesnt know what to do
just listen to me
i need to be here
i want to see this
stay for rachel
stay for your sister
please let me go
you need to let me go
ray and robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever
ray looks to rachel who is being carried away by the couple
robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach
after enough trying robbie is able to squirm out of rays grasp on his shoulders
robbie crawls out of rays grasp and stands up
they stare at each other for a while and robbie begins running over the hill
ray runs over to rachel to get her back from the couple
we thought she was alone
she doesnt finish as she scurries away
ray looks at the hill where the soldiers were firing at
a flaming army truck rolls over the hill
two more trucks come over the hill ablaze
a ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill
the explosion blast is almost big enough to knock ray off of his feet
by now robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site
a robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the hill
ray makes a run for it down the hill
we can see three robots now rising over the hill
missiles and bullets are being fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery
harland lives in the basement of his house about feet away from the hill that the robots came over
he is holding a rifle as a signal for anybody who can see him
ray and rachel run towards him
the three of them scurry into the basement
ray and rachel run into the main room while harland proceeds to close the cellar doors
gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people
lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door
harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks at ray and rachel
his face half lit looks medieval with the clothes he wears
harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where ray and rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes
to rachel you all right
rachel does not respond most likely due to shock
to ray and what about you
ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern
he is still heard muttering robbie very quietly
harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about on the floor
the army platoon has gone far enough over the hill that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard
while harland moves the wheel barrel to rachel there you go
is that comfortable
i need you to close your eyes now okay
you need some sleep
rachels face is pure white with some red around her eyes
ray already knows what she is going to ask
hes gonna meet us
hey robbies gonna meet us rach in boston at your grandmas
harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall
about ready to cry what do you think moms doing right this minute
harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation
he begins sharpening a shovel with a file
shes in boston
and i know shes not sleeping cause she is so worried about you
trying to comfort her
and shes in grandmas kitchen and shes making that awful tea that she makes
and theyre all just
there all just counting the minutes until they see you again
rachel is crying because she misses robbie and her mom
ray sees the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to investigate what it is
picking up the ribbon what is this
what is this
the walk trot and canter
she begins to feel dreary
sing me lullaby and goodnight
shakes his head in displeasure because he cant think of it i dont remember that one
sing me hushabye mountain
im sorry rach i dont know that one either
rachel turns over her back to ray because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him
ray thinks for a moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught
begins to sing im not bragging baby
so dont put me down
because ive got the fastest set of wheels in the town
something comes up to me that dont even try
rachel turns back over as ray continues singing
if i had a set of wings man i know she could fly
shes my little deuce coupe
you dont know what ive got
just my little deuce coupe
now whispering you dont know what ive got
rachel has fallen asleep
ray kisses her on the forehead
harland taps two glasses together and says
ray gets up and begins walking towards him
disgusting i know it
i found a whole case of this shit
harland hands ray a glass as they both sit down
silence falls over for a period
im sorry about your son
we got separated
hes gonna meet us in umm
ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask
whispers did you loose anybody
all of them
introduces himself harland ogilvy
introduces himself ray ferrier
they shake hands
i got water
enough for weeks
youre welcome to stay both of yous
ray gets up from the conversation
im gonna get some sleep
speaks loud enough to get ray to pause those machines those tripods they got
they buried them
right under our feet
since before there were even people here
theyve been planning this for a million years
were beat to shit
ray looks at harland sternly because he is afraid rachel may hear what he may say next
please my daughter
think about it
they defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days
walked right over us
and these are only the first theyll keep coming
this is not a war any more than theres a war between men and maggots
this is an extermination
ray walks over to where rachel is sleeping
feeling hes not grasping the reality are you afraid
of course i am
going on i been around death plenty
drive an ambulance in the city
well drove and ambulance in the city
thats all over now huh
you know the people who make it ray
the ones that dont flatline before the hospital
its the ones who keep their eyes open keep looking at you keep thinking
there the ones who survive
we can t loose our heads ray
running thats whatll kill you
im dead set on livin
he pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke
dead set on living
harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first started
thank you for taking us in
ray lies down next to rachel as harland finishes
were not going to be exterminated
the ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside
ray gets back up just as boom
a small piece of the corner of the basement collapses from all the vibration
with shotgun at side its okay
come on i wanna show you something
they both are waling towards a window
were gonna fight them ray
they gotta have a weakness
come on take a look
ray and harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground
somehow they killed a few of these things in osaka
thats what i heard
you telling me the japanese can figure it out but we cant
ray goes over to rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere else
we can do it
we can get em
we can figure it out
ray puts the now wide awake rachel in a chair
stay right there
ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground almost as if they are tilling up the soil
he now understands that robots do this on a regular basis
i have a daughter
why did you bring us here
to fight em together ray
now well be the ones coming up from underground
when the time is right well take em by supries the way they took us
well take em by surprise
ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying with an insane man
were right under their feet ray
right here under their feet
ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly
he feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe
he examines it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming in and out as the robots work
he takes another piece of a wall and studies that one
ray hears a hovering craft over his head
a light flows over the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board hall in the basement
harland is sitting on the stairs with rachel
you miss your mommy
i had a little girl nearly your age
you know if anything happens to your daddy ill take care of you
ray is very angry that harland is saying things like that to his daughter
rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him
they both stare at harland on the stairs in dismay
distinctly angry but not yelling you dont have anything to say to her do you understand
if you want to talk to somebody or ask somebody a question you ask me
also angry at ray what exactly is your plan ray
i know what im gonna do
how about you
you gonna sit here wait for them to come get you
is that your plan
harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing miscellaneous things
maybe you want to get caught
couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you i bet
youll probably turn yourself right in
the robots outside stop moving
all the rumbling stops
paying no attention maybe youll be okay
maybe youll get lucky and theyll train you as their pet
you know train you feed you teach you how to do tricks
yells will you shut up and listen
pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating down into the hole
ray hides behind the stairs
the camera eye opens and lights turn on for it
rachel is hiding as well
the camera looks around the couch
ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch
it sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds
ray and harland exchange looks as ray runs toward rachel to hide with her
the robot continues checking out the basement
harland grabs an axe to cut off the camera from its limb
ray shakes his head no to get him to stop
ray silently does expressions to convince him not to
harland goes towards ray so they can hide together
harland almost makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers which clang together
the robot hears this and turns around toward the noise
they run to a different spot
robot gets closer
ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot into seeing another robot
the camera looks over the mirror and sees nothing
it turns around just as
rachels boot slides making a noise
the robot views into the boot that is hanging out
it looks behind the mirror to find just a boot sitting there
ray rachel and harland are in the middle of the basement
a sight of relief comes as the robot camera exits out of the hole
now the actual aliens come into the basement
harland turns the lantern out and runs to hide
the aliens look around the basement
they look at smell and touch various different things throughout the basement
ray rachel and harland scurry to different parts of the basement
harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens but the gun is pulled back by ray
dead silent give me that
ray and harland are in a silent fight for the gun
they both have their hands on it
the aliens continue looking around
ray and harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun
harland pins ray against the wall and forces him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp
the aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box
ray lets go of the gun and harland jerks it away from him just as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot
the aliens scurry out through the open hole
harland comes down to ray now sitting on the floor and says
you and i
i dont think we are on the same page
the vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along the concrete slab under the window
robots are spraying a red mist out of the back of their ships
ray holds his hand in the mist that is entering the window
after a moment
ray retracts his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood
harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of blood
they both turn back around then harland runs
ray watches a man being set down fighting to be let go
a needle like object comes down and stabs the man
it then pumps the blood out of him
ray has a horrified look on his face
repeats for about minutes not my blood
ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling
the robots stop because they hear him
ray runs to harland who is digging some sort of hole
you gotta stop it
you gotta be quiet or theyll hear you
with an insane expression and tone they drink us
please theyll hear you
then they spray us like a fertilizer
you gotta be quiet
drink us and
theyre gonna come back down here
harland has mentally lost it now
then they spit us out all over their goddamn red weeds
no longer whispering do you understand what im gonna have to do

harland pays no attention to him
this tunnel will get us to the city
well have our own tunnels there
subway see what im saying

sneak attacks at night
ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead with a shovel
ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile next to harland
were the resistance ray
they cant occupy this country
occupations always fail
historys taught us that a thousand times
this is our land
ray runs up the stairs of the room to rachel standing calmly in the middle of the basement
we eat it we breathe it only we can live on it
they cant survive here ray
they werent built for it
ray hugs rachel because he knows what he has to do
harland goes on saying odd things as ray gets rachel prepared for what he has to do
ray puts a black cloth over rachels eyes which makes her breathing go erratic
what are you doing
whatever you hear
dont take this off
what was that song
that lullaby i didnt know
hushabye mountains yeah
please rach sing it
begins to sing
a gentle breeze
on hushabye mountain
thats my girl
for far away my baby goes
ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears
then walks back to harland
he is still digging and chanting not my blood it fills the sails
harland stops and sees ray standing in the doorway
of boats that are waiting
ray closes the door behind him as he steps in
waiting to sail your worries away rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the door
so close your eyes
youre on hushabye mountain
rachels voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter
wave goodbye to the cares of the day and watch your boat from hushabye mountain sail far away from lullaby bay
all is silent for a while
ray opens the door and walks out
rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold
ray is sitting on the stairs
rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her
they both sit there in silence
ray and rachel are sleeping on the couch
as we view down from rays face we find that rachel is wide awake for some reason
she sits up and
a robot camera is away from her face
rachel runs to the wall still screaming as ray hits the camera with his hands
the camera hits the ceiling and shakes its self off of debris
ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment line
rachel screams as he hits the line
over and over and over
rachel runs up the basement stairs
ray continues hitting it and it finally pulls away
the camera still attached by a hair hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole
no response for a few seconds then rachel lets off a gut wrenching scream
to himself oh my god no
he runs up the stairs to search for her in the house
looks up the stairs rachel
ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in the doorway
he quickly brushes them down stepping out the door
searching rachel make some noise baby
he begins walking down a path to look for her farther out
talk to me baby come on
he gets no response from rachel
all is dead silent accept for him
ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the hill
a robots lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough to him to blow him back
one of the robots grabbing claws comes after ray
he hides in a truck
the claw breaks through the glass grabs the car and flips it causing it to roll about times
now in the car lying upside down he hears rachel scream
he looks and rachel is standing at the top of a hill
the robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw
ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it
the robot blasts through a building
ray is right behind the foot
he runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades
he takes on off removes the pin and throws it at the robot
it hits the robots shields and the robot turns right around
it eyeballs ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw
screams in pain ahhh
he is thrown into a cage with about other people in it as well
the gate closes on the top as he is thrown in
the camera shows he is in one of two cages
people scream and cry in confusion
ray spots rachel sitting on the side of the grate
he goes towards her just as the door opens it makes a sound and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot
ray falls down luckily it grabs another person and sucks him into the ship
the same happens in the other cage
reaching rachel rachel
no response rachel
she seems to be frozen
ray goes to speak just as boom
the grate shifts tossing all the people around and the door opens to take another person up
ray ducks down with rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing claw
he is swept up by it
rachel holds on to his neck to go with him
but then ray sees his belt of grenades
he prigs rachels hands off of him and grabs the grenades
a soldier sees this and latches onto rays arm
people all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving him and ray down
they loose ground until more people join
we got him
ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the cage
ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth
this is seen by the soldier
hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes
we can see the robot exploding on the inside
it breaks doors and fluid stars spilling out of it
the robot releases its cages and they fall into a tree
people promptly climb out
once the robot falls to the ground rachel looks at ray in a way that meant how did you do that
boston city limits freeway day ray walks with rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering them to keep moving
the crows are now eating the red plant which appears to be dying rapidly
ray picks up a piece of dead plant
what happened to it
ray crumples the plant in his hand
it turns to dust and blows away
watching the dust they walk along to find a robot lying half struck into a building
i dont know somethings happening to them
please keep moving
ray goes up to another soldier for information
somethings happening to them
just keep moving sir
ray asks another soldier down the road for information
excuse me excuse me what happened here
you guys take it down
no sir it was behaving erratically walking in circles then it went down on its own about an hour ago
to people now lets keep moving dont stop do not stop
rachel and ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other people
how is it dead all by its self
rachel im not sure
seeing another robot one soldier motions to get into the water tunnel
other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense if necessary
everyone gets into the tunnel
a soldier can be heard telling everyone calm down and get in the tunnel
ray notices that birds are flying over and landing on the robot
the robots shields are down
as he goes to tell someone the robot makes the viberating sound
to a soldier during the robot noise louder look at the god damn birds
the soldier looks at them and doesnt get what rays getting at
he looks back at ray
the noise continues erratically as if the robot is fighting to stay alive
motions and says i cant hear you
pointing no shields
now getting it to the soldiers the ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out
to the people in the tunnel and rachel its safer in here
soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles at the robot
the first missile hits the grabbing claws and knocks them off
a few more shots and the robot collapses into a nearby factory
the factory explodes and the robot grinds to a halt on the ground
they check it to be clear as an alien falls out of the door
it quickly dies on site
we watch the alien turn to stone as it dies
boston walking down street near mary anns mothers house day mary ann walks up to the front door and sees ray walking down the street with rachel in his arms
she flutters open the doors and she and rachel run towards each other on the street
mary ann begins crying
they hug each other crying
mary ann looks at ray who is still standing in the middle of the street
just barely hearable thank you
mary anns parents come out of the door
the mother has a shocked look on her face
tim is behind them
rays eyes and face perk up as we see robbie coming down the front steps towards him
ray and robbie take a good look at each other and robbie finally mutters with a dry throat
they hug each other in thankfulness for each others survival
