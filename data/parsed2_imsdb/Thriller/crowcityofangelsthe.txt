written by david s goyer james obarr a heavy mist hangs before us endless and impenetrable
and out of that primordial fog a crow materializes flying toward the camera in slow motion
i believe theres a place where the restless souls wander
burdened by the weight of their own sadness they cannot enter heaven
presently a second shape materializes a figure on horseback
a warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony mask war paint
and so they wait trapped between our world and the next endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain in the hopes that somehow some day
the figure on horseback sweeps past us disappearing once again into the mists of time
they will be reunited with the ones they love
the crow settles on a shipping container tilts its head watching
close on a pair of hands tearing open a tiny glassine envelope filled with powder our drug du jour trinity
the face of the envelope has been stamped with an image a cartoon imp with a shit eating gring giving us the thumbs up sign
a man lowers his face to the envelope snorts up the powder
the man discards the glassine envelope
as it flutters to the ground landing imp side up
let the rush begin
garbage poisoned waters wreathed in fog
although once part of a thriving shipping industry decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish dumping ground
case in point are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier their arms linked together then tied behind their backs
danny corven is quietly sobbing
ashe late s tries to calm the frightened boy
im sorry dad
i didnt mean to look
its okay danny
a bright light comes on
ashe and danny turn their heads to avoid the glare
a camcorder lens as it auto focuses bringing dannys distorted face into view via the lens reflection
camera finds ashe and dannys executioners curve kali spider monkey and nemo
nemo a post modern sleaze hound circles danny and ashe with a camcorder
he pats ashes face
spider monkey lean and gangly crouches next to ashe holding a marigold in his hand
flowers for the dead senor
ashe stares directly into the camera
suite yourself then
spider monkey tucks the flower behind his ear
danny is praying now mumbling a catholic school litany
youre wasting your breath angelito
nobody up theres listening
we cut to an extreme high angle shot gods omniscient pov perhaps
leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away big burly shaved head a ciggie hanging from his lips
hes got a custom paint job on his pearl drop gas tank a buxom blonde doing the wild thing with the grim reaper
curves also the one who just dusted himself hyped on drugs lets get this over with
kali a cold eyed heavy metal femme with a killers casual stoicism is methodically loading bullets into her revolver
shes taking her own sweet time in defiance of curve
theres a tension between them
finally she flicks her wrist snaps the revolver shut
kali walks up to them
im scared dad
ashe turns to his executioners pleading with them
listen to me please
hes just a kid
let him go
he cant hurt you
he doesnt even know who you are
and puts a bullet through dannys chest
dannys body slumps forward dragging ashe down next to him
ashe stares into his sons lifeless eyes
curve saunters over stares down at ashe flicks his cigarette butt off into the water
nothing personal sport
guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time
curve fires a gun into ashes back
as ashe crumples
lets get this cluster fuck on the road
motions to kali and spider monkey
together the three of them heave ashe and danny into the ocean
bon voyage shitheads
ashe and danny sink down into the murky underworld taking their place amongst a thousand other deep sixed dreams
falling further and further away from the light of the surface world
bit by bit ashes struggles subside
all we hear now is an ever slowing heartbeat
darkness begins to close in around us womblike peaceful
something takes shape a crow
winging its way from ashes dream like death up through watery depths into a smog bound cityscape
the crow flies over a bridge with spans the styx the citys polluted man made river
rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires floods and earthquakes
smog hangs in the air like an army of ever present ghosts
we pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead go back
nevertheless we continue on
they say that time cancels pain
i dont know about that
eight years ago i lost two of my best friends
two thousand miles later i find im still living in the past
sweeps down into man made caverns of pigeon shit concrete and grimy glass
through the birds eyes we glimpse the citys silent homeless
automobile hulks littering the streets like insect husks
the shifting searchlights of police helicopters
the crow circles downward
every night when i close my eyes the dreams come
thats how the dead talk to us i guess
in the dark when our souls are off wandering
the crow lands next to an open window
it perches on the edge looking into the loft
i just wish i understood what they were telling me
sarah early s lies asleep in bed
she stirs troubled by uneasy dreams rolls over opens her eyes
as sarah rises the crow flits away like yesterdays memory
sarahs not sure whether or not she dreamed the bird
gabriel the cat sarah inherited from eric and shelly is perched on the end of the bed
sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind the ear scratch then climbs from bed making her way across the loft
is furnished in thrift store treasures
the loft has an earthy warmth to it in stark contrast to the urban decay outside an island amidst a sea of unrest dominated by an arching half circle window
through which sarah can view the local wildlife on the streets below
turbulent oils reminiscent of historys brooding symbolist painters
give sarahs childhood inspiration the subject matter is no real surprise
camera isolates a work in progress
the painting depicts a woman resembling sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale faced lover surrounded by a sea of watchful dead
reaches the shower strips off her clothes
her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work a pair of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades
shes got a ring in her navel another in a nipple
in short the skate waif we knew back in detroit has matured quite a bit since that fateful devils night
sarah shuts here eyes turns her face up into the spray
for a brief second we see a flash of
plunging into the icy waters down into darkness
just as suddenly we are back in
sarahs eyes snap open
she holds a hand out to the shower wall takes a moment to collect herself
troubled sarah climbs from the shower shrugs on some clothes
among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh the symbol of eternity
as sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony mask that used to hang by shellys mirror
next to the mask is a
theres an inscription inside forever
sarah fingers the ring a moment glancing at the irony mask
lots of memories
lots of ghosts
gabriel creeps up meowing forlornly
she threads the ring onto her necklace letting it fall next to the ankh then slips the silver chain over her head
sarah stands pulls on a jacket heads out
an ill wind kicks up trash and grit
sarah glances down
dozens of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around sarahs feet like confetti
one of the envelopes has stuck to her heel
as she peels it off she catches sight of
in a shadowed entryway
its a teenaged girl strung out on drugs
the girl cowers in a narrow stairway hugging herself shivering from withdrawal
sarah draws closer notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets at the girls feet
the girl shies away frightened suspicious
nice place youve got here
a muttered whisper no place else to go
sarah cant help but recognize a part of herself in this lost soul
listen grace how does some hot coffee sound
maybe a little food
what do you want
guess you just remind me of someone i used to know
after a moment grace offers a reluctant nod
sarah helps her from the entryway into the warmth of the dying light
grace blinks shields her eyes
as they walk away down the street camera rises up to include
perched on a nearby rooftop watching them
the gargoyle is an usassuming ink shop the sole oasis of light in an otherwise desolated block populated by derelict warehouse buildings
flickering neon buzzes in the window
nearby is a battered road sign end city limits
someone has spray painted of the fucking world over city limits
in the distance the bridge of the river styx rises through the mist like a skeletal dinosaur
close on a sparking tattoo gun the needle whirring as it travels over a patch of vaseline smeared skin
yeah stings a little
thats why they call me the mistress of pain
pull back to reveal sarah expertly guiding the needle wearing glasses surgical gloves concentrating
sarahs buzz headed customer sits in a ratty dentists chair
sarah is finishing coloring a japanese dragon which winds its way over the mans forearm
she makes another line of color then sits back smoothing more vaseline over the mans arm
she picks up a jewelers loupe makes an adjustment on her needle
behind sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop walls covered with sheets of flash ready made art bookshelves crammed with reference works
sarahs partner noah a chain smoking proto punk brit consults with a young grunge couple
noah is closing up shop while sarah sterilizes some needles in an autoclave
what a downer this kid wanted me to tattoo if youre reading this youre too close on his bleedin bum
noah fires up a fag flops down into a dentist chair
the two slip into a familiar good natured banter
christ im knackered
beats pushing ink in detroit
that it does princess that it does
oh i bought you a little present
noah reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls something out
its a handmade candy sugar skull with a little strip of paper glued to the bottom a fortune
they do em for the day of the dead
tossing the skull to sarah nice huh
eat the dead
reading fortune life is just a dream on the way to death
i like that
sarah studies the skull then pops it in her mouth nodding
noah rises stretching
want to grab a beer then
no i gotta go home
havent been sleeping much lately
so whats the dirty dogs name
ive just been having some weird dreams
you ever dream that youre dying someone elses death
outside we hear a motorcycle pulling up then someone knocks on the front door
calling out sorry were closed
he pounds harder on the door
open the fucking door
stands moves to the door
look i said were
curve kicks open the door and storms in
he punches noah in the nose then heads straight for sarah
you think what you did to me is funny
some kind of joke
what are you talking about
im talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me
i took off the bandages
curve rips open his shirt revealing his chest
its a crow rendered in bold slashes of black
or is it
upon closer examination the crow looks like something else two demons fighting
the design is a classic ambiguous figure like the picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen as a skull
damn right its a crow
and did i ask for a fucking bird on my chest
sarah shakes her head
then what the fuck is it doing there
i dont know i was just going from the design you gave me
curve backhands sarah across the face
noah rushes forward blood still running from his nose
curve pulls an automatic from his waist band and points the gun at noah
whats it going to be hero
ready to kiss your faggot ass good bye
i think so
i think youre shitting yourself youre so goddamn ready
curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug snorts up the contents
he presses the gun against noahs forehead
over here ass hole
as curve turns sarah squeezes a bottle of tattoo ink into the killers eyes blinding him
sarah plants one of her doc marten boots in curves groin
he screams doubles over
sarah pulls the automatic from his grasp and trains it on him
curve cups his balls slowly rises
his eyes are glowing with manic intensity
a slow smile creeps across curves face
he backs away towards the front door
shoulda killed me while you had the chance sugarplum
be seeing you
curve smashes his fist into the neon sign then ducks out thedoor
moments later we hear his motorcycle roar to life
he takes off engine screaming away into the night
sarah lowers the gun takes a deep breath looks to noah
noah wipes his bloody nose looks to the floor where curve discarded the drug sachet shakes his head in disgust
fuck me wonder what theyll be snorting next
sarah shakes her head at wits end
i just cant do this anymore
im so tired of this
noah pulls sarah toward him gives her a big hug
easy there luv
itll all work out
sarah still clutching curves gun hurries to her galaxy which is parked along the nearby train tracks
sarah moves behind the wheel dumps the gun on the seat and rests her head in her hands
as sarah raises her head
the crow is perched on the hood of her car
sarah honks her horn in frustration
the crow doesnt move
sarah rushes out of her car screaming at the bird
get out of here
sarah fires a wild shot into the sky
the crow files off into the night
sarah collapses against the hood of her galaxy and starts to cry
the crow soars away from the gargoyle toward the beckoning lights of downtown
in the distance a flashing jesus saves sign draws our attention to a monolithic tower
the crow makes its way towards the decaying tower which is crowned by a weather worn campanile
the campanile is a complex arabesque of rusted iron scrollwork like something antonio gaudi conjured up from an art nouveau fever dream
just as the crow is about to reach the campanile it banks away
we however continue to rush onward right through one of the dark openings in the scrollwork
all we see is black then some vague shiny reflections
camera pulls back to reveal a stag beetle imprisoned within a box leashed to a nail with a piece of thread
we were tight on its shiny carapace
the beetle strains at its leash moving in a perpetual circle around the nail
over the side of the box
although mere inches in height this enclosure might as well be the great wall as far as our little member of the coleoptera is concerned
we see crime lord judah earls lair in all its sepulchral glory
dark filled with shadows
the decor is a cross between ruinous palatial splendor and a soho industrial art installation
the upper reaches of the campanile are laced with a spiderweb network of steel girders
look close enough and you might see people bound to the supporting pillars like the half glimpsed shapes crouching at the foot of your bed in the middle of the
voices draw our attention to an area partitioned off by chain mail curtains
camera moves in towards a break in the curtains
we linger there for a tantalizing moment
talk to me sibyl
tell me what you see
i see death returning from the veil of tears
he has your name on his tongue
now we plunge in through the curtains
the camera consists of a series of lenses and mirrors which project images from the outside world onto a circular table offering the ultimate voyeuristic view of the crumbling cityscape
two figures stand with their backs to us studying the cameras view
the first is
a sinewy slash mouthed byronic figure with a guttural voice
old before his time touched by childhood visions of his own death
the tower is judahs prison in more ways than one
sibyl judahs blind oracle waits by his side
attractive though of indeterminate sex
his her dour features are hidden beneath a black cowl
its finally beginning isnt it
what mask will death wear can you tell me that
i see the face of one of your victims
judah lifts his head up and we see his luminous amber eyes for the first time
a kind of madness dances within them
all my sins remembered
sarah sits in bed cigarette burning in one hand a half filled wine glass in the other
she turns out her light looks to the window and the cityscape beyond as if the answers were lying out there in the steam cloaked streets
someones speed induced pov
performers flaunt their flesh on a raised stage
crowds of sexual libertines and cutting edge fetishists writhe as one on the dance floor
lots of rubber latex strap bodices victorian hoop skirts its a modern day de sades wet dream
on curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh
he pulls up to a bar takes a seat alongside kali and spider monkey whos amusing himself with a viewmaster
click click we see monkeys pov as the d tableaus rotate into position a barrel chested samoan sets a drink down in front of curve nods a greeting
curve sits back opens his shirt nudges spider monkey
spider monkey whats this tattoo look like to you
this a test
come on man just tell me what you see
spider monkey inspects curves chest
think about it a minute
dont you see two demons
i see a bird
ah fuck you then
curve lifts up his beer bottle
ecu from within the beer as the amber liquid rushes towards us
air bubbles escaping blood
ashe is drowning again the orbs of his eyes bulging outwards
over this we hear a womans scream and
sarah bolts up in bed knocking her wine glass to the floor shattering it
shes choking gasping for breath
her heart is hammering within her chest
suddenly she catches sight of a shadow on the wall before her a giant bird slowly spreading its black wings
sarah turns to the window
the crow is perched just outside
what do you want from me
the crow caws then takes flight
calm now realization and a sense of purpose dawning
we descend towards the empty docks pushing out into the mist shrouded water then down into the oceans murky depths
come into view caught up in a tangle of razor wire
unaltered by the ravages of time
his eyelids flicker dreaming
a single tear escapes flowing down his cheek
we push on inside we see brief memory flashes of he and danny together
danny stretched out on the floor of their garage painting a picture
danny and ashe rough housing having a water fight
danny sitting in ashes lap as ashe reads aloud from a story
midway through our lifes journey i came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost
danny asleep curled up next to his father
ashe reaches out and strokes dannys hair
his dead eyes suddenly open
a stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth obscuring our view
as the bubbles clear dannys face comes into focus just a few inches from his own
ashe panics jerks back
the razor wire barbs cut into his flesh
the more he struggles the tighter the coils become slashing his hands and face shredding his clothes
hes caught in his sons embrace the two of them thrashing about in a grotesque underwater ballet
the headlights of sarahs galaxy cut through the fog
she pulls up just in time to see the crow disappearing into the mist which cloaks the bridge
sarah follows trying to keep up with the bird
ashes struggles become more and more violent
he thrashes churning up a cloud of bubbles
we are intercutting quickly now between ashes turmoil and
sarah reaches the pier where ashe and danny were executed
she climbs from her car
flies on ahead landing atop one of the piles staring down into the water
starts toward the bird we
ashe tears his hands free clawing his body away from the barbwire swimming to the surface in a storm of bubbles
of subjective povs
the killers walking down the jetty marching ashe and danny to their deaths and
we are beneath the jetty now in the present looking up through the slats as a figure sarah
makes its way to the water
camera cranes up from beneath the jetty to reveal sarah standing there in silhouette
ashe is propelled towards the surface
ashe suddenly bursts from the sea with his arms outstretched
a hellish venus on the half shell
gasping full of terror and rage
he lets loose a tortured howl
digs his fingers into the wood rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to the jetty
he collapses down onto the wooded slats
crouches before us his face hidden from view
he reaches out his hand touching an unmistakable blood stain
dannys blood stain
this triggers more painful memories
images from ashe and dannys execution assault him
kali firing her gun
dannys body slumping forward like a marionette whose strings have been severed
ashe lifts his head wailing
hes covered from head to toe in ocean bottom silt
blood from the razor wire wounds has smeared across his face in patterns which eerily recall the crow make up
strips of the wire still cling to his arms and chest the barbs buried deep in his flesh
reliving the violent moment is more than his mind can bear
ashes eyes roll up into his head
the world spins around him
but even as the lights are going out ashe glimpses
standing in front of him
its the last thing ashe sees before consciousness escapes him
emerges from the shadows staring down at ashe in wonder
ashe opens his eyes
the mud silt which covers his face has dried and cracked causing it to crumble away in flakes
ashe is lying on a cot in the middle of the loft
we see scattered images candles burning a reilgious altar overflowing with trinkets mirrors mannequins canvases and finally
perched at the end of the bed watching ashe intently
sits on the other side of the loft in a paint smeared work shirt brush in hand
shes studying a half finished canvas contemplating her next move
the eerie scene depicting a woman on her death bed being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover
sarah tenses feeling ashes eyes burning into the back of her neck
she turns around sees ashe
who are you
my names sarah
i had a dream about you
i saw them shoot you and your son
i saw you drowning
ashes shuts his eyes a moment trying to recall the imagery
curve fires a gun into ashes chest
ashe crumples and we are back at
ashe looks down at his chest tracing his fingers over the area where bullet holes should be
instead he finds a series of indented welts
how did i survive
sarah suddenly comes to the terrible realization that ashe does not know he has died
coming towards him you didnt
ashe looks up at sarah uncomprehending
ashe stands enraged
he starts toward sarah
she backs away
stop looking at me that way stop looking this isnt real none of this is real
im dreaming this
shaking her head frightened no
the two of the struggle a moment ashe pushes sarah back
sarah reaches for him trying to restrain him trying to somehow keep his rising terror in check
shes not getting through to him he cant be made to listen
finally sarah grabs a kitchen knife from the counter and plunges it into ashes chest
he stares down at the incongruous sight of a knife handle stickout out from his sternum then he yanks the knife back out
a moment of shock then
looking at her a tortured whisper im dreaming this
sarah tries to reach for ashe again
he tears away from her flinging her back and running for the door
ashe stumbles from the doorway out onto the sidewalk
he rushes blindly up the street
from the fleeing ashe to sarahs window
on a pillar outside the crow is waiting
sarah rushes to the window watching ashe run
she sees the crow perched below her
it takes wings flying after ashe
beneath the arching span of a freeway bridge is a series of corrugated iron sheds
camera follows as ashe exhausted fro his run makes his way towards them
the crow flies on ahead landing next to one of the doors beckoning
ashe slides one of the rattling doors open
as light spills in we catch a glimpse of the humble auto repair garage tools a few wrecks in progress a motorcycle
camera isolates a tempera painting on the floor thats been executed on construction paper
a brush and a collection of paint canisters are scattered around it like the kind you might find in a primary school art class
ashe kneels next to the painting
an image rendered by a childs optimistic imagination a crude father and sone respectively labeled dad and me
a footprint mars the otherwise perfect memento
ashe touches the figure labeled me which triggers
ashe is working beneath a car
danny is sprawled on the floor
he holds up the painting in question
what color should i make the sun
theres no such thing
well there should be
just then we hear a gunshot coming from outside
wide eyed what was that
danny climbs to his feet moves outside
ashe slides out from under the car
from the back doorway ashe and danny catch sight of curve and his crew executing someone beneath the freeway overpass
curves face is splattered with blood
he turns and sees them
see no evil
now were back at the pier
the memory flashes are coming faster and faster
danny is sobbing once again
im sorry dad
we see kali raise her gun
theres the muzzle flash
ashe nothing personal sport
ashe is tearing the place apart sobbing knocking over racks of tools
finally he sinks to his knees his face a mask of tears
ashe spins murderous rage in his eyes
never startle an animal right
stands in the doorway
why are you here
i dont know
she stops herself she does know she just didnt want to admit it to herself
i want to help you
i need to
sarah approaches dropping by ashes side
she sees dannys painting which ashe cradles protectively
ashe looks up at sarah his eyes full of questions
everythings so confused
anguished touching the drawing danny
hes not here anymore
sarah draws closer touched by ashes inner struggle
she reaches out to him drawing him into her arms
he stares up at her eyes distant
theres no moon
sarah touches ashes face calming him trying to reach through his pain
youve been given another chance ashe to put the wrong things right
sarahs eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered nearby
she reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the lid dipping her fingers inside
sarahs re creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic feel to it
yet the act is also quite erotic for the mutual attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable
as sarah continues to speak she begins to paint ashes face using dannys art supplies
we see this transformation in bits and pieces an eye here fingers dipping into the canister of white there ruby lips being smeared with black
the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different from erics
its the legacy of the crow as funneled through ashes own unique pain
i believe thereve always been people like you
sarah has finished
she sits back surveying her work
its the pain that brings people back
it makes us strong again
close on ashes face as he turns towards us
a slash of light illuminates the signature black and white war paint of the crow in all its glory
ashe looks like a dark saint
ashe rockets beneath the gothic arches of the freeway overpass on his motorcycle hellfire burning in his eyes his coat flapping behind him like a fallen angels wings
flies alongside ashe
lands on a telephone wire studying the warehouse
presently we hear ashes motorcycle approaching then we see the front wheel of his bike pulling into the foreground
ashe turns to the crow slyly giving the bird the thumbs up sign
ca chunk ca chunk ca chunk
close on a sheet of glassine drug bags as a hand powered printing press comes down mass producing the image of the imp giving us the thumbs up
pull back to reveal the lab set up in a maze of barrells
the walls are stained from the toxic fumes
blacked out windows sweat with moisture
there are heating mantles rigged with flasks and condensers vacuum pumps along with ingredients like battery acid paint thinner and epsom salts
nearby are dozens of gallon drums containing the finished product
spider monkey is working away at the printing press pausing to snoot some of judahs drug
nearby is an old tv featuring lurid videos of amateur bull riding we watch as a drunken participant gets gored
suddenly the power in the lab goes out the tv screen sputters and goes dark
my mother was accursed the night she bore me and i am faint with envy of all the dead
spider monkey whirls around startled
ashe is sitting cross legged on one of the tables grinning like a black leather buddha
tell me monkey
does the corpse have a familiar face
who the fuck are you
you have to learn to look beyond the mask
ashe jumps down from the table walking into the light
spider monkeys eyes widen in recognition
no way man
we put you under
you and that little snot nosed kid
ashe dips his hand into one of the gallon drums
he blows a handful of the trinity dust at spider monkey
spider monkey terminally spooked reaches back to the counter behind him searching for something
looking for this
ashe holds up a pistol and puts it to his head
an evil grin dont try this at home kids
puts a bullet through his own forehead
his head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor
spider monkey creeps forward toward ashes body
springs from the ground slamming spider monkey against a table of chemicals
bottles shatter on the floor spilling their toxic contents
what are you
what the fuck are you
ashe leans in so hes eye to eye with spider monkey
i wasnt sure at first
now i know
im the boiling man monkey
im the plague of darkness and the death of the first born
all your nightmares rolled into one
ashe removes a wooden match from his inside coat pocket
he scrapes his thumb nail over the head igniting it
this shits flammable
look look what do you want
who are they
ill start with nemo then work my way up the food chain
where is he
nemos an old gash hound
he hangs out at the peep o rama on deacon street
ashe blows the match out
you just bought yourself a fighting chance
ashe reaches into his coat pocket pulling out a deck of cards
he fans them out points
pick a card monkey
spider monkey slowly extends his hand half expecting ashe to pounce on him
he pulls a card out
spider monkey tosses the card down face up
hes got the jack of hearts
he smiles tentatively
ashe pulls out a card of his own and flips it around the king of clubs
lady lucks a bitch
ashe produces another wooden match
aw jesus cmon man
youre wasting your breath angelito
nobodys up there listening
as ashe scrapes his thumb nail over the head
an explosion rips through the front of the lab spilling roiling clouds of fire out into the street
the blackened windows shatter outwards in a hail storm of glass
ashe emerges from the raging conflagration walking right through the flames indifferent to the heat
a flurry of the tiny glassine drug bags swirl around him like snow
spirals down from a telephone wire landing atop the handlebars of ashes motorcycle
lifts his head to the night sky laughing
his clothes are still smoking
sarah is working at one of the drawing tables
noah is mixing pigments
shes working on a rendering of ashe
she sits back
and all the world will be in love with night
do you believe in fate noah
seeems to me its more a question of fate believing in you
sarah rises reaching for her bag
as she heads for the exit noah reaches for the sketch
he smoothes it out studies the image awhile as we
the demolished building is still burning strong
curve arrives on the scene dismounting his motorcycle
as he studies the shattered glass which litters the asphalt
the fire is reflected in the fragments
with a growing sense of dread curve looks from the glass to the tattoo on his chest
he touches the crow tattoo
now we see that the glass shards have fallen in an array that is anything but random
the shards have taken the shape of a large crow
flys past a line of palm trees which burst into flames
two zipper masked women are frolicking on a bed acting out an elaborate bondage fantasy
pull back to include
recording the pornographic act for posterity
pull further back to include
lounging on a couch a few dozen yards away watching the women on four video monitors detached and twice removed from the sex play
enters from out of the shadows
judah looks up to him
someone torched the lab on manchester
spider monkeys a fucking crispy critter
monkey i could care less about
what about our merchandise
a total loss
he left a sign didnt he
judah looks to sibyl who is standing nearby
rising uneasy i dont know what youre talking about
yes you do
youve seen it
sibyl points an accusing finger at curves chest
youve been marked
even more agitated jesus christ judah why the fuck to you listen to her
because she speaks the truth
judah rises swiftly from his chair
he snags a handful of curves shirt and rips it open revealing the crow tattoo
whats this curve
a beauty mark
your enemy wears the mask of the crow
the bird of ill omen
close on judah as the words sink in
he strides across the floor sweeping aside one of the curtains surrounding the camera obscura
ive heard the legends
looks down at a view of the seething landscape
let him come then
the peep o rama occupies an old japanese movie house
a geisha girl sign flashes over the marquee
beneath that is a blinking neon eye which opens and closes
other signs offer enticements like only cents a peep
and real girls working their way through as nemo approaches a laconic hindu with a throat microphone sits outside reciting his tired schpiel
tokens for the buddy booths live girls
tokens for the buddy booths live girls
nemo hands the hindu a twenty
nemo enters a cramped booth clutching a handful of tokens embossed with the peep o rama eye logo on them
theres a seat a box of kleenex a phone and a grimy plexiglas window with a metal shutter over it
nemo starts popping tokens into the slot next to the window pockets the rest of them
with a whir the metal shutter rises revealing a woman in a garter belt get up perched on a stool
in a forgiving light she might even be beautiful
an led display starts counting down from sixty the seconds remaining on the metered shutter
nemo picks up the receiver
you got a name
do you want me baby
i need to see some sugar
holly shrugs out of her bra plants her scuffed up high heels on either side of the window runs her hands up and down her body utters some tired ass
right on sister
nemo unbuckles his belt drops his drawers
eyeing his endowment mmmm
is that for me
yeah were gonna celebrate christmas a little early this year
keep doing that honey youll go blind
holly is still moaning
over on the led display nemos time has just about expired
times almost up lover
better hurry up with those tokens
nemo fumbles with his pants scoops out some more tokens
too late the shutter is already closing
nemo feeds some more tokens into the slot
nemo punches the led display
come on fucker
the shutter starts rattling up again only this time
is standing on the other side of the plexiglas
his mouth splits into an evil grin
do you want me baby
nemos eyes just about pop from his skull
ashe slams his fists through the plexiglas window reaching for nemos throat
nemo comes flying out the booth door
he struggles to rise
a chorus of orgasmic sighs and cheesy surf music drifts out from the other booths
hey mime boy
zeke the peep o ramas corpulent manager is cradling a sawed off shotgun
he blows a blast into ashes chest
ashe starts toward zeke unfazed
zeke moves to fire again
ashe snatches the shotgun from the fat mans grasp smashing him in the face with the butt end
zeke falls back into a video display sending an avalanche of porno tapes raining down on top of him
seizing the moment nemo rushes for the exit
ashe spins pumps the shotgun blows out one of nemos kneecaps
nemo collapses on the floor wailing like a child
ashe strides over to him
one crow sorrow
he heaves nemo through a glass display booth filled with sex toys
ashe punctuates each line of the nursery rhyme with a new assault on nemo
two crows joy
nemo starts dragging his broken body across the floor
he finds himself face to face with an anatomically correct blow up sex doll the kind with a built in pre recorded memory chip
ooh oh baby i like it like that
youre so good
youre so good
three crows a letter four crows a boy
ashe heaves nemo back the other way sending him smashing into the front counter
peep o rama tokens go flying bouncing and spinning every which way
on one side of the coin the eye is open on the other its closed this creates the illusion of the eye blinking
five crows silver six crows gold
nemo utters a half sob and rolls over feebly wiping away the blood which is clouding his eyes
seven crows a secret never to be told
please please just stop
ashe pries open nemos eyes with his fingers
you killed my son nemo
you took away the only piece of light left in my soul
we had to
never leave any witnesses
we didnt have a choice
we always have a choice
ashe plunges his fingers into nemos eyes killing him off camera
he lifts up his now blood covered hands and turns
just then holly daze bursts out into the hall
she sees ashe and yelps certain her numbers up
ashe grabs her by the wrist spinning her around
ashe touches her face and sees a split second flash of
jump cut bump and grind cat calls laughter the distorted faces of men leering with their hungry eyes tongues and sweaty palms and heavy breath and i wanna be your
fucking dog baby and
shuts his eyes reeling
ashe looks up at holly one victim to another
his eyes burn a laser beam into her soul
if you value what youve lost youll walk away from this place and never look back
holly daze nods with conviction
ashe releases her
she bolts like a rabbit flushed from cover
curve roars up on his motorcycle followed by kali and a car load of enforcers
the team grab their weapons head for the porno shop
kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop
but curve stops sensing something
he spins around
is sitting atop one of the cars watching him
kali and curve move down the dark corridor
the porn actress voices from the vid booths continue their orgiastic moans but one voice in particular stand out
ooh oh baby youre so good
at the end of the corridor lounging in the arms of the sex doll which is still repeating its tinny refrain
nemos neck has been snapped and his head hangs at an awkward angle
oh yea thats the spot
do me baby
theres a folded piece of paper shoved into nemos mouth
curve pries it out
the paper unfolds like one of those snowflake cut outs we used to make in grade school only this cut out is of a crow
written across the paper crow are the following words a phone on the wall is ringing
ringing and ringing
finally curve leans in snatches up he receiver
do you know what they call a gathering of crows curve
at the sound of ashes voice curves eyes widen with fear
a murder of crows
think about it
the line goes dead
furious curve tears the phone from the wall heaving it across the porno shop
ashe exits a phone booth leaving the receiver dangling
a dog barks nearby followed by the sound of children laughing
ashe turns and sees
a group of children running away giggling their footsteps receding into the night
a black dog trots toward ashe
the children have tied a plastic skull mask to the dogs head
the skull dog trots up the street towards
sandwiched between two derelict buildings
the doors are open theres a path of marigold petals leading up the front steps
the skull dog trots up the steps and enters
ashe moves into the sanctuary
he watches from the rear entranced
people are scattered amongst the pews
at the altar is a lavish offrenda an offering of food and drink for the wandering dead decorated with sugar skulls and floral garlands
amidst the decorations are photos of departed loved ones
there are tiers of candles surrounding these scores of them
an elderly priest emerges from a confessional looking to ashe with a raised eyebrow
can i help you
im sorry father i was just watching
our doors are open
the priest moves to a candelabra and lights some tapers
what is this for
dias de los muertos the days of the dead
we light the candles for our loved ones so that they might find their way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living
ashe watches an old woman place a toy motorcycle in front of a picture of a child
tomorrow night we will celebrate
the people will dance sing
indicating ashes makeup many will wear masks
some spirits linger here too long
they become confused mistaking themselves for the living
they have to be frightened away
the priest nods to ashe and moves down the aisle to the next candelabra
is watching ashe from one of the back pews
he clutches a striped ball
he drops it
the boy rolls the ball across the floor to ashe
ashe kneels and catches it rolling it back
the boy smiles
unnerved ashe retreats out of the sanctuarly letting the nights shadows swallow him up once more
sarah sits by her paintings
gabriel suddenly stands arching his back hair standing on end
appears on the ledge of the broken window crouching there like a gargoyle in silhouette
hesitant but relieved you came back
heaven wouldnt have me and hell was afraid id take the place over
ashe drops into the loft
i needed to see you again
ashe moves towards sarahs paintings pausing to study the one of the woman being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover
he touches the womans face
she looks like you
after a long moment sarah responds
i paint what i see
ashe approaches sarah
he points to the wedding ring which hands from her neck
were you married
it belonged to a friend
where are they now
a better place
sarah turns the ring around her finger fidgeting with it
what about you
dannys mother left after he was born
she was a drug addict
i lost my mother the same way
sarah reaches for a cigarette and lights up taking a long drag
ashe notices a number of scars on her forearm possibly some track marks
sarah catches him looking self consciously pulls her hand back
meeting his gaze i left detroit because i wanted to put the past behind me
the problem is i know how it ends
i dont want a part of it anymore
gabriel approaches ashe
he crouches runs his fingers along the cats back
what happens to me when i finish what im supposed to do here
you go back
what if i dont want to go back
sarah looks away
then youre damned close on a video monitor
were watching the tape documenting ashes death
we see ashes face sinking beneath the waters surface
the image freezes
it was him
it was that son of a bitch we dumped off the pier
i know it
pull back to reveal judah curve and kali gathered around the monitor
sibyl waits nearby
curve is snapping open an envelope of trinity sniffing up the contents
i thought you killed him
i shot him in the head
hes a ghost
no such thing as ghosts
then who killed spider monkey and nemo
curve starts pacing growing more apprehensive
all i know is hes fucking with us
the crows his symbol right
that means im marked
it means hes coming for me now
i thought you said you didnt believe
curve turns on kali furious ready to strike her
in a flash kali has one of her katanas out
curve backs away bristling
look you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales thats your business
but im not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest
im going to take this motherfucker out
you wont stop him with bullets or knives
he doesnt feel pain
he doesnt bleed
dont you see
his soul has crossed over
hes come back from the other side
curve looks like hes going to be sick from fear
but kali and judah are listening intently
l so how do you stop a man whos already dead
can you look destiny in the eye without flinching
judah studies sibyls shadowed face
you tell me
a stare down ensues
judah doesnt avert his gaze
the crow is the source of his power his link between this world and the next
sever that link and hes as vulnerable as the next man
ashe pushes through a curtain turns towards sarahs vanity sees the knick knacks and mementos gathered there then sees the ceramic irony mask which hangs above
ashe approaches reaching a hand out to trace its features
at the bottom of the mirror a faded postcard has been tucked between the frame and the glass
ashe pulls it free studying it
a carnival midway set on the beach people strolling along a boardwalk golden sand and blue skies
words at the top of the picture read wish you were here
ive been here
ashe stares at the picture entranced caught up in a moment of wistful nostalgia for the life hes lost
i took danny last summer
we went up on the bike rode all the way up the coast
it was cold up there
i remember we could see each others breath
ashe catches himself setting the postcard down
he turns his back to sarah hiding his face form her overcome by emotion
sarah stands drawing near
she reaches out to console him touching his shoulder
she alone among all the souls of the world understands the isolation that is consuming ashe
look at me
but ashe wont
look at me
ashe finally turns around a sense of deep and profound loss in his eyes
something unspoken passes between them
sarah leans into ashe tentative eyes searching
its one of those fragile moments where things could go either way
pulling back no
turning away we cant do this
the spell has been broken
ashe starts away from her
i have to finish what i started
i have to find the others
ashe moves to the door hesitant a terrible sense of longing gnawing at his heart
i wish id met you before
ashe nods then turns to leave
theres nothing else to say
sarah watches from her window as ashe strides to his motorcycle
she raises her hand up as if to say good bye
as ashe climbs aboard his bike he catches sight of himself in the
within the bakery are mountains of sugar skulls candy skeletons and pan de muerte bread of the dead
ashes reflection is superimposed over this morbid tableau
ashe fires up the bikes engine
he takes off down the street
judah moves back to the stag beetle watching its sisyphean efforts
so the crow is ashes familiar
to sibyl can his power be taken
the bird is the key the life force that flows within it
the blood of the crow
judah whirls around his eyes glowing with a manic fervor
to curve the tattoo on your chest who gave it to you
some bitch down at the gargoyle but whats that got to do with
judah grips curves shoulders tightly shaking him
everything you idiot
if she gave you his mark then shes connected to him in some way
she can lead us to him
ashe stands at the end of the pier staring down into the silent waters where his natural life ended
he takes something from his coat
which danny had been working on
its got bullet holes in it now
ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens screaming cursing his fate
as seen from afar
a tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse of ocean and sky
curve and kali have duct taped noah to one of the dentist chairs even his mouth and nose have been sealed shut
curve lets noah thrash a moment then violently rips the tape from noahs face
frightened gasping look what do you people want
a house in the country a dog a wife and two kids
your fucking head stapled to my saddlebags
were looking for sarah
where is she noah
im not going to tell you that
oh but i think you are
kali sites astride noah
she reaches for one of the tattoo machines
she motions to curve who hits the treadlight foot switch
noah eyes the sparking tattoo machine with rising apprehension as kali moves it towards his face
a vibrating blur just a few centimeters from noahs blinking eye
noah tries to shut his eyes
kali forces an eye open with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand
last chance love
get bent you dried up bitch
from behind we see kali lower the vibrating needle towards noahs eye
his shrill screams split the night as we
curve and kali are leaving the shop
suddenly curve clutches at his chest wincing in pain
he opens his coat looks down at his chest
is dripping blood from its beak and talons
curve staggers back horrified
kali is watching him
what is it
but curve isnt listening
he leaps onto his motorcycle and hits the ignition
he takes off with a roar
its no good
curve is long gone
note the following scene appears here in the script but in the film it appears in chapter
curve makes his way to the bar
he rips open a glassine bag of trinity and vacuum snorts it
his eyes roll up in his head as the chemicals flow
another wave of pain washes over him
curve claws at his chest falls against the bar
the music fades to a muted echo of distant war drums
as a feeling of inexorable doom settles over him curve lifts his head and sees
reflected in the bar mirror materializing out of the narcotic haze
hes wading through the ocean of bodies
in his face paint and black leather ashe looks like hes just another part of the twisted scene
people are stroking him brushing up against him like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma
ashe lifts his hand hes clutching house o peep zekes sawed off shotgun
curve dives to the floor as ashes shotgun blast shatters the bar mirror taking out his own reflection
curve rolls climbs to his feet starts running
the samoan bartender grabs a semi auto pistol opens up on ashe
now some of the other armed doormen are firing too
but ashe keeps on coming trudging through the hail of gunfire
bullets are exploding over his body at an insane rate
ashe is a human roman candle
nothing is going to stop him from reaching curve nothing
the samoan stops firing
he takes one look at ashe whos still coming at them
he turns tail and run
curve comes storming out the back door like a bat out of hell
he takes the rear stairs three at a time spilling into a couple of back alley junkies
he stumbles into a pile of garbage scatters some rats
curve makes for his bike which is parked nearby
he fumbles with the key hits the starter switch
ashe comes flying off from a second story fire escape landing atop a car roof on all fours popping the windows
times up curve
fuck you bird dick
curve jerks his bike towards the street and guns it
curve zooms by a bridal shop sees his own reflection in the window
curve shrieks turns into the alley tachometer red lining
he glances behind him
the crow flies by
plunges down from the night sky wings flapping madly quickly gaining on curve like the breath of death
ashe in a dream like state races along
curve leans in low trying to urge his bike on by will power alone
he races by a warehouse veering off the road onto the railroad tracks
ashe appears on the overpass riding on his own motorcycle matching curves speed
soars higher for a birds eye view tracking curves progress as it sweeps past chimneys swerves around billboards ducks under laundry lines
as he rockets along the overpass
the crow lands on his shoulder
ahead is a break in the guard rail
ashe cuts sharply to the right taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the rail and
lands on the surface street some thirty feet below
ashe is now just behind curve
sarah is back at work on the painting of the woman being cradled by her lover
gabriel whos lounging nearby suddenly looks up and hisses
the crow lands on the skylight staring down at sarah watching
theres a knock at her door
sarah approaches looks through the peephole
who is it
kali stands there cradling an automatic
shes flanked by two identical twin thugs
kali fires into the lock
the chase continues
curve approaches the bridge doing well past ninety
abruptly he cuts down a roadway which parallels the river
theres a chain link running across the mouth of the tunnel
up ahead is a hole in the fence leading down to a tunnel spillway
curve guides his bike through the hole
curve speeds into the dark tunnel splashing through puddles of water whipping past graffiti
as he nears the mouth at the other end curve brakes hard tires squealing almost going down
we are now beneath the bridge
its a stone cold dead end
the roadway slopes sharply downward spilling out into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters
we hear the roar of an approaching motorcycle then an engine cutting out
curve looks back the way he came
ashes siilhouette steps into view
hes on foot now clutching the sawed off shotgun
he lets loose a laugh which chills curve to the bone
i have a rendezvous with death on some scarred slope of battered hill
ashe starts into the tunnel
his wet footsteps echo off the weeping walls
god knows twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath
as ashe draws closer his death like face emerges from the gloom a ghastly visage floating in the ether
but i have a rendezvous with death
and i to my pledged word am true
ashe stops some twenty feet away grinning like the cheshire cat
i shall not fail that rendezvous
silence like knives
ashe and curve facing one another
curve is tense dry mouthed
you think im afraid of you you fucking freak
you think im curve screams and guns his cycle forward rolling the throttle all the way open a kamikaze run aimed straight at ashe
ashe stands his groupd lifts the shotgun first at curves customized teardrop gas tank
theres the woman doing the wild thing with death and
disintegrates beneath him breaking apart into a rushing comet of flaming wreckage
shrapnel skids along the tunnel walls spewing lies on the garbage strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of blood burnt battered a barb of steel sticking up from his
still curve has one glorious giddy moment where he thinks hes actually succeeded in defeeating ashe then
as ashe steps through the gasoline flames
curves elation vaporizes
can you hear me curve
curve offers a weak nod
youre going to die now
curve tries to speak blood spills from his mouth
ashe places a finger to his lips
ashe drops down kneeling over curves chest
people used to put coins in the mouths of the dead
do you know why
so they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river styx
reaching to curves ear whats this
in a parody of a stage magician ashe retrieves one of the peep o rama tokens from curves ear
the embossed eye logo flashes
open your mouth curve
curve s eyes are wide filled with terror
its not so bad
ive been there
curve slowly opens his mouth
tears run from his eyes
ashe places the coin on curves tongue like a priest administering a holy wafer
ashe stands grabs curve by the coat collar
he pulls him back towards the end of the tunnel
ashe drags curve down the sloping end of the spillway to the waters edge
i want to thank you for showing me my pain curve
you made me what i am
as he releases curve letting the current carry him away
ashe stands tracking curves progress
as he floats downstream limbs outstretched consciousness fading fast
ghostly faces stare down at him from the girders people who have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches overhead
a woman lets loose a cloud of marigold petals
they flutter down around curve swirling in the currents
the petals have clustered around curves body in the shape of a crow
curve continues to float downstream towards an estuary borne away on the wings of the bird
ashe starts back into the tunnel
he pauses a moment kneeling down lowering his head
whether out of respect for the dead or his own condition well never know
after a minute ashe lifts his head again and stands
its time to see his mission through to the end
ashe is heading back from the river when hes struck by
is seeing what the crow is witnessing sarah in danger
ashe starts to run back toward his bike
ashe is on the motorcycle racing through the streets
he takes a corner on a skid zipping past the gray gargoyle and the neighboring train tracks
ashe pulls up on the motorcycle screeching to a stop
he leaps from the bike rushing into sarahs building
ashe stumbles through the doorway into the loft
the loft has been trashed
furniture turned over paintings slashed the ceramic irony mask smashed into pieces
alarmed desperately looking for her sarah
sarahs gone ghost man
ashe whirls around who had been standing still amidst the shadows now moves from behind sarahs paintings
where is she
hes waiting for you there
as kali steps closer we see that shes dressed for war a katana secured in a black scabbard twin daggers on each hip a bandoleer of throwing stars
you took my sons life
some people are born victims
it takes two to make a murder
kali unsheathes her katana
the blade edge catches the streetlights glare coming in from the window
shall we dance
kali comes at ashe blindingly fast
she spins and cartwheels end over end somersaulting
as she lands kali shifts into ginsu mode her blade a whirling blur
ashe ducks under the blade trapping kalis sword arm
he twists his hands snapping her arm
as kali cries out ashe pivots throwing her towards the half moon window looking out over the street
sarahs eyelids flutter open with a start
shes waking on the heels of a dream
pull back to reveal sarah curled up on the cold tile floor a number of candles burning nearby
sarah sits up disoriented
upon moving her arm she finds that its been shackled to one of the pillars via a long chain
sarah wastes a few moments tugging at her tether trying to snap one of the links but its no good
frustrated sarah looks around trying to get her bearings
is standing a few yards away cloaked in darkness head bowed
sarah didnt notice her at first
where am i
everyone finds their way here eventually
sarah rises from the floor a little unsteady
she moves towards sibyl reaches out to touch her shoulder
the prophetess abruptly lifts her head causing her hood to fall back
sarah takes a step back gasping
have been sewn shut with black thread
what happened to you
fate happened to her
emerges from the gloom almost as if he were materializing from the shadows themselves
sibyls been cursed with the gift of prophecy
she sees things that are fated to happen
she cut her eyes out with a carving knife because she wanted to make the visions stop
judah brushes the back of his hand affectionately against sibyls cheek
but that only made the visions stronger didnt it dear
sibyl turns her head away from judah shunning his caress
ive learned to live with my affliction
dont we all
sarah backs away from judah wary
my reputation precedes me
ive seen what your drugs have done to this city
i saw a need i exploited it
its all economics sarah
supply and demand
why did you bring me here
im glad you asked that sarah
youve got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours
you see i intend to capture the crow
judah draws near devouring sarah with his hungry eyes
using and you my dear are the birdseed
kali comes crashing through the window falling down to the sidewalk below
she lands atop a wrecked car snapping her back in two
lies on the ground her limbs twisted at awkward angles
she moans somehow still alive
as ashe approaches
the crow flits in from off screen landing on his shoulder
watching kali with its curious golden eyes
as ashe draws near kali tries to rise
the most she can do is lift her head
ashe stares at her dispassionate
ashe simply shakes his head
my job is to send you to hell
youre in it
kali stares at ashe in disbelief her stoic warriors mien quickly evaporating
honor in this
ive won it
ashe turns and starts away
where are you going
you cant do this
but ashe doesnt turn back
he leaves kali in the cold wet street ignoring her pathetic laments
ashe continues on to the end of the alley
lands on ashes outstretched hand
the crow takes wing lifting its way up into the night
ashe fires up the motorcycles engine tearing away from sarahs apartment in a cloud of smoke
the scene resumes
sarah stares at judah horrified
why are you doing this
have you ever read dantes inferno
it says that the only true path through hell lies at its center
if you want to escape it you have to go further in
judah lowers himself into a chair
when i was a boy i fell through the ice of a lake
i remember seeing the sky through the ice above me close enough to touch
the world grew cold around me
eventually my heart stopped beating
and in that moment i died
judah sweeps his hand through one of the candle flames then pinches the flame out of existence
a tiny wisp of smoke trails up into shadow
judah settles back in his chair overcome by a memory that for him has never lost its vibrancy
a half hour later i awoke on an operating table
i had returned to the world of flesh and bone but i brought a knowledge back with me
tapping his forehead forbidden knowledge
judah leans in close to sarah his lambent eyes glowing like hot coals
as judah continues sarah fingers the ankh which hangs from her neck
ive been living on borrowed time ever since
ive always known death would be coming for me
i see now that your friend is the one ive been waiting for
you cant stop him
youre wrong sarah
there is a way to defeat death
and thats to trade places with him
sibyl turns her head towards the east
the crow is coming
judah looks back at sarah
ashe comes screaming over a hill on his motorcycle the image of judahs face burned into his mind
piloted by a man in a devil mask suddenly looms up in front of ashe
the street ahead has been cordoned off with flashing wooden barricades
theres some kind of street fiesta going on
ashe swerves braking hard to avoid hitting the carriage
ashes bike slips out from under him and ashe goes crashing into the barricades
but even as the carriages skull faced costumed occupants rush up to help him
ashe is up and running leaping over the barricades into the crowd beyond
the crow lands atop the buzzing jesus saves sign
it cocks its head as if considering its next move then flies toward the campanile
the crow enters through one of the openings in the grillework settling on one of the rafters
sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below still bound to the bed by the chain
judah and sibyl are nowhere in sight
flies down from the rafters landing on the floor at sarahs feet
it caws at her trying to communicate
the crow tilts its head as if trying to understand
shaking her chain whoosh
a steel cage on a wire and pulley system clatters down from above slamming to the floor and trapping the bird within it
the bird caws angrily flitting from one side of the cage to another but its efforts are futile
as judah emerges from the darkness crouching down on the floor to study the crow
look whos come home to roost
a massive street festival is under way with dia de los muertos celebrants mobbing the area
paper bienvenidos banners are strung overhead
children light strings of firecrackers
masked mummers in garish costumes dance musicians stroll
people are holding giant papier mache skulls on sticks along with torches and calavera placards
there are stalls offering marigolds and cockscomb black beeswax tapers dangling toy skeletons mountains of calaveras de azucar
pushes through the throng of revelers invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere
in his makeup hes just another face in the crowd
judah now carrying the cage which contains the crow sweeps aside the curtain of the camera obscura
he reaches up to a lever which opens the cameras lens
moonlight shines down on the camera table
with another lever judah adjusts the cameras view
the camera lens is now trained on the night sky
a churning landscape of night sky coulds drifts across the tables surface creating an eerie effect
sets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table
he peels back the cloth revealing a set of ornately decorated tapered daggers
he looks back at sarah
do you know what these are called
wonderful name isnt it
judah removes one of the blades from its sheath running the glinting edge along his finger
judah in the dark ages these were used to deliver the death stroke to the mortally wounded
they were considered tools of mercy
judah turns to the steel cage in which the crow has been trapped
he pulls on a leather falconers glove and opens the door to the cage
the crow flaps his wings madly desperately trying to strike at judah with its beak and claws
but judah secures his grip around the birds throat pulling it out
he pins the crow to the focusing table of the camera obscura with his gloved hand
ashe fights his way through the crowd
a drunken masked woman grabs hold of him spins him around dancing
ashe shoves her aside making his way to
the black sky beyond shimmers with turbulent yellow thunderheads
the entry way to the tower has been gated and chained
the only way in is up
ashe grabs a hold of one of the ornamental statues which crowd th ebuildints facade
he pulls himself up starting the daunting task of scaling the tower
back to judah and the crow
the clouds being projected onto the camera table and subsequently the crow itself are rushing at an unearthly speed
the create a surreal backdrop for the crows frenetically beating wings in effect a mockery of the bird flying
easy little wing
it will all be over soon
ashe continues to climb
a cluster of pigeons take wing startled from their roost
ashe pulls back one of his hands slipping free
he dangles there for a moment hanging by the tenuous grasp of his fingertips
who has been lurking in the shadows suddenly lifts her head up
full of portent ashe is here
this moment has been a long time coming
not for long
judah raises the misericord up high
sarah turns her head away as
judah plunges the weapon down pounding it straight through the birds right wing
ten stories up now
ashe suddenly loses his handhold
he screams in agony as he suffers the pain of the crow through their symbiotic link
ashe stares down at his hand in disbelief
blood seeps from a stigma like wound on his palm
judah plunges a second misericord into the crows left wing
ashe cries out again as his left hand is seemingly twisted back against his will
a second stigma wound appears
he slips tumbling to the next ledge down but catching himself on his fingertips
he hazards a look down
day of the dead celebrants crowd the streets far below
in agony oh god
it takes every ounce of ashes strength to keep from letting go
he tightens his white knuckled grip on the ledge above
shaking terribly trying to fight back the pain ashe continues to climb
he reaches up to a
which protrudes from the buildings facade
the maidens face has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements
ashe clutches the back of the maiden in a parody of a lovers embrace
using the statue for support he drags himself back up to relative safety
now ashe is face to face with the maiden staring into its blind stone eyes
ashe whispers the word like a mantra using it to urge him on
steeling himself again fighting the burning pain ashe resumes his climb
hes on autopilot now just trying to reach the campanile which at this point seems hopelessly unattainable
seems to churn and roil
a storm of epic proportions is about to break
the crow has now been crucified to the camera table a misericord staked through each wing
as judah reaches for a third misericord
he raises it high above his head preparing for the coup de grace
ashes ashes we all fall down
as the dagger comes down we hear
ashe cries out a final time as a gaping wound appears on his chest blood blossoming outward
the day of the dead celebrants swirl around us judahs tower rising up behind the mob an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods
the crowd has been worked up into a frenzy
everyone is singing and dancing
music blasts from loudspeakers
comes crashing down atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls
time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form
the crow is dead transfixed by the gleaming misericords
blood is pooling beneath black flight feathers
judah steps back momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of his crime
judah looks to the camera obscuras table
the blood from the crow has completely covered the tables concave surface filling it to the brim like liquid in a shallow bowl
the end result is an eerie reflecting pool
cast by the camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve only to be replaced by judahs own shimmering reflection
with a shaking hand judah dips his fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face
a swatch of blood over one eye then a swatch over the other
a long bloody smear over his lips
the action harkens back to the moment when sarah painted ashes face a parallel ritual turned on its head
judah turns towards us his transformation now complete
we see that he has painted himself a parody of ashes irony mask in the crows own blood
watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity
scoops up a handful of the crows blood and brings it to his lips
as he drinks letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck
his once pallid features now glow with a kind of beatific radiance
from judah up and up into the darkest reaches of his tower
judah is laughing laughing in the face of death itself
ashe lies amidst a field of shimmering glass shards and flowers
slowly gather around ashe craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel
relaxed peaceful even
for a moment we arent sure whether or not ashes soul has fled
the peripheral noise from the street festival dies away
were in the eye of the hurricane now
once again time seems to shudder to a stop
and the only thing we hear are
thousands of them filling the heavens with their keening wails
ashe slowly opens his eyes tentative
when youre this deep in the bosom of bliss the last thing you want to do is waken but waken he does
is black with crows
and endless army of carrion creatures swirling madly about
ashe sits up stares at the crows fascinated frightened
then his eyes fall to the faces of the people around him
we are in dream time now blurring the edges of reality
wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of the crowd
he stares at ashe a moment then lifts the mask from his face
ashe rushes to dannys side holding him tight his disbelief overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again
what are you doing here
its time to go back dad
ashe looks up at the screaming crows above them
is that why theyre here
theyre the souls who came before you
theyre crying for the people theyve lost
now theyre crying for you
but sarah still needs me
you dont understand dad
you work for the dead not the living
your work here is done
ashe reaches for his sons shoulders all but pleading with him
i cant go not yet not now
you have to
danny i cant leave her like this
the cries of the crows grow louder as the sky above becomes darker
a shadow passes over dannys face
he seems saddened
for a moment it seems as if another entity creeps into dannys voice
if you turn your back on the dead now youll be trapped between the worlds
youll never be allowed to cross over
youll be alone dad
ashe hesitates a moment realizing the enormity of what he is about to do
its an agonizing choice
i have to stay
danny reaches out to touch ashes painted face
good bye dad
as danny says his parting words the sounds of the world around them come rushing back with startling clarity
danny starts to turn away
ashe bolts up from the bed of flowers and glass
the spell is broken
was he dreaming
no theres danny slipping back into the crows the mask pulled down over his face once again
ashe reaches for danny spinning him around pulling off the mask
only its not danny
its a drunken dwarf with fucked up teeth whos laughing his ass of at ashe
ashe recoils horrified then spins around suddenly finding himself face to face with
standing just a few yards away emerging from the doorway of his tower
he got the anti crow blood mask on his face
his eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a feral snarl
in his hands he holds one of the chains from his campanile
judah grabs ashe by the lapels of his coat draging him close so theyre eye to eye close enough to breathe the same beath two sides of a coin
tell me ashe
do you every get the feeling were all just dead men on leave
seething with hatred judah
in the flesh
judah flings ashe backwards
ashe reaches his hand into his coat pulling out a
he fires into judahs chest once twice thrice
judah doesnt even stagger he just keeps on grinning
wisps of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest
ashe stares at judah dumbfounded
im your shadow ashe
every angels got a devil
didnt you know that
or maybe you just slept your way through sunday school
judah lashes out with the rope
ashe spins and falters
incredibly he finds himself feeling pain
judah follows with a series of blows each more savage than the next driving ashe back
ashe stumbles falls to his hands and knees
he reaches to his mouth his hand comes away spattered with blood
ashe shakes his head to clear it
judah kicks ashe in the face knocking him onto his back
but ashe springs back to his feet
he tries to strike judah
judah catches ashes hand and squeezes tight
we hear bones snapping
judah smashes out with his other fist ashe spins around and collapses
ashe tries to push himself up by his hands
he coughs spitting up more blood crawls forward
did you do to me
ive tasted the blood of the crow and taken your power
judah whips the rope about snapping the end around ashes neck dragging him off his feet
judah pulls ashe forward crouching over him like a spider ready to devour its prey
youre flesh and blood now ashe
you can die like any other man
go to hell
already been there
and i must confess i liked what i saw
sarah sobs quietly still chained to the pillar
a figure suddenly appears at her side sibyl
sarah looks up
sibyl produces a key from within her robes
she places the key in the lock on sarahs manacles
with a turn of the key the manacles fall away and sarah is free
sarah looks back at the blind oracle uncertain
why are you doing this
sibyl fixes sarah with her blind stare
ashe needs you now
more than ever
sibyl raises her other hand
shes holding one of the misericords which she extends to sarah
go to him
sarah takes the misericord and racees for the end of the campanile towards a beckoning doorway and a stairwell beyond
printed on a grime smeared placard nearby are the words
sarah rushes through the doorway heedless
judah plants his foot on ashes chest tightening the chain around ashes throat
looks like the dead have forsaken you my friend
ashe clutches at the rusty chain links which bite into his flesh choking
look at you bleeding like a stuck pig
wheres your precious strength
wheres your power
drawing closer whispering youre nothing now ashe not even a ghost
he grabs a hold of the chain pulling
down the street
ashe screams as his body is dragged across the asphalt
sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator pulling the accordion style security gate shut
she punches the down arrow on the tarnished control panel
with a lurch and hum the elevator car starts its journey downward
judah has dragged ashe over to the east side of the street in front of an old movie palace
he leaps atop one of the vending stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself
shouts to the crowds below his eyes on fire
you want death
here he is people
take a good look
even as ashe fights to free himself of the chain judah loops one end of it over a street lamp
he jumps from the marquee using his body weight to pull ashe from the ground
is dragged up into the air dangling above the faces of the crowd
sarah rushes out the front entrance of the tower into the day of the dead crowd which swarms below
she pushes through the mob trying to fight her way across the street
ashe swings like a puppet from judahs improvised hangmans noose
his coat and short have been all but torn to shreds
judah drags down on the chain harder lifting ashe even higher tightening the noose
he secures the chain on a hydrant then strolls forward inspecting his work
judah circles ashe grinning like the cat who swallowed the canary
now dont we look pretty
ashe struggles choking causing
of dannys that ashe had kept in his coat pocket to fall free
it flutters to the ground landing at judahs feet
judah kneels picking it up
as he unfolds the painting we see that it has been stained with ashes own blood
he tilts it this way and that as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of the piece
if you prick him does he not bleed
judah looks up at ashe his eyes full of crazed humor then he very deliberately tears the painting to shreds letting the pieces fall away into the night wind
judah reaches for metal rod lashing out at ashes bare bloodied back
judah is hell bent on beating ashe into oblivion
with every stroke of the switch the crowd cheers
his eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede
the swirling faces of the masked celebrants with judah front and center
mob mentality everyone drunk and laughing jeering at ashe the dangling fool
its a scene out of hell
and behind judah a familiar figure pushing her way to the front of the crowd
lunges forward clutching the misericord shoving a reveller aside
get away from him
sarah drives the misericord into judahs eye
judah momentarily blinded falls back
sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant
falls to the street as the chain clatters over the street lamp
he unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back up
sarah get back
judah has torn the misericord from his eye
he rushes up to sarah and
drives it deep into her chest
sarah gasps drops to her knees clutching at the daggers handle
she pulls the misericord out
blood begins to well up from the wound
she stares at her blood covered hands in disbelief then falls back
silence now as the crowd begins to back away
the mood has shifted
ashe drops by sarahs side
she stares up at the sky eyes wide with wonder
i can see them coming
once again the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the sky
ashe looks up at judah fueled by a righteous rage thats been burning since the moment of his resurrection
all reason is gone
the only think that remains for ashe is an unbridled animal fury
ashe launches himself at judah sending the villain tumbling back into a nest of scaffolding
one of the pipes punches clear through judahs chest impaling him
judah hangs there transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck through it
he struggles to pull himself from the piping but even so hes laughing hysterically
you cant stop me anymore ashe
you dont have the power
ashes eyes boil with hatred
if it were just me youd be right judah
but i have an eternity of pain to call upon
ashe lifts his hands up exposing his bleeding palms
and the pain gives me strength
as we watch the stigmata close themselves up blood drawing itself back into the wounds
ashe raises his arms to the sky gesturing to the crows which spin high above his head
the murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal wave
they descend on judah as one entity screaming down from the heavens like a storm of razor blades
we get one final glimpse of horrified judahs face eyes wide with terror before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him
lets loose a death shriek that all but splits the sky as the myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb
ashe returns to sarahs side lifting her up off the ground and cradling her in his arms
you cant die sarah
i stayed for you
theres a balance that needs to be kept
someone had to cross over
sarah takes a ragged breath wincing as a wave of pain washes over her
i didnt want it to be you
sarah looks up at ashe tries her level best to smile
shes at deaths door now one foot already over the threshold
her face is pale having lost so much blood
tears spill down ashes cheeks causing the war paint makeup to run in rivulets
in anguish i cant go with you sarah
i have to stay here now
cursing his fate i have to stay
do you love me
sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck on the chain
she tugs at the chain snapping it apart
she holds the ring out to ashe
ashe takes the ring from sarah
she closes ashes hand around the ring gripping his fist tightly
ill wait for you
forever if i have to
she shuts her eyes riding through another wave of pain
if two people really love each other
she inhales sharply
breathing has become a labor for her now
nothing can keep them apart
her voice fading nothing
ashe nods trying to let this thought reassure him
its the only thing he has left to cling to
ashes face surrounded by a nimbus of light
were falling away from him
down down down
and as we fall we hear a fluttering her eyes lose focus
her head goes slack in ashes arms
ashe lowers his lips to her kissing her one final time
ashe cradles sarahs lifeless body in his arms gently rocking back and forth tears streaming down his cheeks
and as we pull back from them we realize that the scene mirrors the prophetic image from sarahs own painting the woman dying in the arms of her lover surrounded
by a gallery of skull masked celebrants
ashe stands lifting sarah in his arms
he turns to leave
slowly part for him revealing a path of marigold petals leading away down the street
its almost as if by silent consensus the crowd has come to understand what has happened here this night
moves through the crowd carrying sarah in his arms
the people close ranks behind him and we
sibyl stands over the camera obscura
on the tables focusing surface we see the street below
is carrying sarah in his arms moving through the crowd of silent witnesses
nods to herself satisfied
we see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips
sibyl turns and exits the camera obscura
sibyl approaches the table where the stag beetle is tethered
removing a pair of scissors from within her robes sibyl cuts the thread which binds the beetle
free at last quickly scurries out of the box and across the table disappearing into the shadows
sibyl follows suit gathering her robes about her and stepping on into the darkness
the same church we visited the night before
ashe still carrying sarah in his arms enters the sanctuary
the church is aglow with candles
ashe lays sarahs body down in front of the offrenda folding her arms across her chest leaving her in a state of repose
he stands taking in one last look
as ashe moves to leave he sees the elderly priest he had spoken to earlier
why are you still here
because i have nowhere left to go
ashe steps past the priest moving towards the doorway and the daylight beyond
what will you do then
looking back this city is filled with shadows
one more wont make it any darker
ashe exits the church finding haven in a shadowed doorway
he reaches into his pocket removing the wedding ring sarah had given to him
as ashe turns it over in his hands seeing the word forever inscribed on the inside of the band
he slips it on his finger
are you all right
ashe looks up to see
the drugged out girl that sarah helped at the beginning of the film
shes looking good now clean of the poison that once possessed her
and damned if she isnt holding gabriel in her arms
long night huh
gabriel meows to ashe
ashe reaches out and scratches the cats ear
isnt he cool
i found him on the street
i was going to take him home with me
looks like he needs a home
well see ya
she smiles at him and starts off down the street
gabriel turns around in graces arms and peers back at ashe from over her shoulder
ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light watching them
we see just a hint of hope in his eyes hope that someday he and sarah will be reunited
as we hold on ashes face sarahs voice over begins
i believe theres a place where the restless souls wanter
the same scene as the beginning of our film
weve made a circle
a heavy mist hangs before us endless and impenetrable
and out of that primordial fog a crow materializes flying towards the camera in slow motion
burdened by the weight of their own sadness they cannot enter heaven
presently a second shape materializes a figure on horseback galloping after the crow
and so they wait trapped between our world and the next endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain in the hopes that somehow some day they
will be reunited
as the dark rider comes towards us we realize that its sarah whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war paint
with the ones they love
ashe is back on his bike racing beneath the cathedral like arches of the overpass
as he sweeps past a concrete pillar we
sarah on her horse galloping in parallel action
as she sweeps last a tree we
ashe on the bike
now we intercut between the two doomed lovers each on their respective steeds
worlds apart and yet somehow traveling the same road
we are intercutting faster and faster until the sound of hoofbeats and the motorcycles roar are indistinguishable
until the two figures themselves begin to blur
faster and faster and faster until we
over the darkness we hear sarahs final words to ashe if two people really love each other nothing can keep them apart
