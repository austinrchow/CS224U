written by david cronenberg fourth draft october the man facing us is bearded sweating intense joyous
jacket and tie jeans fortyish
his name is wittold levi
levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word
written like this
capital x capital z
he turns back to face an as yet unseen audience
its new its from antenna research and its here right now
we now see levis audience about seventy five people some standing some sitting on plastic folding chairs
they are of very mixed age and type but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically
we are in the central playing area of a small deconsecrated country church and levi performs on a broad low carpeted plywood dais
at the far end of the dais a man and a woman assistants to levi are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high tech
my name is wittold levi my friends call me witt and im the project manager for existenz
i recognize some familiar faces thats all right thats all right
we wont throw you out
we encourage consumer loyalty and we want you to help us with our product testing
were a team antenna and you
a delighted stir from the crowd
those of you who have come to our invited seminars before will know that i normally lead the group through our new games but tonight it wont be me
no for the test launch of existenz by antenna we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special
an unbelieving excited stir
could it really be
yes it is
the worlds greatest game designer is here in person to lead you the first test enclave through her newest creation existenz by antenna
the small crowd is now tremendously excited wide eyed murmuring one or two have actually gotten on their knees
i give you the game pod goddess herself allegra geller
levi moves to the edge of the crowd works his way into it until he has reached a small unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed
she stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort
his name tag identifies him as ted pikul rhymes with michael not with pickle and we will see more of him later
as levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd her fans applaud softly touch her hem
they part like water as she passes amongst them clutching her own personal game pod case with both hands
she mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing eye dog
allegra geller early thirties conservatively dressed is bright acutely aware but wary and controlled
when she speaks she is deliciously sexily shy serious melodic
the world of games is in a kind of a trance
people are programmed to accept so little but the possibilities are so great
you probably thought that tonight we were going to test a new game that i designed
excited murmurings from the crowd
but there is no new game to test at least not in the usual sense
confused slightly disappointed mutterings
no no its going to be much better than you expected because existenz is not just a game
its an entirely new game system
antenna research and i developed it together the existenz system by antenna and it involves a whole lot of new toys which you are going to be the first to
the crowds spirit rises again
levi steps forward smiling playing off the renewed energy
levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word
written like this
capital m capital f
metaflesh is what our new toys are made of the metaflesh game pod only from antenna research
it connects with any industry standard bioport which i know you all have or you wouldnt be here
chuckles from the crowd using however a very non standard connecting device which we call
levi turns again to the chalkboard
we call an umbycord
spelled like this
levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by now salivating audience
i guess you can tell i started off as a schoolteacher
but i never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what allegra and i are going to teach you all tonight
with a theatrical flourish levi whirls around to face his two assistants who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
at either end of it
are the metaflesh game pods by antenna research ready
yes mr levi
and how many of these precious prototypes did we manage to bring with us
twenty one mr
levis face clouds slightly
the audience does not hear the following exchange
i thought we had an even two dozen
the first three we opened were
any chance that some of the others
we think were clean
god damn better be
levi turns back to his audience radiant once more
we have twenty one prototype metaflesh game pods and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty one volunteers who will port in these slave units
with the game pod goddess herself
levi doesnt need to finish his pitch
every hand is waving in the air and every pair of lips is saying me me oh god please let it be me
geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity of the small crowds enthusiasm
a short montage as the twenty one volunteers mount the dais and are fitted with their game gear the assistants undo the heavy duty snap locks and split open the
ski boot like plastic modules on the back table
inside resting in a lining of dense foam are what look almost like living kidneys the metaflesh game pods
coiled in each boot toe is the y shaped multi player umbycord that comes with each pod a split twelve foot connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord twisted translucent
blue and red veiny vessels running just below the surface
the volunteers watch in hushed reverence as though about to receive communion
the game pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases
the umbycords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game pods
the shirts blouses and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners bioports which are small soft plastic flesh coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just
above the belt line
twenty two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais
as each volunteer has his umbycord plugged into his bioport he takes one of the seats and places his quivering rippling game pod now connected directly to his nervous system
on his lap
the last chair is taken by allegra geller who is fussed i over and settled by levi as she unpacks her own master game pod with exaggerated delicacy and is
then ported in to the players on either side of her
we end the short montage with the security guard pikul standing with arms folded near the churchs side door watching the proceedings with fascination
a loud knocking at the door forces pikul to turn away from the action on the dais
he walks over to the door and opens it
a hyper exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church
pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his way
not so fast
in response the fan thrusts a card at him
pikul takes the card a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name joel dichter
dichter anxiously looks past pikul into the depths of the church nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his shoulder
i hope im not too late
did i miss the port in
its just the first wave
you can be part of the second wave
rereads the invitation ok joel dichter
put your arms up
i have to scan you
metal and heavy synthetics cant come in
a weapons check
more for recording devices
lotta money invested in these games
industrial espionage happens
whats in this case
i brought my game pod
its got original marway tissue architecture
its kind of obsolete but i was hoping
even though i couldnt afford the antenna fifteen upgrade i figured out a method of virtual porting that i thought might
pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case then opens the zipper and feels around
in the case is a more solid rubbery version of the new metaflesh pods
you wont need it tonight
everythings provided for
dichter suddenly spots geller on the dais
he almost faints
is that who i think it is
with paternal pride yeah thats her
shes something isnt she
but why would a star like her come to a product seminar in a little one horse town like this
this is where the real people live joel
her real fans like you
yeah well you said it
just like me
dichter has scanned ok
pikul waves him into the church to join the spectators who will form the second wave and re locks the door
on the dais in the center of the circle of linked game players levi nods at geller
everythings in order
are you ready allegra
this is my favourite part
there is giddy laughter in the room
geller looks at every player in the circle as levi steps down off the platform and retires to the far edge of the small watching throng
im ready to download existenz by antenna research into you all now
im warning you its going to be a wild ride but dont panic no matter what happens
ill see you all back here in no time at all
now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous uncertain but its too late
geller depresses a nipple like protuberance on the game pod on her lap and all the players close their eyes and go rigid like members of a seance who have
suddenly been contacted by the spirit world
the pods in their laps begin a rhythmic peristaltic rippling
at the edge of the crowd pikul sidles up to levi
she seems to be very shy
it never occurred to me that a big star would be shy
she spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games
i think shed like it best if she never had to show them to anybody
she doesnt enjoy all the adulation
she hates having to port in with her fans
its too intimate
then why does she do it
we make her do it
by we you mean the game company antenna research
thats what i mean
are you with us or did an independent security company send you
oh im with your own management training program
shows him a card i want to end up in marketing and public relations
holds up security wand the only thing i know about security is how to switch this thing on
well for example weve spent a fortune developing existenz but we all know its a risky project
she might have to make changes
its the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem
a problem with her new game
existenz is a lot more than a game
yeah right its a game system
i heard that
and were worried that its too intellectual too complex too weird too artsy
that argument never bothers her until she faces her fans
she hates to be rejected in the flesh so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat
ive heard that shes very sensitive
a strange choral humming begins to fill the church
pikul and levi turn their attention to the dais where the fans rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps
what are they doing
its the new antenna research theme song
we thought this would be a good way to launch it
everybody who plays existenz is going to be very familiar with that tune
haltingly but gamely pikul tries to hum along
levi helps him out and soon the whole room is humming along happily warmed by the antenna research corporate theme song
the whole room that is except for joel dichter who at the edge of the dais is more concerned with fumbling around in the vinyl pod case hanging from his
in the case we watch as dichter tears open his obsolete game pod to reveal a bizarre weapon a pistol made of bone and gristle almost like the half decayed
body of a small mammal whose snout is the barrel whose rigid hind leg is the trigger
dichter takes his weapon out of its case shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game pod flesh and steps up onto the dais
pikul is the first to notice this
he glances at levi whos still blissed out and humming then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd
now in the middle of the circle dichter makes his way towards the blissfully unsuspecting geller raising his weapon as he goes
death to existenz
death to antenna research
death to the demoness allegra geller
dont do it
dichter turns to see pikul stumbling through the small crowd scrambling onto the dais
distracted dichter hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at geller
the first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off her chair which collapses over her and takes the second bullet on its seat rim
the circle of players on the dais moans as one swoons and jostles they are all feeling the neural surge of gellers traumatized nervous system
peeking out from under her folding chair gellers eyes are wide with fear and confusion
she clutches her shoulder without being aware of it
blood seeps in between her fingers now levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform to get at dichter who fires wildly hitting two of the players nearest geller
the circle of players immediately goes spastic screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing
many of them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as geller sympathy pain transmitting through their umbycords
pikul manages to tackle dichter then starts whacking at him with the security wand
dichter twists around and raises his weapon at pikul who immediately backs off in terror
but before dichter can pull the trigger the two assistants produce small normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips into the prostrate dichter
dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot at the approaching jevi hitting him squarely in the chest
levi goes down and is lost amongst the jostling feet
the watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game pods which are obviously causing them distress
three of the players attack the dying dichter dragging their game pods after them kicking at whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies
in the turmoil pikul is knocked to the ground
amid the stamping sliding feet he finds himself lying across the stricken levi
levi clutches pikul desperately
get her out of here
there might be more of them
me take her
urgent pleading we have enemies in our own house
trust no one
trust no one
the wide eyed pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips over the all but dead dichter
he falls painfully to his knees struggles up again and finds the bizarre bone gun in his hand
pikul stares at it fascinated horrified
he turns back to levi but levis eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness
the two assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving shuffling throng guns cocked faces set hard
panicked pikul jams the bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform wildly looking around for geller
she and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a few feet away and she is in several kinds of agony
pikul unports her which immediately brings her some relief and a lot of clarity
pikul wards off a couple of fans with one arm screams at them
shes coming with me
im responsible for her
shes supposed to come with me
to his surprise geller laughs a dazed hearty laugh
quietly firmly yeah youre coming with me
pikul pulls her to her feet but she immediately dives back to the floor to find her game pod and umbycord
suddenly near hysteria i cant lose this
i cant lose this
she finds the game pod still under the folding chair a bit flattened on one side but in one piece
she grabs the game pod and its umbycord and stuffs them into her metaflesh pod case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais
as she clutches it to her pikul takes her hand and hauls her through the crowd which is now spilling off the overcrowded dais and clutching at geller fitfully like
they head for the door fighting everybody off as though they might be lethal
as they leave through the side door pikul sees five or six fans shrieking like monkeys still stomping and kicking the body of dichter viciously hysterically while levis two assistants
carry him to the safety of the churchs apse
pikul and geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church
the church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a crossroad
pikul and geller look around wildly
the vehicles in the parking lot are country pickup trucks rusted vans x s
across the road aloof maybe too high class for the parking lot sits a land rover defender the one with the roof cage and the seven seats and the winch
hanging off the front
geller gestures towards the defender
lets take my limo
i dont trust the driver
you drive idiot
they cross the road and jump in the defender
frances the driver sixtyish a retired lady farmer who moonlights is apprehensive
whats the commotion miss geller
say are you all right
whats goin on in there
we need this vehicle and we need it without you
but with the keys
i cant do that
i cant abandon my vehicle
geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished pikuls pocket
she points it at frances
get out frances
you can say you were hijacked
itll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat
geller fires two shots
one rips a hole in francess headrest
getting out of her seat you have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse
they drive off down the country road leaving frances in the dust
he can see why the limo is an off road vehicle the road is terrible dirt and gravel stutter potholes and sharp ridges the occasional fallen tree
manic scared i normally like the countryside dont you
normally the country is relaxing and calm
only if you dont really know whats going on
what do you mean
there is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside
thousands of life forms all screaming me me me and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms
its terrifying and exhausting
well i like the countryside
thats good cause you might end up spending a lot of time here
if you go back home to the city theyll probably be waiting for you
theyd want to have a little talk with you about where i am
i was hoping that was just one crazy guy
did you hear the way he screamed at me
he wasnt alone
everybody likes a conspiracy
its more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing
geller goes silent
well what are we going to do out here
do you know your way around
you know any country people
not country people
the countrysides full of games development people project co ordinators little factories you name it
i never knew that
the citys full of bad microwaves bad thermals bad electro optics
you cant shield from it anymore
you cant get true readings
the whole industry moved out of the city years ago
so you know your way around
we can hide out
but it seems i have some enemies i didnt know i had
death to allegra geller
howd you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming death to ted pikul
reflective pause then hey howd you know my name
indicating his name tag youre labelled
how did you know how to fire that gun
ive never seen anything like it
it has a trigger
i pulled it
can i see it
i think im gonna use it in my next game
if there ever is a next game
pikul glances at her
he hits a pothole and she bounces around in her seat exposing her far shoulder to him
her shirt is soaked with blood
migod youre bleeding
i forgot you got hit
there is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in pikuls breast pocket
its my pink fone
im not sure i should answer it
pikul pulls the pink fone its soft surgical plastic palm sized out of his pocket
when he squeezes it open a diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it
some fan went crazy and started shooting up the place
i dont know why
he was just nuts
shes with me
youre kidding me
youre kidding me
cant believe it
i cant do that
no how can i do that
well im not really sure where we are because
geller grabs the pink tone from him
she fumbles around with it trying to find the power button
she accidentally summons up a read out which she pauses to look at
what she sees makes her glance up at pikul
can i have my pink tone back
geller finds the power button and pushes it
the pink inner light flutters out
she unceremoniously throws the pink tone out the window
it lands in a rain ditch full of frogs
what did you do that for
that was our lifeline to civilization
that was a rangefinder
as long as you have that they know where you are
you mean head office
i mean anybody
i heard what levi said to you
he said we have enemies in our own house
he said it as he was dying
i dont think he died
i mean do you
i think he maybe fainted
maybe he went unconscious
that was alex kindred head of publicity and marketing at antenna hq
on that very expensive pink fone you threw away
he said that some bizarre fanatical group called the anti existenzialists has put a price of million dollars on your head payable to anybody who kills you
its been released to all the media now
everybody knows about it
capital x capital z
they somehow found out about existenz and they want to kill you for creating it
they say that the existenz game system will finally destroy reality or something totally nuts like that
it makes sense to you
youre not suprised
i hear things
its hard to surprise me
and what else
kindred said that im your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety
pikul why dont you have a gun with you
youre not armed
they told me you were my security but you have no weaponry
who told you that
im just a marketing trainee
my clinic master thought id learn something about marketing if i moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews
im marked for death and they send me on the road with a pr nerd
realization setting in jesus
marked for death
dont sweat it pikul
ill handle it
we just have to disappear for a while
and right now we have to stop
so we can have an intimate moment together
the intimate moment involves pikul digging the bullet out of i gellers shoulder with a swiss army knife while kneeling in front of the idling defenders headlights
pikulis being squeamish and not getting the job done
if youre gonna do it do it
he grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto
something yellow and white like a kernel of corn flips out of her wound and onto the roads shredding asphalt
pikul feels around for it finds it holds it up to the light
i got it
did somebody bite you
what do you mean
what i just dug out of you
its a tooth
a human tooth
pikul holds the tooth out to her but she just glances at it then rummages around in her metaflesh game pod bag
lemme see that weirdo pistol
geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag
after a moment of study she expertly pops the magazine out of the grip
the gristly magazine is packed with teeth
the bullets are human teeth
look this ones got a cavity
that thing was designed to get past any kind of metal or synthetics detector
its all flesh and bone
i suppose the smaller caliber pistols would have to fire baby teeth
the tooth fairy could go i into the arms business
that guy really came there tonight just to kill you
amazing isnt it
we follow the defender as it parks outside the salmon falls motel
pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of perky pats takeout
he knees the truck door shut and walks over to motel door
inside the very basic motel room pikul sits hypnotized reverentially watching geller as he obsessively packs the greasy remains of their perky pat burgers into the smallest possible paper bundle
geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed her pod before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap umbycord jacked into her bioport a
second towel slipping off her shoulders leaving her almost naked her shoulder wound livid in the watt light of the night table lamp
her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like insect antennae so delicately that we are not sure that she is actually touching the pod
her eyes are half closed and she is obviously in some kind of trance like ecstatic state
finally she comes out of it and unplugs her umbycord discretely rearranging her towels in the process
she sighs and speaks not exactly to pikul
the whole gamesworld is in a kind of trance
i remember you said that at the church
people are prepared to accept so little
theyre in acage formed out of their own limited expectations
they have no idea what amazing things could be theirs
where were you just now
what were you doing
a worried frown i was wandering through existenz the new system i mean
a shy sexy smile i like it in there
of course without another player youre only a tourist
why wont you let me contact antenna
theyve got to be going crazy wondering whats happened to you
i mean its not like weve done something wrong
we just ran because we didnt know how many of them there were right
i think we owe it to antenna to let them know youre all right to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what hes doing
and besides i cant
i cant just keep doing this whatever it is you know forever not having any idea when its going to be
geller gets up and goes over to pikul
she pulls up his shirt
hey what are you doing
wheres your bioport
dont tell me you were never fitted
i cant believe it
pikul shrugs his shirt back down starts tucking it in
no i was never fitted with a bioport
what do you care
youre hoping to get into the biz and youve never played one of my games
youve never played any game
that means you have no idea what a genius i am
my clinic master told me i dont need to play a game to know how to sell it
you dont play my games you dont work for antenna research ill make sure of that
look ive been dying to play your games
but i have this phobia about having my body penetrated surgically
you know what i mean
im not so sure i do
getting a bioport fitted
i cant do it
its too freaky
makes my skin crawl
they just pop your spine with a little hydro gun
shoot the port plug into it
they do it at malls like getting your ears pierced
with only an infinitesimal chance of permanent spinal paralysis
ive read all about it
its your chosen profession geek
she pauses then moves very close to him
she breathes her words slowly intimately into his ear
theres an intimacy involved in playing existenz that is beyond description
it has to be experienced
and frankly the two player version is the most exquisitely intense
wouldnt you like to play with me
his resolve is crumbling well yeah of course but
let me uh let me call antenna
a gentle threat they wouldnt want to talk to you if they knew you had never had a bioport installed
its company policy you know
they want you to be passionate about your work
besides once youre ported theres no end to the games you can play
you cant seriously want to play games now
not while were being hunted down by crazy people
geller sighs then switches into her explaining the facts of life to a child mode
cradling her pod my baby here took a huge hit in the church pikul
you see how shes quivering
pikul takes a look
the pod is in fact quivering like a terrified hamster
she yes shes quivering
when those umbycords got ripped out of her in the church ripped out just as the game architecture was being downloaded from her to all those slave pods
thats a very vulnerable time for her
she could be crying out for help right here right now
the only way i can tell if everythings ok the games not been contaminated the pod my baby is not about to be crippled for life because of my negligence
the only way is to play existenz with somebody friendly
are you friendly or are you not
sure all right
he might have found a way lets do it
lets do it now
let me see
checks his watch to get an illegal unregistered bioport installed at about midnight we just drive up to your local country gas station right
the defender is parked by the pumps
a gangly pump attendant his name embroidered on his overalls seems to be gas fills the truck as pikul and geller hover nervously
anything else i can do for you
well gas you could check your bioport plugs
you heard me
my friend here has a bioport problem
a bioport now thats a sort of a hole in your spine isnt it
lotta assholes round here but thats generally it
i dont know why youd be talking to me about that lady
geller smiles a knowing smile
sure you do
gas looks at her closely for the first time
his eyes widen in disbelief
he pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls and flips out the card holders
amongst various family photos hot rod photos fishing photos is a photo of allegra geller clipped from a glossy magazine
under the photo is the legend genius in a game pod
gas takes her hand in his and kisses it
you changed my life
pikul sits on a mouldy greasy plump wingback chair in the corner of the gas station garage watching gas balance shakily on one leg as he puts on a fresh
set of overalls
what was your life like before
before it was changed by allegra geller
i operated a gas station
but you still operate a gas station dont you
only on the most pathetic level of reality
gellers work liberated me
did you ever play her game artgod
one word capital a capital g
i dont have a bioport remember
thou the player of the game art god
god the artist
chuckles to himself funny
gas zips up his fresh overalls
those are sterile are they
not to worry
they way they set things up you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection
then why the clean overalls
its a mental thing
helps me focus
the one thing you dont want to do is miss with the stud finder
god the mechanic
gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanics rolling toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a carbon fibre voltage meter
we call this thing a stud finder
it locates the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y
we dont want to be even a micron out of whack
thats when you get troubles
its a little radar sonar laser thingee
marks you with a special range finding dye
never say dye
lift up your shirt and turn around
in the heat of the summer night game pod case still slung over her shoulder geller wanders around the periphery of the gas station touching things trees the ground grass
at random her expression suggesting that everything she sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing like someone who has wandered into a sculpture garden where everything is perfect in every detail except that everything is made out of bronze
gas pulls the trigger on the stud finder then removes it from pikuls back
we see a small purple flower mark like the kind that marks sides of beef on the skin over pikuls spine just above the belt line
pikul stands up from his kneeling position on the wingback chair
he stretches twists
everything seems to be all right
see that didnt hurt did it
i didnt expect that to hurt
i expect the next part to hurt
gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal topped work bench
it is a scary thing like a hydraulic jack designed by giger only smaller
yeah thats what i expect will hurt
ive never crippled anyone yet
how many have you done
well youll be the third
we are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on the chrome of a gas pump handle
gellers hand comes into frame and gently eases the creature into its palm
geller floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature with an expression of rapture on her face
the insect is large praying mantis sized and it has two heads neither of which seems to know how to deal with the other one
each time it attempts to move it falls over in an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and shapes
it beats its large papery wings wildly in order to pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process all over again
eventually its wing action lifts it off gellers hand more by accident than will it seems and the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas pumps
geller enters the garage and sees pikul with his back to the wall of the service bay and a large wrench in his hand poised and threatening
gas stands twenty feet away his insertion gun at the ready
a mexican standoff
whats going on gas
hell hes acting like im attackin him
people usually pay me
to do this you know
all two of them
as you can see ive decided not to have a bioport installed
geller walks over to pikul and puts her face quite close to his
he watches her lips move from the corner of his eye
are full and moist and convincing
this is it you see
this is the cage i was talking about the cage of your own making which keeps you trapped and pacing about in the smallest possible space forever
break out of your cage pikul
break out now
wearing mechanics work gloves gas fires in the bioport plug
its impact knocks the breath out of pikul like being kicked in the spine he cant even scream
when gas pulls the insertion device away from pikuls back we see the glossy plastic head of the bioport plug
its surrounded by a small angry looking volcano of rashy irritated flesh
that swelling doesnt last for long
tomorrow you wont even notice it
i love it
pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly collapses into the arms of geller and gas
whats going on
i cant walk
the procedure comes with its own epidural just like when you have a baby
kinda like instant paralysis from the waist down
thats why it didnt hurt you
itll wear off in about twenty minutes
as they ease pikul into a sitting position in the chair gas almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in one hand
he leans it against the wingback chair and pikul notices blood and flecks of skin on gass work gloves
youre looking more like a butcher than a mechanic
things do get kinda confused these days dont they
im gonna go wash up
you two make yourselves at home
gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great satisfaction
geller eases her game pod out of its case and starts to attach its two player y shaped umbycord to it
what are you doing
we dont have to wait for the swelling to go down
youre going to port into me
while im paralysed
you wanted to play my game didnt you
yeah i did and i do but
its an instant on world isnt it
she lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport
it already looks a bit less angry than it did before
geller caresses it prods it plays with it
then she takes out a little bottle of wd and sprays it around and into the port
whats that for
it feels cold
new ports are sometimes a bit tight
wouldnt want to hurt you
how come bioports dont get infected
i mean they open right into your body
listen to what youre saying pikul
dont be ludicrous
dont you think you could call me ted
geller gently works her umbyjack into pikuls bioport
she locks her eyes onto his then squeezes her game pods on teat
instantly her pod convulses and begins to flash and spark and crackle
white electronic smoke seeps from its crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its pores
geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her umbyjack out of pikuls spine
he cant feel it but the furious force of her move twists him in his chair
i cant believe this
i trusted you and you blew my pod
you must have neural surged
what do you mean
i jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked
now its totally fucked
this is a disaster
i was nervous but i didnt panic
i was forced to trust you and you panicked and you neural surged and you blew my pod
you can get a new pod
her heart is breaking pikul in this pod is the only the original version of existenz an entire game system that cost thirty eight million to develop not including pre
release marketing costs
and im locked outside of my own game
i cant get it out or me in
are you serious
this is the only version that exists
security is everything these days
its the only one and its stuck inside and its your fault
geller uses her sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with tragic gentleness as though it were an injured child
fighting back tears ive devoted my five most passionate years to this strange little creature
and ive never regretted it pikul because i knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any meaning
but why is it my fault
im telling you i didnt i did not neural surge
i didnt feel any surging
gas strolls into the garage still wearing his work gloves which now hold an agricultural looking shotgun
it is levelled at geller
it isnt your fault
its my fault
pikul looks at gas in disbelief
his feet begin to writhe in circles but he still cant get out of the chair geller backs away from gas clutching her pod protectively
oh no gas not you
i wouldnt try to use that bioport again cept maybe for a toaster or something
whats going on
youre worth a lot of money
if youre dead
what are you talking about
you know what im talking about
its all over the countryside
five million for her dead body
no questions asked
she changed your life
and now im gonna change hers
why did you install a bad port into me
seems theres a big bonus for killing allegra gellers latest game or whatever it is
i think i just did that didnt i
geller decides to try another tack
she stops backing away and begins to slowly approach gas
but can you kill a person
can you do that gas
can you kill me
hide my body
contact the crazies
trust them to pay up
hand over my now decaying fucking grotesque corpse
really expect them to hand over mil cash
dont you ever go to the fuckin movies
i like your script
i want to be in it
gas cocks his shotgun
hes really going to do it
except that pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone just behind the ear with the bioport insertion gun
the back of gass skull shatters and he goes down hard
pikul drops the gun and launches himself out of his chair
he falls to his knees beside gass body
oh god i think hes dead
i thought i could just distract him
you did distract him
to gass body plug your toaster into that hole corpse
pikul hangs on in the passenger seat
he wanted to kill you
thats two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you
ive never been more popular
allegra we need help
ive got to get this pod fixed
the defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain road
the defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an open gate
the stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which reads caledon ski club private road
were going skiing
nothing in the countryside is what it seems
its all appearance versus reality and the reality here is something unique
the defender pulls up beside the chalet style ski clubhouse
as they get out of the truck the same bizarre insect that geller was playing with the night before lands on the trucks side mirror narrowly missing pikul as it
flops around in the air
look at that huge bug
its got two heads
they breed them here
theyre not supposed to get away
they get out and walk towards the clubhouse
what if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski
nobody actually physically skis any more pikul
you know that
ive watched some ski shows
downhill racing austrian alps
pikul and geller enter the clubhouse
there is nobody around
it looks like a real ski clubhouse complete with racks of ski pants and ski boots
but when pikul examines the goods he can see that theyre old and cracked and falling apart
theyve been there for years
a man comes out of a back room early sixties authoritarian air eastern european
he is kiri vinokur and he lights up when he sees geller
my darling allegra
i am so pleased to see you here
kiri vinokur this is my bodyguard ted pikul
hello yes i heard the ridiculous story about this fatwa against you
the company is desperately trying to find you
is it really serious
are you in danger
if im her bodyguard then shes in grave danger
there have been a couple of attempts on my life already
the company must stop this
they owe you every kind of protection
i dont know if they can do anything about it
it seems to be open season on me
well you will be safe here i can assure you of that
i will contact antenna right away and have them send some people to come and collect you
kiri no dont
you mustnt let anybody know were here unless you have to
i cant be sure that antenna is completely safe for me
the company draws many eccentric people into its fold
you can hide in one of the guest chalets
as long as you like
i will make sure you get fresh towels
geller pats her game pod case
and make sure i dont lose everything i have in here
in the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet vinokur is taking gellers pod apart
it is more like surgery on an alien life form than computer electronics
the room feels like a weird combination of a hi tech operating room and a woodworking class
a cherubic middle aged man landry who looks more like a farmhand than an electronics technician assists vinokur as he works
what did you port into
thats what did all the damage
it was a flawed installation my first
it neural surged
allegra says you can fix it
it fried some very expensive nerve boards
these are kaput
its a complex thing
we use the nervous systems of specially bred insects to create the electronic circuits on our motherboards
only antenna research has it
and where do the batteries go
hes not kidding
hes a total pr nerd
it ports into you and you are the power source
your body your nervous system
when you get tired run down it wont run properly
landry here will finish up the pod work
lets get that nasty bioport out of you and get a nice fresh one in there
we have guest chalets out back
youre both welcome to stay
now where did i put my bioport plug puller
here it is
vinokur hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring loaded fire tongs
lie down on that couch and pull up your shirt
in their chalet a cozy and inn likespace pikul and geller examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalets twin beds
the region around the port looks swollen bruised and tender
i think its infected
its not infected
its just excited
it wants action
she attempts to jack her pod into his port using the y shaped umbycord but he twists away from her
but i really dont think that i want action
me i mean
the bearer of the excited bioport
what i want is
i feel too
geller sighs then switches into her explaining the facts of life to a child mode
they are both aware that they are replaying an earlier moment
cradling her pod my baby here has now taken three major hits one in the church one in the gas station and one on the operating table
the only way i can tell if everythings ok the games not been contaminated the pods not fucked is to play existenz with somebody friendly
are you friendly or are you not
pikul swallows nervously then turns his back to geller so that she can port in
youre telling me this thing will run off my bodys energy
thats how they work
youre hummin along already
sure enough he is
geller deftly twists the second jack into her own bioport and takes a deep breath
only from antenna
here we go
youve got a bit of an unfair advantage dont you
how can i possibly compete with the designer of the system
you could beat the guy who invented poker couldnt you
geller flicks the game pod nipple and the chalet begins to melt away around them
the chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game store
a lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst the dusty racks and pinball machines examining packages of weird games and game devices muttering secretively to each other and
it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that pikul and geller find themselves standing
a cashier works away behind an old fashioned cash register that sits on a tall counter
the cashier a gangly sallow young man glances at pikul and geller suspiciously from time to time
pikul feels himself his clothes moves his arms his tongue
he feels around behind him but there is no game pod or umbycord in sight
that was beautiful
just like me
is that kind of transition normal a kind of smooth dissolve from place to place
depends on the style of the game
you can get jagged brutal cuts slow fades shimmering little morphs
this is amazing
i had no idea
were still ourselves but were in the game
where are we
its basically a game store i used to hang out in as a kid
are you serious
were ported into a game pod together remember
existenz has complete access to both our central nervous systems
its game architecture will be based on our memories our anxieties our preoccupations
are you serious
you keep saying that
examines a game pak look at this
games ive never heard of
hit by a car
reads pak back in viral ecstasy you are a virus invading a specific human body
you create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the bodys immune system to destroy you
wait a minute
that reminds me
what precisely is the goal of the game were playing now
i mean the rules the objective
nobodys ever really said anything about what you have to do in existenz
the beauty of existenz is that it changes every time you play it
it adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it
the result is that you have to play the game to find out why youre playing the game
but thats kind of cheating isnt it
not to say confusing
not at all
its a much more organic approach to gaming than classic arbitrary rule dominated games
its the future pikul
youll see how natural it feels
look at this
could this be the future too
picks up a game pod ever see anything like this before
they are looking at a game pod in a gel pak that is even weirder than a tissue pod
it has a logo and a name suddenly a hand reaches into the frame and takes the pak away puts it neatly back on the rack
pikul and geller look up at a man in his early fifties graying thinning hair beefy generally harried and pugnacious air
the man is dorsey nader
these are delicate
you have to be careful
i can imagine
cortical systematics is the latest and the hottest
not just a new game but a new system
will it work with an industry standard bioport
ignores her question i havent seen you two before have i
this is my place
haimische isnt it
were new in town
welcome to dorsey naders game emporium
im dorsey nader
is there anything i can help you with
were just looking
i have what youre looking for
nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the store
he stops at a warped and dirty door turns beckons to them urgently trying not to be noticed by the preoccupied patrons
as pikul and geller follow nader through the door they do not escape the notice of the sour faced young cashier who writes something down hurriedly on a pad with
an air of vengeful self importance
pikul and geller find themselves in a stockroom jammed to overflowing with packaged and naked game related merchandise
they are alone with nader and they are all sitting on wooden crates
nader rummages on the shelves behind him for a moment then turns back to them with a gel pak in his hands
he studies them for a moment hefting the gel pak in his hand
who sent you
its none of your businesz who sent us
were here and thats all that matters
pikul is shocked at his own response
he turns to geller in horror worried that hes blown the game already
oh god what happened
i didnt mean to say that
its your character who said it
its a kind of schizophrenic feeling isnt it
but youll get used to it
there are things that have to be said to advance the plot and establish the characters and those things get said whether you want to say them or not
dont fight it
just go with it
but should you be saying that in front of him
look at him
nader doesnt seem to have heard him
in fact he doesnt respond at all other than to hum the antenna research corporate song and tap his fingers repetitively caught in a small behavioural loop
geller chuckles at pikuls confusion
whats he doing
hes gone into a game loop hes locked up and he wont come out of it until you give him a proper game line of dialogue
this is tricky
start by repeating your last line
include his name so he knows youre talking
were here dorsey nader and thats all that matters
nader immediately comes out of his loop
that is all tha matters
pikul smiles delighted
now he takes a deep breath closes his eyes relaxes
the line comes
well nader you said you had what we want
youre going to need these micro pods to download your new identities
i assume that you both have had those industry standard bioports you mentioned installed
yes of course thats right
we both have bioports
here she pauses looks at pikul
we do dont we
i assumed we did
i mean here
in the game
of course we might not
wed better check
while nader goes into game lock up geller lifts up her shirt
pikul takes a look
her bioport is there although slightly rougher puckered more organic than in non game life
yeah its there
looks a little different but its there
geller grabs pikuls shirt and lifts it
his is there too
i see what you mean
yes we both have bioports
port in and thisll tell you all you need to know for now
pikul and geller examine the pak which bears the cortical systematics name and logo
it seems to be a miniature version of their real life game pod
im going to leave while you finish up here
it wouldnt be good for us all to be seen together
nader gets up to leave pauses at the door
dont do anything i wouldnt do
nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle then leaves
i assume that nader is our entry point into the game
not a very well drawn character
and his dialogue was just so so
do we blame ourselves for that
the bad dialogue
or would it be bad no matter who was ported in
the game engine is just getting used to us
itll get more daring once it warms up
geller fumbles the micro pod out of its vacuum pak shell
she reads the instructions on the back
the pods are so small they plug directly into the bioport
geller delicately twists the end of the micro pod into pikuls bioport
the micro pod changes colour pulses ripples and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into pikuls bioport until it has completely disappeared
the whole pod just disappeared into your back
it disappeared into my back
its in my spine
its winding its way around my spinal cord
dont panic its just a game
do you feel anything yet
controlling his fear no i dont
not a thing
i dont feel a thing
uh do you want me to do you
they change positions
pikul ports in the micro pod and it duly crawls its way into gellers bioport
tenderly as though kissing a cut to make it better pikul kisses her back low near her bioport
geller whirls around with sudden anger
what the hell was that
that wasnt me
that was my game character
i wouldnt have done that
not here anyway
she pauses then kisses him on the mouth hard
our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other
probably to create emotional tension when danger happens
no use fighting it
what about our new identities
do you feel yours yet
theyll take care of themselves
im very worried about my body
geller stops sits up
i mean where are our real bodies
are they all right
are they hungry
what if theres danger
kissing and caressing theyre just where we left them sitting quietly eyes closed
just like meditating
reluctantly kissing and i dont know
i feel really vulnerable
dont sweat it
all your senses are still operating
youll pop right out of the game if theres a problem
they begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks and cartons of replacement umbycords
and then the game store melts away around them
pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in the process of assembling insect motherboards along with many other workers
pikul can still feel the warmth of gellers body but shes nowhere to be seen
a gritty narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench upon which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which the workers pick off as they need them
the belt begins and ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building
the place a high ceilinged pre fab long and narrow with hundreds of blanked out windows houses a game pod assembly line
pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo id card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is somebody named larry ashen
he has to twist the card around because of course from his vantage point it is upside down
tryin to remember who you are
pikul snaps his head up to see a long haired morose looking worker sitting next to him snickering
mocking pikul he twists his own card around comically bunching up his work shirt so he can read his own name which is yevgeny nourish
hey it works
i must be yevgeny nourish
nourish leans over to squint at pikuls name tag
you are new to the trout farm
did you say trout farm
you know raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them
entire place used to be a trout farm
seems like most everything used to be something else doesnt it
pikul looks around him
the place is humming but geller is still nowhere in sight
the workers are small town locals o a a wide range of ages
pikul looks down at his own hands which seem to know what to do place glue on the boards glue them down to a resin frame using a template insert
needle like electrodes into the bodies of certain epoxied insects
the insect boards pikul notes are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and frozen together like a sick collage
at least here in the game they are
pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd materials in front of him with great dexterity
nourish takes note of this
i with admiration you might be new but you seem to know what youre doing
it surprises me more than it surprises you
nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has been working on then leans over again exactly as he did the first time
it has the effect of an instant replay but not in slow motion
you might be new but you seem to know what youre doing
pikul realizes he hasnt given the right answer
he now just lets it come without thinking
ive been trained by the very best
nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate furtiveness
so have i
where do you plan to have lunch
im new here
i have no plans for lunch
i suggest the chinese restaurant in the forest
everybody knows where it is
wont you be going there too
i have other plans for lunch
but i do suggest that you order the special
and dont take no for an answer
all right ill do that
nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as though pikul didnt exist
pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon preoccupied with testing the boards circuits by porting it into a test umbycord that uncoils from
the center of the bench
his strange reverie watching himself work on auto pilot at this bizarre task is soon interrupted by a worker pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels
the worker parks the cart behind pikul and taps him on the shoulder
they need this in the back room
they asked for you
the worker shuffles off leaving the cart behind him
pikul turns to nourish
whats that mean
it means that they want you in the back room
they need more insect boards for the pod assembly bays
should i just get up and go there
ill take care of your incoming boards
pikul gets up to go
nourish grabs him by the arm and whispers intensely
the chinese restaurant for lunch
i order the special
pikul enters the huge back wing of the trout farm and walks along a rampway pushing his cart past the pod assembly bay area
there pods very much like the one he and geller are ported into back home are being assembled motherboards inserted internal ports connected fleshy housings like the corpses of small
amphibians sewn up by small teams of workers
the bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still covering the dirt floors
but because the pods are primarily organic the teams are more like groups of masked surgical workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating rooms than lets say
auto assembly teams in a progressive saab plant
as pikul wheels his cart past each stall he digs into the carts canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams
in the last bay one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads himm to an isolated corner
her id card says she is barb brecken and her photo says she is geller
slipping off her mask i saw you make contact larry ashen
what did the guy on the
l assembly line say to you
pikuls expression shows that there is a return game line welling up in his mouth tickling his tongue perhaps
perversely he fights it but it comes out anyway
he told me where to have lunch
a ragged stream of pod assembly workers trickles along a densely wooded gravel path towards a very un chinese victorian red brick farmhouse
a small river flows not more than fifty feet from the restaurant mimicking the movement of the line of workers
the workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the building which reads mona zhangs beijing cuisine
pikul and geller are seated at a round formica covered table with a lazy susan serving wheel in the centre of it all very mandarin in style
other workers sit sullenly at their table wordless suspicious
a restaurant dog a mongrel with a lot a heavy collie like fur lies basking in a pane of sunlight
in a corner
the waiter a young athletic chinese man comes over bringing rice and tea
we have nice sea bass today
shall i bring it for everyone
pikul and geller exchange a look
pikul shrugs ok
we want the special
the waiter looks stunned
the others at their table look distressed
the waiter seems to lock up almost freeze framed
did you hear me chinese waiter
we want the special
the waiter unfreezes smiles grimly
the special is for special occasions
i cannot give you the special
but this is a special occasion
pikul pauses waiting for the proper game line to materialize in his mouth
finally it does
he gestures towards geller
its her birthday
the waiter locks up for a moment then unfreezes
a birthday is a special occasion
i will therefore bring the special for everybody
the waiter walks away
the others at the table get up and move away drift over to other tables with occasional furtive backward glances at pikul and geller
i guess the special isnt very popular
but you know really dont you
you dont have to guess
i mean its your game your little universe
i dont know
you have to understand that to understand what weve really created with existenz
youre telling me for example that you dont know what the special is
or why we ordered it
we ordered it because another game character told you to
thats a clue we cant ignore
but thats just basic games playing
i want to put the game on pause
geller just looks at him puzzled
the game can be paused cant it
i mean all games can be paused right
sure yeah but why
arent you dying to see whats special about the special
im feeling a little disconnected from my real life
im kind of losing touch with the texture of it you know what i mean
i mean i actually think theres an element of psychosis involved here
i mean i dont know where my body really is or where reality is what ive actually done or not done
thats a great sign
it means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture
the game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel realer than real
pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs
existenz is paused
the chinese restaurant melts away
the guest chalet melts back up around them
pikul looks around
they are still sitting on the bed ported into gellers pod together
did i do that
i guess i did
so how does it feel
your real life
the one you came back for
just sitting here it feels completely unreal
im sure you knew that would happen
youre stuck now arent you
you want to go back to the chinese restaurant because theres nothing happening here
worse than that
im not sure here where we are is real at all
this feels like the game
youre beginning to t feel a bit like a game character to me
did we really make love to each other
it feels like we did
our characters did
im sure it would be very different if we did
im actually just like that in real life
you got the real ted pikul there in the stockroom of the game store
well you didnt get the real allegra geller i can tell you that
no i didnt
she kisses him gently
in real life i tend to lose control
it can get messy
lets go back
pikul looks down at the pod
he flicks the play nipple
the room melts down around them and is replaced by the chinese restaurant
pikul and geller are back at their table in the chinese restaurant
the waiter is approaching their table
he proudly sets down a series of dishes on the lazy susan
special order for the birthday girl
hope you enjoy it very much
in the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles amphibians fish and birds all weirdly mutated and presented in a bizarrely beautiful fashion
i think ive lost my appetite
mutant creatures provide new and previously unimagined taste sensations
shall i clear all this away
geller sees that this is a crucial game moment
no it looks terrific
the waiter nods
the waiter leaves
geller watches him go suspicious
when she turns back to pikul she is shocked to see that he has served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly stripping the meat off their
pikul what are you doing
i dont know
i find this disgusting but i cant help myself
pikul looks up from his big bowl which is rapidly filling with creature parts
his fingers areslimy and sticky but he doesnt stop his fingers working expertly on their own
you think this is good
its a genuine game urge
its something that your game character was born to do
dont fight it
i am fighting it but it isnt doing me any good
pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone gristle and flesh a grotesque lego set
when hes finished hes made a gun very much like the one that was used in the attempted assassination in the church
omigod this looks awfully familiar
you sure this is ok
it should be ok
now pikul reaches into his mouth pulls out a bridge of three teeth one of them gold filled and loads them into the gristly magazine
do you have that bridge in real life
my teeth are perfect
dont ask me how i knew this thing was in my mouth
it probably wasnt until you ordered the special
he slaps the magazine into the handle then pulls the slide back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in the chamber
then with a smile pikul points the weapon at geller
death to the demoness allegra geller
suddenly very uncertain thats not funny
pikul looks at geller and sees that there is genuine terror in her eyes
sorry i couldnt resist
but you know
i do feel the urge to kill someone here
geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot and sour soup the handiest weapon she has
i need to kill our waiter
oh well that makes sense
when he comes over do it
but everything in this game is so realistic
i dont think i really could
you wont be able to stop
you might as well enjoy it
free will is obviously not a big factor in this little world of ours
its like real life theres just enough to make it interesting
pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room towards them a big smile on his face
hes too nice
i wont do it
the waiter arrives at their table
what can i do to make your lunch more pleasant
pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter
i found this in my soup and im very upset
the tooth bullet hits the waiter in the cheekbone
a chunk of the waiters cheekbone comes off and his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab
the waiters sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous angry snarling mask of hatred
he pulls a meat cleaver out of his jacket
geller immediately throws her bowl of hot and sour soup into the waiters face
the waiter screams then wildly wipes the noodles and goop out of his eyes
he raises the cleaver over his head
the waiter swings and lunges across the table managing only to hack the tip of the gun off
pikul is shocked to see the gun begin to bleed
the waiter sprawling across the table screams as he tries to reach geller with his cleaver
fires into the waiters shrieking open mouth a tooth bullet into teeth
a piece of the waiters skull comes off like a piece of coconut the gold filled tooth now flattened and embedded in it
the gun is bleeding all over pikuls hand now
he drops it in disgust
the restaurant dog comes out of nowhere picks the gun up and runs off with it under a table where he crouches down and starts to gnaw on it growling
pikul stands up shakily begins to become aware of the strange tense stillness of the other patrons in the restaurant
loudly to room sts all right just a little misunderstanding over the check
pay no attention and enjoy your meal
to his surprise the patrons actually turn back to their meals albeit with a certain sinister reluctance
pikul looks around wildly
i feel a serious game urge to get out of here
through the porthole in one of the pair of metal clad kitchen doors geller spots someone wearing a chefs hat someone who is wildly beckoning to them
through the kitchen
geller and pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around
there are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere in bowls and on chopping blocks
the kitchen workers have all turned to look at the intruders
suddenly a cook steps forward from around the door
we can now see that it is nourish in a chefs outfit
did you like the meal i prepared for you
it was very
it certainly was for me
you both passed our little test with flying colours
why did the chinese waiter have to die
a waiter hears many things spoken when people are relaxed and eating
a waiter has many opportunities for betrayal
he betrayed you
he betrayed us
out this way quickly
they go out a side door and find themselves walking along the river that links the chinese restaurant and the trout farm
the trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the trout farm
nourish points out a connected series of rock lined internally lighted pools some stagnant like ponds and some clear with river water running through them
see there the breeding pools
the pools are all alive with strange creatures mutated fish amphibians and along the small muddy terraces that border the pools reptiles
like the dysfunctional insect at the gas station these creatures do not work very well
they float and swim belly up lie on their sides at the bottom of their pools flop and flounder around and in general ostentatiously fail to function
is that where you caught todays special
the restaurant is controlled by us
we raise these mutant creatures as food and that is our cover but of course we are also raising them as components for undetectable and hypoallergenic weapons
right under the noses of our enemies
and speaking of our enemies its important that you go back to work at cortical systematics
we need to maintain as many agents there as we can
ill take care of the mess at the restaurant
the trout farm is owned by cortical systematics
their corporate slogan should be enemies of reality
a glazed look comes over pikul
he begins to speak like a robotic orator
reality is a fragile thing
most people think that reality must of course be the most solid thing but it isnt
reality is threatened now more than ever
it is being eroded and it is washing away in the deforming storm of non reality which masquerades as reality and eventually replaces it
deformed and crippled and limping and hideous threatening to engulf us all
geller looks at pikul in admiring disbelief
where did that come from
the game made me do it
nourish is also impressed
he smiles broadly then takes pikul in his arms and hugs him then geller
we love you two now now that you have proven to be true and trustworthy realists
well be in touch
nourish turns around and walks back towards the restaurant
enemies of reality
or does it really mean enemies of existenz
are the realists the game life version of the anti existenzialists desperately want to kill you
i wouldnt take it too seriously
of course you wouldnt
but maybe you should
but why is the name cortical systematics familiar
we saw it everywhere in dorsey naders game store remember
so that makes it the game life version of our own company
cortical systematics is equivalent to antenna research in the real world
thats probably fair to say
so then do we meekly go back to work and say nothing
it sounds as though nourish and his realists are preparing to sabotage the trout farm
before you know it theyll be planning to assassinate game designers
were just characters in here
dont mix your real life loyalties into it or youll lose for sure
then what do we do next
we are close on a cortical systematics logo on a game pak
as pikul and geller pretend to examine the merchandise they scan the game store for nader
the store is quite crowded same style of customers maybe even some of the same faces different clothes
they dont see nader
geller goes up to the cashier the same gangly sallow bespectacled young man who was there the first time
im looking for dorsey nader
is he here
say that again
is dorsey nader here
the cashier glances around the store then locks the register
come with me
hes in the back
the cashier leads them through the store towards the stockroom door
as they move amongst the customers both pikul and geller feel that they are being scutinized carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at the last moment
so that they cant be absolutely certain
and as for us have we glimpsed some characters from the game that we have already seen
possibly even wittold levi from the first scene in the church and frances the limo driver and gas
we arent positive
the cashier closes the door behind them then gestures towards the back of the stockroom
you want him there he is
nader lies dead the unnatural purple of his face eerily matched by the veiny purple streaks in the umbycord around his neck
in response the cashier starts rummaging around on one of the shelves
he soon finds what he was looking for and turns around to face them
in his hand is a grotesque slightly chewed gristle gun the one pikul assembled in the chinese restaurant in his hand
you shouldnt have killed the chinese waiter
he was your contact at the trout farm
a damn good man
pause he waggles the gun his dog brought me this
the cashier toys with the guns claw like hammer
but we were contacted there by yevgeny nourish
he seemed to know exactly who we were
thats because nader tipped him off that you were coming
nader was a mole for cortical systematics
youre with the realist underground
i was placed here to keep an eye on nader
the cashier puts the gun back on the shelf
if nourish isnt our real contact who is he
nourish is a double agent for cortical systematics
he was working with nader to subvert the realist cause and doing it rather well
after all he got you to assassinate your own contact
but now youre going to put a stop to him
i assume that you both have had spinal port inserts bioports installed
do you both realize that neither of you can be buried on hallowed ground because of these
does your bioport manual tell you that
are you trying to talk us into having them removed
in fact you would be useless to us without them
we realists are forbidden to have them and so we have to use people like you on occasion
i dont understand
are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports
not a game
a creepy smile you go back to the trout farm and in a familiar place you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread bare canvas cover
how will we know what to do
an even creepier smile even a child would know what to do
someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by
the cashier is oblivious butboth pikul and geller hear it
the stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced one at a time by chalet objects
someone is knocking at the chalet door
sorry to interrupt you kids but i thought youd better have something to eat
we knocked on your door a few times to invite you to dinner
pikul and geller sit on the bed game pod between them umbycord joining them to each other and to the pod
they look at each other
come on in
the door opens slowly to reveal vinokur who stands there uncertainly holding a large tray
and when we got no answer i figured you were playing existenz to try out your new pod and your new bioport
everythings all right i take it
an awkward moment as though vinokur has caught the pair having illicit sex
vinokur moves into the room towards the table
can i leave this here for you
dont bother unporting
i just had to be sure our star designer was in a good place and that shed recovered her multi million dollar game system from her defective pod
vinokur puts down the tray which holds several plates covered by smaller inverted plates to keep the food warm
thanks so much kiri
this is very sweet of you
so i take it she has
oh yes sure
thats why were so spaced out
we were right into it werent we
yeah we were
and its amazing
well thats a relief
ill leave you two alone
you can leave the tray outside your door when youre finished
what is that youve brought
believe it or not its chinese food
theres a great chinese restaurant on the other side of the escarpment road
vinokur turns to go
have you heard anything yet
i mean about the existenz test seminar and the shooting
its come over all the media now
youve never been more famous
your face is everywhere which of course just
makes it worse
a disturbed pause what
theyve announced the possibility that antenna will delay the release of your new system indefinitely until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is
i dont approve myself
i dont think we should bend one degree to extremists
support for the fanatics
what does that mean
well you know
theyre all coming out of the woodwork now
heavy defeated sigh a lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti game bandwagon
theyve now heard rumours about what the existenz system is and they say weve gone too far psychologically medically socially you name it
and im afraid i wouldnt put it past our competitors to be involved in this to try to whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets
youre sure you dont want me to contact antenna even just to see what they have to say
not yet kiri
vinokur smiles gently and leaves
gesturing towards the your friend vinokur is getting shaky
i think hes going to turn you in to antenna
sounds like you might approve of that
it might be the safest thing
are you hungry
are you kidding
im terrified to look under the plates
this support for the fanatics thing doesnt sound too good
maybe we should stop
we cant stop
ive been noticing some new
im not sure what they mean
im not sure the game is ok
listen to be honest i find your game very confusing
im not sure i want to go back in there because im not convinced im going to keep coming out
do you really like that feeling
yeah i love it
when existenz is released its gonna wipe the competition off the face of the earth
it really will do that yes
dont hurt me pikul
dont make me go back in alone
play with me
allegra im worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth
im thinking i was right never to have a bioport installed
sly quick smile but you have one now
and youre ported in
she mischievously flicks the pod nipple and the chalet melts away around them
trout farm workers shuffle along a murky pre fab corridor towards a smoke enshrouded security checkpoint
a puffy faced woman with a clipboard is walking down the lineup checking faces and id cards
with her we discover pikul and geller once again wearing their id cards which identify them as larry ashen and barb brecken
that was cruel
i dont want to be here
it wasnt cruel it was desperate
youve just got a bad case of first time user anxiety
i dont like it here
i dont know whats going on
were blundering around together in this unformed world whose rules and objectives are largely unknown seemingly indecipherable or even possibly non existent always on the verge of being killed by
forces we dont understand
that sounds like my game all right
they are now close enough to the security cubicleat the end of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being frisked by hand then scanned by a wand
similar to the one that pikul used at the church
that sounds like a game thats not going to be easy to market
but its a game that everybodys already playing
existence its wonderful
pikul and geller have passed through security and now enter the assembly line arena
they see nourish at his accustomed place on the line hunched over a pile of insect motherboards and now seeming somehow menacing predatory in profile
the pair skirt the assembly line area carefully scanning as they go but there is no wicker basket to be seen
pikul and geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly bays
other workers drift casually in and out preparing for their day in a desultory fashion
the cashier said it would be in a familiar place
is there such a thing here
my assembly bay
they make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside it
there is for the moment nobody else there but several pods have been left on the work tables half assembled
pikul spots it first in the far corner a large mouldy wicker basket in the opposite corner
something lumpy in it is covered by a thread bare canvas sheet
is that it over there
they stroll over to the basket
geller kneels down and carefully begins to unwrap it while pikul stands guard
id say its exactly as advertised
the final wrap comes off
in the basket is a necrotic purpled very diseased looking pod
god its ugly
even for a game pod
i have a terrible urge to port into it
what about you
he thinks shes joking oh sure
desperate to port into it
geller steps over to a bunch of umbycords draped over a peg and strips one off
she sits down on a rotting wooden folding chair next to the death pods basket and ports in one end of the umbycord
here we go
wanna give me a hand
youre not serious
i mean thats a diseased pod
once you port into that you become you
a quick smile exactly
pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal her bioport
geller hands him the free end of the umbycord and he ports it into her
how long does it take for the infection to take hold
no time at all
and then you quietly port into all the other pods and spread the infection to them
pale shaky oh god
im gonna unport you now
pikul tries to unport geller but her bioport has swollen and seized the jack
he gives the umbycord a tug
in sudden pain god dont
that really hurts
pikul lets go
the death pod triggered off by pikuls attempt to disconnect geller now begins to convulse in peristaltic waves in its wicker basket
pikul looks around desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails on the wall
im going to cut you free
no dont im afraid
but pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming oversized motherboards and with three erratic slashes at the quivering umbycord hacks her loose
blood immediately pours out of both ends of the severed cord
wide eyed quietly pikul
im bleeding to death
panic stricken pikul steps on gellers end of the cord to stop the bleeding
it seems to work but geller moans horribly
i dont know what else to do
i know what to do
pikul twists awkwardly around to see yevgeny nourish standing just behind him
he is in the process of slipping a large propane torch off its wall hook
i know exactly what to do
nourish unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch
death to realism
nourish turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket
where the cone of flame hits the pod it begins to shrivel crackle sputter fat
the pod itself tries to ripple away from the searing flame as though it were alive
nourish laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface of the pod
geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion holds on to pikuls leg
the death pod now swells and bubbles under the torchs flame then explodes with a dull whump
a huge cloud speckled black and gray billows upwards and floats out over the intersecting walls of the stalls and into the main area of the trout farms assembly line
where it begins to settle like granular
ash on the startled workers
i horrified nourish watches the thick cloud of infectious spores floating out of his reach
gathering up her last shreds of energy geller suddenly shoves a startled pikul off her cord and picks up the linoleum knife from where pikul dropped it
trailing her bloody cord she lunges at nourishi driving the rusty curved blade into his back with great force
nourish turns to geller the torch circling towards her wavering
he tries to touch her with the flame staggers
death to the demoness barb brecken
death to who
he fingers his id card oh yeah
nourish drops the torch falls to the ground and snaps into the foetal position
a wall of flame roars up around him fueled by the straw wood canvas pod oils
pikul jumps over to geller and picks up the trailing cord twists it in his hands until it stops bleeding
all four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now
the doorway is a flapping sheet of flame
mixing with the swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire plant going on alert yells screams sirens running feet doors being slammed open and closed
pikul holds geller tightly
she is limp weak drained in his arms
i think we just lost the game
but now strange anomalous objects begin to appear out a nowhere in the flames a chair a tv set a bath tub a table objects emerging into the game from
the quest chalet
after a moments confusion pikul smiles
or maybe not
and sure enough the trout farm and its flames and its black cloud melt away
as the guest chalet melts up around them pikul finds himself back on the bed as he expected but he is still embracing the swooning geller which he had not
allegra were back home
whats the matter whats wrong
as geller swims back up into full consciousness she begins to talk mumbling at first then with terrible clarity
its here its happened
its come back here with us
we brought it back with us from existenz
brought what back
i cant understand what youre saying
we brought the disease back with us
my pod is diseased
as though realizing the implications of what shes saying for the first time geller twists away from pikul and begins to fumble with her umbyjack
oh god im really going to lose it im going to lose my game
cmon unport me
pikul unports her then begins to tug at his own jack
when he takes a close look at the pod he can see that it looks unhealthy
geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the table
she pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe unwraps it flicks the bubbles out of it falls to her knees beside the bed
im coming im coming
geller jabs the pod with the needle
as sne pushes in the plunger she starts to massage it with her free hand rub it prod it
shes so close to it we think she might give it mouth to mouth
but this cant be possible
how can a game event emerge into real life
theres a very weird reality bleed through effect happening here
im not sure i get it
pikul finally gets his umbycord unplugged
whats in that needle
its an anti viral serum
it sometimes works if you get it in time
unconsciously pikul scratches at his bioport
geller fixes on him with strange intensity
lemme see your bioport
lemme see it
pikul turns and shows it to her
she begins to examine it with microscopic clinical attention
i know what happened
its vinokur that bastard
he gave you a new bioport didnt he
he gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game system
wait a minute
the poor thing was trying to tell us that it was sick by introducing the theme of disease into our game
the theme of disease
im fucking reall infected
is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my brain
suddenly all business all right dont panic
ive got something that will help you
brusquely wiping away her tears geller goes over to her bag and takes out a cork shaped plastic capsule
she snaps open the capsule to reveal a knurled plug like electronic device
im going to seal up your bioport with this anti viral resonator
geller bends over pikul and works the device into his bioport until its flush with his skin
inserting the device it uses the umby pick ups for power
should cleanse all your porting channels of infection in a few hours
it give you a little skin buzz when its done
of course we cant play until then
controlling his panic yeah great
this could be critical
were you really saying that vinokur is an agent of the anti existenzialists
because if he is if hes with them then we are really
pikul my pods dying
sure enough the thing is quivering rippling convulsing turning purple
i cant help it
i cant do anything for it
geller falls to her knees beside the pod
as though triggered by this action an explosion in the nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of the guest chalet
pikul and geller are knocked to the floor by the impact of the blast
waves of heat and debris billow into the room
a moment of eery silence and then pikul and geller peek wide eyed over the edge of the bed
flames now engulf the nearby chalet all too clearly visible throught the shattered window frames
sounds of pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below and then a figure steps boldly in through the doorway
when the flamelight flickers over his face pikul and geller are stunned to see that it is the cashier and he is cradling a real life submachine gun in his
the cashier screams at the bewildered and terrified pair
the uprising has begun
the whole place is on fire
youve got to get out of here
theyll be looking for you
hes a game character
how can he be here
i dont know
i dont know
the cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet
she tries to pick up her pod but the cashier tugs her away from it
leave that rotting piece of meat here
its done its job
let it die
but my game
my games inside it
i dont want my game to die
the cashier unslings his submachine gun cocks it and blows the pod into streaks of slime flesh and slivers of insect board
geller is in shock
pikul turns her to face him speaks forcefully right into her face shuts everything else out
allegra listen to me
i think were still inside the game
i think your real pods out there somewhere somewhere safe
i think its ok to let go of this one this pod
its not the real one
a molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters against the bed
the bed ignites with an explosive whump
the three of them scramble out into the fiery night
the cashier leads pikul and geller out of the guest chalet and down the mountain path
the chalet next to theirs begins to implode as they scurry by it
as they flee they realize that all the chalets are on fire
there are people trying to fight the fires running r frantically everywhere with hand held extinguishers
there is also scattered gunfire but whos firing on whom is impossible to tell
the cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill
we can see everything from here
what is it that were seeing
the victory of realism
and you were part of it
the death of existenz
and we were part of it
the cashier turns on her with his gun
he snaps out his old clip and slams home a new one
he cocks the gun
theres just one more thing
what are you doing
were on your side
how could you be
how could allegra geller the worlds premiere game designer be on our side
off their bewildered oh y
we know who you are
you cant hide inside a game forever
somethings slipped over the edge here allegra
somethings all wrong
you see what i mean
you see the problem
the cashier raises his gun to fire at geller but before he can pull the trigger he jolts backwards and falls twitching to the ground
from the shadows of the trees backlit by the fiery landscape below steps kiri vinokur
in his hand he holds the gristle gun which pikul assembled in the chinese restaurant
i tried to find you
thank god i got here in time
pause waggles the gun my dog brought me this
you didnt get here in time
my game is dead
you murdered my game
no just your pod
i replicated the entire contents of your pod when i fixed your nerve boards
theyre in safe keeping
theyre all in one piece
you copied existenz
soft pleading allegra come over to cortical systematics
yes yes cortical systematics
im defecting and so are all the antenna research top brass pellatt melzack sherrin everybody good
youre a spy for cortical systematics
wait a minute
cortical systematics is just the qame version its only
not a spy exactly
i think of myself as a personnel exchange engineer
if you want to be reunited with your creation youll come over to us
existenz by allegra geller
only from cortical systematics
only from antenna research
but why stay with them
look at that mess down there
how could you trust antenna again when theyve endangered you like this
geller seems to have lost the thread
she wanders over to the cashiers body and disentangles his submachine gun from him
referring to cashier you know this guy was actually going to kill me
vinokur looks to pikul for support
can you talk to her
i mean we can take you with us too
but before pikul can respond geller now sitting next to the cashiers body on the grass opens fire at vinokur with the submachine gun
vinokur falls with a startled expression on his face
pikul absolutely horrified runs at geller and kicks the weapon out of her hand picks it up himself
what the fuck are you doing
youve killed him
are you gonna kill me next
hes only a game character
and i didnt like the way he was messing with my mind
you didnt like that and so you killed him
he was only a game character
what if were not in the game anymore
confused childlike huh
if were not then you just killed someone real
a real person
you see what can happen
its important for me that you see that
standing over her it wasnt an accident that you and i ended up on the run together
not an accident
pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands
thats why you never had a bioport
you were one of them
i still am one of them
but you have a bioport now
i thought that was forbidden to anti existenzialists
i made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you to make love to my enemy
why would you do that
to understand what i have to kill
geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the pocket of her shirt
understand that i suspected who you were from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo
understand that i knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the gun at me in the chinese restaurant
she flicks up a safety cover on the remotes tip revealing a toggle switch
pikuls hands tense around the submachine gun
and understand that youre dead
geller flips the toggle switch
the base of pikuls spine blows out his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport explodes
a delighted geller dances to her feet as pikul staggers backwards
death to the demon ted pikul
his eyes frozen in a death stare pikul falls rolls down the hill into the underbrush
smoke creeping up from the fires below curls over him like a blanket
arms raised in the air geller dances around on the top of the hill looking down on the flames and the chaos
confident laughing have i won the game
have i won
have i won
the hill the trees the flames melt down around her
we melt back up into the church which we last saw in the first scene
but there are many differences between then and now geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before her eyes just beginning to flutter open
but pikul is sitting next to her also playing the game
and next to him is nourish whom we are even more surprised to see in this context
aad in fact the players who are sitting in the circle of chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the movie up to this point nader
the cashier dichter gas vinkokur even frances the limo driver
the players are all emerging from a game that has just ended the movie we have been watching and they begin to stir in their game gear which is nothing
like the organic pod technology we have just seen
on the contrary the garners are wearing head gear with electrodes more like normal clunky virtual reality equipment and are linked by mundane wires
in their laps they hold not game pods but sleek plastic game modules each about the size of a walkman with holes into which i their left thumbs are inserted
a simpler and cruder version of the bioports we have become used to
watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are two security guards neither of whom is pikul of course
on a leash one of the security guards holds the dog that in the game picked up the gristle gun in the chinese restaurant
also monitoring the action are a woman merle who is the games actual project manager the real life version of the game character levi and her two assistants
there is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the players and now they are free to remove their thumbs from the game modules and slide their head gear
the two assistants the real life ones are both matronly women begin to help everyone unplug neatly gathering up the equipment in padded bags as they go
a broadly smiling merle mounts the dais and stands in the centre of the ring of players
are you all back
the man whom we knew in the game as yevgeny nourish immediately stands and takes charge
but it is a different nourish exuberant sensitive and artistic
were back merle
although i have a feeling some of our crew might not realize it yet
shaky laughter from some of the players
throughout the following round of comments from the garners whom we now realize have been up to now playing characters in a game we hear nothing from pikul and geller
these two who sit next to each other and are now holding hands remain enigmatically silent
anybody here want a bowl of hot and sour soup
i will if you make sure there are some insect boards in the rice
how long were we gone
about twenty minutes
it seemed like days
if you stayed in the gameworld for most of your life you could live to be five hundred years old
the twists and turns at the end made my head spin
maybe there were too many to fast to absorb
to pikul and geller hey but you two were fantastic
you guys are game divas
i think you both deserved to win
there is general agreement amongst the garners about this compliment to pikul and geller
the pair just smile sweetly and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause
a little jealous well me i was really bummed out at first
i got knocked out of the game so soon
it was fun to watch the rest though
i liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game early got to be spooky customers in the game store
but you were so wonderfully bad
so scary and crazy
i had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but i thought my character was kind of boring
well you know im a gas jockey in real life so i was kind of disappointed that i was basically the same thing in the game
a little more fantasy there fellers
hold that thought for the focus group
indicating game module can i keep this
ive never felt anything like it
and i love this little thumb hole
appreciative laughs and nice try but youre going to have to turn them in because theyre beta versions pre production hand made specials and we need to study them after
use for wear and tear and other things
but youll get a certificate for helping us out here im right about that arent i merle
and that will entitle you to reserve one of the first batch of the transcendenz by pilgrimage game modules to hit the market and at a seriously discounted price
youre gonna love it
amidst applause and general excitement merle turns to the tripod mounted chalkboard standing as in the first scene at the back of the dais
there we see the words that she has already written transcendenz by pilgrimage
remember its written like this
capital t capital z
its new its from pilgrimage capital p
capital i and its coming soon
allegra geller now stands up walks over to nourish and gently takes his hand
he turns to see whos got him then smiles broadly
id just like to say thank you to mr
nourish for giving me the chance to play the role of a star designer
i guess the game picked up on my ambitions to be like you
well let me first say that im kinda glad i lost this game
i dont usually play such nasty characters
and allegra you were so good in that role that i suspect it wont be long before pilgrimage is after you to sign a designing contract
applause and laughter and maybe you should take your friend ted here mr
pikul with you
hes obviously good in a crisis and when you design games there are plenty of them
amid the renewed good natured laughter geller blushes
she reaches out for pikuls hand
i guess you all could tell that ted and i had a relationship prior to our coming here
we really do like to play together
shy but determined we do but id like to assure everybody here that allegra wouldnt really jump into bed with a security guard unless he was me
laughs from the security merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation towards nourish
well what do we say to our brilliant award winning game designer yevgeny nourish
does he have another winner on his hands or not
wild applause from all garners including geller and pikul
all right now i have to ask you some questions before the game half life wears off
first let me thank you for taking part in this test seminar
pilgrimage wants to deliver nothing but the finest to the game enthusiast and you have all been a proud part of that process tonight
when weve collected all the head sets and game modules well be handing out a questionnaire to each of you and id like your answers to the questions to be
as honest as brutal as clear as you can make them
dont hold back
after that were going to form a focus group where well discuss details of each of your experiences playing transcendenz
youve all had different but interlocking lives in the game and i think youll be amazed when you hear each others stories
while the questionnaires are being handed out by the assistants nourish confers with merle in a corner
merle i was very disturbed by the game we just played
what do you mean
it had a very strong very real anti game theme
i mean it began with the assassination of a game designer
but thats very creative
but on second thought i see what you mean
it makes me nervous
you think it must have come from one of our game players
it sure didnt come from me
the tone of it in the game was very very passionate fanatical
and the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming
the whole thing felt unstable dangerous volatile
but worse than that there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot
stealing game systems jumping ship from one game company to another
that kind of thing
they both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group who are all innocently dealing with their question cards
so which one of them did these elements come from
lets probe it when we do the focus group
i think we might have been infiltrated here and if we have weve got a big security problem
pikul andgeller questionnaires in hand wander over to the wary nourish and merle
pikul is now leading the dog that the security guard was holding for him earlier on the model for the game dog in the chinese restaurant
we were just wondering if we could ask mr
nourish a question away from all the others
long as you dont ask me to fill in your questionnaire
weve played your game now and so we can finally agree with the others that you are the worlds greatest game artist
we werent sure before
well thank you so much
yevgeny dont you think you should suffer for all the harm youve done and intend to do to the human race
dont you think the worlds greatest game artist ought to be punished for the most effective deforming of reality
i dont think this is very
looks towards security boys
could you come over here right now
but its too late
geller reaches down and pulls a flap of false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi automatic pistols strapped to the dogs flank
pikul and geller grab the guns pull back the slides and cooly execute merle and nourish who bump grotesquely together as they slump to the ground
in the stunned silence that follows only the clatter of the last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be heard
pikul and geller glance at each other
pumped then fill the silence
death to the demon yevgeny nourish
death to pilgrimage
death to transcendenz
now a hesitant shuffling of feet causes pikul and geller to whirl and catch the security guards coming at them with their pathetic scanning wands
the guards stop in their tracks raise their hands and start to back away as the place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium
as pikul and geller in their turn back towards the front exit they glide past the young chinese man who was the waiter in the game
the waiter stands flattened out in fear against a pillar with his questionnaire and his pencil in his hand
they ignore the waiter but stop to wait for pikuls dog to trot calmly past them heading for the door
now pikul and geller are just about to turn and follow the dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the pillar towards them
they immediately swing their pistols over towards him
the waiter stops and raises his hands
no wait you dont have to shoot me
i just wanted to ask you a question
hey tell me the truth
are we still in the game
pikul and geller look at each other then into the camera
the church melts down around them into blackness
