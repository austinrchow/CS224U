apt pupil by brandon boyce apt pupil by brandon boyce based on the novel by stephen king rev
through the window of a moving vehicle we see a series of small middle class houses
this could be any suburban street in america
a boy is seated near the back of a moving bus
this is todd bowden as all american as they come
he stares out at the other passengers indifferently
then something catches his eye
todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot
this is the kind of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful suburban community of santo donato
todd gets off his bike and heads up the front steps
on the way he bends down to pick up the l
two signs in laminated plastic are secured neatly above the door bell
the first reads arthur denker
the second reads todd rings the bell
he looks at his watch
it is twelve past ten
he rings again this time longer
finally todd leans on the tiny button staring at his watch as he does so
after more than a minute of solid ringing a voice is heard from within
let it go
todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle
then it opens
an old man stands behind the screen
he is kurt dussander a
standing there in his bathrobe and slippers a cigarette smashed in his mouth he looks like a cross between boris karloff and albert einstein
dussander stares at todd who tries to speak but suddenly cannot
continuing a boy
i dont need anything boy
cant you read
i thought all american boys could read
dont be a nuisance now
the door begins to close
todd waits till the last moment before speaking
dont forget your paper mr
the door stops
dussander opens it slowly
he unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper
todd does not let go
give me my newspaper
sure thing mr
dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door
quickly almost imperceptibly the old mans eyes survey the area across the street up and down the sidewalk the boys bicycle
my name is denker
perhaps you cannot read after all
what a pity
as the front door closes todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap
bergen belsen january to june
auschwitz june to june
then you went to patin
the door stops still partly open
after the war you escaped to buenos aires
from to you were in cuba and then
i dont know
no one does
but in you popped up in west berlin where they almost got you
the door opens wider
i dont know what is the matter with you
but i dont have time for this game
now get out of here before i call the police
call them if you want
the heavy door slams shut
its okay by me herr kommandant
im sure the police would love to meet the blood fiend of patin
in a flash the front door is open so is the screen
dussander is through the doorway and descending upon todd with the rolled umbrella raised to strike him
todd stumbles back against the porch rail
you get away from this house god damn you
ill beat you all the way home
but todd regains his composure quickly
he brushes himself off and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the threat he was a few seconds ago
after no one saw you again
until i did
three weeks ago on the downtown bus
if you want to call the cops go right ahead
iii wait on the steps
youll do no such thing
listen old man if i want to start screaming right here i will
if i want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself then i will
i will do what ever i want
do you understand
pause but if you like i could come in for a minute
we could talk
id be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home
is that what you want to come into my home
so be it
there is no arguing with crazy people
dussander turns and steps back through the screen door
he stops at the threshold of the house and turns
he is holding the screen door open with one leg the front door open with the other
he looks straight ahead
a moment later todd steps into the house
dussanders home is what you would expect of a single poor old man
nothing fancy nothing out of the ordinary
todd looks around perhaps half expecting to find a nazi flag or an oil painting of der fuehrer hanging above the mantle
but he doesnt and moves into the living room where an old picture of a woman sits framed on an end table
she died in of lung disease
at that time i was working at the menschler motor works in essen
i was heartbroken
todds attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a lampshade next to the photograph
he begins to feel it as though he were inspecting it for something
todd jumps back a little but then recovers
tell me wasnt it ilse koch who made the lampshades out of human skin
now i dont know what youre talking about
sure you do mr
you dont listen boy
the television has fried your brain
your hands are shaking
yes theyre shaking
we all shake
you are most tiresome and rude
now if you have a point i wish youd come to it
were in no rush
if i thought you had plans id say cancel them but since i know you dont
you know nothing of my business what business
you sit in that ugly chair and watch soap operas all day
except on friday afternoons when you walk down to the movie theater
and twice a week you take the bus downtown to do your shopping
you always use the express lane because you never have more than ten items
you have been following me
of course i followed you
you think i normally go around to peoples houses and accuse them of being nazi fugitives
perhaps for me you made an exception
no for you i had to be sure
for kurt dussander i had to be absolutely certain
now i am and thats why im here
todd sits on the sofa
oh yes i see now
as i am this ex nazi fellow as you say then this must be the part where i offer you my hidden stash of gold taken from the mouths of
old jewish men of course which i keep buried in the basement
isnt that right boy
well im afraid youre wasting your time
i have no money
if i did i might even give you some just to be done with this nonsense
i dont need money
you dont have any anyway
at least i dont think so
you probably had to spend it all to sneak in the country
a good american passport is expensive on the black market that i know
good for you
yes i do
i know it all dussander
youre my one great interest
my one great interest
well not you personally but
well its something i learned back in eighth grade
our teacher miss harmon she said wed have to find our one great interest in life
you know the thing that would really grab us
once we did that everything would fall into place
like hers she said wasnt teaching but collecting nineteenth century postcards
i guess theres no money in that so she has to be a teacher
anyway she told us to start thinking about it
so i did but nothing happened
until the following summer in ronny peglers garage
thats where i found it
todd and ronny both rummage through several large boxes in the corner of the garage
we see that the boxes are filled with old war magazines
ronny tosses several of them to the ground as he digs for his dads old copies of penthouse
ronny selects one penthouse and rifles through it
he discards it a moment later
one of these has three girls doing it at the same time but the old war magazines catch todds attention
he picks one up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages
we see a few of the photographs nazi storm troopers prisoners behind barbed wire the ovens
i got it
check this out
hang on a sec
as young todd stares into this secret world his voice comes in
it was all there
pictures of stuff id never seen stuff they never put in the books anymore especially the ones they give us to read
and here were stacks of them
todd speaks excitedly
dussander very bored clearly indulges him
it was just like miss harmon said
i couldnt believe it
but there it was the camps the uniforms the the way they saluted each other
but what am i telling you for
you know more about this stuff than anybody
yes what are you telling me for
ignoring him then last year i wrote my big term paper on dachau
i got an a
it was the only a she gave
i mean i always do real well
as on everything
thats why im accelerated
you know accelerated
i skipped two grades second and ninth
i didnt need them
thats why im already a junior
some kids resent me for it
thats not important
anyway my paper really floored my history teacher
i guess because i got through all those books without throwing up
but i learned something
i learned that when you talk about the camps now you have to remember to sound really disgusted
i mean you cant just say what happened like the magazines did and leave it at that
if i tried that the teacher would have freaked and called my parents in
todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old magazines
the door to the house opens and ronny looking cross pokes his head out
todd your moms on the phone
she says you have to come home for dinner
todd lost in the sea of old photographs doesnt notice ronny at first
then he looks up at him
in his eyes is a glint of a darkness that we will come to know better
suddenly wary of todd your moms on the phone
angle on todd
nowadays you have to
why do i care about this
because i dont want it softened
todd hops up and begins to pace the floor
dussander stares at him blankly unsure of where this is going
i am sure you trouble your parents to no end
actually im pretty low maintenance
thats what my dad says
you told your parents about me then
you think im crazy
i think youre crackers but go on
todd looks deep into dussanders eyes
dussander is uncomfortable
slowly todd reaches out and brushes his finger against dussanders hand
dussander gets up
what are you doing
and then it happened
i was on my way to the library
it was raining
todds voice narrates what we are seeing
todd seated near the back of the bus watches dussander climb aboard
todd thinks nothing of it at first but soon finds that he is unable to take his eyes off him
todd is trying to place the old mans face in his mind
you climbed on the bus and started this slow walk down the aisle
just like you were examining a new batch of inmates
i dont think anybody gave you a second glance but me but somehow
people seemed to move out of your way
and under your arm you carried a rolled up umbrella
but what really did it what really set me off was the coat
you were wearing this long black rain coat
my mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of you taken at patin
you in your s
greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm
it was incredible
dussander stares back at him flatly
all of this
because of a rain coat
well it wasnt that easy
i mean i had to really check up on it
and every picture of you in those books is forty years old at least
i went back to the library to find the picture
and then i matched it with the photos i took
you took photographs of me
yeah i got this little camera
fits right in the palm of my hand
crunches cigarette into ashtray clever boy
but even then i couldnt be sure
i needed real proof
so i went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what youre supposed to look for and then dusted
your mailbox while you were at the movies
pretty smart huh
put dust on my mailbox
you took photographs of me
what else did you do
i dont believe any of this
i already had a copy of your fingerprints
theyre on your want sheet from the israeli government
its on database at uc irvine
can you believe that
he storms toward the kitchen and stops
would you care for a drink boy
sure you got a coke
no kok milk
dussander disappears into the kitchen
todd stands alone in the living room
he lets out a long nervous breath showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for dussander
he knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back
but after a moment he composes himself he has come this far
the sternness returns to his eyes
todd is all business
he takes a breath and then speaks loudly enough for dussander to hear him in the kitchen
it takes eight good matches theyre called compares actually for a fingerprint to get accepted in court
is that right
todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly
he pulls the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the mailbox for prints
yeah there were two sets of prints
the first i figured were the mailmans
once i knew what i was looking for yours were easy to spot
you should be a detective
the sounds of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the kitchen
drinks being poured
todd begins to move slowly toward the kitchen
maybe i will
mom thinks id be good at it
he reaches the doorway just as dussander turns around with the drinks
i found fourteen compares
dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass of bourbon
he hands the tumbler to todd who brings it up to his lips and hesitates
you have some
good gott he snatches the cup and swallows twice
its milk boy
from dairylee farms
on the carton is a picture of a smiling cow
todd pauses and then begins to drink
more to himself than todd and two missing children
pause boy what you have done i have to explain this to you because clearly you dont understand what you have done is a violation
kind of like those experiments with the decompression chamber
now that was a violation dussander
that fucking name
enough of that
i demand it
i demand you demand nothing from me
boy i will tell you this once more and for the last time
my name is arthur denker
it has never been anything else
it has never even been americanized
if you must know and apparently you must i was named by my father who greatly admired the stories of arthur conan doyle
i did serve in the reserves i admit and in the late thirties when i was first married i supported hitler
i supported him most i suppose because for the first time in years there was work and there was tobacco
would you like a cigarette
my dad used to smoke
mom made him quit
now hes addicted to nicorette
thats nicotine gum
dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match from a cabinet
he lights his cigarette with his back to todd
dussanders eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him
he lingers a moment pulls deeply on the cigarette then turns and continues
anyway hitler lost his mind at the end directing phantom armies at the whim of his astrologer
he even gave his dog blondi a death capsule
on may nd my regiment surrendered to the americans
i remember that a private named gonzales gave me a chocolate bar
bored todd sinks into a chair at the table
i was interned at essen where i was treated very well
we listened to the nuremberg trials on the radio and when goering committed suicide i bought half a bottle of schnaps and got drunk
when i was released i put wheels on cars at the essen motor works until i retired in
in i emigrated here to california and became a u
i am as american as you are
no buenos aires no berlin no koo ba
and thats it my whole story
i hope youre satisfied
but if not its as you say tough shit for you
now you go
enough of this
dussander points to the door but todd remains motionless in his chair
that was pretty good
so much to remember
but i guess it helps when you have forty years to practice your story
oh to hell with this and to hell with you
im calling the police
your father is going to beat your behind when he picks you up at the police station
my parents dont believe in violence
well they should start
dussander steps past todd and picks up the receiver of the phone hanging on the wall above the table
the boy still sits motionless behind him
dussander dials a and then with more difficulty a
he stands with his finger poised over the final
tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead
his shoulders drop
todd stands up
their faces are close together
hang up the phone
this is unforgivable
do you know the things youre accusing me of
slowly dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook
if you dont want money what do you want
i want to hear about it
hear about what
all the stuff the writers are scared to put in their books because people will think theyre sick
thats what i want everything everything
and youre going to tell it to me
youre a monster
according to history youre the monster
how could you ask me to remember such things
i can barely remember to take my heart medicine
you were there
you did those things
no one can tell it better than you can
and you will tell it starting today
if you dont ill tell everyone who you are
i swear it
why should i
why should i do any of it
because you hung up the phone
and just so you know just so there is no misunderstanding whatsoever
everything i have on you the compares the want sheet all the photographs are all in an envelope under my mattress
im going to put it there every time i come to see you
if anything happens to me if i should suddenly disappear some one will find it
believe me thats a foolish thing to do
what if your mother goes in your room anyway
what if she hires a maid
you better hope she doesnt
looking at watch were wasting time
lets get started
i have to be home for dinner
today i want to hear about the ovens
how you baked them after they were dead
to himself a boy
but before we start put your teeth in
you look better with your teeth
it is later the same day
todd emerges from the house
the setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours
he picks up his bike and hops on
he turns to look up the street in both directions
a moment later he pedals off down the street
a typical high school image
rows of students sit listening to a lecture from mr
proxmire fifties as he weaves his way through the aisles
but in panama didnt exist
the country we know as panama was part of columbia
as the teacher continues to lecture the camera stops on joey
on his desk is a folded note
he hands it across the aisle and motions for it to be sent to todd a few rows over
the note moves across the room avoiding the meandering teacher on its way to todd
now the nations of the west knew they needed a canal through central america
they were tired of waiting for their ships to sail around cape horn
this was the new century the age of modernization
and the u
was at the forefront
teddy roosevelt was in the white house looking for any chance to assert the might of america
when columbia balked at the offer made by the u
and england roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off the coast of panama just sit there where they could be seen from the coast
the female student across the aisle from todd now has the note
she whispers to him but he doesnt hear
todd is trying to say awake with great difficulty
the girl extends the note just as proxmire passes
he stops turns around plucks the note from the girls hand and heads for the front of the class
finally columbia gave up the territory for about a tenth of its original price
and as roosevelt would say later the u
stole the panama canal fair and square
without glancing at it proxmire crumples the note and drops it into the waste basket by his desk
it is in between classes
the denizens of students crowd around their lockers
among them is todd
he searches through his locker and selects a book
suddenly the door slams shut to reveal the face of joey standing against the lockers
todd startled jumps back
laughs take it easy jesus
its just me flinch man
serious dont do that
i got news for you
youre gonna like it
walk with me to french
the two walk down the corridor
someone likes you
well i heard my sister talking on the phone with lisa herman and
well you going to tell me who it is
two cheerleaders pass them
lowering voice you didnt hear it from me
was that so hard
so ask her out and the weekend after next you can double with me and vanessa
what about this weekend
im already planning on being grounded
where the hell you been
report cards were sent out today
i know that never affects you
they arrive at the door of todds classroom as the bell sounds
dont forget what i told you
joey runs off leaving todd looking after him
it is late afternoon
dussander sits in a rocking chair facing out into the backyard
todd is in the lawn chair off to the side
he has just finished a mcdonalds cheeseburger and is about to start another one
dussander eats a big mac washing it down with bourbon
a large cat keeps jumping onto dussanders lap while he is eating
he brushes it away annoyed
ive never seen anyone drink bourbon with mcdonalds before
so how did the stuff get to patin
in railroad cars marked medical supplies
it came in long crates that looked like coffins
was it always zyklon b
the cat jumps into dussanders lap again
he throws it down this time harder
no from time to time we would be sent something else
the high command was always interested in improving efficiency
once they sent us a gas code named pegasus
a nerve gas
thank god they never sent it again
todd sits up a little leaning in
it didnt work very well
it was quite boring
what did it do
it killed them
what do you think it did made them walk on water
it killed them
the cat jumps up a third time
this time dussander picks it up and tosses it a good six feet
the animal hits the ground and runs away
slurps on his coke tell me
where are my cigarettes
he finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips
he lights it
todd watches calmly giving the old man a moment to collect himself and then
what did it do
it made them dance
like zyklon b it came in through the shower heads
after a few seconds the prisoners began to leap about
some were screaming
most of them were laughing
they began to vomit and to
to defecate helplessly
you mean they
but dussander ignores him staring out into the yard as he begins to remember more easily
they began to twitch all over and make high strange sounds in their throats
at last they collapsed and just lay there on the concrete twitching and yodeling with blood streaming from their noses
but i lied to you boy
it didnt kill them
either because it wasnt strong enough or because we couldnt bring ourselves to wait that long
i suppose it was that
i sent five men in with rifles to end their agonies
these were five men i trusted
it would have looked bad on my record to have wasted so many cartridges at a time when the fuehrer had declared every cartridge a national resource
i was always given high marks for efficiency
yeah i bet
dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap
as if his own story has suddenly disgusted him he balls the food up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag
how do you eat this crap everyday
why didnt you just do the job yourself
you carried a gun didnt you
incredulous i was the commandant of the camp
so you never killed anybody
getting frustrated the entire world was at war boy
thats not a real answer
im asking about you boy i was a soldier in a position of power
you dont get to be there by selling
girl scouts cookies
i know what the ss was dussander
who are you talking to
it was a bunch of dumb rich kids who bought their way into the service so they wouldnt have to go fight on the front
dussander stares at todd wanting to say something
todd shovels a few more fries into his mouth then looks up and sees dussander eyeing him
thats enough for today boy
i beg you
that was good story though
you always tell them good once i get you started
angle on dussander
dussander is asleep in his bed
a low groaning sound comes in very slowly
dussanders eyes open
he sits up looks around sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field
it is grassy but certainly not beautiful
something is wrong about this place
he stands out of the bed wearing pajamas
but it is cold
he takes the sheet and wraps himself in it
the groaning is getting louder more human
we have never seen him frightened until now
he steps a few paces from the bed
the groans have becomes low screams
there is no where to go
slowly as if he knows what hes going to see he looks down at the ground
its just grass
but the human voices are now wailing desperately
his knees buckle but he tries to fight it
he reaches his knees and lowers his head toward the ground
the white sheet flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind
the screams are now at a feverish pitch
his ear is inches from the grass and his eyes marked with unmistakable terror are wide open as
dussander bolts upright in his bed
richard dick bowden is a taller grayer version of his son
he stands over todds shoulder watching him shoot at a paper target
he still has on a tie from work but the knot has been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up
both dick and todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses
dick chews gum
they are alone on the range
todd fires a few rounds from his fathers
a strained tension exists between the two bowdens
dont hold your breath so long
i cant concentrate
he pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to his father
dick takes it and begins to reload it for him
i know your upset
so am i
so is your mother
these honors classes
they arent as easy as i thought theyd be
i totally admit it i didnt prepare enough
well fine but now is not the time to slack off
you got a chance to finish at the top of your class nobody wants that more than i do dad
well you havent been hitting the books very much
and seeing as youre not playing soccer this year its not like you dont have enough time that still bothers you doesnt it
with difficulty no son
if you werent enjoying it then you shouldnt play
i think it bothers you and youre not telling me
dick decides to take a shot himself
he readies himself and fires
that was lousy
gives the gun back to todd i want to see your grades come up buddy
thats all that bothers me
and if you say you need more time to study then thats what well do
the first thing is to cut out all the time you spend reading to mr
its a nice thing to do but its not helping our school work a bit
dick is looking at his son unsure if he has just seen a contortion of rage on his sons face
but todd is cocking the rifle and
you still with me
dad dont do that
dont punish mr
denker for something thats my fault
i mean hed be lost without me hell be fine without you
he was fine before and hell be fine after
theres nothing wrong with wanting to help people but you gotta make sure you got yourself squared away first
thats what matters
todd turns to face his father and speaks to him with a new seriousness
dad am i like other kids
not by a long shot
then trust me on this
dont lose faith in me because i blew a couple of exams
i will get my grades back up
in fact ive already started
three days a week i go over to freddy tremains for extra help
hes a wiz at trig
but please dad whatever you do dont punish a helpless old man for something thats my fault
did you practice that in front of a mirror or something
feeling his father caving in he aims the rifle and squeezes off a round
dick keeps his eyes on todd as he shoots
hey hes not
it takes him a second no
thinks for a moment all right
well give your way a shot
if you think you can do it if you really do and your serious then
you really like the old guy dont you
im making a difference in somebodys life
its that simple
todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger
the gun jams
todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck
takes the rifle dont ever force it
dick begins to methodically unjam the gun
dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes
his clothes and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal appearance
he goes to the basement door and leaning carefully over the steps retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash stored precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement
he comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open
todds irritated voice booms in from the living room
dont get too drunk
we still have a little while
dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so todd can hear him
you dont have to do that you know
todd has built a fire probably the first fire dussanders fireplace has seen in twenty years
the room is bathed in a warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside
todd uses the poker to adjust one of the logs
im doing this for me
this place is freezing
dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy chair which has been positioned in front of the hearth
yes it must be fifty degrees outside
im sure to you it seems positively frigid why didnt you pay your gas bill
it slipped my mind
i will attend to it tomorrow
slipped your mind
i noticed it didnt slip your mind to stock up on a new case of bourbon
leave me alone
todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet away
all right so finish your story because im still not clear
you cook up this stew and you bring the prisoner in and you let them smell it and suddenly they tell you everything
oh dont misunderstand me
certainly with a pistol pressed to their head a prisoner would tell us everything we wanted to know sometimes more
but mine was a much more
remember it had been months since they had smelled real potatoes simmering over an open flame and boy when that delicious odor hit their noses their mouths would drop and
out would pour an account of every minor infraction their friends had committed i mean it was magnificent
and you let them eat the soup
oh we never promised them the soup in exchange for information
we never mentioned it at all
todd is impressed
wow thats really good dussander
i mean thats
pointing thats thinking
dussander does not respond
he gazes deeply into the fire
but as the war pressed on the time for such civilized measures became a luxury
i remember by april of we had barely enough food to feed ourselves
the sound of the russian mortars grew louder everyday but still the train cars from france and poland kept coming
this was a time of desperation
the ovens burned day and night and still knew we would not beat the arrival of the russian forces
many of my men the cowardly ones deserted during the night
but the men that remained the same ones i had called upon so many times
continued the work
at first we thought a massive fire in the main building would serve our purpose
we could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows
but with so many of them we couldnt be sure the bodies would burn properly
we needed something certain
then a young bright soldier i shall never forget his enthusiastic smile pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the western gate which had been used during construction
how perfectly simple it was
the bulldozers carved a narrow trench four meters deep down the center of the camp
for two hours they dug until i realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job
so the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery
when they were done i immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench
it took less than twenty minutes to get them in place
quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave
those who tried to free themselves were shot of course but very few cartridges were wasted that day
the machines were too fast
back and forth they went
packing the dirt
one by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels
but by sunset
it was done
i gave the order to evacuate
in the distance the plumes of russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud
but i knew that no matter what happened
no one would ever forget what we did here
dussander stares into the fire
todd wide eyed is locked on dussander when
the phone rings
they look at each other a bit puzzled
clearly it does not ring very often and when it does dussander cannot help but be apprehensive
it rings again
dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen todd watches him go
then with apprehension yes
no no trouble at all
yes hes here
his face softens really
no no plans
my dear id be delighted
of course i will
yes until then
he hangs up and turns to todd with a odd grin
it seems i am to be your guest for thanksgiving dinner
todd and becky are in the backseat of beckys car
they are on a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the lights of their town
at becky trask is an attractive girl who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes them
they are kissing in the back seat
music plays on the stereo
beckys blouse is unbuttoned
she stops kissing todd
is everything all right
yeah im fine
becky smiles to herself unconvinced
i think its sweet
no im cool
do you want me to do something else
todd just stares at her
he doesnt know what he wants
becky decides for him
she slides down out of the frame
todd is startled at first but lets her
after a moment he closes his eyes
dussander sits in his rocking chair
a small blanket drapes across his lap
he smokes a cigarette and holds a near empty glass
on the ground beside him there is a small bowl
here kitty kitty
here kitty kitty
out in the yard the large cat emerges from the darkness and moves across the grass
it sees dussander and more importantly the bowl next to him
we see that the bowl is filled with milk
come puss puss
dussander sits perfectly still
cautiously the cat moves toward the porch
thats right puss puss
you can smell it now cant you
the cat creeps to the edge of the steps
it takes them one at a time
thats right kitty kitty
after a moment the cat edges up to the bowl
its tail twitches nervously
finally it begins to lick up the milk
dussander crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass
his movements are slow and patient
from under the blanket he pulls a pair of yellow rubber gloves
he begins to put them on
the cat jumps back for a moment
he waits the cat out
soon the animal is back at the bowl
dussander continues with the gloves
he watches the cats tail
as the animal gets comfortable its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair
dussander slams the chair back
the cat shrieks
dussander flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight squirming hissing bundle
he stands out of the chair
it is later
becky sits behind the wheel
todd is next to her
a different song is on the radio
they sit for a moment in silence clearly uncomfortable
its all right
maybe youll be more in the mood later
i dont know
thats never happened before
becky lights a joint
she takes a puff and exhales toward todd
can you blow that the other way
maybe you dont like me
no i do
exhaling out the window maybe you dont like girls
for a moment it is as though todds face were purple with rage
but a moment later the expression is gone
todd turns away
becky sees that her comment has hurt him
that was a lousy thing for me to say
im sorry honey
she kisses him on the cheek
he nods reluctantly
lets just go home
dussander bursts through the door with the bundle
a single paw emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at dussander clawing him across the neck
oww you mother fucker
they move across the room to the stove
with difficulty dussander pulls open the oven door revealing the glowing red interior
the animal screams and claws at dussanders neck and arms escaping more and more from the blanket with every gyration of its body
with a mighty shove dussander plunges the cat toward the opening but the animal braces its paws on the edge of the stove
the two are deadlocked
but dussanders hands are too close to the heat
his grip loosens just enough
with a desperate cry the animal charges up dussanders body over his head and leaps to the floor
dussander dives after it
but the animal is too swift
in a second it is atop the counter and out the open window above the sink
although defeated and exhausted dussander cannot contain his excitement
his panting gives way to a twisted hearty laugh
this is a s laboratory
todd is in his boxer shorts
dussander is next to him wearing a lab coat and his s
todd looks down on the examination table
a young girl about is held to the table with clamps
she is naked staring at todd
behind the table is a glass window and behind that is another room where other scientists are monitoring equipment
over dussanders methodical voice todds dream shows flashes of what is being done some sort of sexual experiment on the girl
to other scientists test run eight four
electricity sexual stimulus metabolism
based on the thyssen theories of negative reinforcement
dreamlike sounds and images pass before us todds breathing the girls cry electrical equipment naked flesh maybe todds maybe the girls
subject is a young jewish girl approximately sixteen years of age no scars no identifying marks no known disabilities inside the control room a scientist monitors a volt meter calling
out the readings as dussander yells for the voltage to be increased
as the meter rises the girl screams more violently
perhaps her eyes roll back her tongue flutters in her mouth
through all of this the scientists call out and the record heart rate blood pressure brain activity voltage etc
todds eyes close
his breathing accelerates as does the motion of his hips until
todd snaps out of his daydream
his trigonometry class is having an examination
he sits at his desk staring blankly at the paper before him
most of the answer spaces are empty
he knows he is going to fail another test
todd is blasting away rapid firing the rifle down range at an unfortunate paper target
the protective headphones lay on the counter beside him as does his backpack
he stops shooting when a voice snaps over the p
speaker next to him
you on lane twelve
you need to have your headgear on at all times
click and no rapid firing
todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small booth
todd puts on the headgear and after a moment the man goes back to reading a newspaper
todd looks up and down the range
one or two other shooters are concentrating on their targets
todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the man in the booth
he snaps off a single dry round
todd smiles weakly at the sound of the click
unnoticed by anyone he turns back toward the target strangely comforted
all the bowdens are there including dicks parents victor and agnes
dussander sits at the head of the table todd next to him
the family has finished dinner and is having coffee
dick and his father smoke cigars
todds mother monica bowden still pretty at pours dussander some more coffee
todd loved that dog
a lot more than dick did
we all loved that dog
i remember when you had to put it down todd cried for two weeks
just about broke my heart
excuse me mrs
put it down
ive been here over twenty years but thats a new one
means put it to sleep victor
dussander still looks puzzled
he looks to todd but victor jumps in
well its how they kill it arthur
they do it all the time at the pound
sick dogs dogs nobody wants
its very humane
todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others dont notice
some more pie
as my departed wife used to say one must never overdo the sublime
it was delicious monica
tell me arthur if you dont mind me asking
what did you do during the war
now dont get too personal victor
a quick moment between todd and dussander
i was a student at the university until my reserve unit was called in
notices victor but we were not a combat unit thank god
help me find my cigarettes todd
in those days not even the call of higher learning could exempt an able body from military service
dussanders cigarettes are right in front of him
todd fetches one and bringing it to his own lips lights it for him
laughs knowingly my dear i do apologize
my hands are too arthritic to strike a match im afraid
your son has been good enough to help an old man with his filthy habits
as long as you dont inhale
cigarettes are gross mom
well victor you were doing your part like we all were i suppose
of course if you were in the pacific fleet id have to shoot you
everyone laughs except todd
to dussander my dad is very proud of the fact that the bowden men have hit every major conflict since the civil war
dickie served two tours in vietnam
earned a bronze star and a purple heart
its one family tradition id like to put an end to
todd and i blow a few caps down at the range every week
thats all the combat he needs
perking up offended whats that supposed to mean
looking at todd perhaps your son would excel in combat
todd could excel at anything
todd doesnt answer
his eyes are still on dick
dick notices him
getting up starts to clear some dishes oh lets dont even talk about this
i cant stand to think of you boys fighting another war
the purple heart
you were injured
he was knocked unconscious and woke up in a hospital
a long pause
dick is embarrassed and offended by todds stab
he puffs on his cigar
agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks up some more dishes
dick stands suddenly to help her
mom let me get that for you
todd and dussander walk together in silence
todd is clearly in a bad mood
dussander prods him
you shouldnt be so hard on your father
why dont you mind your own business
amused at todds short fuse boy its not so easy to raise children
your father does the best he can im sure
having his own father there is bound to cause some anxiety on his part oh give me a frigging break will you
look whos talking to me for christs sake
and what was that crap about the dog
if you were any more charming i was going to puke
heavens boy wasnt that precisely the point
i used the evening to our advantage our advantage
certainly now they will offer no objections if you continue to come over and read to me
you sure take a lot for granted
do you think theres anybody forcing me to come over to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up booze all day
lower your voice
people will hear
no nobody forces you to come
in fact you are welcome to stay away
believe me boy i have no scruples about drinking alone
none at all
they start walking again
dussander turns up his driveway
you know if they found out what you are theyd spit on you
i am sure they would have nothing but revulsion for me
but what would they say about you boy when i told them you had known about me for nine months
and said nothing
dussander unlocks his door and steps in
come and see me if you please and stay home if you dont
good night boy
he closes the door
todd places a brightly wrapped christmas present on the table in front of dussander who looks at it skeptically
go ahead open it
wait i better pull down the shades first
just to be safe
getting up to hell with this
you open it
oh relax old man
sit down and open it
todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of coke
dussander slowly sits back down
you wrapped it yourself i see
he begins to remove the bow and then the paper
he moves very cautiously as if the package might explode at any moment
finally he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one of fear to one of exasperation
we see that the box contains a replica of an officers s
uniform complete with hat and jackboots
dussander reads the label
petes quality costume clothiers serving you since
go ahead try it on
are you out of your mind boy
what makes you think i would put something like that on
i thought youd like it like it
my god youre a bigger fool than i thought
maybe ill put it on and do a little shopping downtown
is that what you thought
you stupid boy
dont call me stupid
you know you are correct
am the stupid one
for months i have suffered your indignities
i have exposed my past to you while watching you stuff your face with those wretched hamburgers
i have stocked my refrigerator with coca cola and ding dongs
all for you i have done these things and im tired of it
but because i value my life and my freedom whats left of it anyway i do them
but ill die before i put this thing on you fucking piss ant
you dont get to talk to me like that
dussander bangs the table
i should smash you
what youve suffered with me is nothing compared to what the israelis would do to you
remember what happened to eichmann
you forget that i think
and you know thats my fault
i have let you forget
you have gotten comfortable with this situation
well dont you for one minute ever forget who holds the cards here
dont you ever forget that envelope under my mattress
i tried to do this the nice way i tried to do something to please you but you dont want it
so fine well do it the hard way
you will put this on because i want to see you in it
i hope you go to hell it is five minutes later
dussander stands in the uniform
he looks at it indignantly
the insignia is all wrong
the boots should be leather not imitation
that suit cost me over eighty bucks
with the boots
and this material
straighten that hat
dussander ignores him
straighten that hat soldier
good gott dussander does what he is told
slowly dussander straightens up
dussander begins to move his feet in place
dussander has gotten into a rhythm marching faster in place
dussander spins sharply on his heels
he continues to march
dussander is stomping in place vigorously
he spins on command facing todd
he gives a nazi salute
todd watches him march for a moment
at first he enjoys the domination but as dussander gets caught up in the marching todds expression changes
okay thats enough
dussander is still marching furiously
i said thats enough
suddenly dussander stops
he collapses into a chair exhausted
he sits there panting for a moment
you play with fire
dussander wakes to a strange faint rumble
he climbs out of bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound
we follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed
soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his room
yet he is still in darkness as if his room has suddenly ended and continues into a black void
but the rumble gets louder more mechanical sounding
as the sound crescendoes we see what dussander sees
a train car
steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a complete stop in the night
dussander stares at the boxcar coldly and we realize that something is staring back at him
eyes dozens of them glare back at him from between the slatted boards of the train
some are low to the flooe like those of children
others are higher
dussander snaps at them in german
in german come out
come out now
no one exits the train
yet the eyes seem to move around cautiously within the boxcar
dussander is getting angry
his orders arent being carried out
suddenly the door of the train slides open
but still only the eyes are visible
in german line up in front of the train
again no one gets off
enraged dussander takes a few steps toward the train
in a flash the eyes charge at him
but these are not the eyes of prisoners
these are wolves
dussander can only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend upon him
dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat
his pajamas are soaked
disoriented and out of breath he climbs out of bed and clicks on the light
he stares at the closed closet door for a moment and then moves toward it slowly
he opens the door and runs his fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets
his hand stops near the back
dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette
he is dressed with the exception of the boots and hat in the ss uniform
he appears calmer less agitated
he crunches out the cigarette and slips under the covers
he turns off the light
he closes his eyes
for the moment he is at peace
todd stands facing his open locker
he is staring at his report card
sweat collects on his forehead
he looks like he is about to explode
he wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns around to see if anyone notices him
two students catch his eye
they are both asian
they are smiling and pouring over each others report cards
todd zips open his backpack giving us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside
he throws the report card in and zips up the bag
slinging the bag over his shoulder he slams the locker shut and heads off down the hall
todd is shooting baskets with joey
it is after school
todd wears a white t shirt
off to the side we see the dress shirt he was wearing earlier and his school bag
so what are you going to do
fuck if i know
todd throws up a clumsy shot
youre throwing it flat
let it roll off your fingers more
snapping at him i dont need a lesson
todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway
he shoots again
your dad man
i dont know
i mean im a fuck up
my dad is used to this crap from me
todd does not respond to his friends attempt at humor
he is slamming the ball around with great force
he bounces it hard off the back wall to give himself a rebound
he is mumbling to himself
you said something
youre talking to yourself bowden
its not the first time ive noticed it
what is going on with you
i fucked up
iii fix it
iii fix it
hurt all right man
whatever you say
look i got to get to practice
no response from todd
if you need to talk you can call me
you know that
iii see you around
joey walks off
todd continues shooting the ball
mumbling youre talking to yourself bowden
youre talking to yourself bowden
he throws up a shot
it is good
iii fix it
iii fix it
a strange squawking sound is heard
todd doesnt hear it at first but as the sound grows louder todd stops the ball and looks around
his eyes focus on the area near an open doorway
sunlight streams into the empty gym
todd walks closer seeing that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled in from outside
he goes up to it
the bird is black
its wing is damaged
it squawks loudly looking up at todd
todd begins mumbling again
he starts to dribble the ball thoughtlessly
as his words become clearer the bouncing gets harder
ill fix it
ill fix it
ill fix it
todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him
the bird continues to scream
slowly the ball drifts from beside todd to in front of him gaining force with every bounce
he brings it up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his might
when it comes back up it is smeared with blood
he throws it down again this time it comes up with feathers smeared in the blood
the squawking has stopped
blood splatters on todds shirt
his eyes close
he stops the ball looks around
no one has seen him
he notices his shirt
calmly he tears it off wraps the ball in it and tosses it in a nearby trash can
todd pedals his bike through town carrying a brown paper bag under one arm
he turns down dussanders street
he stops in front of the house and heads for the front door
dussander emerges from the basement just as todd comes into the kitchen
todd sniffs the air frowns
what the fuck happened in here
i burned my tv dinner im afraid
somethings come up
dussanders studies todd for a moment
although todd appears calm his tone reflects a somber business like attitude
sits at table what seems to be the trouble
todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table
dussander picks up the grade card and examines it
quarterly progress report
he reads silently you seem to have fallen on the rocks my boy
one b three cs and a d
hardly the work of a national merit scholar or whatever you call yourself
this isnt a joke dussander
i cant blame this on teachers or honors classes anymore
looks like you have a problem then
i have a problem
you still dont get it
im out of excuses
do you know whats going to happen when my dad sees that
hes going to hit the fucking roof
hell get it all out of me
the truth you
boy its not my fault your grades have fallen
dont be so sure
dussander throws todd a dismissive wave
he gets up to get a drink please you dont spend that much time here
i hardly think quickly as if confessing something i cant study anymore
dussander looks at him oddly a bit surprised
but then opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass allowing todd to continue
with difficulty i try
i sit in front of my books and start thinking about
about corpses and electrified fences and people getting strangled with piano wire
all that crap you tell me
the next thing i know its after midnight
i sit in class like a zombie
but thats not the half of it
check out the letter
dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope
he opens it
reading letter dear mr
bowden this note is to suggest that we have a group conference concerning todds first semester grades
in light of his previous good work in this school the sudden deterioration in his grades suggest a specific problem which should be addressed before his academic advancement is jeopardized
such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion
i am ready to work out a time for us to meet
in a case such as this earlier is usually better
sincerely yours edward french
who is this edward french the headmaster
hes a stupid guidance counselor
what is that
he guides and he counsels
you read the fucking note
do you realize i could have to go to summer school
me in there with all those fuck ups
i do not want to go to summer school
or to the reformatory
what did you say
you have a far greater problem than your school grades before you speak to me about what they will get out of you remember the facts
seventy thousand people died at patin
have you forgotten that
to the world at large i am the most despicable of criminals a monster
do you think i would stand aside and let you turn me in so easily
without a fight
is your american self confidence so bloated that you have never once realized you are an accessory to my crimes
you have criminal knowledge of an illegal alien and have not reported it
dont you see that
and if im caught i will tell the world all about you
when the reporters put their microphones in my face it will be your name ill repeat over and over again
todd bowden yes thats his name
oh for months almost a year
he wanted to know everything
thats how he put it yes everything theyd never believe you
perhaps perhaps not
its a gamble
how would you explain all those books you were reading to me
my eyes are not what they were but i can still read fine print
i can prove it
id say you tricked me
why would i do that
for friendship because youre lonely and had no one in your life
no jury would take your word over mine
just get it out of your head
you cant threaten me and you cant scare me
what you can do is find me a pencil
a pencil what for
todd sets the small paper bag on the table
dussander opens it and removes a small bottle
the label reads ink eradicator
he also removes an x acto knife and a few sheets of rub off letters
that will take care of the report card i think
about that fucking letter i dont know
todd sits down at the table
he takes the bottle from dussander and examines the report card
come on a pencil
a sharp one
with an eraser
he knows todd is right
slowly he goes to the counter and opens a drawer
he rummages through it as todd sits with his back to him
dussander picks out a pencil with an extremely sharp point
he holds it point out and approaches todd
he gets closer the point moves in toward the back of todds head
he holds the point inches from the boys neck
will this do
todd grabs the pencil
dussander turns toward the window
he thinks for a moment
tell me does this french know your parents in a social way
they wouldnt mix with a geek like him
how about professionally
has he ever called them before
ive never needed it
i have an idea
it will require you to make one phone call
kurt dussander a
arthur denker a
victor bowden todds grandfather sits outside an office marked edward french guidance
dussander looks the best he has ever looked
his hair is clean and combed
his face is shaved
and he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit
as he waits he glances down at a piece of paper
we see that it is a crib sheet of todds family tree
several names appear on the sheet connected to other names by lines and arrows
by each name is one or two word description such as dead cancer or divorced dallas tex
the door opens up
dussander pockets the note
edward french s stands in the doorway
he wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat
french a pleasure
there is a bit of hesitation on frenchs part but they shake hands
dussander notices the shoes on frenchs feet bright red converse high tops
my those are some
french makes his way around his desk
dussander stands by the door
to you sir im sure they seem quite out of the ordinary
but when it is your job to get confused sixteen year olds to open up to you you take whatever steps you need
please have a seat
they both sit
and the shoes work
they seem to help believe it or not
well i thank you for coming down mr
bowden but ill be frank with you
yes please do
the fact that youre here and not todds parents tells me a great deal
my son and his wife asked me to come in and discuss this sorry business with you mr
todd is a good boy believe me
this trouble with his grades is only temporary
dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then thinking twice puts them back
its all right
pulls an ashtray from desk drawer theres no smoking on school grounds but if it will make you more comfortable ill never tell
a terrible habit but thank you
lights up i suppose i should begin by informing you that my son and my daughter in law are having troubles at home
rather bad troubles i should think
i appreciate your candor
leaning in the mother drinks
the boy has told me that he has come home on two occasions and has found her sprawled out on the kitchen table
he knows how my son feels about her drinking and so on these occasions he has put dinner in the oven himself and forced enough black coffee down his mothers
throat so that she will at least be awake when richard gets home
bowden thought about getting professional help for her problem
the boy has tried to persuade her but she is far too ashamed i think
if she was given a little time
he is not without blame believe me
the hours he works
the meals he has missed
they take a toll on a family
i was raised to believe that a mans family came before his work or anything else
i tried to teach my son that
but theres only so much we can teach our kids mr
what about monicas mother or father
couldnt they talk to her
her mother sabrina lives in a nursing home in florida
im afraid after her husband died she lost her will to live
probably not the best person for monica to speak to
bowden i dont have to remind you im sure of todds stellar academic record
national merit scholar finalist academic all stars
i keep his certificates on the wall of my store
i run a small bookstore in san remo
a hint of skepticism crosses frenchs eyes
glancing at folder on desk yes i see that
anyway todd is and i hate to phrase it this way but hes one of the ones worth fighting for
hes a special kid we both know that
but if todds grades dont improve drastically and quickly
hell be opening a real nasty can of worms
summer school would just be the beginning
his whole college acceptance schedule would be thrown way off course
the good schools wont know what to make of him
im sure hed hate that and so would you
so lets get to the bottom line shall we
what im proposing is some family counselling at the counselling center downtown
everything is in confidence of course
a man in charge down there harry shumacher is a good friend of mine
i think todd and his parents should go see him together
it might be difficult for todd to go to his parents with this i think you should do it
maybe we can get everybody on track by the end of the next quarter
it will be tough but not impossible
im not sure that would be the best thing for the boy
the parents might resent him if i took them that proposal right now
things are very delicate
to swing the scale too far in the wrong direction might cause more harm than good
the boy has promised to work harder in his studies
he is most concerned by the drop in his grades more alarmed than you might expect
he has his mind set on attending stanford or berkeley next fall and does not wish to see his plans altered
yes well also the parents would resent me
monica already thinks i meddle too much in her affairs
i have a great deal of experience in these matters mr
and please understand that my interest in your sons marital problems begins and ends with the effect they are having on todd
and right now i think they are having quite an effect
i really think counselling is in order here
allow me to make a counter proposal
you have i believe a system for warning parents of poor grades
yes interpretation of progress cards
the kids call them flunk card
they only get them when their grades in a class fall below the seventy percent
that means a d or an f
and they are sent out when
thats about three weeks into the new marking period
allowing for christmas break the next time they are sent out will be in late january correct
yes thats right
then what i suggest is this
dussander still wears the blue suit
the tie has been loosened and top button undone
todd still wears his backpack
i told him you were getting back on track by your own accord
i gave him my word
if you get even one flunk card are you out of your fucking mind
im going to get three or four flunk cards
i failed an economics test today so theres another one
boy it was the best i could do without arousing suspicion
i could have done better myself well you didnt did you
this is the way it is and now you are upset because the only way you can make things right is to work
im upset because it cant be done
and it will
you will work
i dont take orders from you
maybe youve forgotten turning on him listen boy
before today it was possible just barely possible that you could have denounced me and come out clean yourself
the way your nerves have been lately i dont think so but never mind that
it was at least technically possible
but now things have changed
today i impersonated your grandfather one victor bowden
and it was you who arranged the meeting
what would people make of that
if things come out now
perhaps you were right your age and a good attorney might keep you out of jail but you would be humiliated boy publicly
you would be infamous
your parents too
do you know what such a scandal would do to them
think about that
todd is stunned
he turns away then back again struggling for the right words
its a done deal boy
if you dont like it you can discuss it at family counselling
i wish never mind your wishes
your wishes make me sick
all i want to hear is that you understand the situation
todd is furious
he sees there is no other way but continues fighting
look you gotta believe me
there is no way in hell that i can pull myself out of a half year slide in a couple of weeks
i wish i could but were just going to have to think of something else
boy the time for discussion is over
this is the way it is
you are going to work
and i am going to be right here with you
what are you talking about
todd is standing with his bike on a dirt path
he is looking out at something
the wind blows throw his hair
a distant glimpse of some buildings off to the side tell us he is on a hill
you are going to spend the rest of this quarter all of your vacation and the first three weeks of january studying
during your free period you will study
during lunch you will study
and after school and on weekends you will come here and do the same
todd pedals his bike furiously toward the camera
he approaches a tunnel lined with corrugated metal below an overpass
not here at home
at home you will dawdle you will talk on the telephone watch tv
here i can make sure that nothing distracts you from your studies
todd emerges from the tunnel
spotlights like those from a guard tower criss cross over a small compound surrounded by an electrified fence
inside the pen wolf like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth
the spotlight catches the source of their aggravation
dussander caught ghoulishly in the roving light stands in uniform outside the pen
he is laughing
in his hand is his luger
he fires through the fence killing one of the dogs
they go wild
he laughs harder
he shoots again and then again
it is like shooting fish in a barrel
the light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have transformed into human prisoners
they maneuver helplessly to avoid dussanders bullets
but he fires faster his laugh growing more extreme
his movements in between shots becomes a sort of dance
one prisoner flies against the fence in a pools of sparks
as dussanders waltz reaches its climax one prisoner remains in the pen
he looks up
it is todd
angle on dussanders toothy grin
the gun comes up
dussander wakes up
a clanking sound echoes from the street
dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex dream but he turns his head toward the direction of the street
he clicks on the light
dressed in the ss uniform he gets up and moves toward the window
through the window bathed in the glow of a street lamp a derelict who we will come to know as archie rummages through dussanders trashcans
under his arm are a few of the empty bourbon bottles
the car pulls into the driveway of todds house
becky is smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window
they both look a little tipsy as if they have been to a party
she holds the joint up to todd
he contemplates then takes it
todds first toke of marijuana isnt very small
becky looks on surprised
she reaches out for the joint and todd waves her off
he pulls again this time ingesting a huge hit
he holds it then exhales
he gives the roach back to becky
their light is still on
ill get out on your side
dont say anything
becky gets out
todd slides over and does the same
she crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her purse
dussander watches archie collect the cans and bottles
there is something about archie that makes dussander wonder if he has seen him before
archie looks up right into dussanders window as if he were expecting him to be there
the two stare at one another for a long moment
suddenly dussander is aware that he is dressed in the ss uniform
he quickly steps back from the window
his breathing is short and erratic as he waits in the shadows for archie to finish
after a long moment the noise from the street stops
we hear only the faint steps of archie walking away
todd and beckys lips are locked in a passionate kiss
in their exuberance they fall onto the bed
as they try to undress and kiss at the same time becky begins to moan
todd brings his fingers to his lips
their clothes tumble off around them
he slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed
he pulls out a condom
by now she is naked
todd slips out of his underwear and falls on top of her
the radio plays in the b
as todd begins to grind away with his hips
she moans softly with delight
the camera moves off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat setting up a volt meter
this is one of the scientists from todds laboratory nightmare
the camera continues to pan across the bedroom showing the other scientists preparing for the electricity experiment
the camera stops on dussander clipboard in hand observing everything carefully
todd releases with a final thrust
becky is moaning in a series of high fast yelps
todd lies still on her body
becky is speechless still quivering from the unusually intense love making
the bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette
dussander is in bed wide awake
todd sits alone at the table eating while he studies
dussander crosses the frame behind him drink in hand
todd is noticeably annoyed by dussanders presence
it is raining
todd is riding fast
he wears a raincoat with the hood up
he talks to himself loudly but we cant make out what he is saying
he enters the tunnel
the muddy run off inside the tunnel catches todd by surprise
he loses control of the bike and falls into the mud
todd gets up and tries to free his bike but the mud and water do not make the job easy
he is almost finished when a gruff voice catches his attention
hey kid you having some trouble
todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows of the tunnel
todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife
he flicks open the blade and hides it behind his leg
i got it
the figure steps closer
the light catches his face to reveal archie
he is an unshaven filthy mess and when he speaks his words are slurred from years of steady drinking
that case maybe you could loan me a dollar
help out a vietnam vet
how bout it
todd eyes the man cautiously
he looks around
no one is nearby
the constant din of the rain echoes within the confines of the tunnel
i dont know
i dont think so
todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum
cmon you got something for me
i know you do
i have to check
todds hands go into his pockets
he stops a few feet from the bum
see i got to get up to l
got a job waiting for me up there
todd moves closer
close enough to touch the bum
i thought i did have a couple of quarters
the bum looks at him hopefully
todd looks back at him sizing him up really noticing him for the first time
you know his voice drops for a dollar ill give you a blow job
take you right up there where its still dry
you never had so good kid
youll come your brains out
todd freezes for a moment
the bum is right in his face
suddenly todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints back to his bike
he hops on and is gone in a flash leaving the bum there to pick up the scattered coins
as todd zips away the hood is off his head
the rain begins to beat away the splattered mud from his face
proxmire makes his way through the rows of desks
he is passing out papers
our illustrious administration in its quest to make my job as difficult as possible has decided that home room teachers are now responsible for handing iop cards for all your
so for those of you getting flunk cards youll find them attached to last weeks exam
moans erupt from the class
todd sits motionless at his desk
the moment of truth
proxmire passes him and places the exam face down on todds desk
todd hesitates before turning it over
he is sweating
he flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to the top of the paper
he picks up the card and reads it im sure glad i didnt have to give you one of these for real
great improvement todd
todd cannot contain his delight
nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy beaming over his flunk card
dussander sits at the table
he holds the iop card out at arms length to read it
the bourbon bottle next to him is empty
todd sits across from him
well this calls for a celebration no
dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator
look i guess i owe a lot of this to you
im not proud of it but its true
eyeing him cautiously your gratitude humbles me
pause how about some ritz crackers and velveeta
sure what the hell
dussander goes about his task taking items from the cabinets etc
todd watches all of this intently but without expression
i would have expected you to be doing back flips down the hallway after such good news
you are so quiet
todd does not respond
today i think i give you the day off from studying
how about one of my stories instead
i still have a few good ones saved up
i dont care
whatever you want
todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table
dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to the counter
i could tell you about the special soap we made
or there is always the story of how i escaped from berlin after i was foolish enough to go back
that was a close one i promise you
no none of these i think
you dont seem to be in the mood
dussander slices open a pack of velveeta and puts it on a plate
i think today i will tell you the story of an old man who was afraid
he was afraid of a certain young boy who was in a queer way his friend
the boy proved to be a very good student but perhaps not in the way his mother or his teachers had envisioned
at first the old man disliked the boy intensely but then he grew to
to enjoy the boys company
of course there was still a great deal of distrust between them
he puts a glass of coke in front of todd and goes back to the counter
he opens a drawer takes something out closes it
each knew something that other wanted to keep secret
but over time the old man began to feel that things were changing
he felt his hold on the boy slipping away from him
dussander goes to the cellar door
his back is to todd
he opens the door and clicks on the light
todd stands up silently
one sleepless night the old man got out of bed and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy
everything he could remember from the first day forward
todd has moved across the floor careful not to let the floor creak under his steps
he is right upon dussander
dussander reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle grasping onto the railing with the other
his body hangs over the steep staircase
when he finished his hand was stinging from arthritis but he felt good for the first time in weeks
he felt safe
he gets his balance again and turns to face todd
dussander holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side where todd can see it
a tense silence passes between them
todd is frozen
dussander steps past him and back into the kitchen
he closes the cellar door behind him
he climbed back into bed and slept until it was time for general hospital
dussander sits back in his chair cutting the seal on the fresh bottle
on the following day the old man put on his best suit and went down to one of the local banks and rented a safety deposit box
the bank officer explained to the old man that he would have a key and the bank would have a key
to open the box both keys would be needed
no one but the old man could use the old mans key without a signed notarized letter of permission from the old man himself
with one exception
todd sinks into a chair across from dussander and takes a sip of coke
that exception is made in the event of the box holders death
then the box is opened in the presence of a bank official and a representative of the internal revenue service
the contents of the box are inventoried
in this case they will find only a twelve page document
but highly interesting
todd understands what the old man has told him
he slams his glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair
you cant do that
my boy it is already done
look at you
you could go at any time
todd stares at dussander in disbelief
after a moment he storms out the back door to the porch
todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when dussander steps onto the porch
he carries with him the bottle of bourbon and a glass
then there is nothing for me
but there is
as the years go by as i get closer to the grave your hold on me will become worth less and less
a man five ten years older than i worries more about his ailing heart than being extradited to israel
and there will come a day if i live long enough when i decide what you know no longer matters
then and only then i will destroy my document
but so many things can happen to you in between
you could slip in the shower for christs sake
dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette
he begins to sing softly then gets caught up in the song
todd turns away angry
que sera sera
whatever will be will be
the futures not ours to see
que sera sera
dussander sees he has pressed todds button
he moves closer
my dear boy i see you thinking about it even now
it is in your eyes
it would take only a flick of a knife
or maybe push me down the steps make it look like an accident
i am old
you are strong
you are angry
good assets for killing
but there is something missing
dussander speaks with a near whisper in todds ear
to have some one in your control
to have them know that they are alive because you have not decided to the contrary
do you have that power
it is no easy question
i think you know that
there is a long pregnant pause
then todd lets out a sigh as if to dismiss what he has just heard
he turns to face dussander
you know this means were through
you wont be seeing me around here anymore
no i suppose i wont
im never coming here again
and so it comes to an end
dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boys glass
what are you doing
to our lives together the beginning
and the end
todd picks up his glass
i think you should fuck yourself
he clicks his glass against dussanders
my boy dont you see that we are fucking each other
todd reluctantly does the same
dussander dressed smartly for a day out of the house emerges from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the sidewalk the umbrella under his arm
he stops at an empty bench and sits to wait for the bus
archie sits down next to him
at first dussander doesnt pay attention to him but archies behavior tells us that he is keenly aware of dussanders presence
dussander stares out into the street but archie fidgets about his eyes roaming and finally slides a little closer to dussander
dussander looks at him flatly
dussander turns away prepared to dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict
then archie speaks
leaning over i notice the kid dont come around no more
dussander doesnt respond
he catches archie in a glance and sees that he is staring at him
little blond hair boy
whats the matter you aint his friend no more
dussander is like stone flashing the eyes of a man who is not to be harassed
you mistake me for somebody else
pardon me my bus is coming
dussander stands slightly rattled only to those who know him well
he looks down the street for the bus
archie doesnt move
rather he inspects dussander from head to toe stopping on the shoes
cuban high heels
nice ones too
the squeal of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in front of dussander
he has become perceptibly more nervous as he waits for the passengers to exit
he climbs up the first step
i aint seen a pair like that since i was in havana
talking louder because of the bus thats the only place you can getem
cant getem exported
government dont let you
the door closes behind dussander
the bus pulls away
through the window of the bus dussander watches archie as he continues his speech to no one
todd sits nervously in a chair next to a tough leather clad trouble maker
a secretary sits behind a long desk
her phone beeps and she picks it up
go in todd
theyre waiting for you
todd approaches a door marked dr
he goes in
todd opens the office door
as his eyes scan the floor he notices a familiar pair of yellow high tops
he looks up to see ed french leaning against the wall
seated at the desk is morgan a thin stern man around
todds face shows a moment of trepidation but he regains his composure almost instantly
have a seat todd
todd does as morgan pours over todds files
i see from your record and from what mr
french tells me that after a minor slip up last semester youre right back on course
straight as for the quarter so far
and i hear your little slip didnt bother the folks up at stanford too much either
a good break for you todd
looks like that little talk with your
looks at file grandfather
well we dont want to keep you too long
to french you tell him
well it seems sally chong didnt do to well in a
she failed it
im afraid so
she refused to take part in the fetal pig dissection
the teacher begged her to drop the class but sally thought she could pass anyway
what were telling you son is that because sally chang chong
because sally chong wouldnt hack up a baby pig you snuck by her in the rankings
so if you can keep your grades up for two more months any reason that shouldnt happen
then youll make valedictorian todd
french shakes todds hand an uneasy moment passes between the two of them
todd comes out of morgans office
french follows him
todd you really should be proud of yourself
to tell you the truth im amazed you pulled it off
thanks i guess
he starts to walk away
i was glad to hear you made varsity baseball
i spoke to the coach
he says your coming along real well
its turning out to be a good year for you
he turns to go but french stops him again
he steps up to todd and lowers his voice as if he were hedging a touchy subject
todd youve got a lot of good things going on right now
you should be enjoying yourself
frenchs looks says no youre not
how are things at home
todd realizes he is not going to get out of this easily
look things with my parents were bad for a while
but theyre doing a lot better
thanks for your concern really
i should get back to class
he is pulling away from french as he speaks
unconvinced okay todd
i know this isnt the place to talk about this
but my door is always open
todd walks away
and its going to stay open
but todd does not turn around
french stares after him
the bell rings and todd is swallowed by the stream of students emerging from the class rooms
todd is kneeling down at the bike rack
his backpack is on the ground next to him
he unlocks his bike and begins to coil the chain around his wrist when joey walks by
he sees todd and considers going by but stops
we can tell they havent spoken in a while
todd looks up
he seems pleasant but there is little warmth in his voice
they look at each other
joey wants to talk
todd slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack
joey jingles his car keys anxiously
ah i heard about stanford
i heard a couple of weeks ago actually
i got into school to
its no stanford but
its an awkward moment
he walks closer
thats good joe
i just wanted to say hi
here let me get that
joey reaches for todds backpack
he lifts it
the heaviness puzzles him
todd takes it from him
what do you have in there
todd stares at him stone faced
joey doesnt like todds expression
todd takes the bag from him and puts it on
you busy now
come with me
i have a car now todd
you cant drive where were going
joey sits on the handle bars as todd pedals over the rugged terrain
joy looks scared but appears to be enjoying the ride and the chance to be with his old friend
the next shot shows todds bike laying on the ground
the wheels still turn slowly
the camera moves to reveal todd and joey standing on a rocky ledge
orange country sprawls out before them
under the cross hairs of a telescopic sight a truck from the freeway below zooms out of frame
the image vanishes
we see joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand
this is so cool
point it over here
thats the middle school
you can see right into our old class room
but i still dont see what you need the rest of it for
doesnt your dad notice
the hunting rifle disassembled sticks out of todds backpack on the ground
he hasnt yet
he is trying to joke but the seriousness is clearly in his voice
and over here thats your dads office
and theres the old drive in
joey isnt looking through the scope anymore
he holds it out to todd watching him
todd grabs the scope
but joey doesnt let go
he finally locks todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months
he wants to say something
todd takes the scope
he sees that joey is serious
he takes a few steps toward the edge toward the gun
he looks out
its such a rush you know
to be up here
dont you feel it
so high above them they never know were here
its like an ant farm
were the gods on mt
they cant see us they cant hear us but every so often we can make them feel us
just so they never forget
he looks through the scope at the freeway
he picks out passing cars
there goes a future track star
there goes a judge
a mom and her two kids
that ones a school teacher that ones a drug dealer
you see joey it doesnt matter
it doesnt matter how smart you are or how many grades you skip
theres always someone who can take it all away
the right person snaps their fingers
and its done
joey takes a few steps backward
todd doesnt notice
todd im gonna go
todd turns his head toward joey but it is as though no one is there
he looks away again
todd looks again
but this time joey is really gone
a slight chuckle escapes todds mouth
dussander plods down the sidewalk with his sacks of groceries
he is a little more winded moves a little slower than previously
suddenly archie emerges from behind a group of trees
he moves quickly up to dussander catching him off guard
i can do that
i can help you carry those
dussander jumps back
you dont gotta be afraid
i can carry those
dussander does not move
but slowly his face changes and we realize that he remembers archie from the bus stop
i dont need any help
he starts off again
hey i aint a bad guy
you dont gotta worry
im a veteran
i just want snapping at him what
what do you want
why do you bother me
archie is taken aback by the sudden viciousness
plaintively you got a nice face
no i dont
look were practically neighbors
i stay right over there most nights
pointing across the street i see you walking down the street
i come up to help
its called being neighborly they are nearing dussanders yard
fed up with his belligerence archie strips the bags from dussanders hands with ease
dussander knows he is outmatched
aint no reason to be rude
you see i know something about you
i know your a nice guy
im nice too
just like the kid
dussander looks up and down the street
no one is around
and i know you got some bourbon in these bags
i aint ashamed to say i could use a drink about now
but i dont need no charity
if you want to invite me in like a friend we could have a nice drink
thats what im saying
you smell like a toilet
maybe you let me use your shower
but first a drink
after that ill do anything you say
dussander and archie come through the front door
archie scans the room
yeah this is nice
let me take those
takes the bags right this way
dussander moves toward the kitchen
archie watches him walk away
a smile crosses his face as he follows him to the kitchen
todd and his parents are together in the living room
todd is studying for his trigonometry final
monica sits at the couch addressing graduation announcements
dick is at his desk pouring over a pile of receipts
i guess your parents dont need a graduation announcement
grandma and grandpa arent coming
to dick i thought you told him
christ i forgot
todd my aunt patty dads sister died on wednesday
mom and dad have to drive up to fresno to settle her estate
we cant ask dad to drive six hours each way for graduation
if we ask them theyll do it
you understand dont you todd
todd thinks for a moment realizes something
of course dad
its all right
tell grandpa ill spend the week with him and grandma when they get back
what about mr
i almost forgot about him
no he wont want to come
archie seated at the table with his back to dussander is in the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which dussander half listens
dussander goes to the cabinets and takes out two glasses
he pours the drinks and sets the glasses on the table
archie picks his up and is about to drink
dussander picks up his glass to toast archie
archie clinks his glass to dussanders and downs the shot
i believe we need another bottle my friend
well if youre offering im accepting
dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle
no trouble at all
now where is my bottle opener
ah here it is
dussander pulls something out of a drawer
he goes to the table and stands right behind archie
why dont you drink mine
archie picks up the glass and begins to drink slower this time
dussander pulls archies tattered hat off his head and sets it on the table
he then begins to stroke the matted knots of archies hair
you dont mind do you
i dont mind
maybe in the morning everything goes okay you could let me have ten dollars
maybe even twenty
we shall see
you can relax you know ive done this before
its all right
so have i
dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of archies neck
he starts to plunge it in just as archie turns back to look at him
the fork goes in crooked
archie explodes from the chair howling his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear
with the fork protruding from his back archie tosses the table to the side
the empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor and shatters
archie spins and slams a fist into dussanders temple
dussander collapses against the counter
archie moves about wildly trying to grab the fork and pummel dussander at the same time
blood is streaming freely from his wound
dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the counter
as archie approaches dussander swings the pan into archies descending fist
archie winces and staggers backward
he stomps down on the broken bottle and screams
his guard falls briefly
dussander is upon him
he swings the pan catching archie squarely in the face
archie brings his hands up to his face which now oozes with blood
blinded by the blow archie charges dussander who crouches to the side and as archie passes hurls himself into the mans back sending him through the open door of the
archie flies down the stairs face first tumbling into the packed dirt floor like a derailed train
dussander exhausted and bloodied exhales deeply
looking down at the crumpled body below he straightens his tie brushes the hair from his face and then surveys the kitchen
what a mess
he rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the steps to finish the bum for good
after about three steps he stops abruptly
he appears puzzled but after a moment the expression changes
a look of searing pain rushes across his face
dussander brings his hand to his chest
he collapses on the stairs
he is having a heart attack and knows it
oh my god
he looks down at archie up to the kitchen then back down to the cellar
a moment of decision
the stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they did a minute ago
getting to his feet he turns slowly toward the kitchen
he starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace counting with each step
the same scene as before
how long did we rent those jet skis in hawaii
about two hours
this receipt says we had two jet skis for twenty three hours a piece
the bill is fifteen hundred dollars
didnt you look at the receipt before you signed it
todd doesnt look up from his textbook
way to go mom
that bill was written in japanese
i told you that
numbers are numbers monica in any language
that guy didnt speak a word of english
i told you not to rent from him
the phone rings
monica gets up to get it
ill get it
thats not the point
you should always read the bill before you sign
ive told you that a hundred times
to todd fifteen hundred dollars
maybe its in yen
dick looks at the bill
hey maybe youre right
monica comes back into the room
todd its mr
he sounds excited about something
you better speak to him
todd rises from the couch
his mood shifts instantly
into phone mr
intercut between todd in his living room and
dussander leaning against a wall in his blood stained kitchen
the wall above dussander read
come over right away boy
im having a heart attack a bad one i think
gee that sounds exciting mr
denker but i was studying for my trig final i understand that you cannot talk but you can listen
i cannot call
at least not yet
there is quite a mess here
i need help
and that means you need help
well if you put it that way tell your parents ive had a letter an important letter and i need you to read it to me
ill be right there
now we see what you are made of boy
dussander hangs up the phone and falls into a chair
hangs up ive got to run over to mr
denkers for a minute
is everything all right
oh he just got a letter from a nephew in hamburg or dusseldorf or one of those places
i thought his family was killed in the war
todd zips up his jacket
so did he
thats why he sounded excited
i shouldnt be too long
ill take your car mom
i dont know you have a final tomorrow
i know i was almost finished studying anyway
dont be gone too long todd
see you in a bit
he kisses monica on the cheek
he is out the front door
todds driving reflects his state of mind erratic and out of control
he meets a police car at an intersection and almost runs a red light
the police car doesnt bother him however and a moment later he pulls the honda up to dussanders house
todd appears in the door of the kitchen
his face tells us that what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected
the room is a gruesome sight
blood and broken glass are everywhere
the table has been knocked to the side
dussander barely conscious slumps in a chair
what the fuck
todd moves to the center of the room careful not to step in any blood
he doesnt know what to do
his attention falls on dussander
suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his body carefully
where are you bleeding
dussander does not respond
todd shakes him harder
wake up goddamnit
dussander stirs a little aggravated
i thought you said you had a fucking heart attack
its not my blood for christs sake
what did you say
it was self defense boy
youll see what needs to be done
dussander points to the open cellar door
im not going down there
what did you do
dussander only stares back at him then looks away almost smiling through his incredible pain as if to challenge todd
what the hell is this
dussander does not respond
todd stares at him for a moment then moves toward the cellar
todd is half way down the stairs when he freezes
sprawled out on the ground below him is archie motionless
the meat fork still protrudes from his neck like an antenna
jesus fucking christ
suddenly dussander is more awake than we realize
when he hears todd discover the body he slides his chair over to the cellar door and slams it shut
his face is red with pain as he pushes the dead bolt into place locking todd in the cellar
todd races up to the door
he tries the handle and then pounds on the door with his fist
the following conversation cuts back between todd and dussander on opposite sides of the door
open the fucking door
dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob
he drags the table against the door as he speaks
todd is screaming on the other side and begins to kick at the door violently
you give me no choice boy
what are you doing
open the door
if you wont help me then ill make you help me
if you dont we are finished
fuck you old man
this is your problem
i didnt do this
open the door
todd pounds awayat the door
tears now stream down his cheeks
his relentless pounding has dussander enraged
dussander pounds back at the door to shut todd up
if you dont stop screaming like a fucking school girl im going to
a surge of pain from his chest silences him
he recovers speaking slowly and deliberately
now listen to me boy very carefully
if you dont help me im going to die here
and if i die there is no stanford for you
there is no scholarship
there is jail
fuck your document
i got nothing to do with this
dont make it sound like i do
i came here i saw this shit and now im getting the fuck out of here
thats what im gonna tell the police
why not tell them the truth
tell them i locked you in the cellar
tell them i wouldnt let you out until you buried the body
im not listening to this
todd runs down the stairs and leaps over archies body
under the dim glow of a single naked bulb hanging from the ceiling he searches for a way out
he crosses the dirt floor toward a tiny window high on the opposite wall
you must be at the window yes
as you can see i had it barred a few years ago
a bad element started to move into the neighborhood you know how it is
todd realizes he cant get through the bars
he turns around to find another option
in the obscured background archie begins to stir
silent and bewildered he feels the area around him and rises slowly to his knees
todd doesnt see him and moves into a dark corner of the cellar rummaging through the piles of cluttered junk for something to help him escape
he disappears for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a shovel a fresh confidence on his face
he holds it like a sledge hammer
we are wasting time now boy
switches to a loud whisper come back to the door
you are not going to find anything down there to help you
to himself oh really
todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from archie when he sees him
todd mortified lets out a scream
this startles archie who cannot speak
he only gurgles a sickening whine the fork still sticks out of his neck
blood drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead
yet even on his knees he is an imposing figure
dussander puzzled by the commotion presses his ear against the door
archie blocks the stairs from todd
get out of the way
but archie is too disoriented to move
summoning all his courage todd pokes the shovel into him as if to prod him out of the way
but when the blade of the shovel touches him archie counters violently grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side
todd holds tightly to the handle an act which sends him flying across the cellar
the shovel stays with archie and now he wields it like it were a childs toy
he slashes it viciously through the air
todd hides under the stairs watching archie duel with the shadows
todd bumps into something
archie hears him
through the slats in the staircase we see archie jabbing the shovel at todd
alarmed dussander reaches for the lock but hesitates forever mindful of the chance of being duped
his ear goes back against the door
what are you doing boy
its not going to work whatever it is
archie pushes the shovel in too far and cant retrieve it
todd grabs the other end and pulls it through
fed up he comes around from under the stairs and confronts archie
archie sees him and takes a step toward him
i mean it get the fuck away from me
archie steps closer
instantly todd tightens his grip on the shovel
he is no longer afraid
he swings the shovel at archies head striking him
archie staggers back stunned but then charges forward
todd strikes him again this time with more force and anger
todd lifts the shovel to strike again but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade
the glass shatters
the room goes black
a second later we hear a sharp authoritative blow followed quickly by another then another
dussander knows something is wrong
he slides the bolt back and slowly turns the handle
he opens the door slightly and speaks into the darkness
a shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar floor revealing archies slain body
an expanding pool of blood seeps out from his head
as the door upstairs opens wider the light falls on todd standing over archie the shovel still in his hands his face spattered with blood
the todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed
he stares up at dussander not with the eyes of a boy but with those of a man
a man who can no longer be saved
quietly dussander moves away from the door leaving todd alone with what he has done
he slides the furniture away from the door knowing as todd does that the two of them are now working together
todds face is suddenly illuminated as he screws a fresh light bulb into the dangling cord
he picks up the shovel
archies body still lies where it fell
todd goes to the open area of the floor and with a forceful stomp plunges the shovel into the dirt
todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack the dirt then smooths the area over to destroy any markings
he is sweaty dirty and tired
but his manner is cool and efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand
he runs upstairs hopping over the bloody spot where archies body used to be
todd bursts through the door
he notices the old man in his chair
dussander doesnt look good
todd levels his eyes at him
his voice snaps with the authority of an s
wheres the fucking pinesol
dussander points to the cabinet under the sink
todd throws the door open and pulls out bottles of cleaner
i need rags
under the stairs
todd checks the clock it is
he gets the bottle and a bucket and goes for the cellar
a series of shots showing todd cleaning up the mess
he is on the stairs sponging up the blood
then we see him skimming the area where the pool of blood was with the shovel
the next shot has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area
then on his knees he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light bulb and drops them into a bucket
in the final shot todd stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar
the shovel has been cleaned and replaced
the floor looks smooth and even
satisfied he goes upstairs
the table has been put back in its spot
todd is in his boxer shorts
a shot of a washing machine somewhere else in the house shows us that todd is cleaning his bloodied clothes
now he is washing the dishes in the sink
the water in the sink is a murky pink
he pulls the meat fork from the suds and holds it up
i ought to run this through your chest you know that
it couldnt hurt more than a heart attack
he looks at the clock
christ my parents are going to freak
stay calm boy
you are doing fine
todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away
for a moment he slows down a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him
dussander sees something is different about him
what are you thinking about
the sound of dussanders voice snaps todd out of his funk
he is all business again
todd is back in his clothes
he wears a white t shirt
he brings a knife up to dussanders neck and slices down his suit still stained by archies blood
your pants are okay
todd takes off dussanders shoes and balls them up in the tattered suit
put this on
he holds up dussanders bathrobe
the old man slips into it with difficulty as todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash bag
dussander looks at todds t shirt
is that my undershirt
the blood and glass have been removed
todd runs a mop over the floor
his job is almost over
sweat pours down his face
the same for dussander
hurry up for gods sake
dont you die on me you old bastard
todd puts the mop away
he surveys the room as before
dussander does the same
there is a strange silence as the two of them look around the room for anything damning
i think were okay
call an ambulance
todd turns to face dussander
he brings his face up to his and speaks softly
what are you talking about
the safety deposit box
i want the key
for gods sake boy
i want the key and i want to know where the bank is
dussander cannot argue
hillcrest savings on domingo avenue
the key is behind the clock on the mantle piece
todd goes straight for the mantle
he moves the clock and finds the key
todd holds a blank piece of paper in front of dussander and hands him a pen
dussander starts to scrawl his name across the paper
at the bottom
neatly with great difficulty dussander does as he is told
todd folds the paper and stuffs it into his pocket with the pen
he picks up the phone and dials
do you need an ambulance
its my friend mr
du todd nearly bites his lip in half
dussander notices the slip and cringes
he had a heart attack
is he conscious
yeah hes awake
im really scared
the address is we have the address here
the ambulance is on the way
it should take about ten minutes
ill stay on the line with you no
i have to call my parents
just send the ambulance he hangs up
it smells too clean in here
todd sees a pack of cigarettes on the table
dussander is not amused
todd lights two cigarettes and lets them burn down in the ashtray
he picks up the phone again and dials
mommy its me
let me talk to dad
what is it
just let me talk to him
hold on todd whats wrong
denker had a heart attack
is he conscious
yeah hes awake
todd call an ambulance
theyre on the way
all right son
dont touch him
ill be there in five minutes
he hangs up
he sits down across from dussander
the old man is near death but through the slit of an eye he watches todd
the stare between them is lethal
for a long moment this continues until
what is it
where is the goddamn letter
i told my parents i came over to read you a letter from germany
yes well say its from willi frankel we need a letter
i told them it was your nephew i think
look in the dresser
second no third drawer
from the top
there is a small wooden box
you will have to break it open
i lost the key
there are letters very old ones
from a friend
all in german
none of them are signed or dated
a page or two will be fine
todd turns to go and stops
are you crazy
i dont read german you numb fuck
why would willi write me in english
if you were to read me the letter in german i would understand even though you would not
your pronunciation would be terrible but i could manage all right
todd dashes out of the room
dicks porsche speeds along the same streets that todd took two hours earlier
todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of the dresser
he yanks on the drawer
it comes half way out and stops
goddamn you come out
the drawer flies out knocking todd back
he digs through it the contents of dussanders fake lives spilling about the room
he finds the box at the bottom
as he expected it is locked
without a moments hesitation he slams the box down on the post of the bed frame
it doesnt open but bits of the frame fly across the room
on the third attempt the tiny box shatters
todd freezes cocks his head
outside he hears the distinct roar and sputter of the porsche engine
he grabs two pages of a letter
there is nothing he can do about the mess in the room
he closes the door on his way back to the kitchen
todd enters the kitchen and places the pages on the table just in time to look up and see dick standing in the kitchen doorway
we hold on dick for a moment as he takes it all in dussander todd and the room
a hint of uncertainty crosses his face
a paramedic straps dussander onto a stretcher
todd is talking to the other one
he started laughing at something in the letter
i dont know what it was its in german
dick sees the letter on the table and picks it up
todd watches him
without much of a thought dick puts the letter back on the table
well well take care of him now
were going to take him to st
its a good thing you called when you did
you saved his life
the medics wheel dussander out
you did real good son
looking around the room as if searching for something you did real good
todd doesnt like dicks apprehension
he grabs his fathers hand and leads him out of the room
lets make sure he gets checked in all right
two orderlies push a gurney through the door
a man in his late thirties david krauss walks with them
a nurse following behind addresses him
he needs to rest now
you can come back tomorrow after ten
david approaches the gurney
lying prone is ben krauss
david kisses him on the forehead
ill be back in the morning with the girls
i cant wait to see them
the orderlies lift ben onto his bed
to ben the doctor will be in to see you in a few minutes
the orderlies the nurse and david leave the room
ben notices his roommate in the next bed
it is dussander who has been watching all of this quietly
my nephew david
dussander smiles politely
his parents died when he was very young
he is like a son to me
i have no children of my own
david is very protective of me
of course i dont mind
i enjoy his company
a few years ago he started working with me at the university
i teach chemistry
my name is ben by the way
a pleasure arthur
what do you do
these tubes in my arm
no one said they would itch like this
you will find in time you dont notice
ben looks oddly at dussander
the wheels of his memory slowly very slowly begin to turn
well well see
looks like ill be here for a while
i didnt want to alarm my nephew just yet but this break in my leg
well well see what the doctor says
yes of course
but for now you must forgive me my medication has made me drowsy
do not be offended if i fall asleep
dont be offended if i keep talking anyway
it beats wondering if im ever going to walk again
i tell you my friend the ways of god are not meant to be understood
but bens words are lost on a sleeping man
he continues to stare at dussander
todd comes through the front door using his key to get in
todd grabs the letter off the table and stuffs it into a plastic trash bag
todd manages to get the drawer back into the dresser
he throws all the remaining debris and bits of wood into the trash bag
he goes to the closet and searches through the clothes
he finds the s
uniform now tattered from many night of fitful sleep and places it in the trash bag
the bank clerk behind the counter is a fat elderly woman pleasant faced and not too sharp
todd stands solemnly on the other side of the counter
she stares hard at a piece of paper
we see that it is a note please allow my grandson todd to retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box
thank you arthur denker
it is dussanders phony signature at the bottom
hes really sick
the woman looks up at todd the key in his hand then back down at the note
the woman inserts her key into the first lock and todd does the same in the second
a moment later he is holding the box in his hands
i sure hope your granddaddy feels better
you can bring that in here
she escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents of the box
todd puts the box on a table and opens it
it is nearly empty a few old photographs some financial records
there is no document
todd is swept up in a wave of emotion anger relief contempt
hes been played like a fool but is nonetheless grateful
ultimately he is so overwhelmed a laugh springs from his lips
son of a bitch
he scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket
on the other side of the door the clerk listens curiously to todds words
she pushes her ear against the door to hear more
todd has dug a hole in a remote location
he empties the letters the s
uniform and the contents from the safety deposit box into the hole
a little lighter fluid
todd watches the evidence burn
todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers
dussander notices the bouquet
you shouldnt have
todd is aware that ben is listening even though he is pretending not to
todd goes to put the flowers in a glass of water
he sets the glass on the table by the bed
theyre from my mother
he sits in the chair by the bed and lowers his voice
he flicks a tattered photo onto the bed
we recognize it as one from the safety deposit box
it is a black and white portrait of a woman and a small boy
everything else i burned
dussander grins weekly
i had to protect myself from you boy
todd drags a screen over to prevent ben from hearing
i suspect that we shall never see each other again
no i dont think we will
dussander looks almost hurt to hear todd say it
well i better go
there is something i want to ask you
dussander waves him over with his finger
reluctantly todd brings his ear an inch from dussanders mouth
was it like you thought
todd pulls his head back stands up
he contemplates the question
he touches dussander on the shoulder
i should go
he turns for the door
perhaps i could persuade you to wait here just until i fall asleep
this medicine makes me quite woozy
todd resigns himself to stay
he picks up a magazine and begins to read not even looking at dussander
todd emerges from behind the screen toward the door
dussander is asleep
excuse me young man
todd is startled
youre a fine boy to visit your grandfather like that
but hes just a friend
is that right
well you are a good friend to him
tell me is he bad off
he doesnt talk much
the doctors say hell be out soon
that is good news indeed
tell me from the way he speaks id guess hes been naturalized like me
todd is starting to be wary of where this is going
hes from germany
do you know that town
i was only in germany once
originally i mean im from radom
i wonder if he was in the war
i really couldnt say
it doesnt matter i suppose
it was a long time ago the war
soon in this country we may have a president born after the war was over
how about that
todd starts to leave
im sure youre right
your friend is lucky to have you
a great man once said no man is an island entire of itself
take care sir
todd heads for the door
he stops turns back to dussanders bed
he contemplates something
he decides against it
ben sits quietly for a moment thinking
he turns on the television the price is right
we hear it over the following
ben glances over at the screen which separates him from dussander
slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy
he starts to nod off
but as sleep begins to envelope him his eyes suddenly fly open
a surge of terror burns across his face
he sits up frightened
a single crutch stands next to the bed
he grabs it
he strips away his covers and the restraints on his leg once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell a painful scream
he gets to his feet awkwardly hobbling half dragging his bad leg
every step he takes is a study in agony
angle on the screen
it slides out of the way revealing ben staring down at the sleeping dussander
in the pained struggle to keep silent he brings his face right up to dussanders close enough to smell his breath
ben stumbles out of his room into the hall
the crutch falls to the ground
he slides against the wall toward the nurses station
tears stream down his face
as he clutches the wall we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm
he reaches the nurses desk
she is on the phone
he grabs her by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his
she lets out a startled scream
but bens emotion stops her from resisting
he is sobbing uncontrollably
orderlies appear and pull him off of her
he collapses to the ground consumed by grief
dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery
a large black man darren stands above him changing the iv bag
he notices dussander is awake
dussanders voice is low and hoarse from hours of sedation
wheres the nurse
my name is darren
ill be taking care of you from now on
ill tell the doctor youve woken up
darren finishes with the iv unit and goes to the door
dussander watches him a bit puzzled but his eyes are closed again before darren is out of the room
dussander wakes up again
something is different in his room
he looks to the table next to him
all his magazines are gone
he looks to the other side of the room
ben is gone his bed stripped of all linen
finally he looks to the door
it is cracked open
two men in suits are talking in the hallway
one we will come to know as detective getty
the other is a subordinate
dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees
he reaches over for the call button and rings it several times
a moment later darren comes in
getty sees this and stops talking
he watches dussander from the hall
did you need something
what is going on here
where is ben
krauss has been moved
im going to give you something
it will help you sleep
darren readies dussanders arm for an injection
i dont want it
who is that man
before dussander can protest darren sticks him with the needle
your surgery was a success
just try to relax
in german wake up
wake up old man
dussanders eyes open
the first thing he sees are three men all in suits standing over him
dussander in german are you speaking to me
the voice comes from weiskopf s
his suit is dark gray well tailored probably european
he speaks eloquently despite an accent that shows roots of europe and the middle east
back in english no one else is here
dussander looks over at bens former bed
krauss is recuperating elsewhere
are you awake now dussander
yes of course but you seem to have me confused with someone else
my name is arthur denker
perhaps you want a different room weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed
dussander notices the pin on his lapel
a small silver star of david
my name is weiskopf
you are kurt dussander
i know no one by that name
shall i ring for the nurse
dussander reaches for the call button and stops in horror
he looks at his hands
his fingertips are smeared with black ink
he looks up at the men in disbelief
the man in the next bed was benjamin krauss
he was imprisoned for ten months at patin
you were responsible for the death of his wife and two daughters
his identification of you was quite specific
im sure his reward from my government will help offset the burden of his broken leg
my name is arthur denker
i am an american please dont bother
your papers will not stand up to serious examination and you know it
the detective getty snaps a few pictures of dussander
the other man is fbi special agent dan richler
we have all we need here isaac
who are you men
what are your names
my name is richler fbi
this is detective getty from the orange county sheriffs department
and i think you know who i work for
when you get your strength back you will be moved
until then this entire ward will be under surveillance
you can expect to be in tel aviv by the end of the summer
the three men are out the door
todds room is dark as he lies on the floor writing something on a pile of index cards
the only light comes from the hallway through the open door of the bedroom
todd is deep in thought but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the writing is not coming easily
the road ahead reveals itself uh god no
the road ahead
grrrr the fucking road ahead
monica appears in the doorway
todd doesnt notice her
he stares down at the card
finally he looks up as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in his mind
his response is hardly audible
what are you doing there in the dark
monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light
she touches the switch but then pulls her hand back
todd is back at the note card
she looks at him oddly worried but then steps away from the door and goes downstairs
todds lips are moving as if he were speaking to himself
then in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write furiously
he finishes and stands up catching his reflection in the mirror above his desk
in the eerie half light he stares at the ghost like image of himself
todd in cap and gown is seeing his parents to their seats in the second row
ed french comes up to todd and puts his hand on his shoulder
todd is startled
its your big day isnt it
they shake hands
french sees dick and monica sitting behind todd
before todd can stop him he introduces himself
these must be your parents
extends hand hi ed french
its good to finally meet you
dick and monica are the picture of happiness hardly the dysfunctional drunkards that french believed them to be
they all shake hands
dick bowden nice to meet you
this is my wife monica
are you one of todds teachers
french is a bit puzzled
im his guidance counsellor
a woman behind monica taps her on the shoulder
monica i thought that was you
monica turns away from french
suddenly the band strikes up opening notes to pomp and circumstance
to french thats our cue
to dick it was nice meeting you
to todd good luck son
ill talk to you and your wife after the ceremony
todd and french dash off in different directions
standing at the podium is a black female graduate tasha little
she is reading the end of a poem by emily dickinson
principal morgan and todd sit in chairs next to the podium
in the b
is the graduating class joey is among them
french sits among the faculty who are lined up to the right of the podium
thy sacred emblems to partake thy consecrated bread to take and thine immortal wine
there is polite applause from the audience as she takes her seat and morgan goes to the podium
thank you miss little for that superb invocation
and now it gives me great pleasure to introduce a young man whos academic achievement at this institution stands as testament to the power of hard work and determination
todd had a tough time a few months ago so by god he buckled down hit the books and pulled himself through it
todds eyes scan the crowd indifferently
he notices becky seated in the audience near some friends
ladies and gentlemen students and faculty here to deliver the student remembrance for the class of this years valedictorian todd bowden
the crowd burst into applause
a half dozen police cars are in front of the house
one officer is blocking off the entire yard with yellow tape
a news van pulls up
todd shakes morgans hand and takes the podium
the crowd quiets
todd begins we all have dreams that we carry with us
perhaps it is a dream of prosperity or happiness
but now so early in our lives it seems that all we should ask for is to be at peace with the world because only then can we be at
peace with ourselves
weiskopf and richler both wearing rubber gloves are carefully looking through the contents of dussanders dresser
they pour over everything placing some items in clear plastic bags
a few deputies are milling around
richler picks up a small photograph of a young woman
todds voice comes in we learn from our education that we are the masters of our own destinies
we learn what it is that separates us from the others why we are special
what about this
detective getty comes in
you boys better come down to the cellar
youre not going to believe this
getty comes down the steps followed by weiskopf and richler
weiskopf gazes across the cellar
whatever he sees disturbs him
he turns away and goes back up the stairs
each of us have unique talents and interests unlike those of anyone else
the challenge now as we stand at the doorway to adulthood is to channel our abilities into our goals
richler moves to the rail and looks out disgusted
he pulls a handkerchief from his pocket and covers his nose and mouth
a deputy wearing rubber gloves carries the shovel up to him
as todd speaks he notices his parents becky various teachers
his eyes stop on ed french who is looking oddly at something in the crowd
french notices an elderly couple walking down the aisles of seated spectators as if they are looking for someone
we forge our own paths
our education is but a stepping stone to the world
they are victor and agnes bowden looking for dick and monica
todd sees them too
he pauses almost imperceptibly
he looks back at french
our true destinies await us
there we become the
todds grandparents come down the aisle to see dick and monica in the second row
they start to slide in causing a slight ruckus
dick is surprised to see his parents but smiles and makes room for them
french watches all of this curiously
there we become the men and women that will make a difference
but we must take away from this place a sense of purpose for ourselves
we now begin to see the road ahead
it is a road from which we cannot veer
a connection is made between french todd and the bowden family
morgan is reading the last of the names as the graduates file past and collect their diplomas
the graduating class of
the crowd cheers as the graduates throw their caps into the air
the band begins to play
now we invite all the friends and parents to join the students and faculty in the main courtyard for refreshments
todd still pale bolts off the stage
he reaches his parents
french starts to walk down to the bowdens
todd goes up to his mother
mom i dont feel so good
i dont know i feel like im going to pass out
can we go home
you looked real good up there todd
todd ignores her
dont you want to see your buddies
i want to go dad
todd and his family start off
as they leave the camera moves to show ed french working his way through the crowd past the spot where they had been standing
the following series of images appear under music the quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied sea of reporters cameramen photographers and police officers
everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity through the window that looks into dussanders room
inside weiskopf and richler are speaking to the doctors
getty stands to the side instructing the deputy who guards the door
through all of this dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as the bodies whirl around him
darren enters the room to change dussanders iv bag
suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in snapping pictures wildly
getty and the other officers descend upon him
the camera flashes
other photographers try to get in but are blocked
yet dussander seems oblivious to the commotion
his eyes are nothing more than glazed slits his mouth hangs open
darren runs toward the door to help
dussanders eyes open slightly
there is life behind them after all
he turns his attention imperceptibly toward his iv bag
the camera moves away from dussander to the window
outside in the parking lot groups of protesters have gathered
some hold candles
others chant and wave signs
news reporters surround them
angle on a ticking wall clock
todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to his mother
she puts her arm around him
he is pale and glassy eyed
his parents dont look much better
dick is especially nervous and stands off to the side watching everyone intently
richler and weiskopf sit across the room in chairs
todd my name is dan richler
im a special agent with the fbi
this is my associate dr
what kind of doctor are you
im a school teacher
weiskopf is a professor at the judaic institute in munich
he is assisting the israeli government in certain matters
he is here today only as an observer
a moment passes between weiskopf and todd
thanks for calling us up mr
you saved us the trouble of tracking through the records
actually it was todds idea to call
we thought there might be some way we could help your investigation
todd if you wouldnt mind id like to hear about your involvement with dussander
but you knew him as arthur denker right
i never knew of that other name till i saw it in the paper
how did you know him
todd starts to rub his stomach
i met him at the movies
he asked me where to pick up the number seven bus
he said his eyes werent too good
will you excuse me for a minute
he gets up before richler can answer walks toward the stairs
you okay honey
i just gotta use the bathroom
ill be right back
he vanishes up the stairs
they all watch him go
monica turns to richler
hes not feeling well
angle on dick
can i get you some coffee
the faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as todd digs through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of pepto bismol
he takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the bottle
he finishes and takes a few deep breaths
as he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror
an empty bottle in his hand a bright pink ring around his lips a few pink splotches down his shirt he looks totally ridiculous
todd cant help but laugh
the interview continues
the clock ticks on
richler drinks from a coffeee cup
todd is back in his seat
todd let me tell you what were really interested in here
you told the admitting nurse that denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter
thats what i was doing there
it was in german but he insisted i try to read it anyway
once or twice he got pissy about the pronunciation but i asked him what did he want from me
i dont speak german
got really excited at one point
he yelled out yes thats what you would do all right
but i didnt know what he was talking about
then he grabbed his chest
and thats when you called the ambulance right
well this is the part we cant figure out
the letter itself todd
do you remember what happened to it
i guess it was still on the table
i couldnt swear to it but wait i saw a letter
it was in german
i didnt think anything of it at the time
but yeah it was on airmail stationery
then it should still be there
this is our problem
maybe somebody broke in
why would somebody break into his house simply to steal a letter
there was someone
someone right here in santo donato who would want to protect him for some reason
maybe a close friend or even another fugitive
i know it sounds like a bunch of robert ludlum stuff but when dussander was taken to the hospital we think our mr
x scooted over to the house and swiped the letter
that doesnt make sense
why not todd
well if denk
if he had an old nazi buddy in town why didnt he come over himself and read the letter to him
if you could have heard the way he corrected me at every word a good point
except maybe this other fellow is in a wheelchair or blind
guys that are blind dont normally go scooting out to steal letters
did dussander have any friends that you knew of
no not really
how about phone calls
no i heard his phone ring maybe five or six times in all the time i knew him
it was never anything out of the ordinary
did you ever hear him speak german on those occasions
he hardly ever spoke german
he always said he would teach me someday but he never got around to it
did he ever talk about his past
todd looks at weiskopf
this is the first question he has asked and todd is more wary of him than of richler
todd shrugs innocently
little bits i guess
well dont you remember what he told us at thanksgiving
todd looks at her
he said he was in college shutting her up monica
they dont care what we know they care what todd knows
richler notices the tension in the room
he looks at weiskopf
finally he speaks to dick
look im sure this whole thing has come as a terrible shock
i think weve done enough for the day
he and weiskopf stand
dick is almost surprised that they are leaving so soon
thank you todd
weiskopf nods good bye
wait a minute
agent richler before you go todds not a suspect in this is he
i mean hes just talking to you right
because todd always thought he was helping that old man
we didnt know any of this before today
bowden you and todd have nothing to worry about
i assure you
your son has been a great service to us
thank you todd
for now thats all we need
our next step is to turn that house upside down
were bringing in some special teams to look through everything
we may come up with something
well be in touch if we need you
they are almost to the door when richler stops
oh todd by the way
casually pulls a photo out of a folder he is carrying have you ever seen this man before
he holds the photo up to todd
it is a picture of archie in military dress probably a blow up of his military id
todd stares at it for a moment
his face shows no reaction
weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave
from his window todd sees richler and weiskopf talking by their gray sedan
youll be back wont you boys
wont you special agent jackoff
you and the sheeny professor
i know lets show him an old army picture thatll screw him up
fuck you dick is half way up the stairs when he hears yelling coming from todds room
he pauses a moment
most of todds words arent clear but the profanity sure is
after a moment the sedan pulls away
todd turns away from the window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in one hand and the scope in the other
he takes a few breaths tries to calm down
a burst of nervous laughter slips out of him
there is a knock at the door
two seconds later dick comes in
dicks pov todd stands in the middle of his room
the gun pieces are nowhere in sight
everything all right son
im fine dad
your mother and i feel terrible
its not your fault
dick grabs his son and pulls him close
todd doesnt know how to respond
for dick it is like hugging a phone pole
he knows something is terribly wrong
todd stands stiff in his fathers arms until he releases him
you know we love you dont you
i know dad
he smiles at his father comfortingly
dick is not comforted
look ahh your mother and i are going to go down and talk to our lawyer
i dont want you to worry about a thing
its just a precaution
i dont trust these cops
were not going to be gone long
dont worry about me ill be fine
your old man is on top of things all right
i am going to take care of this
i know dad
dick kisses todds forehead
he turns to leave and stops
this afternoon if youre up for it well go do something
how bout it
dick tries to smile and goes out the door leaving todd alone
the garage door opens and dick backs the porsche into the street
monica is with him
todd from the upstairs window watches them go
todd is near the end of his rope trying to hold himself together
we see him splashing water on his face in the bathroom
he gazes into the mirror transfixed by the ghost like image reflected back at him
todd pounds his fist against the sink
he can stand it no longer
he darts out of the bathroom
todd drives his mothers honda wagon towards the entrance of the hospital and for the first time witnesses the scope of dussanders discovery
news vans are everywhere
the protesters have grown in number
a line of cars wait for admittance into the parking lot
a policeman stands a few feet away from todd directing cars in turning others away
he is moving toward todd
horns honk around him
todd sees that more police officers are standing by the door of the hospital
the nearby policeman notices todd and walks closer
todd doesnt wait
he pulls the car out of line and drives off
todd holds the steering wheel with a white knuckled grip
his face is sweaty and flushed
he rocks back and forth as he tries to reassure himself
were o kay he is almost calm when he nears his house
but it doesnt last
he sees something he can hardly believe
you got to be fucking kidding me
an old vo vo is parked on the street in front of the house
standing on the porch sneakers and all is ed french
todd pulls into the driveway and gets out
french has a cautious air about him as he walks toward todd
french what brings you to the wild side of town
the two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car
french pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket
he starts to move around the car toward todd but todd circles the other way keeping the car in between himself and french
i found something troubling in the morning news
are your parents home
i know the man in this picture is the man who came to see me
its sort of a bad time right now
why dont you go home
but first i need a couple of things explained to me
richler is speaking to the reporters
cameras and lights are in his face
his words are low serving as a backdrop but we can tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate dussander
weiskopf stands close by
todd why dont you tell me what happened
while todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the car french does not
you know mr
french sometimes one thing just leads to another and before you know it
things get out of control
im afraid thats not much of an answer todd
when do you expect your parents home
i dont know ed
you want to come in and wait
ill put on a pot of tea
well talk about old times
i think you might need some help todd
thats why im here
dussander is alone in the room as richler addresses the reporters outside
his eyes open wide and his movements are the liveliest they have been since he was discovered
he reaches over to his iv unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the bag
i do need help
i really do
todd becomes more animated more threatening with every word
somehow it is as though french is now retreating from todd as they circle the car
let me help you todd
i want to
youre too smart to do anything crazy
can i ask you something ed
you dont mind if i call you ed now that im out of your fucking school do you
you know all this crap you see on tv about forensics
hairs and fibers that stuff
how much of it do think is true and how much is just bullshit
french is puzzled by the question
he has no answer
oh how would you know
youre a fucking guidance counsellor
todd this is silly
why dont we go inside
liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the bag
dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up to his mouth
his lips wrap around it and his face tightens as he begins to blow
todd starts moving again
french does the same
heres a little factoid for ya
ill bet you didnt know this one
hairs fall out of your head all the time
but its even worse when youre nervous
and you know what
ive been real fucking high strung lately
todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to the back seat
he opens it
todd bends down to get something from the back seat
his voice is muffled from the inside of the car
thats how it all happened you know
one thing lead to another and before i knew it
todd pops back up holding the rifle fully assembled and aimed at frenchs chest
you showed up in my driveway wearing those same fucking sneakers
to todd rapid fires
frenchs chest explodes red as his lifeless body sails back onto the grass
in the front yard a dozen birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus
todd swoons back on his heels overcome by something
but it isnt pain rather its a rush of pleasure
a laugh slips out
dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the floor
the camera moves along the tube and stops at dussanders arm where it ends
he lies back in his bed and waits
todd regains his balance
french stares wide eyed as todd steps up to him the muzzle aimed at frenchs head
todd grins widely
for the first time he looks
happy a single round obliterates half of frenchs skull
todd chokes back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch
dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic contortive fit as the air embolism reaches his heart
his arm flails against the iv unit sending it crashing to the floor
the monitors next to him reflect a drastic turn in his condition
the door flies open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of journalists
richler and weiskopf run in and the eager cameramen follow
the room is bathed in flash explosions as the nurses try to subdue dussander
todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the boxes and boxes of ammunition
he lets out a beautifully wicked laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack
he leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his shoulder
todd zooms out of the garage on his bike the rifle slung over one shoulder the backpack over the other
he zips past frenchs body and out into the street
in the distance we hear the faint but rising wail of sirens
a front door or two slams shut as todd passes
suddenly he cuts up between two houses
a man standing in his back yard sees todd and freezes
todd ignores him
he steers the bike through the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times before
from above we see dussanders eyes wide open motionless
yet the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction
a doctor pounds on his chest barks orders
the trauma team prepares the defibrillator but we know they are too late
todd rides fast over the dry rocky ground
the wind streaks back his hair
his excitement is as palpable as the grin dancing across his face
an aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail and up a steep embankment
as the camera moves ahead of him we see the crest of the hill and beyond it
the freeway teeming with rush hour traffic
