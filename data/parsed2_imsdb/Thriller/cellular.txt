mackye gruber eric bress july we pull back to reveal were looking at the sun
in the distance lie the gorgeous san gabriel mountains and the downtown los angeles skyline
in one long tracking shot we crane past some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of brentwood
homeowners walk dogs a paperboy chucks papers fr m a gleaming mountain bike
its early in the morning and the landscapers havent come with their leaf blowers yet
continue booming down to road level to face the resplendent martin residence
we steadicam down the fr ont walk able to admire the manicured hedges and the black e scalade in the driveway to the front door decorated with a whimsical placard
that reads the martins and we pass through the keyhole into the foyer
we track through the living room passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy and we hear a womans voice as she comes down the stairs with a
golden retriever at her side
into phone yes donna im out the door
we track over the womans shoulder and follow her into the kitchen unable to see her face
just inform kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and ill be there as soon as i can
still looking over her shoulder we watch her absently straighten a photograph of her son on the fridge as she talks
and promise her shes about to have a woooonnderful labor
as the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee her housekeeper enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket
they give each other a silent wave
right ill see you in twenty
she hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we come around to finally reveal jessica martin slightly weary but ready for the day ahead
buenas dias rosario
good morning miss jessica
jessica sees her answering machine blinking hits play
in the background a cheerful rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry
on machine honey
honey wake up
pick up the and as she brings the coffee cup to her lips slamm
the door explodes open and a squad of five gunmen storm in wearing ski masks
everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts noise and confusion
jessicas dog starts to lunge at the men and thup
is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark
rosario runs for the alarm system get away from there
dont touch that
but as she reaches out for the panic button blam
he blows her away too
the gunman curses then turns on jessica
dire where is he
where is who
the bastard hauls back and wham i punches her in the face knocking jessica cold
then he turns to his men
search the house
and as the answering machine fills the silence on machine ill call back later
the lead gunman spins around and we push into the blackness of his masked face
the blackness of a black van and escalade passing below us
we quickly crane down to see the vehicles traveling through an iron gate at the edge of an aband ned property
they bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees angle on the kidnappers van as it arrives at its destination an isolated house in the hills
the grass is dead
the trees are dead
its the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing
as the van stops a door crashes open
light slices through the dark revealing the dusty skeletal interior
jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor
with bound hands she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see standing in front of her
sturdier than the rest
what do you want
unsettlingly the kidnapper says nothing staring at her
jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze
then suddenly the kidnapper turns and exits the room
jessica breathes a sigh of relief
but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later with a baseball bat
grim as death he stalks toward her no wait
her he hauls back and swings smash
the bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above jessicas head obliterating the rotary dial telephone that hung there
as phone guts shower down on her the lead kidnapper turns and stomps away slamming the attic door shut and locking jessica in the darkness
only now that theyre gone does jessica allow her fear to show through
trembling tears running down her face jessica finally breaks down pleading to the empty attic wha
what the hell is happening
the attics suffocating silence is the only answer she gets
skimming along the water
and we tilt up to reveal the majestic beaches of southern california and at the center of it all the santa monica it would be a typical day except for
that some people are preparing for a heal the bay rally at the end of the pier
vendors set up preparing for the daily grind ahead
bikers gather around a bad ass hellcat g confederate motorcycle and admire its cutting edge design
hot chicks in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand
fishermen crack beers while awaiting the next bite
the screen displays a car race arcade game
a computer generated hot rod passes other racers at breakneck speed
playing the sit down game daytona usa is ryan ackerman early twenties looks like he grew up on the beach without so much as a pot to piss in
his lethal reflexes and bold recklessness however have made him a jedi master of the game
ryans score approaches the high score at the top of the screen
you recording this
chad his best bud aims a blue tooth videostreaming cellphone at some cute girls instead
we can see their faces on the tiny screen of the cellphone
ryans car gets caught behind a blue speedster then passes on the shoulder
he gets an extended play and the screen flashes new record
nearby a kid watching the game nods
the high score starts rising to match ryans score
ryan turns around to see chad has shoved the cellphone down the front of his tattered shorts
and hes freeballing it
check it attack of the bubblegum monster in hi def videostream cmon chad i gotta put my mouth on that
holding a cup of soda between his teeth chad pulls the cellphone out of his pants and hits send
through cup holding teeth sweet
its going to my email right now
s me soda inadvertently spills onto the cellphone and chad wipes it dry on his pants
watch it dude i gotta return that thing in seven days
they arent giving you shit yet
nah whenever i return it i just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model
figure by the tenth time ill have to go somewhere else
ryans car finally crashes in a wall of flames
as seen looking over the rail of the pier
the tide is in but its still a forty foot drop
ryan stares over the railing like a death row inmate contemplating his last meal
no ones looking
his left hand holds his wallet
re wallet need me to hold that
ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts he zips a zipper tucks a velcro flap
pats his pocket proudly
but as soon as ryan covertly climbs onto the rail his left leg starts trembling like crazy
this is stupid
i could get killed
pick another dare
chad lowers the phone irritated
not after you made me march in the gay pride parade wearing a thong
screw it then
two and a half whole numbers only rabbitfoot
ryan stares at the waves crashing below
his leg starts snaking like crazy
and he chickens out hopping back to the deck
just so you know im emailing this to every chick you ever met
but suddenly ryans oblivious to the dare
his eyes are glued to something else speaking like hal transmitting pussy file now
chloe early s a head turner confident funny she can pull you in like a tractor beam
she and some cute friends carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the heal the bay rally
ryan walks over like he owns the place
got any more
im here to help
thanks but no we got em all
whats in em
chloe opens the box
hands him a heal the bay pamphlet
cool youre handing these out during the concert
yeah wanna help
ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart
im all about heal the bay
his eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand
me an chad do the monthly cleanup thing of course
an awesome wing man chad appears over chloes shoulder pretending to read a pamphlet but really holding it up so ryan can see it
piece of cake now
weve collected water samples with the stream team raised money on the promenade
im surprised i havent seen you
he offers his hand
she takes it
the handshake lingers a second longer than necessary and they both smile at each other
i cant tell if youre full of it
ryan stops posturing gets real
you ever go up to santa barbara
my dad used to take me there all the time
their pier is amazing clear water huge crabs everywhere oysters right there on the rocks starfish
hard to believe its the same ocean sometimes
hes managed to win her back
maybe you and i can take a break later when pat benatar goes on
sounds like a plan
theres a moment
then oh no i forgot
i still have to pick up a box of t shirts at the kinkos on venice
ill do it for you
if you want
seriously you would
how much is the bill
its been paid up front
do you promise not to go anywhere
ryan makes a graceful exit
okay i wont be long
ryan grabs chad and as they walk out of earshot dude does santa barbara have a harbor or a pier
a short time later ryan cruises through a venice neighborhood
ryan drives an early s ford bronco clothes are strewn across the backseat and a box of heal the bay t shirts now sits on the shotgun seat
ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush
he sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing
checking himself out in the mirror he sniffs his pits whoa and grabs the cellphone
into phone dex wassup
you wont believe the hotties i just met at the pier
you wanna meet them
well dont get too excited cause i need my money
ryan stops at a red light
bullshit youre not going anywhere quickly adding im pulling up right now
some ambulances speed by sirens blaring
ryan lays on the horn
when the light changes ryan peels away angrily
covering his ear what
yeah you better be
and i need your shower im talkin code red stankage the cellphone begins to crackle with static just as ryan drives under an overpass
suddenly the car ahead of him stops in the middle of the street
ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes
the car skids he screams
and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other cars bumper
he lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is washed into phone dex
you still there
and as has happened to all of us he loses the call
as traffic resumes and ryan clears the overpass id iu ryan picks up the phone
sorry got cut off
hey whats my caller id say
but theres no voice on the other end only shuffling sounds
their insulation picked off and spliced together
pan along the attic floor past the rubble of the shattered phone foll wing the crudely repaired wires to jessicas hands tapping the dialer wires together
shes trying so hard to simulate a numeric pulse that she almost doesnt hear hello
jessicas hands go suddenly still then whoom
her head slams down into frame on top of the crushed earpiece a desperate hope filling her eyes
with still no answer ryan pulls the phone from his ear whatever
signing off and is just about to hit end call when he hears a tiny female voice on the other end
dont hang up
ryan puts the phone back to his ear
theres not much time
i need you to go to the police
my name is jessica martin ive been kidnapped
not buying oh really
i know what youre thinking but its real
im in an attic somewhere
i think theyre going to kill me
you need to awfully polite kidnappers to give you a phone
jessicas voice trembles uncontrollably
desperate fearful and frustrated
you dont understand
suddenly the cellphone blips twice in ryans ear
he pulls it away and looks at its faceplate
the lcd reads call waiting
if you were really in trouble you wouldve called the cops not me
now ive got a real call on the other line a wider shot so we see jessicas bound hands
her bruised face
whispering frantically into the demolished telephone shes jeri rigging back together as she talks
goddamn it listen to me
the phone im on
theres no dialer
ive been clicking wires together for hours trying to get someone anyone and you re the only connection i was able to make
important beat if you hang up i may not get anyone else
sfx ryans call waiting blips again
he considers everything jessica has said then hmm
sucks to be you
try crank yanking someone else

ryan flashes over to the next call
a telemarketer checks ryans name on a list then glances at the script
my name is mark and id like to discuss with you the benefits of mastercharge credit unions awesome i can totally use a credit card

and thats when he notices the message flashing on the phones faceplate call on hold
ryan clicks the flash button to pick it up
and jessica is still there
an you hear me
you still there
youre getting kinda creepy lady
theyre going to kill me
theyre going to kill me
a silent beat
a calculated look in her eyes
ryan pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up
when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold
on the other end jessica begins to cry
oh its like that huh
nice with the fake tears lady
i just need help
but ryan wont be manipulated
you need acting lessons
now go take your meds and bug someone else
jessica stops herself short quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away
she glances anxiously at the attic door then continues more in control
these men killed my housekeeper
you have to help me
ryan bristles at being saddled with anything much less this
no actually i dont
not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier
youre my only hope
beat whats your name
that catches ryan off guard
he stalls not wanting to make this personal
why you writing a book
please just tell me your name
ryan glances around the street his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a french restaurant
what if it was your mother who was calling for help
how would you feel
well id be damn impressed considering shes dead
goddamn it how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police
ill pay you
five thousand dollars
sure you will
im hanging up now
even if theres a eighty percent chance im lying you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f r a lousy twenty minutes of your life
panics as ryan is silent havent you ever bet on a horse or bought a lottery ticket
im talking one in five odds twenty minutes
ryan slaps the radio off
what do you want me to do
in extreme slow motion chaos unfolds around us like a nightmare officers manhandle a drunk toward the back a hooker screams at us with unholy rage in the far corner
a junkie spits on an officers face and theres a lethal race for disinfectant through invisible soup
sounds are distant eerily muffled
a high pitched whine lets us know were in hell
close up bob mooneys eyes
concerned but not panicked
still surreal slow motion as an officer with a crewcut responds by spinning the junkies face into a wall legal but hard
sfx a heartbeat
and possibly irregular
close up slow motion the right thumb presses into the mooneys eyes
back to reality when a young gangbanger is slammed into the station desk by a rookie
if i put this one in with the others theres gonna be a bloodbath
put me in there
ill waste all them pussies
reveal sergeant bob mooney a tough fifty something beat cop whos fighting growing old every step of the way
he rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of pizza
come on powell put the sharks with the sharks the jets with the jets and make room
rookie powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the gangbanger back over to the holding cells
mooney puts down the pizza no appetite and stares at the news story playing on the tv mounted in the corner
a news reporter is in the middle of a segment
over him footage rolls of six guilty looking cops testifying in court being led away in handcuffs
was somber when the indictments came down this afternoon in the rd precinct corruption scandal
though the names of six police officers were read aloud the district attorney stated that this was merely the tip of the iceberg and that unfortunately many other arrests are
likely to be coming as the investigations proceed
as detective jack tomlin passes mooney he nods toward the tv
sucks for the fellas at the two three right now huh
dirty pricks deserve what they get
public hates us enough without this shit
leaving theres good men over there
a female officer passes mooney and reaches for his box of pizza
what are you doing
you cant be eating this crap
mooney plants his own firm grip on the box
keep walking shelly
nothing to see here
a friendly tug of war
you sure you wanna do that
what would your wife say
mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to lecture this little girl
shed say nothing cause shes not gonna know about it
christ shel my old man had eleven heart attacks
i have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like an invalid
im a grown man
leave me alone will you
abashed i was merely referring to your cottage cheese ass
mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when whamm
the station doors burst open and two dozen gang members are bum rushed into the room by a squad of cops in riot gear
the screaming is deafening
i hate this place
the ford bronco roars up snags the handicapped spot
ryan hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until hes far enough away from the car to start running
into phone im here
cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting gang members who cram the station desk waiting to be booked
ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the mayhem to the extremely shorthanded station desk where is busy doing ten things at once
signing release papers
booking a drunk whose wife beater tee is drenched in blood etc
excuse me officer but mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that suddenly need arrest sheets signed
hey ive got an emergency here just then crewcut officer shoulders his way through with a cuffed crackhead trannie in tow
the trannies wrists ache
loosen these man please
jus gimme a chance hey moon
where do you want me to put whitney houston
christ ive only got two hands here
stick him in the can will ya
crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom
shoving forward come on man
ive got some lady on the phone here who says shes been kidnapped
ryan holds up the phone
mooney looks around
nice try kid but i got no time for pranks
seriously a lady was murdered
which is it a kidnapping or a murder
take the phone and find out moron
a cop snickers somewhere
jessica holds her breath
she stares apprehensively at the attic door praying for mooney to just take the damn phone
ryan looks sincere
mooney deliberates then sighs
give it here
ryan thrusts the phone at him happy to get rid of it
barely audible whisper oh thank god
youve got to help me
my names jessica martin and ive been kidnapped
this morning five men broke into my home in brentwood and kidnapped mooney strains to hear
his eyes go wide and he quickly jots notes on a pad
mooneys eyes shift as three tweakers wide eyed and sweating profusely are led inside by their arresting officers
mooney holds out the phone
hurry kid take this upstairs to robbery homicide and ask for detective tomlin
ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge on the station desk
jessica hears the phone being shuffled around
mooney recognizing an emergency when he hears one ignores the incoming crowd him long enough to assist ryan
up the stairs tomlin
ryan turns away and as he returns the cellphone to his ear hes startled to hear terrified oh my god
what is it
jessica hears lady whats going on
jessica drops the phone
has just enough time to shove it behind her before slam
the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in
when they reach her they stand silently trying to unnerve her
wheres your husband
i dont the masked leader slaps her sharply across the face
jessica wants to collapse to the ground but remains sitting to keep the phone hidden behind her
the leader bends down and yells right in her face
where is he
why what do you want
this ones even nastier than the first
phone to his ear
hearing it all
for the first time starting to believe jessicas story
panicking ryan turns and walks then jogs then all out runs for the station stairwell
v the lead kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling jessica oh god
does he see the phone cord
please he should be at work
thats all i know
the leader nods then turns away
jessica exhales with relief that he didnt spot the phone
but her victory is short lived as you have a little boy right
the wyman school in westwood
jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest
but the men silently head out the door slam
the door locks
jessica scrambles back to the phone
im trying to get help
my son suddenly as ryan reaches the first landing static starts breaking up the call
worried oh my god
its just static
im running upstairs to the detectives
hold on i might lose you for a sec realizing no dont
you cant lose me still running wait were almost there
panics losing her cool stop
johnny goddamn it stop
hearing her fearful tone ryan stops reluctantly
well what the hell am i supposed to do
ryan looks at himself standing on the stairs like an idiot
im almost there
ryan checks the signal strength indicator on the phone
theres only one bar left
defiantly ryan takes a step up
and the bar disappears
he quickly hops back down
shouts up stairs theres no response
ryan cant believe this
youre shitting me
johnny what time is it
checking his watch who
oh one twenty
yells upstairs jessica calms herself resolving to save her childs life
johnny listen to me
my sons school lets out at
good then if i get a cop ryan exits the stairwell to find mooney but mooneys not there anymore
theres some new guy and hes swamped
theres not enough time
you have to pick him up before they pick him up
hell no lady
i aint goin nowhere else ryan tries to get the new guys attention in a dream
please please stop standing there
he s just a little boy
but im in a police station
ryan grunts in frustration
ecu the ford broncos tires burning rubber
the furniture in this abandoned house is all covered with sheets giving the entire place a creepy haunted feel
follow the lead kidnapper as he descends a nearby stairwell and pulls off his mask forties salt and pepper hair
he looks to his crew
theyre all trim
in good shape
theyre unmasked watching the tv with interest
the news on the corruption scandal
greer snaps the tv off
checks his watch and nods grimly
go get the kid
instantly a hulk of a man deason and an arrogant red headed prick ellis stand and exit the house
as greer stalks away boom down the bar to reveal a telephone sitting there unnoticed by the men and on its face the line in use indicator light is lit
push in on the flashing orange light that threatens to give ryan and jessicas call away
closer and closer until we enter the phone and travel through the wires to as we pull back we see that were in the ford bronco racing through ryan guns
the engine as jessica panics on the other end of the phone
we can hear her hyperventilating
where are you now
i just got off the
youve got to go faster johnny
youve gotta chill
youre stressing the crap out of me
looking around where the hell is a cop hiding in a speed trap when you need one
ryan takes a hard right tires squealing
pushing it against his better judgment
what do these guys want anyway
how should i know
what do you do
im an obstetrician
they dont want anything from me
ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver
so your husbands like uber rich
hes an accountant
i make more money than he does
could theyve mistaken you for someone else
i dont know
none of this makes any sense
jessica starts losing it completely upsetting ryan so much that he takes the next corner too fast and skkrrash
the bronco explodes through an orange and white road closed and dead ahead is a construction crew resurfacing the road
ryan slams on the brakes and swerves to avoid hitting a group of workers and obliterates the broncos passenger side mirror against another barrier ryan cringes with every muscle
and the mirror ricochets off the ground and smashes through the windshield of a recently waxed acura legend
smirking aint that a bitch
as the heavily muscled workers start running to beat the shit out of him ryan floors the gas sending a shower of wet asphalt all over the cursing workers as
he peels away crashing through a final barrier
more cautiously ryan rounds the next corner and theres the school
just ahead we see private prep school for boys
ryan pull a private prep it
walks quickly toward the building
school for boys
ryan pulls over and hops out
okay im here
how much time do we have
ryan checks his watch
it reads pm
whats your kids name
you named your kid ricky martin
why didnt you tattoo kick me on his ass while you were at it
he was named before the singer ever forget it
what does he look like
hes eight years old
small for his age
hes wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants theyre all wearing blue shirts and pants
ryan turns down a hallway and we see that hes right
its filled with identically uniformed little boys
as a timid blonde boy passes in front of him ryan grabs him and wheels him around
the boys eyes get huge
he tries to pull away
dont touch me
no kid its okay
i didnt mean to
dont touch me
ryan quickly moves on
aware that other adults are now beginning to take notice of him
does he have anything else
whats his lunch box look like
i dont remember
you dont remember your own kids lunch box
i dont pack it
rosario our housekeeper does
sometimes craig but
jessica begins to sob which causes ryan to panic further
ricky martin where are you
none of the stepford kids respond
through tears i wish i could give you more
now ryans running
he yells into a bathroom
can i help you sir
ryan turns to see a muscular gym teacher looming there
clearly the guy thinks ryans peeping into the boys room
im looking for a little blond boy off his shocked look no no
not like that
sir come with me please
ryan isnt going anywhere
and thats when the bell rings
like a nightmare hundreds of uniformed little boys come racing out of their classes
as the boys stampede by ryan yanks the whistle from around the gym teachers thick neck and starts blowing it like crazy
where ricky martin is
i cant believe im yelling this at an all boys school
all hell is breaking loose
the kids ignore him
the huge gym teacher races after him
jessica yells in his ear
was that the bell
was that the bell
ryan wades through the sea of uniforms
he go to the parents pick up spot
oh god theyre going to get him
ryan turns around and starts bulling through
the gym teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks where do you think youre going
causing the phone to fly out of ryans hand and crack
hit the pavement
ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone
the lcd display glass is cracked into a spiderweb
desperate into phone jessica
you still there
relieved ryan turns and races for the front of the school
no ones gonna get your kid
hes not slow is he
then he wont go anywhere with strangers
unless they have our escalade
ricky think its rosario and hop right in
shes got a point
ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the pick up spot
scans the lot
looks of course it is
pan around to see what ryan sees three black cadillac escalades
theres three of them
whats your plate
oh my god i dont remember
like you dont remember the lunch box
or anything else about your kid stops realizing oh man
this is a prank isnt it
oh youre good lady
your friends too
getting me to scream out ricky martin at a boys school
damn you really nailed me
no this is great the police think im a whack job
the school thinks im some kind of perv child molester
ill probably get the herpes from the gym teachers whistle
no johnny you have to listen to me
but ryans had enough
he turns to leave im done being your entertainment for the day
im going back to the pier while i still have a chance and passes right by a blonde haired green eyed eight year old boy carrying a lord of the
ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid
but then decides screw it and keeps on hoofing
ryan rounds a corner to leave and is confronted by the gym teacher and a rent a cop security guard
here he is
hes the one thats been stalking the students
no i can explain the rent a cop mumbles into his walkie
okay we got him
were at the front of the school
then to ryan sir come with us
as they grab him hey hey rent a dude
hang on a sec
this is a huuuge misunderstanding a little rent a cop car think geeky wanna be cop car pulls up in the driveway below
the security guard starts forcibly leading ryan toward it but as he gets close interrupting lord of the rings
i forgot his father bought him a lord of the rings lunchbox last week
ryans heart stops in his chest
he turns to see the boy with the lord or the rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting escalades
struggling the boy opens the car door
but turns as he hears his name called
for the briefest moment ricky and ryan lock eyes
and thats when a hand reaches out snags his backpack and yanks ricky into the dark of the car
instantly the door slams shut and the escalade begins to take off
whip pan to ryans shocked reaction
hes the only one whos seen it
he tries to struggle free of the guard
you just see that
losing control of ryan the rent a cop calls to his partner in the car
roy some help over here
below the escalade is leaving the driveway
struggling harder goddamn it that little kid was just kidnapped
the second rent a cop hops out of his car and runs over but as he gets near ryan breaks free
they chase after him but ryan hops over the hood of the idling rent a cop car and throws himself into its drivers seat
rent a cop reaches through the open window and grabs ryans collar and is dragged twenty feet as ryan throws the little car in gear and burns away
trying to catch the escalade a quarter mile ahead
ryan feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he slaloms through the streets of east hollywood
whats happening ryan
dont worry i can fix this
oh my god
there are three cars between ryan and the escalade
its okay i can see them ahead
dont lose them
if you follow them back here you can tell the police where theyre holding us
the mountainous deason drives as ellis sits shotgun
in the back sits jessicas son ricky who eyes the two men suspiciously
ccr plays on the radio
ellis turns down the radio
faking sincerity he turns to face ricky
gesturing to the radio do you want me to change the station to something else
ricky refuses to answer
ellis turns around his fake smile quickly vanishing
i like creedence too
hes about to turn the radio volume up when wheres rosario
i told you kid she had a doctors appointment so your mother asked us to pick you up
dont worry youll see your mommy in a few minutes
but we can tell by the look on his face that hes not buying their story one bit
cautiously so as not to give himself away ryan passes one commuter car
then the next
narrowing the gap between the rent a cop car and the escalade to one last auto
it takes ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up enough speed to get around the final car
now the escalade is dead ahead
ryan begins gently closing the distance between them and is just starting to relax when merges into traffic from a bus stop right ahead of him
ryan slams on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a ainful m
worse he has his view of the escalade glocked by the bus titanic silver ass
theres this stupid bus ryan jags left and right catching glimpses around the bus of the escalade still ahead
taps his horn come on
but the bus doesnt pull over
ryan tries flashing the security cars clear bubble lights on the roof but who the hell would pull over for that
the bus sure doesnt
cant you go around it
theres an ungodly amount of opposing traffic but suddenly theres a break in the flow
seizing the moment ryan slam sh ifts the rent a cop cars uni cylinder engine into gear and starts to tear around the bus but has to swerve back as
a speeding trash truck rounds a bend and almost creams him
did you lose him
no i just almost got killed is all
oh thank god
irritated thats nice
just then the bus signals that its pulling over
hey here we go
as the bus pulls aside ryan floors the wanna be cop car around it
but directly in front of him is a homeless man dressed like a sheik dragging his caravan of two covered ryan slams on the brakes swerves hard to avoid a
collision and loses cont rol of the car
the rent a cop car goes power sliding across oncoming traffic horns blaring at him and heads straight for a the floor to ceiling window of a car smash
the car goes through the window and races down the center aisle
car salesmen and patrons are forced to dive out of the way as the rent a cop car mows down displays and everything else in its path
the mountainous deason drives
in back ellis sits with jessicas son ricky who eyes the two men suspiciously
creedence clearwater revival plays on the radio
to deason anyone following us
deason checks we see the bus about five car lengths behind but the rent a cop car is nowhere to be seen
deason flashes an evil grin
the rent a cop car exits the dealership smashing through another glass window
ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on the street
only to find that the escalade has disappeared
are you okay
yo u lost no no
just give me a second as jessica goes off ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the escalade
he floors the rent a cop car engine clattering to the intersection
ryan franticly searches in every direction but the escalade is nowhere to be seen
he floors it
where the hell did they go
dreading talking to jessica ryan slowly picks up the receiver
jessica i you let them get away
ryan wants to snap at her but guilt crushes it right out of him
he knows shes right
th precinct locker room day mooney changes out of his blues his ears glued to three cops in the corner boasting about an arrest
so of course everyones playing dumb to what kind of drugs hes on
the cops start to snicker theyve all heard that one before
so i start searching the place
im about to open a closet door when a kid with a mac jumps out of the bathroom
misses me and hits one of the e
fires again but the gun jams and bam
blows half his face off
had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the
mooney tries to join in on the conversation
it mustve been around when
the cops turn around while grabbing their stuff
sorry moon were late for a briefing
mooney waves them on but looks disappointed for not being able to join in
ill bet in your day you had some stories
mooney whips his head around to see detective jack tomlin
hardly thrilled my anniversary
you know duty calls pricey dinner and then some crap ass play
beat hey i sent some college kid down to see you this morning
had some rap about a kidnapping i havent seen anyone but ill ask around
i thought it was a prank at first but the kid was so worked up well dont you get worked up
slaps mooneys chest if the kid comes back page me and ill be sure to see him
swallowing his pride yeah
and as tomlin walks off ryan lead foots the gas
the speedometer climbs
sixty miles an hour
look johnny youve got to go back to the cops
are you high
i just jacked a car
goddamn it stop thinking about just yourself
you can explain everything to them later
ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out
the battery indicator is flashing low batt
now the batterys dying
dont you have a charger
its in my car
sfx beep beep
the battery indicator has lost another bar
ryan fumbles around in the armrest
opens the glovebox and a snub nosed
special tumbles out
whats going on
did you find one
staring at the gun not exactly
sfx beep beep
jessica starts growing afraid
johnny dont lose me
well what the hell do you expect me to do
just then ryan rounds a corner and sees traffic gridlocked to a halt ahead
he tries to maneuver around it but is almost immediately boxed in
i know jessica
the phone starts a steady beeping now dying imminent
and traffic isnt going anywhere
ryan looks around desperately
no emergency lane
just a long drop down a hill to a strip mall below strip mall
ryan scans it and does a double take on one of the stores signs verizon wireless
traffic inches forward
now he sees an off ramp a quarter mile ahead but at this rate itll take forever to make it there
ryans got to do something
you know that money you promised me
im giving myself a raise
and with that ryan cranks the steering wheel hard right and hits the gas
despite other drivers protests the little rent a cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock tears through the rusty guard rail and vroooom
flies off the side of the hill
ryan lets out a frightened yell as he sails through the clear blue sky
the rent a cop car touches down on a steep downslope
ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile miraculously avoiding the minefield of rocks and tree stumps
he needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its antenna in his teeth
theres so much noise the only thing jessica could possibly hear is a cacophony of noise and ryan hyperventilating
whats going on
with phone in teeth mmmrrmph mrm mrmph
ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and whoooom
goes up on two wheels
it looks like its going to roll but gravity brings
it back down slamm
so hard that the phone goes flying across the car
ryan scrabbles for the phone but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees a billboard dead ahead
ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the billboards concrete posts but wham
obliterates the rent a cops bubble lights on the billboards lower edge
somehow ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot where it skids out
grabbing phone jessica
can you hear me
ryan hops out and races inside and of course theyre having a sale and the place is packed
every salesperson is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy
panicking ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter hey what do you think youre doing
theres a line
to the overly perky salesman helping someone else
and if you get the new nokia you can switch out faceplates to match your mood
and we have a special today on tiger stripes
are you feeling fierce
the salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand
oh how fun
excuse me im sorry sir im with a customer now
indicates a number dispenser but if you take a number someone will be with you shortly
ryan glances at the dispenser
a big yellow smiley face with tickets ejected from the mouth
the next ticket it offers is
and the now serving display on the wall reads
just then a busy saleswoman walks by
ryan grabs her
ive got an emergency here sorry im on break damn it will you listen to me
ive got a life and death call on this phone and my batterys dying
do you have a charger
walks away take a number and one of the sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up
ryan breaks out in a cold sweat
cant catch his breath
as a saleswoman rushes by ryan reaches for her
help i take a number
the room starts spinning around him
its clear no ones going to help him
like the clap of doom the now serving display on the wall flips happily to frantic ryan glances at the phone
and just as the last battery bar on the power indicator flickers and disappears aw screw this
ryan pulls the rent a cops big
special from his pocket and blows the smiley face dispenser to dust
instantly people hit the dirt
now serving thirty eight special
beat mooney exits the mayhem of the s tation and walks to a squad car
as he pulls his seatbelt on something crinkles in his breast pocket
he pulls it out the scrap of paper where the scribbled the words jessica martin and brentwood when ryan handed him the phone
mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away
but stops himself
he stares at the words then unable to let it go punches keys on the mobile data terminal
a name and address appear on the screen mooney stares at the name
then after a moment he sighs and pulls a la lakers cellphone from his coat
yeah im gonna be a few minutes late
and as mooney closes the door and starts up the engine we pan past photographs of jessicas family over to an answering machine rings
we hear jessicas outgoing message then a beep and over machine jessica
damn where are you
beat i called earlier and
jess im in serious trouble
i cant explain right now but were all in danger
please just grab ricky and meet me in left field
pan up to an attractive woman listening to the machine
just as the phone literally dies ryan rips a new charger from its packaging slaps it into the phone and voila it begins charging
that was so no bueno
you found a charger
among other things
ryan glances at piles of phone gear hes appropriated from verizon
ryan fiddles with the now war torn phone
thank you for doing all this johnny
yeah look about that
awkward beat my name isnt really johnny fountain
good it sounded like a porn star name
then softly its okay
you dont have to tell me its ryan
im a bar back
im twenty two and just a little freaked out right now
jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty
thank you ryan
but before they can say any more suddenly jessica jumps with a start
tries to push the phone guts behind a beam with her foot as greer enters but fails
the receiver sits in front of the beam exposed
greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to jessica
he stares at her for long uncomfortable moments
do you want to die here
jessica drains white does he see the phone
slams on the brakes and skids up to the curb
covers the mouthpiece
greers question still hangs in the air
jessica scoots away trying to draw greers eyes in another direction from the phone that lies out in the open
but i am going to arent i
up to you
your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field
i dont understand
greer winds up and bam
hits jessica in the stomach knocking the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground
a base ball field
wh ich o ne does he mean
choking out the words i
i dont know what you want me to say
i swear shut up
he wouldnt leave a message that didnt make sense to you
greer tightens his fist and is about to hit jessica again wait
the bleachers behind left field at dodger stadium
thats where we first met
greer stares at jessica for a long uncomfortable moment searching her soul
that has to be where he means
i swear to god
then he stands looking away for just a moment but long enough for jessica to nudge the phone back behind the beam
working in my profession as long as i have you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it
jessica trembling hangs on greers every word
turning back go to the window jessica
theres something i want you to see
relieved at hiding the phone jessica gets up and moves to the attic window and gasps
down in the yard below jessicas eleven year old son ricky stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half court as one of the kidnappers a severe looking ex
con named hodges stands nearby watching
jessicas knees nearly buckle
hodges looks up and sees jessicas face in the window
then turns and tosses a basketball to ricky
i dont feel like it
nervously ricky begins to bounce the ball
jessica sees her son start shooting the ball completely oblivious to hodges who flicks open his coat revealing silenced pistol tucked into his waistband
you have three seconds to tell me where he really is or youre going to a funeral
theres nothing he can do
jessica drains ghost white
on the verge of passing out
down below ricky shoots baskets unaware of hodges closing his hand around his gun
please believe me
ricky plays innocently while hodges now cocks his pistol
frantic jessica locks eyes with hodges silently pleading for him not to do this
hodges stares back with glacial ice
sobbing uncontrollably please hes just a child
ryan is more frenzied than jessica
to himself goddamn it listen to her
she doesnt know
ricky backs up to retrieve a high rebound
jessica watches in horror as hodges begins to slowly draw his gun
i swear thats all i know
greer gives a sigh of disbelief
breaking down lax airport
theres a bar called left field
thats where we met
we were in college on our way to mardi gras
ryans completely floored by jessicas admission
she knew all along
please god i swear thats the truth
dont kill my son
looking impressed most people dont get past two
greer signals and hodges tucks his gun away
just as ricky turns around
the kid startles that hodges was so close
jessica watches as her son is led away to the guest house across the yard
once hes inside and out of view jessica collapses in a heap on the floor
greer is about to exit the attic when jessica speaks
you wont get away with this
when i didnt show up at the hospital someone must have called the police the police are the last people on earth im worried about
greer pulls a police scanner out of his jacket and shows it to jessica
listening to the call with every fiber of his being
we get one hit on the scanner about you well be picking out family plots comprende
suddenly a hummer with the bass thumping at ear shattering decibels pulls alongside ryans car
jessica hears it first
the pumping cacophony coming from the phone behind the beam
its subtle at first but grows increasingly louder
she closes her eyes praying greer wont hear it but greer does hear it
on the verge of leaving the room greer stops
cocks an ear
instantly jessica tries to cover it with her own voice
do you honestly expect me to believe were going to walk away from this alive
but greer isnt listening to her
he strides back into the room listening to the noise under her voice
to jessica shut up
oblivious of jessica desperately trying to clue him in
how can i shut up
you threaten to kill my child and you expect me to act like a mute
if this suddenly it hits ryan like a punch to the face
and he scrambles trying to cover the phone
your child then
greer shoots a hole in the wall next to jessicas head
afraid she shuts her mouth
ryan finds the mute button
presses it and greer listens intently
and hears nothing but silence in the still attic
soon he turns to leave
only when hes gone does jessicas heart start beating again
the hummer finally pulls away
niggas they would my niggas
as the thumping bass subsides ryan sighs with relief
x deason and ellis wait for greer who enters pulling off his mask
the left field sports bar at lax
are you positive
greer ignores him
then turns to deason
tell hodges we move in ten
deason nods and moves off
jessica lies on the floor sobbing into her knees
soft as an insects buzz we can hear ryan calling to her on the broken phone
answer me goddamn it i soon his voice pierces the suffocating gloom around her and she crawls desperately over to it
ryans freaking out
you all right
i thought they im okay
what are you doing
whyd you lie to them
welling up with tears do you think i like gambling with my sons life
i cant tell
you seem pretty good at it dont you see ryan
once they get craig were all gonna die
you cant know that for sure
does letting us live benefit them in any way
the only chance hes got is if you can get to the airport and find him before they do
theres no time
just get to the airport its suicide
theyll kill me
youre invisible to them
they dont know who you are
they dont know anything about you
youve got to try
lady ive jacked two cars been accused of being a child molester obliterated a car dealership and busted three caps in a verizon store
dont tell me im not trying
jessica tries another tack
look i have no right to ask you this ryan but you re my familys only chance
and i am asking
something in the way she says that last sentence a mixture of strength and vulnerability gets through to ryan
and against his own will hes swayed
gives in ill get the phone to your husband but thats gotta be it okay
ryan heading toward the airport floors the gas
a patrol car prowls down a quaint residential block
comes to a stop in the driveway of what we know to be jessica martins house
mooney gets out
the door opens revealing the attractive young woman from before
jessica kate martin
the woman nods
mooney is plainly disillusioned by the woman
maybe his hunch was wrong
cam i help you officer
she scans mooneys badge
shakes his head no
no i guess not
mustve been a prank
i m sorry to have b thered you ms
have a nice day
the woman smiles and nods and mooney walks off
when he gets to his car he crumples the paper with jessicas name and address and shakes his head chuckling at himself
as mooney drives off walks back into the house and flips open her cellphone
when she finishes dialing a familiar deep male voice answers
remember the fusco brothers
well ive got an itch that needs scatching
too close to make out who it is just yet whats the problem
were in the middle of a shit storm and i need you to put a leash put on an officer
an officer mooney from your division
now we start pulling back revealing the mans features
hes a desk sergeant
what would you want with him
i had to do a b e and he came snooping around the house looking for the owner
and what did you say
that i was her of course
continue pulling back
we can almost recognize him now
did he believe you
i think so
he said he thought someone was pulling a prank on him
mooney doing an investigation
whats are you really up to
the man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly its and no bullshit
right now youre entire departments hot so if im gonna get in the tub ive got to know how deep it is
ryan drives like madman toward the airport blowing through lights
jessica is frantic
where are you now
ill be at the airport in twenty minu twenty minutes
oh my god ryan youve got to drive faster
please snapping jessica this car has a sewing machine for an engine
i cant go any faster
jessicas voice trails off as she catches a glimp se of herself in an old mirror standing in the corner
staring at her own cracked reflect ion she breaks down but silently this time locked in he r own personal hell
for ryan the silence is deafening
despite his frantic driving he feels her pain
and hates being unable to help
theres an emotional beat then do you think god will forgive me
what do you mean
for what ive done
for giving up craig
ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice
jessica they have your kid
you had no choice
i dont know
i dont know
i heard what they were doing to you over there
you held out for as long as you could
grim beat my son and i are going to die here ryan
they already have us
but maybe i couldve saved craig
the truth of this has a profound effect on ryan
and just when jessica is about to lose herself to despair ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didnt know he had
jessica listen to me
i promise you im not going to let that happen
i could care less about your money
im risking my life cause i know im gonna get you and your family out of this
you hear what im sayin
there is a moment between them two people connecting on a human level
but the moment is suddenly cut short as a staticky voice start bleeding into their phone call some british asshole having his own phone call
yeah the show just bought me a cadillac xlr convertible
no you cant ride in it
not until you do something with that road kill you call hair
and whats with your makeup
kabuki theatre is not in style interrupting jessica
are you still there
this is a private call
jessicas voice starts fading as the crosstalk gets worse
washed in static im
ere but y
get off my line
are you there
i listen dude this womans in serious thats not my problem lady
suddenly static starts drowning out ryans side of the call
yelling over the static jessica dont hang up
you hear me
whatever happens look woman tell your kidnapping story to someone who gives a shit
ryan cant hear jessicas side of the conversation only the british assholes which comes in loud and clear
as ryan goes mental a car passes him on the opp site side of the road a new cadillac xlr convertible
inside is an appropriately asshole ish looking guy
he could only be the british asshole
ryan pulls a harrowing degree turn barely missing an oncoming car by inches
he races up to the cadillac which has a vanity plate that reads idol mkr
ryan looks through the window at the driver who in a typical la celebrity sighting turns out to be none other than simon cowell host of american idol
simon continues his spittle spraying rant at no one
it appears hes using the cars speakerphone
ryan eyes simons mouth while hearing over ryans cellphone murdered your housekeeper
dont bullshit me i work in the industry that invented it you stupid cow
ryan sees simon cowell mouth the words stupid cow in synch with the conversation
ryan floors the rent a cop car ahead of the cadillac and pulls a degree turn at an intersection cutting cowell off
cowell trying to avoid a collision slams on the brakes causing the cadillac to skid twenty feet
ryan jumps out of the rent a cop car hes left in the middle or the intersection and runs over to the cadillac banging on the window with the
cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes
give me that phone
or i shoot your car
cowell is prepared to comply but suddenly behind them
ryan notices a ton semi heading straight for the rent a cop car too late
the driver slams his brakes but explodes into tiny pieces of junk as the semi ploughs through it
flaming debris rains down around ryan and he covers his mouth unable to believe his shitty luck
aint that a bitch
ryan turns back to simon cowell
out of the car
cowell all but dives out
wheres your phone
its on speaker
ryan turns to the car
her voice says she cant believe her ears
relieved ryan jumps in the cadillac xlr and tosses his phone on the passenger seat next to a laptop computer
guns the engine and stomps the gas
as he passes the ruins of his rent a cop car he slows just enough to open the cadillacs door and snatch up his bag of verizon goodies laying on
the pavement then peels away
practically frothing at the mouth simon cowell chases after on foot cursing as his beautiful new cadillac disappears in the distance your careers over
you hear me
as jessicas voice resounds around him he notices the phones controlled through the radio
he turns it up
still shaken i thought they
i thought i was
its okay now
along with the million other cars find the cadillac threading its way up to the main terminal
ryan tries to avoid eye contact with the traffic cop assisting the flow of cars
ryan steps on the brakes seeing something ahead
whip pan around to see what ryans staring at
just ahead jessicas escalade is pulling up to the curb
your cars here
ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough looking men exit the vehicle
we recognize them as greer deason ellis and hodges
just find craig
ryan hops out but stops when the car calls out to him
what about me
ryan searches the car and finds the handset in the armrest
as he grabs it and races after greer into the airport a traffic cop comes up to the car
but its too late
ryans already gone
greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks honing in on bleeding prey
soon the kidnappers break up into two groups greer and ellis heading for the departure gates deason and hodges go the other way towards the information kiosk
ryan heads toward the
greer who waits in the line of passengers waiting to pass through airports metal detectors
this is ryans chance
he cuts through the line
my grandmother needs her walker
soon he makes his way to the front right behind greer and bumps into him
as he does notice ecu of ryan slyly slipping the rent a cops tiny
special into greers heavy motorcycle jacket
greer turns glaring but no ones there
greer looks around and theres a heart stopping moment that were afraid hes going to notice ryan who now stands innocently the next line over but greers eyes pass right
over him as he scans the crowd
ryan breathes a sigh of relief as greer finally turns away to walk through the metal detector and
sets off the alarm
excuse me sir
would you mind emptying your pockets over here
confused greer does
he lays his wallet on the table then his keys
then looks baffled as he pulls out the gun code red
the response she gets is stunning
security guards jump out of the woodwork with guns drawn
alarms go off
security gates start coming down
travelers start screaming and reaching for something wait this is a mistake as one the entire security force pounces on greer and ellis tackling them to the ground and immobilizing
and while that chaos is going on ryan slowly backs through to the metal detector
and starts running for left field
greer and ellis are crushed under the dogpile of security
behind them a door slams open and a formation of national guardsmen race on scene showing just how seriously security is taken in the wake of sept
ryan jogs down the concourse when attention travelers
due to a security problem all persons are required to clear the terminal and return immediately to the security checkpoint at the entrance to concourse b
at once everyone begins filing out of the terminal
ryan looks like a salmon swimming upstream the only figure moving against the tide of people rushing to get out
left field is in terminal c
listen to me
theyre clearing the terminal
before your husband passes me what does he look like
hes thirty eight
scanning the passengers thats not enough
whats he wearing
i dont know
we have completely different schedules
i was fast aslee p thinking it through a suit
he wears glasses thick rims like buddy holly or bingo
the buddy holly glasses is what did it
ryan sees a man in the distance hurrying in his direction craig
and just as ryan bee lines it towards craig excuse me sir ryan turns and finds a national guardsman right behind him
you cant be here now
you have to leave the area
but now sir
and as ryan is marched away he sees knees in their necks
hands covering their faces
if youd just listen to me
i can explain
someone reach into my coat pocket
goddamn it reach into my pocket
a young guardsman does and in a big reveal we see that he withdraws a badge
a los angeles policemans badge
ryans jaw drops
he cant believe it theyre cops
hey this ones on the job
holy shit jessica these guys are cops
the guardsmans superior officer examines it
is it real
the guardsman runs off turns back to greer is that your gun
its my piece
well youre supposed to declare it
we just got focused on a rabbit were here to nab
just then the young guardsman returns
badge matches his i
grumbles unhook em
stand down security
ryan looks relieved when the airports alarms shut off
system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation and all around security gates begin to rise
noticing to guard hey can i go now
can i go
the guard nods and ryan takes off like a shot racing back towards the bar
ryan spots craig martin outside the left field sports bar
ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through the concourse
hey what the hell
get your hands off m
shut up and keep walking
if they see us theyll kill us both
your wife sent me
would you hurry your ass
you need to hide
theyre here and theyre looking for you
they already have your family
craig looks at him growing terrified
ryan pulls craig into the mens restroom
i dont understand its okay
shell explain it to you
into phone okay jessica im handing you over now
relief can be traced on jessicas face
welling up ryan youve done so much
i dont know how to repay you
an awkward emotional pause falls between them
forget about the cash
just get you and y ur son home safely and well call it even
i know you will
ryan hands the cellphone over to craig
im gonna be outside this door
dont come out unless i get you
ryan walks out the restroom door as craig puts the phone to his ear
he sighs with relief its finally over
greer and ellis stride toward the bar
sotto voce nice move
what the hell you bring a gun for
sounding nervous what do you mean
just keep your eyes open
something weird is going on
greer stares daggers at everyone he passes
ellis io ks around before glancing down at a photo copy of a california drivers license
trying to act inconspicuous ryan guards the entrance to the mens room
hes starts to check out a magazine rack at an adjacent concession stand when he hears ryan turns
rack focus past ryan to craig standing fifty feet back holding the phone out
this isnt my wife
as it sinks in
my wifes name is patty
im not craig
in utter disbelief ryan turns back toward the gate and sees greer ellis hodges and deason cornering another man
and wearing buddy holly glasses
the real craig martin
greer seizes craig by the arm
make a scene and youll never see your family again
now whos here with you
craigs eyes swell with fear
greer looks around the crowded airport
ill forget i saw anything just leave them alone
greer manhandles craig toward the exit
for your familys sake you better not have done anything stupid
ryan snatches the phone from the bogus craig martin and hauls ass through a sea of travelers trying to catch up to x who scan the crowd bulling their way
through throngs of people leading craig martin between them
has more difficulty
gets stalled and swept away in the crowd long enough for the kidnappers to make it outside to their car
craig is forced into the escalade between greer and ellis
you goddamn animals better not have hu rt greer surprises him with a vicious elbow to the face
ellis whips a burlap hood over craigs head and they drive off just as
he said you looked distracted when you left
he wants you to relax bob
he said they found that kid you were looking for and that you were right it was all a prank
nothing to worry about
yeah i know
she pulls him back down for another kiss
what am i gonna do with you
youre gonna dance with me all night long until were too pooped to pop
youll never change
yes i will after i shower
they both share a laugh
she pushes herself down the hallway and he follows
as it pulls off the road onto the driveway of the kidnappers safe house and parks
craig still wears the hood as greer exits the car
as craig reaches blindly for a door handle ellis opens the door and shoves him out onto the driveway
greer yanks him up by his collar
with guns at his back craig is dragged inside the house
the darkness is oppressive
craig is pushed inside and pulls the hood off
goddamn it what the hell are you people going to craig
craig stops dead hearing the voice
scans the cobweb filled room seeing nothing then from the depths of the shadows jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost
jessica races for the safety of craigs arms but just as shes about to be embraced greer steps forward and yanks jessica back by her hair
she squeals in pain
craig moves to object but oof
deason sends him gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut
no dont hurt him
jessica struggles and with an annoyed shove greer sends her spilling into craig
she hugs tightly against him
when craig gets his wind back he comes to his knees and manages to croak out ricky
jessica nods gravely
hes here too
craig looks at his wifes face bruised and hurt and tears rise in his eyes
oh god jess
what have they done to you
but jessica wont let this moment be about pity
who are they craig
craig doesnt know what to say
tell them craig
tell them they have the wrong family
tell them theyve made a mistake but something in his eyes disagrees
what is it
u craig this isnt a mistake jess
and thats all it takes for jessicas world to shatter
greek emerges from the shadows startling them and backhands craigs jaw with the butt of his gun
where is the disc now
blood trickles from the corner of craigs mouth
you have to promise
if i give it to you
youll let my family go
ill tell you what you tell me where it is turns his gun on jessica and i wont blow her brains all over you right now
greer traces the barrel of the gun down jessicas cheek
craig looks utterly helpless
your call craig
its an eighty five cent bullet to me
greer lowers the gun to her neckline pulls her shirt lower
she pleads no at craig with her eyes but he finally breaks
enough you win
but if anything training gun on craig just shut up and talk
ryan rides back into the city in a cab
he listens some more then covers the phones mouthpiece and taps the cabbie on the shoulder
i dropped it down the mail chute at work
its gotta be in the mailroom
for ryans benefit weakly you hid it downtown
change of plans
i need to get to downtown fast
greer pulls craig to his feet
how will i know shes okay
shoving him move
when he gets near the door jessica is overcome with emotion and races to her husband
she brushes past hodges and hugs on tight to her husband tears flowing from her eyes
hodges goes to pull them apart but greer stops him
he knows this is going to be their last time together
i love you
craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a strong loving embrace
jessica hugs him closer
leans into his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return but what she actually whispers takes craig by surprise
quickly sotto voce pretend im telling you that i love you
theres an open phone line in here
youll have help at the office but if you give these men what they want were dead
jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws leaving craig with an utterly confused expression on his face
but before his look can betray him lets go
greer and hodges move forward ushering craig out of the room
when the door locks behind them jessica once again rushes to the phone
theyre going to fegan securities th and figuroa
ryan in the cab weaves through cars
im already on my suddenly the cab rounds a bend and grinds to a halt from backed up traffic
youve gotta be kidding me
to cabbie cant you back it up
the cabbie tries but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling up behind him
about a hundred yards up the road ryan sees the th street figuroa exit
hes so close
aw screw this
ryan throws some bills at the driver hops out the passenger side and starts running
a short time later ryan drenched in sweat sees craigs office building in the distance with an all cement exterior and few windows its a cellphone users nightmare
as ryan huffs and puffs toward the building he sees a bike messenger bullshitting with a hot dog vendor
ryan stops and stares at the package pouch on the seat and a flashy red bike helmet hanging on the handlebars
the helmet is futuristic like something the flash might wear
ryan eyes the messenger grabs the bike hops on and peddles for dear life toward craigs building with the messenger hot on his heels
as ryan arrives at the building the escalade pulls up in front of him and greer hodges and ellis file into the building
ill ryan skids to a stop
eyes the carrying pouch
ryan carrying the carrying pouch and bike helmet enters the lobby
greer and the others disappear into an elevator
n w inside static starts playing hell with their connection
fine in some areas terrible in others
wait we bzzt
ve to think
re we going to do
i have an idea
ryan fights his way through the tourists to the elevator bay
quickly scans the directory
among the long list of cpas theres a mailroom on the rd floor
mooney looking damn awkward in a suit and tie lies on the bed watching the news
in the background marilyn can be seen in the master bathroom sitting before the vanity mirror in her wheelchair
she puts on makeup
in five minutes ill need you to give me a hand
whenever youre ready hon
still wearing his holster he shifts uncomfortably on the bed as he watches the news
and authorities are now asking your help in identifying this man mooney jolts upright as they display a fuzzy photo of ryan from the verizon surveillance cameras
believed to be responsible for todays bizarre string of crimes most notably the theft of an cadillac at gunpoint
mooney watches as they continue to detail ryans wild crime spree but gets the bigger picture realizing that every event the verizon store searching for the martin kid
stealing the cadillac centers around the cellphone call ryan tried to tell him about this morning
detective gears turning mooney reaches for the phone on the bedside table
thank you for using pacbell
this is claire how may i help you
i need the phone number for a residence
jessica martin in brentwood
that number is
for an extra seventy five cents mooney hangs up dials the number
the phone rings and rings
eventually an answering machine picks up
hi youve reached the hom e of craig and jessica martin
we cant get to the phone right now but if you leave your name and a message mooney listens intently and is troubled
to an oblivious marilyn the woman at the house didnt have an accent
marilyn smiles realizing hes really talking to himself
mooney hangs up thoughts racing
he reaches behind him and without looking he grabs his wallet and keys
he then walks over to marilyn and kisses the top of her head
she knows him and knows somethings up
im sorry honey but i have to check on something real quick
youve got to be kidding delay the reservation if you have to ill be back in twenty minutes
and mooneys gone
twenty minutes my foot
a few secretaries get out on the second floor
alone with the others greer eyes the mysterious
special keep your eyes open
dripping with sweat ryan shambles out of the stairwell the bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his shoulder just as the elevator arrives behind him
as greer hodges and craig get out ryan turns and searches for the mailroom thats supposed to be here
where the hell is ah i he finds it and hustles into a wide counter separates ryan and a few business men and women from the mail clerks that busily
work the other side
ryan leans against the wall pretending to be an ordinary bike messenger waiting for a package as craig and the dirty cops enter brushing right past him
craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally
he ignores ryan completely whose face is mostly hidden by the tinted plastic visor attached to the helmet
craig notices an aging security guard stationed in the area but knows better than to make any waves
recognizing craig anything i can help you with mr
this might sound ridiculous but i dropped a dvd mailer into the chute this morning and i forgot to put down an address
happens all the time
let me see whats back there
gimme a sec
the supervisor disappears into the back room
greer and hodges take a seat only a few feet away from ryan
the moment is uncomfortable
and gets infinitely worse as
excuse me sir
ryan turns realizing with horror that another mail clerk is speaking to him
you waiting for a package
now everyones looking at ryan
facing away sure uh
im supposed to pick something up for mr
fountain over at the bonaventure
from what department
im not sure
they said it was a contract though i know that so what would that be legal
whats the tracking number
patting himself down uh
its looking grim
thankfully the supervisor reappears
i found a number of things that could be what youre looking for
mind coming back to take a look
hodges shoots craig a look go
the supervisor leads hodges and craig away to the back room
unfortunately greer stays behind
patting himself i might
maybe its on the clipboard on my bike
ryan watches greer out of the corner of his eye as hodges and craig disappear inside the vault
i uh may need to call somebody
theres an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office
one plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice envelopes another bin is overflowing with small mailers computer disks unlabeled video tapes etc
hodges cautiously watches craig shuffle through the mailers opening two or three before finding he turns one upside down and a dvd case slides out
a quick glance at the label adt digital surveillance
confirms its the disc
this is it
hodges seems uncomfortable with the supervisor hovering over his shoulder
ryan now sits by the window cellphone pressed to his ear
you believe this
everyones got their head up their ass over there
the mail clerk ignores him almost as much as greer wants to
greer opens his cellphone to make a call but when the signal is no good he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window at the end of the hall
you think you could just go outside and get your clipboard
just then hodges and craig come marching out of the vault
ryan glances at greer momentarily distracted on the phone
at hodges almost out of the bank
as he and craig near the door
a moment where craig finally locks eyes with ryan and suddenly realizes this is the guy
its now or never
ryan has to do something
to clerk screw the package
ryan stands and unable to find anything better snatches a metal hand truck sitting by the door and as hodges walks by swings it full force into hodges face whamm
hodges drops like a slaughterhouse cow
instantly employees hit the ground scream run for their lives
craig dives for the dvd case
the security guard has come to life drawing down on them
but ryan grabs him and moves racing out of the bank
at the end of the hall greer sees craig and ryan running out of the mailroom
drops his phone draws his gun just as the guard comes running out
his gun was fixed on ryan but now that he sees greer with a piece he trains his gun on him instead
ryan and craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire
flashing his badge the instant ryan and craig try to escape into a nearby stairwell greer turns his gun on the security guard
the security guard drops and greer aims his weapon at craig again
craig shot in the back slams against ryan with the impact
they fall half in half out of the stairwell
craig weakly shoves the dvd into ryans hands
but ryan is overwhelmed
his legs feel like a thousand pounds of jelly
as craig slumps to the ground ryan stares in shock but when greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them he dives into he starts flying down the stairs
but when he sees four building security guards racing up from below damn
he turns around and starts running up instead
hodges gets to his feet
stumbles out holding his gushing broken nose
yells at greer whos racing into the stairwell
with the guards and greer only a floor behind ryan thinks fast and chucks his bike helmet down the corridor elbows the in case of emergency glass setting off the
fire alarm and starts running up
seconds later when they reach that level one of the guards sees ryans helmet and the broken glass leading away
racing down the hall this way
the other guards follow
but greer isnt convinced
on a hunch he turns and continues running up also
peeking over the edge from the floor above
sees greer and hodges coming
big ass guns out and ready
the alarm bells scream
people start filling the stairwell on every floor
forcing his body to its very limits ryan bolts up the stairs until he sees the roof exit on the next floor up
he shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof
he slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as greer and hodges reach the floor beneath
see the door swinging shut but neither fall for the bait
they runs up toward the ryans eyes scan the rooftop
construction is in progress up here tarpapering
huge rolls of tarpaper lie about palattes holding supplies covered with tarps an industrial ryan quickly shoves a x under the doorknob to jam it
heart pounding he races to the buildings edge and looks down
nothing but a straight drop feet down
footsteps are approaching
pounding on the door
ryan darts behind a tarp covered mass of supplies just as greer shakes the x loose
he and hodges explode out onto the roof looking for ryan
greer encircles the huge air conditioner while hodges hunts behind a large satellite dish
to hodges here
cop instincts crackling greer stands on one side of the tarp covered stockpile and waits for hodges to secure the other
this is it they signal go at each other and spring around but ryans nowhere to be found
greer turns and sees a large aluminum chute that leads from the roof and elbows down toward a dumpster on ground level
greer peers down the chute for long seconds
but nothing can be seen from this angle
it all falls to blackness
greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence
the only sounds are incoherent screams coming from the stairwell
he eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster thinks
ryan wedging himself against the sides of the chute tries to be as still as possible
every slight movement makes the from his shirt pocket jessicas tiny desperate voice pleads
ryan please answer me i but ryan just sits there
afraid to move
terrified to discuss craig
greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it toward the open mouth of the chute
ryan holds his breath
his leg threatening to rabbit foot again
straining to hear greer its impossible not to hear you have to talk to me
ryan please you have to talk to me
the sweat from his hands causes the tiniest slip and as he catches himself there is a soft metallic boooong from the stressed metal
unable to ignore her pleas any longer ryan carefully pulls the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear
desperate to console her ryan bang
the tarpaper roll flies down the chute
ryan looks up to see it angrily launching itself right at him
he has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit
he presses himself to one side but wham
the bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist and he drops
ryan reaches out but the phone goes sliding down the chute
jessica hears a loud scraaaape crash and a wash of static
oh my god ryan
the hulking deason hears jessicas panicked voice and stands with a start
as he moves toward the attic he notices a small red light flashing behind the bar
as he passes he checks it out and whip pan down to what deason sees the red light is on one of the house phones
the line in use indicator
and its lit
shaking like a bear pissing pineapples deason rages away toward the attic
jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the floor when whamm
the attic door crashes open
deason looms there
sees the phone
jessica hurls the phone receiver away
deason roars up and grabs jessicas neck with one hand
hurls her across the attic and into the old mirror shattering it in a million pieces around her
desperate for anything jessica palms a tiny shard as she struggles to her feet
a two inch chip
she lowers her arm defeated out of breath
dont hurt me and ill do anything
there is a promise in what jessica offers that deason responds to
his fist flashes toward her throat making her flinch
but rather than hitting her he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat almost daring her to stop him
jessica trembles but that is all and just as deason begins to enjoy his work jessica jabs at his face but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect
she flicks her wrist up and slices the underside of his upper arm
deason flinches a little bit like a bee sting then laughs as he notices the tiny shard in her hand sarcastic oooh
but thats when he hears it
a dripping sound
deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve soaked in blood
it literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river
deason drains white dizzy
he looks at jessica confused
pumps up to liters of blood per minute
and theres only five liters in the human body
three seconds later deason crumbles
and jessica leaves the attic
ryans still trapped
sounds of approaching sirens in the distance
ryan listens for greer is he still there
two more heavy tarpaper rolls come right at him
the first one he gets lucky with but the second nails him before bouncing furiously away and ryan loses his grip completely and slides out of control
greer watches amazed when ryan actually tumbles out of the ass end of the metal chute into the dumpster
he drops the next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun
ryan is in serious pain
he frantically fishes through the refuse to find or rather whats left of it a million shattered pieces scattered everywhere
ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly hoped he could still use it
hes barely able to sit up when he ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster
as sirens get louder closer ryans got to make his move he jumps out of the dumpster landing on his ass on the opposite side of greer
bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and ryan summons his courage and takes off limping
blamm blamm blamm
greers pistol is ill equipped for long range shooting
the kids too far away by now
he grabs his walkie into walkie the kids outside headed toward the front of the building gotta go boss
the guards dead
hodges waits by the rooftop door looking concerned as cops spill out around him onto the roof
who the hells shooting up here
greer points to ryan bolting around the corner
sonofabitch shot the poor bastard right in front of us
jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest house prison that holds her son
getting her first good look
at the secluded premises shes on confirms that screaming would do no good
shes on her own
when she reaches the guest house shes shocked to find a huge lock on the front door
frantic she makes her way around the structure to a big bay window
though its protected by security bars she can see ricky through the glass
jessica pounds on the glass and ricky turns
when her son sees her he races to the bars
are you okay
i cant get out
jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with
a gold ford taurus pulls up in front
the driver door opens and mooney gets out
walks to the front door and knocks
but this time theres no answer
mooney rings the bell
suspicious he checks around the side
and sees the back door swaying in the wind
mooneys cop senses scream as he walks inside
a police scanner chatters in the background
the place is a shambles
someones been looking for something
he then sees blood streaks the floor
it leads from over by the telephone to underneath the pantry door
calling into house hello
drawing his gun mooney stalks carefully into a small staircase leads up to the second floor
as mooney starts up the steps boom up to the top to reveal hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs gun in hand
she listens to mooneys footsteps and when she thinks hes neared the top she springs out blasting away down the staircase
but mooneys not there
drop your gun now
i got you
now we see him
still down in the entryway behind some cover gun aimed and steady
i said drop it
bayback relaxes then whirls around disappearing down the hall
mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs following her into a narrow hallway with multiple open doorways on each side
the imposter jessica could be hiding in any one of them
taking care not to give himself away mooney inches down the hallway
and just when hes thinking that he may have successfully created an element of surprise for himself sfx squeeeeak the floorboards of the old house groan softly giving his position
instantly bayback swings out from a doorway right next to mooney taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang but mooney dives out of the way
blamm blamm blamm
two miss but the third shot nails his shoulder
mooney lands hard
blood spreading out under his white dress shirt
he cocks his head
listening for the sound of bayback ejects a magazine and is about to reload mooney jumps up returns fire slamming bayback against the wall with two
she collapses to the floor
angry the adrenaline drowning out the pain mooney turns to the kidnapper laying in the hall bleeding out
kicks her gun away and kneels
but for the first time bayback isnt tough
tell me where jessica martin is or you bleed to death right here
im a fuck this mooney kicks her ribs
bayback struggles for air reaching for him im a cop
bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain and dies
mooney stares at her
what did she say
starts patting her down
and thats when he finds her badge
she is a cop
mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks up the phone dials
request emergency back up and medical units
officers down at ryan wanders the streets
checks his wallet a measly four bucks
despair overtakes him and he almost gets crushed as a tow truck speeds by an old hyundai mounts it like a hippo
a lightbulb clicks on for ryan
ryan bolts to the nearest bus stop just as a blue line bus pulls up
jessica smashes a rear window with a long thick branch and uses it to try to pry the bars apart
the limited leverage wont enable her to bend them enough for ricky to squeeze through
and just then jessica leans her head around the back corner of the guesthouse and sees the escalade pulling in
to ricky get down
and jessica ducks out of view just as the pulls into the driveway
greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken from the cameras at the fegan securities building
the hotos are useless though as ryans face is obscured by his e helmet and visor
these are the best pictures you could get of him
he was wearing a visor
greer glares at him no shit and throws the pictures
the car parks and greer storms out followed by ellis and hodges
they head for the house and the moment they enter jessica reappears
but now shes staring at something
to son through window baby listen to me
i want you to get away from this window
i want you to go to the other side of the room as far away from the door as you can no dont leave me
dont leave me
the terror in his voice breaks jessicas heart
honey im getting you out of there
where are you going
im only gonna be gone a second and then were gonna go home but you have to do this first
its gonna be loud but dont be scared okay
now go find somewhere safe like i told you
ricky n ds and runs off into another room of the house
and as jessica rushes for the escalade paramedics apply a bandage to mooneys shoulder
mooneys pretty shaken up
shot went clean through
a few inches either way
mooney watches other paramedics carry sheet covered corpses into awaiting ambulances
flashbulbs pop from inside
a sedan pulls up and mooneys relieved to see tomlin get out
what the hell moon
its all over the radio
jack she didnt identify herself
what are you saying
i shot a cop
lowering his voice dana bayback
from the rd
she was one of the kidnappers
tomlin looks stunned by the revelation
let me call the tw three
see what the hells going on
tomlin pulls out a cellphone
i hate to think more cops are involved but did she say anything about the martin woman
never got the chance
detective tomlin frowns
a gonzolez tow truck drives up like the one we saw at the airport and stops temporarily beside simon cowell from the cadillac xlr incident who stands at the window
screaming at the jaded cashier
his car idles just on the other side of an imposing fence
just give me my goddamned car
dont take that tone of voice with me sir
ive already told you we do not release vehicles until all impound fees are paid
in the e
notice ryan skulking closer behind the gonzalez but i didnt cause it to get impounded
cant you understand that
it was stolen from me
sir do you want the car back or not
noticing cowell standing at the window ryan presses further into the shadows not wanting to be noticed
but im not paying for it
the cashier signals a grungy yard worker on the other side of the fence
take er back
howie nods and just as hes about to drive the cadillac back into the yard wait wait
all right you bloody fascist ill pay
but if theres even the slightest scratch on it
howie smiles thought so gets out and splits
as cowell angrily starts making out a check the cashier flicks the switch to open the gate and as it opens ryan slips in
he sneaks behind the wheel of the idling cadillac
and the moment cowell hands over his check vrrrrooom
ryan burns rubber out of there
hey thats my car
cowell chases it and watches in horror as ryan takes a speed bump too fast and tears the rear bumper off the noooooooo
as he zooms away ryan searches the passenger seat with his free hand
he hunts through the car and finds his blue thank you
as he flips it open his eyes spot the laptop on the floor of the passenger seat
ryan thinks pulls out his security dvd and pops it in
at first the screen is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook and as ryan grunts with frustration a hi res quicktime movie suddenly fills the screen the fagen securities building
a police pursuit in progress
three police cars skillfully box in a bmw with two hispanic youths forcing it to come to a dead stop
greer and hodges explode from their cars guns drawn
bayback and ellis come from the back
deason appears and he and hodges yank the teens out of the car who struggle frantically to avoid vicious baton blows
when one decks hodges and tries to run ellis shoots him in the back
inside the building craig gets up from his chair hurries into as craig enters frame inside the security office
and watches live greer wastes no time in shooting the second man execution style
ryan watches in horror
he pulls over too riveted to drive and watch simultaneously
finally understanding the magnitude of this disc
and as bayback drags a dead hispanic youth out of the frame legs disappear off screen in short bursts
and more terrifying greer stops picking up shell casings turning his head ominously toward the camera
greer motions to several others deason and bayback who rush out of frame toward the front entrance
angle one at the side door ellis and hodges start kicking in the door with full force
angle two greer outside unholstering his gun at the ryan glances at the cellphone in his hand gets an idea
angle one ellis and hodges finally kick open the door and rush inside angle three the cops rush inside the building consult the directory
angle four craig panicked reaches over to the dvd recorder the laptop monitor all static
the recording has stopped
im so screwed
as ryan speeds away from the curb he fingers his cellphone
greer walking up the safehouse stairs step by step nearing the attic that jessicas supposed to still be in
jessica quietly opening the door of the escalade trying not to give herself away
she climbs in behind the wheel and says a silent prayer of thanks when she sees that the keys are still dangling in the ignition
ryan in the speeding cadillac xlr selects last incoming call on the cellphone
holds his breath
as greer reaches the first landing the house phone starts ringing
ignoring it greer continues on and is about to turn the corner to the attic when boss you better take this
greer stops a footstep away from seeing the open attic door
from the bottom of the steps hodges tosses him a cordless phone
greer puts it to his ear
ryan inside the cadillac xlr growls into the cellphone
shut up and listen to me asswipe
i got what you want
who is this
you know who this is shithead
to our surprise ryan isnt talking to greer
but to the same telemarketer that called him earlier
look sir we can take your name off our list if you want but you dont have to get nasty what
who is this
at mastercharge credit union
a frickin telemarketer
but i just hit last incoming call ryan suddenly puts it together
the telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly
greer listens intently to a call
so who is on his end of the phone
look captain weve got to do everything we can to protect this guy
i mean shit with all his years in hes owed a little
hes with you
howd he find out
said something about a kid who came into the station earlier greer grimaces putting it together
stumbled out of brian wilsons hamper
something like that
take care of him
thats more than tomlin bargained for
are you sure thats necessary sir
you know once the shitstorm starts theres nothing i can do to save you
thats what i thought
ill tell him
tomlin hangs up with a calm flick
the paramedic finishes up mooneys bandage
keep pressure on it until you get it stitched
whats the word
not g od
s not throwing out any lifelines with all thats going on
re mooneys sh ulder come on
you can write a statement while i take you to the hospital
greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket continuing up the stairs
hodges follows staring expectantly
whatd he say
you know a desk jockey named mooney
greer sees hodges gaping up the stairwell
following his look greer turns
and sees the attic door wide open
further in he can make out deasons bloody body and the rigged together phone
in fact the only thing greer doesnt see is jessica
greer turns and pounds down the stairs
she twists the key and stomps the gas sending the monster suv on a collision course with smashhh the guest house window
the bay window shatters and the security bar snap like twigs as the escalade bulldozes through
unable to open the door because of all the debris jessica rolls down the window and yells to her son
but hes frozen in fear at all the noise and dust
he shakes his head
its okay now
were gonna go home
glances back nervously ricky please
somehow the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to the escalade where his mother scoops him up into the cab just as the kitchen door bursts open
and greers team spills out into the yard
they spot her instantly
get out of the car
get out of the goddamned car
as they rush at her jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out but the escalades stuck
caught by the debris the wheels just spin
jessica rocks the car forward and back
forward and back
and just as it finally comes loose krrraaashhh
the window next to jessicas head explodes in a shower of tempered glass shocking us
two arms snake in and wrap around jessicas neck
but jessica stomps on the gas hoping the big car will pull her free
as the escalade surges away across the lawn greers vice like grip holds pulling jessica out the broken window and thump
to the guest house debris below
as jessica watches in horror careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar
hodges races over and yanks ricky out
balls his fist in jessicas hair and yanks her around hard
jessica screams as he yanks her to her knees
dont hurt her
seething mad greer rips his gun from its holster and is literally about to blow jessicas brains out when the entire world stops
theres an awkward moment jessica cowering greer recovering the phone just ringing and ringing
the telephone is the only sound in the world getting louder and louder with each ring until greer answers it
bad timing tomlin
but it isnt tomlin on the phone this time
its feel like a trade
greer snaps his fingers at hodges indicating its ryan
the mysterious bike messenger
how did you get this number
in the cadillac push in on ryan t show the cellphone manual he picked up at the verizon store in his hand
gotta love modern technology
my new phone knows the numbers of the last fifty incoming calls
what do you want
just the woman and her kid
who are you
whats your name
my name is f you
ive got your shit pal it doesnt work that way
turns to ellis go cut the kids throat
though ryans eyes widen in panic his voice remains cool
nice talking to you
and ryan hangs up
he waits nervously sweating staring at the phone for the longest seconds of his life ring
cmon damn it ring
then it does
ryan waits a couple rings slowing his speeding heart then nonchalantly picks up
so how do you want to do this
put on a big ass ronald mcdonald smile apologize to the kid and the woman and bring em to the santa monica pier
dude youre lucky im still talkin to your sorry ass
you do as i say exactly as i say or i hang up now and slap this bitch on nightline you know what im sayin
theres a long beat
but you come alone
how will i recognize you
you let me worry about that
whats your cell number

i can hardly wait
ryan hangs up
a scared but satisfied smile
mooney in the sedans shotgun seat is trying to write his statement
but with his bad shoulder its useless
he winces in pain when the sedan jerks at a four way stop
to tomlin shouldnt we be on pico
to the right some people wait for a bus
tomlin turns left
county will have a six hour wait
ten if they know youre a cop
mooney grunts his gratitude as tomlin heads toward a wasteland of warehouses
and just as any potential witnesses vanish from sight tomlins cellphone rings
he lowers the gun and answers the call
is it taken care of
were making a trade with the kid at the santa monica pier
your boy can id the kid for us
bring him down
relieved im on it
tomlin flips his phone closed and turns the car around
we caught a break with the kid
hes been spotted on the pier
think you can hang on a little longer
just enough to id the kid before we patch you up
mooney clearly doesnt want to say no
but it hurts
up to you
lets solve the goddamn thing
an aerial shot at magic hour tracking up the coast to the boats clog the water and th usands of spectators line the shores of the pacific watching the heal
the bay concert on the pier
with all the cheering dancing and drinking going on its like times square on new years eve
ryan drives up in the cadillac xlr and parks
a group of college friends stare enviously at the car as ryan gets out
you like it
tosses him the keys happy birthday
the friends jaws hit the ground
and as they run to the cadillac xlr ryan disappears into the crowd
creeps down the wooden bridge and stops at the bottom the base of the pier
inside hodges sits behind the wheel jessica and ricky lay bound and gagged in back
hodges lifts his nextel and thumbs the button
im in position
greer and ellis are on top of the carousel building
ellis lays on his belly with a police sniper rifle and some fuzzy photos of ryan from the mailroom
we skim the faces of the crowd hunting for ryan and locates hodges
greer is talking to ellis whos scanning the crowd rocking to the concert only take the kid out if its clean
no guess work
the last thing we needs a stampede
greer paces anxiously when suddenly his nextel rings
he answers it though its hard to hear over the music
greer nods to ellis its him
how do you want to do this
first show me that jessica and the kid are okay
do you have the disc
where are they
see the black van at the bottom of the bridge
passenger side window
beat okay got it
greer muffles the phone against his leg
whispers to ellis hes within visual of the car
greer takes his police walkie and toggles it
hodges show the woman
lower the passenger side window only
the passenger side tinted window rolls down
hodges sits jessica up then her kid displaying them for a few seconds before powering the window back up
did you see that
greer muffles the phone again
whispers to ellis
hes around the passenger side
have you found him yet
throws his photos i dont know what the hell he looks like
hes the one on the cellphone you idiot everyone in the crowd is on a cellphone
everyones on a cellphone
ive got like fifty possible targets here
ellis cross hairs flit from one person on a cell to another to another
tomlin and mooney move along the crowd scanning the sea of spectators for ryan
mooney moves more slowly behind tomlin skin looking pale sheened in sweat and laboring for breath as they hike up the bridge
now you show me something
put them on the ferris wheel
i want to see them safe first
that wasnt part of the deal
the top of the bluffs overlooking the pier below
among the crowd some skate rats scare the elderly
ive been thinking
does me no good to hand over the dvd and then you and the funky bunch take us out
x i swore i wouldnt do that
like you swore to protect and serve
the reference brings greer up short
theres a moment then you know a lot
and ill forget a lot too
but not until theyre both out of danger
now pan around to reveal ryan among the crowd wearing a surfing windbreaker hooded with waterproof pockets but wheres his cellphone
moving closer we see ryans wearing the earbud mike from the verizon store
with the earbud concealed under the loose hood ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show
your choice man
the martins or the dvd
either way im not hanging around any longer
you got five seconds then i disconnect your ass
you sure you know what youre doing
on the other end of the phone greer wrestles with his better judgment three
but ryans got him by the balls
angrily greer lifts his walkie
into walkie hodges put em on the ferris wheel
i shut up and do it
most people never get past two
greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him
to ellis keep an eye on them
as soon as we make the trade take the woman and her kid out
ryan watches from a distance as hodges exits the van
dont screw me kid y u wont live long enough to enjoy it
oooh i think i just pissed myself
ryan looks optimistic when hodges gets out and opens the back door
and just as hes on the brink of success
a womans hand grabs the hood of ryans windbreaker and rips it away from his face
wheels him around
its there you are
where the hell were you
get away from here
know how many hours i waited for you to bring back those stupid shirts
whatd you do
sell them on the prominade yourself
but ryans got no time for this
a sickly looking mooney glances at the commotion and sees the hoodless ryan
motioning to tomlin thats him
there he is
ryan desperately tries to shoo chloe away
it isnt safe to talk get it
i people are after me
shrugs free what are you high
suddenly mooney steps up beside ryan and grabs him
winded ive been
you kid but ryan struggles thinking mooney is with the bad guys
mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it
let go of me
sonofabitch let go
s greers pissed
pacing on the roof when
t ellis ive got him
instantly greer jams the walkie to his face and we hodges is about to let jessica out of the van when he hears hodges do not let them go
do you hear me
do not let them go
ryan struggles with mooney
the crowd completely ignores them in favor of the raucous concert
in the heat of battle ryans cellphone clatters by chloe s feet
sweating profusely jesus kid calm down
trying to break mooneys stronghold ryan shoves him backwards slamming his injured shoulder into the pier mooney screams out in pain and grabs his shoulder releasing ryan who breaks away
and turns to see mooney collapse to the ground holding his blood soaked shoulder
ryan looks over to chloe whose face is a combination of shock and confusion
oh my god checking mooney someone call
a crowd starts to gather when ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back
its over kid
ryans got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end of the pier
mooney from his prone position he catches a glimpse of tomlin backing ryan quietly into the crowd
not trying to help
not calling for an ambulance
in that instant mooney knows hes been betrayed
tomlins in on this
for all the trouble youve caused youd better have that goddamned disc
where is it
just then greer appears through the crowd ahead of him
like a nightmare he closes in
ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his windbreaker and zips it up
ryans world is spinning the noise the crowds the he kicks back hard into tomlins shin
it is enough for tomlin to release his grip and ryan bolts
tomlin recovers and raises his gun to get a bead on ryan but it causes the crowd around him to panic
dudes gotta gun
ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see greer and tomlin quickly gaining ground
he has to make a choice either go over the railing or deal with greer and tomlin
ryan decides on the ocean
he runs to a man fishing with his son and uses their ice chest as a step
just as he jumps the rail tomlin gets off a shot
the bullet tears through ryans shoulder as he spins headlong into the pacific
tomlin and greer run to the railing and see ryan hit the choppy water below
under the pier
ryan flails panicking exhaling all his air and sucking in the dark water of the ocean ryan is struggling
his lungs convulse trying to breathe burning like a thousand red hot needles are pushing their way through his chest
the waves pound against the thick pylons below the pier
just as ryan comes up for air hes slammed into a wooden pylon
ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater bashing him repeatedly against the pillars
its not pretty
as he struggles toward the shore hes constantly thrown back and forth underwater like a rag doll
tomlin races down the pier towards the beach greek aims his weapon at the ocean daring ryan to surface
ryan finally makes it to shore coughing retching
he crawls up the sand out of breath blood trailing behind him
he unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts pulling out the cellphone which thank god is actually dry
ryan forces himself into action stumbling exhausted into a the place is dark
an array of rowing shells covered in ghostly flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted
this place is also filled with storage equipment such as buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol
tomlin racing through the sand under the pier
he spots ryans bloody footprints and follows them toward the ryan sees tomlin coming
ryans trapped like a rat and dripping blood everywhere
he looks for anything thatll save him but finds only useless boating tools sanders saws box cutters etc
to himself think
chloe hands mooney a cup of water and frantically looks around for the paramedics
mooney starts rising to his feet
you better lie still
the paramedics should be here shortly
but mooneys obstinate
he rises despite her best efforts
just keep that ambulance close by
and as he stumbles off tomlin by the time his eyes adjust to the dark ryan is nowhere to be seen
tarps undulate over jumbles of boxes and equipment everywhere a hundred places to hide
alone tomlin stalks among the equipment
hunting ryan like a snake on the scent or prey
youre wounded kid just give me what i came for and ill let you all go
police sirens in the distance grow louder
tomlins offer goes unanswered
thats when he notices the blood on the ground
tomlin smiles following ryans trail to a pile of blood smeared tarps where the trail ends
its obvious ryan used these to staunch his wound
hes gonna have to search this whole place then suddenly tomlin gets an idea
he pulls out his phone making sure its concealed from view and writes a text message to x ext
santa monica pier night greer pulls out his ringing cell phone
on the text screen it says call him
greer flashes an wicked grin and dials the last number on his call log
tomlins ready to pounce
sfx nearby ryans cellphone starts to ring betraying him
instantly tomlin hones in on the noise coming from under a bulky tarp along the far wall and empties his gun at it
the tarp shreds
nothing could survive the assault
tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp
shoulda stayed at home this morning kid
and just then tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing ryans cellphone
and nothing else
i was about to say the same to you
what the and in the instant tomlin realizes hes been tricked he turns and ryan hits tomlin in the face with a x smashing his teeth and sending him backwards
before tomlin has time to rec ver ryan swings again
and his knee cap is obliterated
ryan looking like a psychotic babe ruth gives tomlin two more vicious whacks before grabbing his cellphone and high tailing it out of there
hodges has no luck on the walkie
jessica cuffed from behind covertly wriggles the handcuffs under her ass toward her feet
ricky terrified screams no with his eyes
but she knows shes out of time
ryan losing blood he does his best to move quickly through the sand
he stumbles but regains his footing as he makes his way towards the stairs leading up to the pier
ellis still on the roof scans the pier
hodges locates ryan emerging from the stairs
hes in the parking lot
hodges listening intently to the walkie
ive got a clean shot
we dont have the dvd
just hold his location
hodges parking lot now
just as hodges reaches for the door handle jessica wraps her cuffs around his throat throws her legs against the back of his seat and pulls like her life depended
hodges chokes flails digs and claws at the cuffs but his fingertips are no match for jessicas muscular legs
rickys paralyzed with fear
ricky bolts from the car
v police cruisers race down the pier bridge desperately trying to avoid the fleeing crowd
jessica finishes squeezing the last bit of life out of hodges
she finally exits the van but not before grabbing the walkie talkie and gun
ryan sneaking his way through parked cars heads in the direction of the police cruisers on the bridge
mooney scanning the pier for ryan hears hes heading for the cops
we should do it now
mooney looks to the roof of the carousel and sees ellis
drop your weapon
ellis quickly swings his rifle and bam
mooney shoots ellis in the head causing him to slide off the carousel roof
ryan stopping in his tracks looks in the direction of the gun shot
he turns around only to find a pistol pointed right at his face greers pistol
he pushes ryan behind a suv so as not to be seen by the cops
no more bullshit
just give me the goddamn disc
ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the greer snatches it and smashes it to pieces
fragments fall through the cracks in the pier to the ocean below
ryan pale as ghost knows hes seconds from meeting his maker
this is about to be the most enjoyable part of an extremely shitty day
and just as hes about to pull the trigger blam
jessica fires a warning shot
greer startled spins around to see jessica pointing hodges gun in his face
tell me why i shouldnt kill you
for the first time greer actually looks frightened
recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes he sputters but nothing comes out
ryan weak and pale with blood loss looks up at his guardian angel
jessica trembles with rage a tear falls
i have to
lower the weapon jessica
jessica looks behind her and sees mooney surrounded by eight trying to reason with her rickys safe
its all going to be okay
put it down
jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into ryans face
thank you for keeping your promise
as the cops move in and drag greer to his feet ryan calls out to him
hey man your shitty day is about to get a whole lot shittier
ryan flips open his phone and on the screen plays the security footage of the murder in the parking lot
we see that ryan mustve copied the dvd with his videophone
aint that a bitch
and through the tears jessica manages a laugh
a small one
but enough to let us know everythings going to be okay
and as we pull back on the scene the ecu of a television screen showing an aerial shot of the santa monica pier
pull out to reveal chloe and ryan sitting in a hospital dayroom engrossed in the news report that plays in the far corner of the room
ryans shoulder has now been bandaged his arms in a sling
the santa monica pier was the latest setting in the ongoing rd precinct corruption scandal
ryan ackerman a local resident risked his life to save a family kidnapped by officers to cover up
chloe strokes ryans scalp with her fingers
how does it feel to be a hero
re his wounds it hurts
but youre making it way better
im just glad its over
smiling modesty can be sexy
and to think this was our first date
next time skip the shower
in the background jessica and ricky exit a hospital room and join the two lovebirds
craigs very weak but the doctors say it looks promising
hes probably going to have to walk with a cane but thats the worst of it
im just thankful
chloe senses that jessica and ryan might need a moment alone
come on ricky lets get a hot chocolate
a small smile forms on rickys exhausted face
chloe leads ricky down the hall
i cant believe i almost lost everything that means
i dont know how i can ever thank you
weak smile dont ever call me again
a shared laugh then as they turn to the television a cell phone rings on a nearby table
they turn to look at it neither one apparently having any idea to whom it might belong
but this time as we pull back on the scene we realize no ones going to answer it
