written by gary whitta june a civilization is destroyed only when its gods are destroyed
emil cioran bare as all hell
the trees stripped of their bark and white like ghosts
some torn violently from their roots and felled
stark gray sunlight shafts between the trees clouded by a creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything
a light snow flutters
the world monochrome lifeless and cold
a cat prowls across the dead earth
barely recognizable as the domestic breed it might once have been
its fur mangy and rank body rib thin from starvation
it moves slowly cautiously
sniffing the air scanning the forest alert
trusting nothing of its surroundings
it paces across a leaf strewn clearing closing stealthily on a dead man splayed face down in the earth
his feet bare
face frozen in a grim death mask
a gaping gunshot wound in his head the dried blood caked around it matting his hair
as the cat moves closer approaching warily about thirty yards away
someone is watching
slow deep breaths heard through a gasmask respirator
the mirrored lenses reflecting the forest clearing locked onto the cat
the slow metered breathing continues
the cat slows but continues pacing toward the corpse
more cautious than ever
it inches forward sniffing at the body
on the watcher
crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled tree
concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves twigs and bracken
a ghillie suit of the kind used by snipers
the cat sniffs at the dead mans hand frozen by death in a grotesquely contorted claw
the animal still unsure
looks around again checking its surroundings for predators
the watcher moves almost imperceptibly
the leaves covering him rustle ever so slightly as we hear just barely the familiar creaking sound of a bow string being drawn taut
the cat hears it
looks up alert
staring right at the watcher but he is too well camouflaged to be seen
an interminable tense beat is the prey going to flee
finally the cat turns its attention back to the carcass nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the mans fingers
the watcher looses the arrow
it sails across the clearing and skewers the cat clean through
it drops to the ground
the watcher stands shaking off the ghillie suit revealing him to us for the first time
he wears a weather beaten knee length duster
hooded sweater with more layers beneath that
torn pants and scuffed work boots
everything filthy and battered from years of wear
along with the goggles his face remains obscured by a disposable paper dust mask and a crudely fashioned fur hat with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been
around his neck he wears a silver saint christopher pendant hanging from a frayed twine cord
his name is eli
he shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing
crouches beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow
wipes the blood from the shaft then reaches down to collect the body
suddenly the cat screeches and flails wildly
eli recoils falling backward stunned as the cat mortally wounded but fighting to the death bites and claws desperately at him
eli struggles violently with the cat wrestling it to the ground and grabbing up a hunk of fallen branch
he holds the writhing animal down and clubs it until it lays still
he sits back breathing harder than the dustmask will allow
he yanks it down revealing the dirty unshaven face beneath
impossible to tell his age but certainly not a young man
for a moment he just sits there
then bundles up the dead cat and returns to the mangled tree stump
folds away his ghillie suit into a nearby rucksack which he hauls up onto his back
a canteen dangles from the backpack a shotgun strapped to its side
eli reaches down for his final possession an old samurai sword in a scabbard which he slings across his back
he gazes up at the sky
a snowflake drifts down and lands on his cheek
he reaches up and brushes it away leaving a black smear on his face
not snow after all but some kind of ash
eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt
lined by more of those ghostly stripped bare trees
he sniffs the air breathing it in
checks the road in both directions
a few yards away is the rusted burned out chassis of a car
he heads toward it
the car rests half on the road half in the adjacent ditch
stripped of its tires and engine
in the drivers seat is a mummified body
a bullet hole piercing its forehead
eli regards the body dispassionately
tries the door handle but its jammed
he yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open
he leans in and checks the mans feet
no shoes or socks
eli curses under his breath
he leaves the car behind and heads on down the road
as he walks away we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose held in place now only by a rubber band
eli continues down the road
he ambles along slowly a man in no hurry
a man who has been walking a long time
the road has since emerged from the forest
passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk
the sun beats down from directly overhead
the sky has no color to it paper white
the unfiltered suns stark light leaves everything seeming bleached out over exposed
crane up as eli walks on
on the horizon is the silhouette of a city
or what was once a city
columns of black smoke rise from within casting a deathly pall over the skyline
burned and broken skyscrapers jut out like tombstones
eli reaches a fork in the road and stops
the road hes on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon
the other fork continues on into the wasteland
after a brief pause eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork away from the city
little more than a main street lined with storefronts
eli walks steadily along side stepping rubble and debris
ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street
he passes by abandoned stores every one picked clean
empty shelves smashed windows
looted and burned
he doesnt even look inside knowing already that he will find nothing
until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop
an old fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze
he steps into the doorway and pushes open the door
it swings open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust
eli steps inside
like all the others the store has been cleaned out
shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the floor
the whole place reeking of dead musty air
eli looks around just to be sure
drags his sheathed sword idly along the empty racks as he checks them
as he turns back for the door his foot nudges against a shoe box
its not empty
he crouches down flips the lid off hopefully
and pulls out a ladys high heeled shoe
he strokes the shoe leather with his hand
shakes his head grimly then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves
on the outskirts of town
in disrepair peeling paint broken windows damp stained walls but habitable
eli stands in the front yard surrounded by brownish overgrown weeds
thinking it over
turns to face the setting sun
it will be dark soon
he turns back toward the house
the front door is sent crashing open with a hard kick revealing eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight
the shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready
he moves inside
another dead place
flies buzzing in the still dank air
everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved
an eerie snapshot of a world long gone
every cupboard empty
eli checks each one poking around in the dark corners with his sword but finds nothing but dust
he opens the freezer checks inside
empty save for a small icebox
the lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk
eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open
inside are the wizened petrified remains of a human hand
floating in slimy discolored water
the smell vile and thick enough to make eli retch
he quickly jams the lid back on
a wooden bedframe stripped clean
the dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor
eli moves toward a large walk in closet and opens the door
no clothes inside just the near fossilized corpse of a man hanging by a noose
twisting gently back and forth
unfazed eli crouches down and checks the mans feet
an old pair of converse all stars hang limp from the mans skeletal ankles
eli calmly sets about unlacing them
he checks the size theyre a fit
he upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them
discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers laces them up
he walks around pacing up and down getting a feel for the new shoes
they feel good
for the first time he smiles
eli sits in the corner roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small campfire
he cleans the animals pelts as he watches it cook
pokes at the meat with a pen knife checking it for done ness
it appears ready to eat
he clasps his hands together in prayer
dear lord thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast
he speaks quietly his voice barely above a whisper
even so we catch the accent a raspy old world midwest drawl like john wayne or some other long forgotten western icon
thank you for the many gifts that you have given me
thank you for your protection and your guidance
thank you for bringing me this far
i know my long journeys end is near
i ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men
i wont let you down
he signs a cross over himself then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat
takes a bite savoring the taste with great relish
to him its grade a filet mignon
it appears as though he is talking to himself
until a rat emerges from his coat pocket whiskers twitching keenly
eli offers it some meat
the rat gnaws enthusiastically at it
the last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedrooms broken window
eli rummages through his backpack pulls out a small package wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string
he sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it
its an old leather bound book
the binding cracked and pages dog eared thumbed through a thousand times and more
eli gazes lovingly at it
lets his fingers play across the beat up old leather cover
a cherished thing
he begins to read half hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight
silently mouthing the words as he reads them
eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before
replaces it in his pack then reaches in for something else
a car battery
old and streaked with acid stains
attached to a tangled bunch of electrical wiring and jumper cables
eli reaches into his pocket and produces an ipod
badly beat up the case pretty much held together with duct tape
eli attaches the battery cable to the ipod and places the headphones in his ears
the music plays
mozarts piano concerto no
in d minor
eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up
the music swells
elis fingers dance and swoop in the air as though conducting an orchestra as he is transported by the music to another world a world far from this one
sunlight shafts through the window
eli sits slumped in the exact same position headphones still in his ears
the rat scurries up elis chest and licks his face
slowly he wakes realizing he fell asleep with his music still on
checks the battery
its dead drained overnight
he gets to his feet moves to the window and checks outside
all seems quiet
he loads up his backpack and weapons
come on now
the rat scurries up his leg onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket
eli turns and moves out
the gate squeaks shut behind eli as he exits the front yard
he breathes in the air turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face
then turns away from it and walks on down the road
the landscape barren and featureless road lined with dead trees
eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt
the road is strewn with burned out cars and debris from a world long dead
a warped metal sign by the side of the road reads litter removal next two miles by circuit city
up ahead is a hunched figure by the side of the road
eli arrives to see that its a young woman
bone thin dressed in filthy rags
skin plagued by an unpleasant rash
the shopping cart she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch spilling its contents
blankets tins of food old clothes
shes on her knees trying to gather it up
she looks up as she sees eli approaching
instantly cowers from him raising her hands to protect herself
please dont hurt me
here take anything you want
you want some food
she offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand
eli stands there looking at her
his expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles
im not going to hurt you
thats what the last guys said
eli bends down and picks up a couple of the carts spilled contents
steps forward and offers them to her
cautiously she reaches out and takes it
could you help me
the wheel came off
i cant fix it
maybe if i could get it out of the ditch
but i cant
eli looks at the cart
it has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a thick bracken hedgerow that lines the road
he looks again at the girl
her faded blouse is unbuttoned revealing a little cleavage
her skirt torn along the leg showing more than a little thigh
he sniffs the air
watches the hedgerow warily
just like the cat he hunted his senses heightened and on alert
behind the hedge three roadside bandits are crouched waiting to pounce
each armed with a crude blunt weapon
they exchange anxious looks
eli sniffs the air again then backs away from the girl
one good thing about no soap any more
you can smell the road agents a mile off
the girls face falls as eli backs up
the three bandits emerge from the hedgerow brandishing their weapons
a couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to elis
the bandit leader grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes yanking her painfully to her feet
what did we tell you
he pushes her away she crumples to the road in a heap
eli backs away but two more armed bandits drop from hiding in the trees behind cutting off his escape surrounding him
what you got there in the pack
yeah thats what they all say
how about you take it off real slow and tip it out sos we can take a look
bandit notices the shotgun strapped to the pack
hes got a gun
shit it aint loaded
they never are
aint that right old man
open the fucking pack or die
i cant do that
the bandit leader steps forward aggressively
now within striking distance of eli
he grins teeth filthy and rotten
want us to do it for you
we can get it off real easy after weve hacked your fucking arms off
eli remains perfectly calm
and though he speaks with a soft even tone there is something formidable about his voice
its real important you boys listen to me and understand
the man i work for you do not want to cross him
see im under his protection
you stand in my way you stand in his
and he will cut you down with a righteous fury through me
for i am his faithful instrument
the bandit leader looks at eli incredulously
and then laughs
the other bandits laugh along nervously
what the hell are you some kinda preacher
something like that
well i got news for you preacher man
whatever kinda god you reckon yourself to be working for he left these parts a long time ago
he aint here to protect your ass
now take off the pack and set it on the ground
eli doesnt move doesnt say a word
the bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder
you fucking listening to me
i hear you
you lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back
the other bandits exchange nervous looks
this is not how its supposed to go
all right i had just about enough of this shit
he lunges forward grabs the shoulder strap of elis pack
if you blinked you missed it
but somehow eli has now drawn his sword
a rivulet of blood snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt
bandit leaders hand is still gripped firmly around elis shoulder strap
but its no longer connected to his arm
the severed hand hangs there from the strap dripping blood
bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was
looks at it in shock and horror
he just cut my fucking hand off
my fucking hand
eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leaders legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt
his eyes dart around as though confused
what you standin around for
whats he talkin about kiss him
hes in shock
he means kill him
a tense beat
and then the four remaining bandits attack eli all at once weapons flailing
eli flourishes the sword
a blur too fast to follow
but its clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill
it is over in moments
the four bandits lay slain in the road blood pooling out onto the asphalt
the bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand a few yards away
eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach
i told you you wouldnt be getting that back
bandit leader looks up to see the figure of eli bearing down on him silhouetted ominously against the sun
he looks for a moment like an avenging angel something not of this world
who are you
my name is eli
and with that eli runs him through with his sword
he turns to see the young woman slumped in the road sobbing
she cowers again as he approaches certain that she is next
he walks past her
sheathes his sword then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it
the woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart
take it and go on your way
and dont fall in with men like these again
no good can come
she looks at him puzzled
why are you doing this
eli says nothing
walks back to the slain bandits crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies
he takes a scarf from around the neck of one
finds a zippo lighter on another checks that it works and pockets it
the five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch half covered with dirt
the best burial they are going to get
eli stands before them head bowed in prayer
he speaks quietly and quickly a speech he has given many times
god the father of mercies through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of
the young woman stands a few yards away watching him transfixed
she has never seen anyone like him
through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace and i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father and of the son
and of the holy spirit
he turns and walks away down the road passing the woman
a good man
there are no good men on the road
where are you going
can i come with you
he doesnt even turn back to look at her
he walks on into the horizon
straddling the desert like a giant crumbling monument to a long dead civilization
eli steadily climbs his way up
he comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has collapsed at mid point
rusted iron rods jut out from where the roadway has been severed
eli just stands there at the edge for a moment feeling the wind whip around him his coat fluttering in the breeze
the overpasss collapsed section is now just a mountainous pile of rubble that leads down to the road below
eli steps onto the rubble
about to make his way down when he freezes
he hears something
the faintest of sounds
he takes cover peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see two people walking together on the road
we see everything from elis p
too far to make out much detail but apparently it is a middle aged couple
the man pushes along an old wheelbarrow covered by a tarp as the woman seemingly his wife walks alongside
the barrows rusted wheel gives out a plaintive rhythmic squeak
eli ducks down again as he hears something else
this time much louder
the menacing growl of motorcycle engines
four bikes in total
riding out of the horizon closing in on the couple
they see the bikes coming and panic
try desperately to steer the barrow off the road
the bikes screech to a halt and the four riders dismount
brandishing a variety of weapons
the couple make a run for it but theyre quickly chased down and tackled to the ground
the woman screams and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals
the woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her
eli turns away
he knows what comes next
eli listens as the woman screams and screams
he reaches for his shotgun
then withdraws his hand
it aint your concern
stay on the path
it aint your concern
stay on the path
eli repeats it like a mantra
he clearly wants to intervene but will not permit himself to
instead he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help
and then finally suddenly is silenced
down below the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt
the bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow spilling its contents onto the asphalt
they ferret through the items scavenging a few items we dont see what and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel
they leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came dust pluming in their wake
eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place
eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple
he signs a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer under his breath
then stands and continues on down the road
more desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see
the road forks again here
eli arrives at the junction and stops
the road eli is on leads further into the west
the other fork heads toward a small town just visible on the horizon
a hand painted sign has been driven into the dirt nearby
no words just a series of crude pictograms
a plate of food
a water faucet
an arrow points toward the town
eli pauses thinking it over
retrieves the ipod from his pocket
clicks the button but no response
he turns and heads down the other fork toward town
a primitive sprawling village of tents and barn like structures
built from corrugated iron rotted wood molded plastic tarpaulin materials scavenged from the old world
huddled residents are dressed in little more than rags many wearing goggles like elis to shield their eyes from the sun
eli stands at the edge of town
reluctant to enter but he braces himself and walks on in
and as he rounds a corner entering the center of town an astonishing sight the broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town once stood here
many of the old storefronts still largely intact but patched up with salvaged materials
the asphalt street warped and cracked parking meters bent and smashed
its a lot like the abandoned town eli passed through earlier except very much alive bustling with townsfolk
its at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight like an old norman rockwell painting of classic small town america but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse
an unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new
the centerpiece of the town is a grand theater at the head of the main street
like the rest of the town badly damaged and shoddily fixed up
but still standing
eli walks down the street and approaches a blacksmith hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store
you got an engineer or a fuelman around here
the blacksmith doesnt look up from his work but motions toward a storefront at the far end of the street
eli heads down the street
stopping when he comes across a statue erected in the center of the road
a tall man crudely fashioned in clay
one hand placed paternally on the head of a small child the other outstretched toward the sun
as he observes the statue eli notices that passing residents take a moment to pause and genuflect before it
curious eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statues face
then hears shuffling feet behind him and turns as a parade of emaciated men and women trudges past
roped together at the waist each man leading the one behind
heads shaved thin from malnutrition
and each one blind
they gaze at the ground with pale dead eyes
they carry picks shovels and other tools a sightless chain gang
eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past herded like cattle by a brutish chain gang boss who swats at them with a stick to keep them moving and indicate
come on move it
the gang boss glares at eli as he passes by
eli doesnt return the look just continues crossing the street as the blind are herded away
headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a lightning bolt suspended above the door
whatever this place once was its now a kind of post apocalyptic radio shack
shelves display a variety of goods
old electrical wiring
an old electric generator rumbles noisily powering strings of multi colored christmas lights that hang all around
behind the main counter a convoluted rube goldberg esque still is running
an engineer in a leather apron pours the remnants of a can of motor oil into the stills funnel
attached to the still is an old motorcycle mirror
in its reflection the engineer sees eli checking out the store
without turning around he reaches surreptitiously behind the counter for something
eli turns toward the counter to find the engineer training a pump action shotgun right at him
i dont know you
eli slowly raises his hands
im not from around here
who are you
im just a customer
a customer with a shotgun
he nods toward the shotgun visible on elis backpack
you come in here to rip me off
the engineers hands tremble his finger tight on the trigger
this man needs to be talked down carefully
ill set it down
unhitches the pack and sets it down steps away
you carry a gun in the outland you dont bring one into town less you live there
dont you know that
im sorry i forgot
ive been on the road a long time
this seems to make the engineer more suspicious of eli
show me your hand
im not a the engineer jerks the shotgun at eli nervously
i said show me your fucking hand
eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched palm faced downward
the engineer watches it closely for any sign of ticks or tremors but elis hand stays steady as a rock
im not one of them
the sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a little
finally he lowers the shotgun
what do you want
im just passing through
i need some help
i can pay
what kinda help
and what kinda pay
im going to get something out of my pack
the engineer raises the shotgun nervously again
i know i know
the engineer watches him like a hawk as eli opens up his pack and pulls out the car battery
when he sees it he gasps
eli places it on the counter
the engineer looks it over with awe like its a priceless historical artifact
whered you find this
years ago in the outland back east aways
does it work
yeah it just needs a charge
can you do it
i got the cables
depends if you also got the coin
eli pulls the zippo lighter from his pocket
the engineer picks it up sparks the flint watches the flame flicker
itll take a couple hours
theres a bar across the street you can wait they just opened up
ill wait here
you dont trust me
i dont know you
this once grand theater have been largely gutted seats torn out fixtures and fittings stripped curtains ripped from the stage
but still theres a sense of grandeur to this place
looking out over the stage a royal box once the most prestigious seat in the house has been converted into an office of sorts
seats removed and replaced by an ornate mahogany desk facing inward a chandelier suspended above it
the whole set up is gaudy and ostentatious the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth but has no taste whatsoever
a tall man is seated in a battered leather armchair behind the desk deeply involved in an old paperback book
the books cover is faded and partially torn away the title still just visible habits of highly effective people
the man is older than most weve seen
his skin weathered by the elements and by a long lifes experience
one of the very few people weve seen in this world close to elis age and unlike everyone else weve seen he appears healthy and well groomed
a rich mane of hair full set of teeth
he wears a tattered suit and tie
none of it matches everything scavenged from different outfits and eras
but he looks almost civilized
his name is carnegie
he looks up from his book at the sound of a polite cough o
redridge stands before him
tall powerfully built
what is it
his accent is like caramel
a rich deep south drawl
survey team just finished up their inspection
it aint good
carnegie lowers his book
how bad is it
pressure is down again and going by the new rod they sank levelsre lower than theyve ever been
this is bad news
hard to say
six months maybe
a little longer if were careful
but were already halve the rations
we just halved em last so halve them again
carnegie stares redridge down
nobody but nobody questions his orders
youre going to have to say something
folks were none too happy last time
gonna be worse now you can count on it
carnegie sighs rubs his brow
he knows redridge is right
a large crowd of townsfolk several hundred strong has assembled outside the palladium theater
an armed crew of carnegies goons keeps watch over the crowd
carnegie stands on a balcony above the theater marquee
he treats the balcony like a pulpit speaking through a microphone connected to an old pa system that carries his words to the far reaches of the crowd
i want you all to remember how far weve come together
and how far we still can go if only we believe
when i brought us here to this oasis this promised land we knew there would be hardships
knew there would be sacrifices
but we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders
the crowd listens intently hanging on carnegies every word
he is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker his cultivated image and inspiring confident delivery remind us of a television evangelist
and i want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town
this sends a murmur of discontent through the crowd
many dont like where they suspect this may be going
carnegie senses this and dials up his rhetoric delivering it now with the fire brand passion of an old time baptist preacher
it is our faith that sustains us brothers and sisters
the crowd is divided
many return the hallelujah with varying levels of conviction
others are not convinced
but carnegie continues unabated selling it harder than ever
and mark me the ultimate validation of that faith is coming
the sacred word of our lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor bring it nourishment bring
it new life
for the almighty himself has spoken unto me and promised it
carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker its almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his words
his apparently unshakable belief is infectious
in the meantime he has asked us all to be patient
to walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer
and to do that we must give just a little more
water rations will be halved until further notice
this sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the crowd this news has not been received well at all
some still keep the faith but many more are perturbed by this
carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down
i understand your frustration
the road to salvation is a difficult one but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory beyond anything you can imagine
a discontented villager steps forward pushing through the crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at carnegie
weve heard this all before
when are you going to carnegies goons quickly move in and efficiently silence the man removing him from the crowd
dissent is not tolerated here
carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened
i know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action
it was faith that built this town and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead
but it is always darkest before dawn and the new dawn is coming
may god go with you all
carnegie steps back inside leaving the crowd to talk among themselves clearly mixed about what they have heard
as the assembled townsfolk disperse four motorcycles roar into town and pull up outside the palladium
as the riders dismount one detaches a cloth satchel from his bikes cargo rack
the four riders head inside
they each have long straggly hair and brutish expressions
we recognize them now as the biker bandits who killed the couple on the road under the freeway overpass
carnegie emerges into the second floor hallway from the balcony mopping his brow
exhausted and stressed from his grand theatrical display and from its mixed reception
redridge climbs the stairs to meet him
one of the road crews just rolled into town
carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch
of course they did the bars open
outlanders always looking for answers at the bottom of a bottle
not these guys
these guys say they got something
that gets carnegies attention
get them up here now
what was once a grand gilded entrance foyer has like the rest of the theater been largely gutted
but its still impressive a spacious bar area with a grand staircase leading up to a second floor entrance to balcony seats etc
faded old theater posters still hang from the walls
the place has been shabbily converted into a kind of saloon
old ripped out theater seats arranged around tables
a fireplace sputters dimly
a mangy tabby cat walks across the straw laden floor
a dozen or so customers in the place a mixed rough looking bunch
redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of his men who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs
carnegie checks his reflection in a cracked hand mirror licks his palm and slicks his hair back
he adjusts his tie as redridges men usher the bikers into his office
carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them
just as when he gave his balcony address carnegie is in performance mode charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician
its truly a delight to see you again
i understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one
the bikers exchange looks
they understood maybe half the words in that sentence
the lead biker named hog speaks
we did good
well lets see shall we
hog tips the satchels contents out onto carnegies desk
about a dozen different volumes of all shapes and sizes
carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection
we see various titles as he sorts through them
the da vinci code
a volume of encyclopedia
the diary of anne frank
tuesdays with morrie
in amongst the books are a few magazines
an old issue of oprah magazine
a torn copy of sports illustrated
and a newsweek
the cover graphic illustrates opposing nuclear arsenals over a world globe
on one side the stars and stripes on the other flags indicating a sino islamic alliance
the headline reads is there no turning back
as carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and frustration its clear hes looking for a specific volume
its not here
these aint worth nothin
when you bring me the book i asked you for itll be worth something
the bikers exchange more looks
an unspoken conversation
we been doin this a long time now
had to make a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books
you want us to keep at it reckon its worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you call liquor
carnegies guards bristle ready for a confrontation
carnegie just smiles always ready to smooth things over
i urge you once again to take the long view here
when we find this book and believe me we will find it we are going to build a new world
a world far greater far more righteous than this one
and you and i are going to be perched right on top of it looking down upon it masters of all creation
as always his carefully stage managed rhetoric is delivered with the utmost conviction every word dripping with passion and persuasion
hes a master salesman a true huckster
and you know i think youre absolutely right
carnegie contd that is worth more than a few glasses of liquor
a whole lot more
he steps forward and looks hog right in the eye
his gaze like a laser beam utterly disarming
the book i want is out there somewhere just waiting to be found
once there were millions of copies you only need to find one
find it and bring it here
and i promise you you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine
its impossible not to be swayed by this guy
hes just so full of fiery passion and infectious belief you almost want to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet
hog snatches up his empty satchel
this better not be bullshit
he turns and marches to the door the other bikers following
the guards escort them out only redridge remains
carnegie slumps back into his chair frustrated pissed off
might help if they knew just what they were looking for
not one of them can read
how would they even know when they found it
so hows about you just tell me
carnegie and redridge lock eyes
two years now you been sending these crews into the outland
burning up gas we can barely spare
for a goddamn book
what the hell kinda book can be worth all this
carnegie ignores him
stands walks toward the door
redridge sighs gestures toward the books piled on carnegies desk
what about these
put them with the others
redridge stands by the marble fireplace tossing the books into the fire
the flames flicker and leap around the books as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire
eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas generator which chugs noisily
he licks his lips dry as sand
unscrews his canteen to take a drink but its down to its last few drips
whats this place across the street
they got any water
we got our own underground spring here
only fresh water in a hundred miles ifs you can pay for it
eli thinks a while longer
then stands and stuffs his shotgun inside his pack shoulders his gear and makes for the door
ill be back
eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer
if that battery aint here when i get back i will use this gun on your kneecaps and i will put this building to the torch and i will watch
it burn to the ground with you alive inside it
so help me god
and with that he turns and leaves
the engineer gulps
not a hint in elis voice that he didnt mean every word
this old second floor dressing room has been converted into a bedroom simply furnished
a woman stands in front of an old dressing room mirror the bulbs around the frame burned out and broken
she washes her face in murky water in an old porcelain bowl on the dresser
her name is claudia
early s pretty
she gazes into the mirror as she dries her hands but its so cracked and warped its near impossible to see a reflection
the door opens and carnegie enters
he still looks steamed
claudia doesnt turn to look at him keeps facing the mirror
is that you honey
carnegie says nothing
just paces angrily up and down
finally claudia turns to face him
more books came in from the road today
its been a while
and itll be a while longer
just another pile of useless junk
if we dont find the right one soon if i cant give these people what they want to hear
carnegie trails off the thought too awful to contemplate
claudia adopts a sympathetic expression supportive
youll find what youre looking for
its out there somewhere
you just have to have faith
this seems to anger carnegie
he wheels on her
is that what you think were missing around here
she detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet head bowed
carnegie moves toward her angrily
my old man used to have faith
he had it in spades
my mother too
carnegie contd you know where it got them
you know where it got me
hes in her face now
claudia avoids eye contact submissive
faith is for the weak
its for them out there the sheep
this world is what you can see and touch and taste
its what you make it
all these years with me you still dont have any grasp of that
whats wrong with you woman
hes shouting now and shes trembling afraid to speak
carnegie realizes hes frightened her
no im sorry
i didnt mean to scare you
he lifts her chin up wipes away a tear
you just get me all riled up with that kind of talk
its not what i need from you right now
you know what i need right now
he puts his hands on her lustfully
its clear shes not in the mood but she halfheartedly responds anyway
more out of a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion
as they kiss carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants
the original customers have now been joined by the four bikers who sit at their own table drinking a clear and pungent moonshine type liquor from a shared jar
all eyes are on him immediately regarding him with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar
the bartender approaches looks him up and down
let me see
eli raises his hand as before
holds it outstretched steady
whatll it be
eli places the canteen on the bar
thats the good stuff
gotta eat into my own ration to sell it so i dont sell it cheap
eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar
the bartender takes it and looks it over
not particularly impressed
thatll get you maybe half way
the bartender spies elis silver saint christopher pendant
what about that
eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt
no way thats for sale
instead he reaches into his coat and produces the fur pelts he skinned from the dead cat lays them out on the bar
thats the best i got
the bartender takes a pelt and examines it
the mangy cat leaps up onto the bar and approaches
sniffs at the pelts with suspicion and hisses at eli
eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand
at the bikers table hog watches this not happy about this
satisfied with the pelts the bartender gathers them up along with the scarf then turns away toward the back room
a teenage girl emerges from the back
no older than or
dressed in unflattering work clothes face grimy blonde hair tied back in a ponytail
but even through all this its clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman
the bartender takes elis canteen and hands it to solara along with a ration card he keeps around his neck
take this out back and get it filled
solara takes the canteen pausing for a moment to look eli up and down
unsure quite what to make of him but intrigued
theres something about him she cant put her finger on
he doesnt look back at her
she turns and exits
solara exits via the palladiums stage door and walks across the busy street to where two of carnegies armed men stand guard around an enclosure of chain link fence topped
with razor wire
townsfolk wait in line with bowls and buckets
one of the guards recognizes solara and lets her cut to the front of the line
he punches two holes in her ration card and lets her inside the chain link enclosure
inside is an old rusted spigot attached to a pipe emerging from the earth
solara cranks hard on the handle it takes a few pulls before the water comes and then only at a weak trickle it will take a while to fill the
as eli sits at the bar a shadow comes into view and looms large over him
hog is standing behind him glaring cutting a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers
solara senses trouble brewing and moves off taking elis canteen away into the back room
that was my cat
eli doesnt turn
just looks straight ahead
impossible to read him behind those mirrored goggles
i saw you push him off the bar
i didnt push him
you raised your hand at him
it wont happen again
the bartender looks at hog nervously
hey how about another drink hog
that cats been comin in here for nigh on two years
it got more right to be here than you
who the fuck do you think you are
i dont want any trouble
hog grabs him by the arm
well thats too bad cause blink
suddenly hogs head is pinned to the bar by nothing more than elis thumb
pressed deep into a nerve cluster in his neck
eli leans in close as hog whimpers paralyzed
i know you
murderer of innocent travelers on the road
youre going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that youve done
did you know that
the other bikers stand and approach the other customers following suit
eli senses the trouble gathering behind him
you go on back to your table and ill be on my way
its all hog can do to just barely nod his head
eli releases his thumb
hog staggers backward gasping for breath
eli stands and makes toward the door but the bikers and other patrons have moved to block his exit
you push hog you push all of us
eli sighs looks down at the floor
hes been pushed one time too many today
for the first time we see anger in his face
cursed be the ground because of you
by toil shall you eat of it
thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you
from the ground were you taken
for dust you are
the patrons look at eli strangely
who is this guy
eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword
carves a line in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade
and to dust you shall return
carnegie has claudia pinned against the wall his pants bunched around his ankles ass bared as he pounds away at her
not making love
this is mechanical loveless sex
claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as carnegie thrusts into her again and again
deeply uninterested just waiting for it to be over
suddenly we hear a crash o
carnegie stops and listens
did you hear that
what was that
claudia sees an opening to get out of this
maybe you should go check
carnegie keeps listening
then comes another crash
what in the hell is going on
he pulls up his pants grabbing a rifle propped by the door as he rushes out
claudia just stands there for a moment then reaches down and pulls up her panties
she moves from the wall and makes her way across the room feeling her way with her hands gazing off into nothingness
only now do we finally realize that she is blind
carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony
looks down over the railing and is stunned by what he sees
chaos in the bar below
eli cutting a one man swath of mayhem through the dozen brawlers
most already lie dead
two more men attack eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword
carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing banging loudly on the doors of the upstairs rooms
get your asses out here
surrounded by the dead only one man left standing
he backs away as eli circles him like a predator
sword held ready the blade glistening with dark red blood
solara re emerges from the back room with elis refilled canteen
she stops and emits a horrified gasp when she sees the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her
she watches mortified as eli moves toward the helpless terrified hog going in for the kill
raising his sword
suddenly solara steps forward and cries out stop
sword hanging in the air poised to strike
he turns his head to where solara stands behind the bar
beat as eli considers
he looks back at hog still completely at his mercy
and then lowers the sword
it aint for me to judge you
your time for thats gonna come
now go on
get out of here
hog stumbles backward through the door into the sunlight
eli moves toward solara who stands petrified behind the bar
reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip
in the exitway hog turns back inside grabbing up a broken bottle from the bloody floor as he goes
hog rushes eli from behind
solara sees him coming and goes to scream but before any sound can come eli flips his sword backward and hog runs right onto it skewering himself
hog just stands there for a moment eyes wide frozen in shock
his fingers go limp dropping the bottle
he slides off the sword and collapses to the floor dead
eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it
looks around at the bloodied fallen bodies
then back at solara
im sorry for all the mess
as he turns and heads toward the door hold it right there
accompanied by the sound of multiple guns cocking
carnegie is on the landing training his rifle down at eli
alongside him five gunmen do the same
theyve got him cold
carnegie sits at his desk the huge auditorium and stage area visible behind him
eli stands before him
around him are the other gunmen who keep their weapons trained on him
standing at carnegies side are redridge and claudia
so who are you
a walker in the outland
ive met walkers before
not a particularly civilized bunch
some have even taken to eating their own kind did you know that
you wouldnt be one of those savages now would you
carnegies gunmen look him over inspecting him warily
he aint got the shakes
carnegies confident gaze remains fixed on eli throughout
this is a civilized town
do you know what that means
eli cant help but react at the mention of that word
it means we have laws here
laws set down long before any of us ever walked this earth
and one of them is you dont eat the flesh of your brother
else youre no better than an animal
and not welcome here
eli doesnt respond
just stands there in carnegies gaze
so whats your business here friend
walkers dont usually come into town less they want something
i had a battery needed charging and a canteen needed filling
i didnt come here looking for trouble
barely noticeable carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen who nods in acknowledgement and leaves
well you sure as hell found it
do you know who i am
my names carnegie
i own this bar
i own the whole town
youve never heard of me
thats you out there on the street
remarkable likeness isnt it
youd never guess half the men who built it were blind
a small tribute from a grateful people
i was deeply touched
you had slaves build you a monument to yourself
the mention of that word rankles carnegie
he walks around the desk toward eli waves an admonishing finger at him
dont call them slaves
thats an old word
im not a slaver
im trying to help these people
carnegie cant help himself once again he is in his natural element spinning the argument his way pitching
in the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals
here at least theyre protected
they do the essential work others dont want
and in return they eat they drink they survive
last year a couple of them even got married performed the ceremony myself
you see im not exploiting these people im saving them
any one of them is free to leave whenever they wish
but here they stay
and they thank me every single day for their salvation
an impressive impassioned performance
he sounds just like an old school tv evangelist
but eli is unmoved
its none of my business what you do here
like you said its your town
i just want to be on my way
whats your name walker
eli doesnt respond
just stands there
all right i guess we just call you walker
dont see too many folks your age these days
you lived in the world before
you can read
i read every day
we educated folk we need to stick together if were ever going to rebuild this world
people like you and me were the future
what do you want with me
straight to the point
i like that
fact is you could be in a lot of trouble
this is a peaceful town
you walk in here armed and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead
ive hanged men for less
i could hang you
or you could come work for me
i never once saw anyone handle themselves the way you did down there in that bar
i dont know where you learned it but i sure as hell could use it
im not interested
people who work for me can live better than any walker ever dreamed
real beds clean water hot food
you could do a lot worse my friend
im not your friend
and im not staying
i got someplace i need to be
there is nothing west
its all gone a long time ago
ive been told different
eli doesnt reply
carnegie smiles dials up the charm
all right look
im going to make you an offer of goodwill
stay the night think it over
try a little local hospitality
well talk again in the morning
if youre still not interested youre free to go
no hard feelings
thank you for your offer
but id prefer to just leave right now
so you can either let me out of here or i can kill my way out
the gunmen bristle exchange nervous looks
carnegie appears unfazed
he looks to the gunman at the door
let him go
the gunman opens the door
eli turns and exits
the engineer stands behind the counter looking worried
his heart sinks when he sees eli enter
hows my battery
its gonna take a little longer than i thought
how much longer
its gotta charge overnight
you uh you can always stay here in town pick it up in the morning
eli leans in a little closer
he smells a rat
you remember what i said would happen if i came back here and you didnt have my battery
its right here
its just gonna take a while longer
eli looks at the engineer
hard to be certain but hes pretty sure hes lying
somebody got to him
a violent commotion is heard from down the hall
suddenly one of carnegies henchmen comes flying into view as he is thrown hard into a wall and slumps to the floor unconscious
eli storms into the box pissed
more guards rush in behind him
carnegie seated behind his desk waves the guards off as he stands to greet eli smiling ingratiatingly as ever
i knew youd reconsider
howd you know that
none of the walkers ive seen come here from the outland were ever what youd call smart
i mean all those years out there alone on the road some with their brains half fried from eating each other its understandable why you people arent the brightest bulbs
in the box
but i never met one so dumb that hed turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered
so you didnt send someone across the street to the engineer
i dont know what youre talking about
if theres something wrong maybe i can help
carnegie is a practiced liar
much more difficult to read
this is redridge
hes kind of my right hand man around here
redridge one of the two men who chased eli into the room steps forward
he regards eli with a distrustful eye
hell show you to your room
redridge opens the door and ushers eli inside
its another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom less well appointed than carnegies own
a threadbare rug
bed with relatively clean sheets
a sink for washing
enjoy your stay
therell be someone outside your room all night
if you need anything
redridge smirks and closes the door leaving eli alone
eli paces across the room
finally sits down on the creaky old bed
trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here
he unshoulders his pack sets it down
lies down on the bed
its been a while since he felt a real bed on his back
a knock at the door
eli gets quickly to his feet
the door opens and claudia enters
carrying a metal tub of water in both hands and atop that a dinner tray
i have this for you
water for washing and some food
eli just stands there
totally unfamiliar with this kind of situation its been too long
she smiles embarrassed
are you going to take it
he takes the stuff from her sets it on the table
youre very welcome
we get the impression that claudia is as unfamiliar with this kind of polite interaction as eli
but she likes it
itll be dark soon
she strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table
the room is lit by its flickering glow
can i get you anything else
no thank you
have a good night
as she turns for the door youre carnegies woman
why do you ask
just making conversation is all
havent had one of those in a while
not a real one leastways
neither has she
he found me in the outland
i was sixteen my family had been
well they were gone
there was just me and my baby
you had a baby
id met some men on the road
she trails off struggling with this unhappy memory
eli gets it raises a hand reassuringly
its all right
i was on the road for a year after that
i couldnt feed myself let alone my little girl
and then bill found us and he promised hed take care of us
he told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe
and he did
he did all that
he built this whole town
he kept us safe
and he raised that child like she was his own
hes been so good to both of us
he saved us really
theres a bittersweet quality to claudias words
as though there is more to the story than she is telling
eli pulls out a chair at the table offers it to her
you want to eat some
she smiles and sits
eli sits across from her
when did you go blind
in the war
you get caught in a flash
no i was born this way
i think im lucky like that
its not like i ever knew what im missing
i was already used to being like this by the time
by the time it all happened
so i got around pretty good even when i was on my own
and now its easy
i know every creaky old floorboard in here and its not like i ever go any place else
bill would never allow it
he worries about me so much
the sense that claudia feels trapped
thinking about it begins to upset her
she gets up
i should go
hell be wondering where i am
eli stands escorts her to the door and opens it
i enjoyed our conversation
so did i
eli closes the door then sits back at the table
carnegie washes looking at himself in the old dressing room mirror
he sees claudia enter the room in its dim reflection
you took your time in there
how long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water
a subtly accusing tone
it makes claudia nervous
he wanted to talk
he asked me what it was like to be blind
he tell you anything about him
i dont think he likes to talk about himself much
yeah i got that
claudia moves to the bedside begins to undress
i dont think hes going to change his mind by morning
i dont think hes going to stay
what makes you say that
just strikes me as the kind of man whos of a mind is all
doesnt seem like the type to go changing it once its set
well well just see about that
you saw him
hes not like the others
you wont be able to smooth talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do
who said anything about me
im sending solara
claudia reacts suddenly to this
shocked and angry
youre doing what
you know how often these walkers get laid
least not by anything living or willing
girl like her can be very persuasive
you cant send her in there with him
hes dangerous hes a killer
you went in there readily enough
solaras just a child she cant carnegie sighs tiring of this
shes a grown woman now claudia
sooner or later youre going to have to accept that
she has to earn her keep around here same as the rest of us
by working as a whore
thats all you think shes fit for
weve each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world
some peoples gift is more evident than others
solaras sure as hell is
claudia looks at carnegie in disgust
what kind of a man are you
now its carnegies turn to get angry
he rounds on her menacingly
she backs off as he approaches
im the kind of man whod pull a helpless blind girl off the road a girl whod been beaten and raped and give her a place where she can live
without me youd be just another no eye lying dead in the outland picked clean by the buzzards or shoveling dirt down there with the others
thats the kind of man i am
he has her against the wall his face just inches from hers
i dont live without fear
i havent for a long time now
carnegie calms himself backs off
claudia goes to leave
where are you going
im not going to let you do this
carnegie surges forward and pins claudia to the wall
youre not going to let me
nobody tells me what i can and cant do in my own town
i built this world and i am god here
so dont go thinking about screwing with my plans
you know how this works
solara goes against me you get hurt
you go against me she gets hurt
he releases his grip on her
so lets not see anybody get hurt
he speaks more softly now
as he strokes his hand tenderly through claudias hair a tear runs down her cheek
dark outside but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the oil lamp
eli sits up on his bed quietly reading the old leather bound book from his backpack
another knock at the door
eli jumps up and hurriedly hides the book inside his shirt
the door opens to reveal solara
looking very different than she did before
cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer dress blonde hair let down over her shoulders
unlike everyone else we have met she seems physically at least totally unscarred by the horrors of the times
far too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this
can i come in
someone was already here with food and water
i got everything i need
you sure about that
she glides into the room closing the door
eli is totally disarmed in her presence
its too bright in here
mind if i turn it down a little
she doesnt wait for an answer
moves to the table and turns down the oil lamp
a darker more seductive lighting scheme
youre walker right
my names eli
that short for something
i never heard that one before
its kinda cute
she sits on the bed kicks her legs playfully
her light cotton dress revealing in all the right places
the silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the oil lamp
no red blooded man on earth could resist her
look i dont mean to be rude
but im really not interested
you sure about that
it gets mighty lonely out there on the road
she leans over on the bed resting on her elbow
her hair cascades down
god damn she looks good
if youre worried about money this is all paid for
the whole night
its not that
youre a very nice girl
but im not that kind of man
she slides off the bed approaches him
begins to work the buttons of his shirt
theyre all that kind of man
he moves her hand away
gently pushes her back a step
she is stunned
no man has ever turned her down before
and then she seems a little insulted
they told me you were crazy
maybe they were right
eli opens the door for her
suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear
she moves to the door and slams it shut again
looks eli in the eye
please dont make me leave
i have to stay the night
if i dont
if you dont what
hell hurt my mom
she nods fighting back a tear
this angers eli
maybe he and i oughta have words
he goes for the door handle but she stops him
hes hurting you
hes hurting your mother
hes hes my dad
eli moves his hand away from the door
look if you want to help me just let me stay here tonight
we dont have to do anything
ill sleep on the floor
tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time
ill be no trouble i swear
she looks up at eli imploringly
no longer the teenage sex kitten
now shes just a frightened little girl
you want to have a conversation
she smiles wiping the tear from her cheek
eli and solara sit together on the bed
a silent beat
at first it appears as though they have nothing to say
you know you dont have to be afraid of me
what happened down there in the bar
im not afraid of you
i know you didnt start that trouble
when i first saw you i knew you werent the type to go looking for it
howd you know that
my mom says im a good judge of character
she says i can read people
that i know a good man when i see one
eli is surprised to find himself smiling back
youre pretty old right
eli smiles amused by the bluntness of the question
i just mean i havent seen too many people your age
how old are you exactly
you know i dont rightly remember
but youre old enough
i mean you remember what it was like
in the world before
what was it like
eli thinks about this
dredging through old old memories
better than this
people lived longer back then
longer than me
some were more than a hundred years old
solara smiles like shes having her leg pulled
i swear its true
nowadays its not the same
if youre sick or youre weak or youre old you wont last long out on the road
so how come you have
should he or shouldnt he
can i read you something
you can read
eli pulls the book from his shirt
solaras eyes widen
and you have a book
not just any book
for the first time we see that its a king james bible
an embossed gold cross on its old leather cover
eli opens it up scans the page with his finger until he finds the passage hes looking for
the lord is my shepherd
i shall not want
he makes me lie down in green pastures
he leads me beside still waters
he restores my soul
he leads me in the paths of righteousness
on solara as she listens to eli read
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil
for you are with me
your rod and your staff they comfort me
you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies
you anoint my head with oil
my cup runs over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever
did you write that
what book is it from
is it poetry
i guess you could think of it that way
its from the holy bible
i never heard of it
whats it about
beat as eli thinks
how on earth to answer that
its about love and forgiveness and life and death and mercy and revenge and the beginning and the end of the world
i guess its about a little bit of everything
can i see
she reaches out for the book but he snatches it away
im not going to do anything
im charged to protect this book
i cant trust it with anyone
not even for a while
whats so special about that book
eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on the beat up leather cover
its the last one
there are no other books like this
all the others are gone destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after
this is the only one that survived until now
the last one anywhere
how can you know that
i just know
for a long while after it happened i just wandered on the road like most everybody else
there were still a lot of people around back then in the beginning
i didnt really know what i should do or where i was going
i was just moving from place to place trying to stay alive
and then one day i heard this voice
i dont know how to explain it its like it was coming from inside me
but i could hear it clear as day
clear as i can hear you talking to me now
what did it say
it led me to this place i dont really know where
and i found this book buried deep under some rubble
no way no one was ever going to find it if they didnt know exactly where to look
but you knew because the voice told you
and that voice told me to carry the book west
eli contd it told me that a path would be laid out before me that id be led to a place where this book would be safe
it told me id be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way
if only i would have faith
that was twenty five years ago
and ive been walking ever since
because a voice you heard in your head told you to
im not crazy
i didnt imagine it
i know what i heard
so who was it
beat as eli considers his answer
a very important very powerful man
more powerful than my dad
i should say so yes
the two of them sit in silence for a moment
would you teach me to read
i never learned
no one around here knows how
only my dad and he wont teach me
i think he likes being the only one who can read
i think it makes him feel powerful
i think youre probably right
so would you teach me
im leaving tomorrow
and i wont be back this way ever
she looks down sad
she likes this guy
she doesnt want him to leave
eli can sense her sadness
are you hungry
i guess a little
theres some food on the table over there
she walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small cloth
she whips it away to reveal elis rat nibbling on a piece of cheese
solara shrieks and backs away
the rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto elis shoulder just as afraid of her as she is of it
its okay its okay
hes with me
to the rat dont be afraid pal
this is solara
shes our friend
solara approaches warily
reaches out and strokes him
the rat scurries up her arm
she almost shrieks again
it means he likes you
trust me if he didnt like you youd know about it
solara pets the rat on her shoulder
then did you really mean that
that im your friend
eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a thing
when is the last time he had someone he could call a friend
he cant even remember
giggles as the rats whiskers tickle her ear
eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to solara
shes about to eat but stops as eli clasp his hands in prayer
our father we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us
unsure of what to do solara mimics eli putting her hands together and bowing her head
we thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this
and we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times
solara looks at him touched by that
you say that last part too
and now we eat
and now we eat
they sit and eat together sharing the simple meal
pull out from the window as they eat away from the theater
away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight
moving farther and farther away until the entire town is consumed by the darkness of the world
the pale sun rises over the town
what was once the theaters costume room old mannequins still stand around in the corners creating an eerie feel
carnegie and claudia sit at a dining table eating breakfast in silence
a third place is set but no one is seated there
solara enters and sits down without a word
good morning solara
solara doesnt say anything
i said good morning solara
how was your night
did you sleep well
claudia appears perturbed by carnegies subtle probing
solara flashes him a frosty look
i did like you asked
isnt that what you really want to know
just come out and say it
carnegie glares at her sternly
you dont speak to your father like that
when i ask you a civil question i expect a civil answer
solara lowers her head scorned
carnegie continues eating
did he say anything
we didnt talk much
well do you think you managed to change his mind about staying
i dont know
he said he had to go
carnegie puts down his food looks angrily at her
so he did talk
what else did he say
come on i want all of it
thats all he said
that he was going to be leaving this morning
this is my town nobody leaves until i say they leave
he glances knowingly at claudia
solara honey eat something
she looks at the food on the plate before her
then closes her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer
our father thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us
claudia and carnegie freeze
carnegie stares at her agape
thank you for my mother
please watch over her and keep her safe
thank you for all the solara
she snaps suddenly out of it looks at her father
what the hell are you doing
she doesnt respond
god didnt put this food on the table
do you hear me
who put this food on the table
solara says nothing just looks down at the table
i said who put this food on the table
who taught you that
eli taught me
who the hell is eli
thats his name
and he taught you how to say those words
how did he know them
he had them written down in a book
this piques carnegies interest greatly
what kind of a book
he barks the question at her
solara is rattled
i dont remember
it was an old leather book
it had kind of a
thing on the front of it
solara makes the sign of a crucifix with her index fingers
carnegies eyes widen he can barely believe it
he had a bible
thats what it was
a holy bible
daddy whats wrong
carnegie bolts suddenly from the table overturning his chair and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor
carnegie races across the landing toward the armed guard posted outside elis bedroom
the guard steps aside as carnegie flings the door open and barges inside
no sign of eli or his gear anywhere
the window is wide open the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze
his hands shaking the engineer disconnects elis battery from the generator and places it on the counter
eli stands on the other side of the counter with his shotgun trained right at the mans head
he takes the battery from him and stuffs it into his backpack
carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the open window to elis room
he could have easily jumped
redridge emerges onto the street behind him
something wrong boss
the walkers gone
that cant be
i had a man outside his room the whole time
he jumped out the window you idiot
you didnt think to put a man outside the fucking window
beat fuming find him
boss he could be anywhere
didnt he say something about a battery
they turn to face the engineers storefront just as eli emerges onto the street shotgun still in his hand
like a wild west stand off
redridges fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip
beat as time hangs perfectly still for a second
and then redridge draws and fires shattering a parking meter just inches from eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk
eli rushes along the sidewalk returning fire
the shot wings redridge in the shoulder
he goes down wounded
carnegie dives for cover as four more gunmen rush from the theater
carnegie waves frantically in elis direction
they spot eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit
carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater
solara and claudia watch through the window
turn suddenly when they hear the door slam open behind them
carnegie stands in the doorway glaring at them
local residents scream and rush to and fro in panic as eli darts along the boardwalk
carnegies gunmen pursue firing their rifles wildly on the run
the bullets splinter wood pierce barrels and crates narrowly missing eli as he dashes keeping his head down
eli aims the shotgun and fires without even looking
the shot hits a gunman square in the chest dropping him to the dirt
eli hits the deck diving for cover behind a junkpile as more gunfire ricochets all around him
he takes a moment to collect himself reloads the shotgun
the three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily
eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun looks to the sky and offers up a silent prayer
then emerges from around the junkpile back into the street
all three gunmen open fire their bullets whipping past on either side of him
in one swift motion eli raises the shotgun and fires
three shots in quick succession
and then there is silence
smoke wisps from the shotguns sawn off barrel
the three gunmen lie dead in the street
one hit square in the chest
the other two each have maybe one half of their heads remaining
eli looks around
hes right at the end of the main road the perimeter where the town meets the open desert
and then a girls scream
distant but unmistakable
eli whips around
in the upstairs window of the theater carnegie shoves solara roughly against the wall
barking angrily at her shaking her
eli looks at the road
then up at the theater
then back to the road again
quietly to himself it aint your concern
stay on the path
but he sounds less resolute now than before
until today this was always a simple decision for him to make
he marches back toward the theater stepping over the fallen bodies of the gunmen re loading his shotgun as he goes
redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound
he looks up just in time to see eli coming right at him
without breaking stride he cold cocks redridge in the jaw with the shotgun sending him back to the deck out cold
eli kicks the door wide open finds carnegie holding solara against the wall
she sobs terrified
eli levels the shotgun at carnegies head
let her go
that cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net
i dont reckon you can hit me without hitting her
i reckon youre right
he holsters the shotgun
then in the same fluid motion draws a pistol from his belt that we never even knew he had
with this ill shave the hairs clean off your balls at a hundred paces
you believe me
carnegie releases his grip on solara steps away hands up
i believe you
i have to say im surprised to hear that language coming from you though
i mean you being a holy man and all
eli glances at solara
she told me all about it
told me all about the bible too
can i see it
carnegie takes a small step forward
suddenly his whole demeanor changes and he now looks at eli imploringly
you know ive been searching for a book like that one for years
all ive ever wanted was to bring the word of god to these poor unfortunates here
to shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in
something to live for
its why i built this town did you know that
all weve been missing is the word to show us the way
and now praise the lord youve brought it to us
carnegie takes a step closer
he appears entirely sincere but then he is very good at doing so
its not right to keep that book hidden away all to yourself
the word is meant to be shared with others
its meant to be spread
isnt that what you want
i could help you do that
you and me we could do it together
eli seems to be considering what hes heard carefully
the lord himself told me that if i carried this book west one day i would find the place where it was needed
where it would be safe
where it belonged
carnegie smiles broadly
and then with a sudden blur of movement eli pistol whips him to the floor
but this aint it
he turns to solara and offers her his hand
eli emerges from the theater leading solara onto the street
residents part before them staring at eli with astonishment
eli passes the statue of carnegie and stops
something about that thing is bothering him
what is it
you shall not make for yourself any graven image
he turns drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid motion slicing across the base of the statue
and then the statue topples from the neat cut just below the knees crashing down to the ground and shattering
the assembled residents gasp at this defiant display
eli sheathes his sword and takes solara by the hand again
now we can go
crane up over the main street as they both head out of town
the town barely visible on the distant horizon behind eli and solara
eli walks as he always has his pace steady and slow
still solara lags along behind
shes already tired
where are we going
i told you where im going
youre free to go wherever you want
she stops in the road
im not coming with you
youre only going to slow me down
eli doesnt stop walking
solara is forced to catch up
so what the hell was all that about back there
the man was hurting you
i dont like that so i put a stop to it
now youre free
he cant hurt you any more
off her stare no need to thank me
what am i supposed to do now
whatever you want
thats what being free is
whatever i want
except go with you
i have to get where im going
i cant be worrying about someone else along the way
solara is incredibly hurt by this
blinks back a tear
i thought you were my friend
eli stops and turns back to face her
its dangerous in the outland
i wouldnt want you to get hurt
ill be safe so long as im with you
i know it
hes not getting through to her
so now comes the harsh truth of it you dont want this life
i gotta do what i gotta do
dont have no choice in it
but you do
and i cant let you choose this
you dont want to be like me
you dont want to spend your life alone
solara steps closer her eyes pleading
if i came with you i wouldnt be alone
and neither would you
a long beat as eli considers this
for a moment it appears as though solara might have won him over
but then im sorry
look maybe its best you just go on back to town
he turns and walks off leaving her in the road
she stands there furious screaming at his back as he walks away
ill do just that
i had a life there
i didnt ask you to save me
i didnt ask you for anything
he doesnt turn or acknowledge her at all
just keeps walking off into the horizon
getting smaller all the time
solara stands there in the road weeping
she turns and walks back in the direction she came
a small penned in area to the rear of the palladium containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals
goats sheep geese pigs
mostly mangy sad looking specimens
carnegie stands in the yard tossing handfuls of animal feed from a nearby sack onto the ground
he watches with satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed
claudia emerges from the theater with an ice pack
thank you darling
carnegie applies it to his jaw red and swollen from elis pistol whip
redridge appears nearby his arm in a sling
he killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch
they shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didnt get hit once
i never even heard of anything like that
carnegie doesnt appear to be listening
he is lost in a world of his own as he tends to the farm animals
you know i always thought of myself as a shepherd
bringing together the wayward and the lost
tending to my flock
but all the things i want to do i cant do them on my own
the one thing ive needed is the one thing thats always been missing
then one day it walks right into town so close i can almost touch it and then walks right on out again
carnegie finally looks up from his animals at redridge
i want you to put a crew together and go out after him
hes not going to work for you
i think hes made that plain
im not interested in him any more
i only want the book hes carrying
if im gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland i need to know its gonna be worth it
i need to know whats so special about this goddamn book
beat as carnegie considers this
you have no idea
youre too young you dont remember the world before
but i do
he turns back to his animals summoning up old memories
when i was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day
my mother shed read it along with this smooth talking preacher on the tv screen
they used to be able to beam these guys right into your house into every house in the world through the air
she worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the tv
my old man hed read that book then hed get liquored up and kick my ass tell me all about the power and the glory and how i was going
to burn forever in hell for the sins i was born with
he made sure he beat it into me good
he snaps out of his reverie and looks at redridge
dont you see
its not just any book
carnegie contd it has the power to motivate people
it can give them hope it can terrify them
it can shape them
do you remember how i built this town
it wasnt done with force and it wasnt done just with water
it was done with the power of words
i created this place out of nothing because people believed in a promise that i sold to them
those guys on the tv they were richer than you could ever dream and it was all built the same way
and with that book
that book is a weapon
aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate
just imagine what i could do with it
were running out of water and the people are running out of patience
youre trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line
oh itll do much more than that
the water in this town may run dry but faith that springs eternal
and that faith will help turn this town into a city
and this city into a nation
it will help me build a new world
in my image
people will come from far and wide to hear whats inside of it
theyll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it
and theyll do whatever i tell them
as usual carnegies slick rhetoric has worked redridge has totally bought into it
claudia however looks appalled
and what if this book dont work
what if it dont say what you want it to say
oh itll say what i want i can promise you that
because im going to rewrite it
ill keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever i need it to be
a new bible for a new world
he reaches out and takes claudia by the hand
what do you think darling
a whole new world to do with as we will
wont that be grand
she smiles halfheartedly but its clear she is mortified
carnegie turns back to redridge
find that book
he has half a day on us already
so use the motor pool
there aint much gas in reserve
whatever there is use it
redridge nods and goes to leave
what about solara
in all this excitement about the book she had been completely forgotten about
shes still out there
bring her back too if you can
but the book
redridge turns and leaves
claudia scowls at carnegie but he doesnt even notice just goes back to feeding his animals
solara wanders the road
the sun beats down mercilessly
nothing but desolation and wasteland all around
she comes to a fork in the road
stops at the junction unsure
was this here before
she doesnt remember
there are no signs
both paths look the same
which one is which
she turns and looks back looks around
she alternates her finger between the two paths
eeny meeny miney moe
picks a path and follows it headed down the road
eli walks on
slow and steady
his gaze as ever fixed firmly on the horizon
takes a swig from his canteen
suddenly he stops and stands stock still in the center of the road
impossible to know what hes thinking
he stands there for a long time
solara comes upon an abandoned chevron station
she doesnt remember passing this
looks back up and down the road
where the hell am i
theres a rusted car parked at one of the pumps
like every other car weve seen stripped of its tires and engine
she walks around to the drivers side
a petrified female body lies on the ground half in half out of the car
solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils horrified
in the dead womans hand is a dusty bottle of mineral water
not wanting to get closer
but so thirsty
she braces herself grimacing and tries to take the bottle but the dead womans hand is closed tight around it
she pulls harder and wrenches it free
in the process she falls on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back
in the other womans arm she has a skeletal baby cradled to her bosom
it seems to be staring right at solara
solara screams and frantically shuffles backward away from it
gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt
she stops by the station shop and rests against the wall hyperventilating heart pounding
trying to get it together
she inspects the water in the bottle
it looks clean
unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip
she spits it back out coughing
empty shelves coated in thick sheets of dust
she moves further in searching for something anything
but the place has been gutted
she checks the wall of dead refrigerators
shattered glass all empty
shes never known desolation and emptiness like this
its beginning to scare her
she wheels around in a panic
distant calling from outside
solara hears it and freezes
can anyone help me
she runs out across the forecourt onto the road
a female figure is hunched by the side of the road about fifty yards up ahead
hard to see what shes doing from here
is anybody there
solara starts walking toward her
the woman has her back to solara
shes on her knees muttering to herself
gathering objects up from the road
as solara moves closer we see that the woman is struggling with an upturned shopping cart
stuck in a roadside ditch its contents spilled out next to a few bracken bushes
we see her face now
its the same young woman from before
the same shopping cart
the same trap
are you all right
the woman looks around sees solara standing nearby
shes shocked to see that its a girl
yes im fine
you go along ill be okay
you look like you need some help
i need a man to help
you just keep along
the woman seems anxious to get rid of her
tries to indicate the threat silently with her eyes but solara doesnt get it
itll just take a minute
she steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out
really its fine
three road brigands pounce from the bushes
every bit as brutish and horrifying as the group that eli killed on the road in our opening
they grab solara and drag her from the road into the desert screaming and kicking all the way
let her go
she aint got nothing
the brigand leader looks solara up and down lustfully
i aint too sure about that
solara is reviled by the man
hes filthy his stench overpowering
one eye missing just a dark empty socket
he licks his lips revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth
this wasnt the deal
the brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat
shut your mouth bitch
you oughta be grateful youre getting a break
he releases her
she slumps to the dirt whimpering
never did care much for that dried up old snatch anyhow
he looks back to the struggling solara
this one though
this one looks fresh
you a virgin
she says nothing just sobs helplessly
well lets find out
he unbuckles his pants lets them drop to his ankles
we hear a sound
its hard to place
something like a thhup
the brigand leader is frozen in shock
his face goes pale the blood draining from it
the two bandits holding solara look at their leader in dismay
staring down at his crotch
a quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down
there is an arrow imbedded in his crotch
what was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat
more blood streams down his thighs
a real horror show
he staggers backward shrieking
staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends
the two other brigands release solara and whip around scanning the horizon
they see nothing
one of them has a rifle
he unslings it and aims it frantically around
then they both see it
coming right at them
the most terrifying thing either has ever seen
eli walking toward them from the road out of the sun
his silhouette distorted in the rippling heat
an avenging angel
he pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit trains his weapon on him finger tightening on the trigger
the arrow sails through the air and right into the rifle barrel
the feathers at the end of the shaft plugging the muzzle tight
rifle bandit pulls the trigger
the gun explodes blowing his hands clean off
he falls to the ground screaming
eli only had two arrows
he shoulders the bow and draws his sword
all the remaining brigand has is a small knife
the two now square off at arms length
a hopeless mismatch
the knife brigand hesitates trembling
and then rushes eli with the knife
eli deftly sidesteps flourishes the sword
so quick it almost seems like he didnt move at all
the knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps
his hand goes limp and drops the knife
and then his head falls backward like a pez dispenser
almost completely decapitated but not quite
blood fountains from the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt
eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded on the ground but still breathing
he stands over their fallen bodies
they stare back up at him helpless
he crouches down between them in the dust
i offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation
will you say with me the act of contrition
the brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him
stands and looks down on him without pity
some might think itd be most fitting to leave you here like this
let you die slow in the sun
but i know better
i know where youre going
and the sooner you get there the sooner youll get whats coming to you
he plunges his sword into the bandit leader finishing him off
pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean
he turns to the other man raising his sword
eli pauses sword hovering over him poised to strike
i want to say it
i want to be forgiven
eli crouches once more by his side
repeat after me
oh god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee and i detest all my sins
the bandit follows along with eli mouthing the words quietly
the life ebbing from him with each moment
i firmly resolve with the help of thy grace to confess my sins and do penance and to amend my life
his eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him
eli signs a cross over his body then stands and walks away
solara sits on the ground nearby a wreck
eli approaches and gathers her up in his arms
she clings on to him tightly
you came back for me
what are friends for
she laughs a tear rolling down her cheek
grips him tighter
he helps her up and escorts her back to the road
this is the deal
you keep up
you pull your weight
you fall behind i cant help you
she looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt
what about her
theres nothing can be done for her
they walk on down the road
metal garage doors roll back to reveal darkness within
a pair of headlights fires up
full beam right at us
a vehicle roars out of the darkness onto the street
heavily modified with plate armor and turret mounted weapons
but its original form still recognizable underneath
its a honda odyssey minivan
once the choice of soccer moms transformed now into an armored personnel carrier
another minivan roars from the garage behind it
a dodge grand caravan similarly customized and armed to the teeth
three more cars follow
as eclectic an assortment as you could imagine
a mini cooper
each adorned with plate armor and weapons
in the lead minivan is redridge heavily armed
he nods to the driver who guns the engine
the fleet of armored vehicles moves out kicking up a great funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town
the sun hangs low on the horizon
were far from the road
nothing but scrub brush and a few prairie dog burrows dotted around
a prairie dog pops its head up scans the horizon
sniffing the air whiskers twitching
and is skewered by an arrow
thirty yards away one of the pieces of scrub brush appears to come alive
and then we realize it is elis ghillie suit camouflaging both he and solara beneath it
eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead prairie dog
solara just stands there appalled
you killed it
that cute little thing
eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff
its good eating is what it is
he yanks out the bloody arrow
solara looks away
when she turns back eli is standing right there holding the dead animal in front of her face
she yelps in surprise and staggers backward falling on her butt
thats not funny
if youre going to be on the road you cant be picky about what you eat
you eat whats there to eat
im not eating that
more for me
eli and solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave around a flickering campfire
the prairie dog roasts on a spit
eli digs his knife into the carcass the blade comes out clean
he clasps his hands together and gazes down penitently at the ground
father we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal
bless this food to our use and us to thy service and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others
eli carves off a piece of meat
juicy and succulent
he bites into it teasing solara by making a show of how good it tastes
he feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder
solara tries to appear uninterested but shes starved
what does that taste like
he takes another bite thinks on this as he chews
tastes like chicken
she tries to fight the temptation to try it
but she cant
she reaches out and tears off a piece
sniffs at it takes a small bite
then quickly wolfs down the rest
as she eats she gestures toward elis saint christopher
what is that
eli reaches up and touches his hand to it
its a saint christopher medal
whos saint christopher
is he a character from your book
eli smiles and shakes his head
christopher was a man who lived a long time ago
he wanted to be a good man he wanted to help people
so he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across
he was a big strong man and there was no one he couldnt carry
solara listens rapt
eli is a good storyteller
then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across
christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy
he was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried
the boy explained that he was the son of god and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world
after that christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river
and thats how he became a saint
later on he was known as the patron saint of travelers
what is a saint anyway
its someone who spent their life doing good things for others
enough that god himself took a special interest in them
solara looks at eli tenderly with admiration
someone like you
eli looks away down at the ground
he appears sad
not like me
saints aint killers
and i done too much of that
spilled too much blood
no words just the flickering firelight
will you read me some more from the book
you should get some sleep
the fire down to its last embers
eli sleeps next to his pack half hidden in the looming shadows of the cave
his hat and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword
solara sleeps nearby
then opens her eyes
not asleep after all
she looks over at eli his face hidden in shadow and so impossible to tell if hes asleep or awake
quietly she moves forward kneeling by his side
she opens his coat and checks the pockets
she goes deeper peeling back the layers of clothing stealthily frisking him
she finds something on his lapel hidden under several layers that causes her to stop
its a rectangular plastic badge
the red white and blue colors faded and worn
she stares at it for a moment not knowing what to make of it
then moves on continuing to pat him down
whatever shes looking for is not here
she turns her attention to the backpack
slowly carefully opens it up
there it is
the bible wrapped carefully in its neat little package of cloth and twine
she reaches in for it
suddenly elis hand shoots out and grabs her by the wrist
she cries out startled
eli sits up his face just a dark shape in the shadows
for the first time he appears a little scary to solara
what are you doing
you scared me
i thought you were asleep
on the road you sleep with one eye open
i asked you what you were doing
i just wanted to see the book
you want to see the book you ask me
nobody touches it but me
until it gets where its going
do you understand
hes very forceful
she nods a little afraid of him
tell me you understand
he grips her wrist tighter
eli releases her wrist
takes the pack from her and closes it up
pulls it closer to him and lies back down
its no use to you anyway
you dont know how to read it
now we have the time maybe you can teach me
get some sleep
she lies back down beside him but doesnt close her eyes
she just lies there watching him
the sun rises out of the east
and out of the sun comes the fleet of armored vehicles
racing side by side down the road
the lead vehicle comes to a halt
a door opens and redridge gets out
more armed men emerge from the other vehicles and follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside
the dead brigands are splayed out in the dirt where eli slew them
a flock of buzzards is picking their bones clean
hes been here
redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the bodies and back onto the road
two sets of tracks
the girls with him
he moves back to the cars
the other men hold for a moment still looking at the half eaten bodies in the dirt
redridge turns back
i said move out
i heard this guys protected somehow some
power from up above
that there aint nothing on this earth can touch him
hes just a man
you put a bullet in him hell go down like any other
i dont want to hear no more of this superstitious horseshit
hesitantly they make their way back to the vehicles
the cars gun their engines and move on down the road past the abandoned chevron station
dust pluming in their wake
eli and solara walk together passing by a few burned out buildings
it appears we might be headed toward a town
solara looks up at the sweltering sun
then around at her surroundings
nothing but devastation and decay
you say youve been walking for twenty five years
have you ever considered that you might be lost
but how can you know
how can you know this is the right way
i told you
my path has been laid out before me
yeah but laid out by who
by almighty god
well if this god guys so mighty how come its taking you so long to get where youre going
doesnt he know the way
eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her
you want to stay on this road with me dont ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again
solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction
eli resumes walking
god has a reason for everything being the way it is
its not always apparent to us
but it is his plan nonetheless
so is he talking to you right now
telling you where to go
its not like that
its kinda hard to explain
im guided by faith
i dont know what that word means
beat as eli thinks on how to explain it
it means you know something even though you dont know it
solara thinks about this shakes her head
that doesnt make any sense at all
it doesnt have to
they walk on
on the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins
almost every building burned or reduced to rubble
except for one small house
the building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition
it stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact
the windows are barred
the outer structure fortified with sheet metal and other custom patch ups
the whole plot surrounded by a chain link fence topped with razor wire
eli and solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby
i dont get it
it looks almost
like nothing ever happened
how can it still be out here
i dont know
maybe we should look inside
there might be food
beat as eli considers
then stands and unhooks his shotgun
stay behind me
they approach the house cautiously
arrive at the perimeter fence
theres a gate held in place by a padlock
eli pulls a pair of bolt cutters from his belt and snips the padlock free
swings open the gate with a metallic squeak
they move inside up the garden path
though the soil in the yard is dead its been carefully raked and tended
weeds arranged in thoughtful patterns like real flowers
this is weird
eli steps forward his foot planting on a cracked paving stone that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet
accompanied by a barely audible sound
he looks down
a rope noose suddenly whips around their feet tightening at their ankles and yanking them upside down into the air
eli drops his shotgun to the ground
they hang there for a moment twisting in the breeze
the front door to the house swings open to reveal
an elderly couple
the womans gray hair tied into a neat bun
the man bald squinting through wire frame glasses
they look like the couple from grant woods american gothic
instead of a pitchfork the man holds a gauge riot shotgun which he keeps trained from the hip on eli and solara
they step outside regarding their new visitors carefully
the man seems more suspicious than his wife
he drags elis shotgun toward him with his foot hands it to his wife
who are you
my name is eli
this is solara
were travelers thats all
we dont mean you any harm
you cut my padlock
i saw you
trying to break into our house
we didnt think anybody lived here
we thought it was abandoned like all the rest
this seems to annoy the man
take a look around you
look at this yard
does it look abandoned to you
clearly hes proud of the work hes done with the pitiful means at his disposal
like what youve done with the place
whats your business here
were sorry to have troubled you
if youll let us down well happily be on our way
the wife steps forward shes much warmer less guarded
george look at them
theyre not robbers or road agents
one of thems just a girl
seen that before
oldest trick in the book
its no trick
let them down
the woman glares at him
the husband reluctantly accedes and moves to the concealed trap apparatus
releases the rope dropping eli and solara to the ground in a heap
the old woman helps them to their feet
they shake off the noose from their ankles
im so sorry about my husband
we so rarely get visitors these days hes suspicious of everybody
im martha and this is my husband george
would you care for some tea
eli and solara exchange a look
what the hell is this
its like something out of the world before
the interior is almost perfectly preserved
a mahogany table
a tv set in the corner
eli and solara sit on the couch feeling self conscious and looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment
george sits across from them on the couch scowling at them inhospitably
the shotgun resting across his lap
martha emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray laden with a tea pot and old china cups
cracked and faded but intact
she places the tray on the coffee table and sits
im afraid we dont have any cake or biscuits for the tea
they ran out some time ago
she lifts the tea port and pours into the cups
but its not tea only water
somewhat murky water
eli and solara stare at the cups unsure
martha gestures toward them
they raise their cups and take a sip
martha watches eagerly
its clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as civilized and elegant as serving tea to guests
how do you like it
its very good
martha smiles delighted
she lifts her own cup to her lips
her hands tremble the cup rattling against the saucer
have you always lived here
for almost forty years now
this home is our pride and joy isnt it george
george just grunts
not interested in conversation
we refused to leave even during the troubles
we said didnt we george we said if were going to die anywhere were going to die right here in our own home
i dont understand how youve survived out here this long
well george is something of a handyman arent you dear
he did a lot of work on the place making it safe
we may be old but were resilient
weve had more than a few whove tried to take this place from us
havent we george
yes we have
he stands and moves toward the back door
opens it up and beckons eli and solara to come look
eli and solara stand in the doorway looking out on the yard
solara is horrified by what she sees
the entire back yard is a graveyard
maybe twenty human graves dug shallow into the earth
some were dug long ago others look like theyre very recent
it would be uncivilized not to bury them
were not barbarians
plus its good for the soil
come on back inside
i think i might be able to rustle up some sandwiches
george and martha go back inside leaving eli and solara gazing at the little graveyard
we have to get out of here
they look so sweet
i would never have believed they were killers
theyre worse than that
they didnt just kill these people
they ate them
solara is stunned
theres a disease in the outland
spread by eating human meat
it affects the brain
dementia loss of motor function
did you notice the old womans hands shaking
shes got it
theyve both got it
oh my god
eli and solara re enter
solara looks at george nervously
hes still carrying that shotgun
marthas voice drifts in from the nearby kitchen
i found some meat for those sandwiches
are you hungry
we really must be going
an unnerving glint in his eye
eli moves toward the door
yes im afraid so
as he gets to the door george moves to intercept
hard to tell if hes blocking his path or moving to open the door for him
a tense beat
martha emerges from the kitchen
are you sure you wont stay
thank you again for the tea
eli stares george down
reluctantly george steps aside
eli opens the door and escorts solara outside
eli and solara emerge into the sunlight
walk down the garden path
and freeze in their tracks
the armed vehicles are coming
driving toward them out of the horizon in a hazy cloud of dust
its my dad
its his men
are you sure
i recognize the cars
eli bundles solara back into the house
george stands in the doorway squinting at the approaching convoy
george follows them back in furious
what did you bring upon us
a whole convoy of armed degenerates thats whats wrong
coming here for them
and they led them right to us
martha rushes to the window pulls aside the lace curtain
outside she sees the armored vehicles screeching to a halt
the men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind them locking and loading weapons
oh no they dont
she rushes across the room teeth gritted with determination
martha what are you doing
i finally got this house just the way i want it
im not going to let anybody tear it apart
she goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions
underneath is a wooden lid which she throws open to reveal a huge cache of weapons
and enough ammunition for everything
she pulls out an m machine gun slings the strap over her shoulder and locks in a chain of bullets
she looks like a post apocalyptic martha stewart
where did you get all this stuff
george pulls out an ak slots in a magazine
took em off them who came looking to take the place from us
built up quite the stash over the years
he offers a
magnum to solara
you know how to fire a gun
my daddy showed me once
just like riding a bike
i never rode a bike
george sighs turns instead to eli
how about you you know how to eli is already reloading his shotgun checking the barrel
readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert
redridge steps forward raises a bullhorn
we know youre in there
come on out with your hands up and your weapons on the deck and nobody needs to get hurt
no sign of activity inside the house
redridge turns back to his men
their hands trembling
they didnt sign up for this and theyre not ready for it
redridge turns back to the house
into the bullhorn all right look
im gonna make it easy on yall
bring out the girl with the book
eli is crouched beneath the window
george and martha have taken up positions at other windows peering out
thats all we want
the girl and the book
the rest of yous can go your way
what are we going to do
beat as eli thinks
hand me my pack
still no sign of a response
his nervous gunmen exchange worried looks
they aint comin out
they redridge raises his hand to silence him
looks up as an upstairs window slides open
a cloth package is tossed from the window
it lands in the dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from redridge
cautiously he approaches
the package is wrapped in cloth and tied up with twine
it looks like elis bible
he picks it up and tugs at the twine untying it
folds away the cloth wrapping
looks for a moment in puzzlement at the object at the words written on the front of it
its a miniature claymore mine
the small red light on top of the unit illuminates with a beep
he drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back toward the vehicles
everybody get down
he dives across the trunk of the explorer into cover as the mine explodes shattering every window of every vehicle
the lightweight mini cooper takes the main brunt and explodes cartwheeling through the air a burning wreck
redridge looks around
three men lie dead already
flaming wreckage all around him
suddenly its a war zone
machine gun fire erupts from the house peppering the vehicles armor
the gunmen cower behind cover
damn you return fire
redridge aims at the house and opens fire
inspired by his example the others follow
a hail of bullets criss cross back and forth
the houses faded paint facade is shredded
martha continues firing wildly with the m
screaming at the top of her lungs loving every minute of it
come and get it you god damn sons of mother fucking bitches
george and eli also open fire from their windows periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire
solara sits across the room in the corner sobbing
its all right
were going to be all right
more gunfire splinters the window frame above his head
you remember what i told you about faith
eli peeks out and fires out the window dropping one of the enemy gunmen with a crack shot
ducks back down as the return fire impacts around him
were going to get out of this alive
both of us
because god told you
because god told me
amidst all the chaos and gunfire george has been listening to this exchange
what about us
he didnt mention you
george chambers a round and resumes firing
redridges men continue the hail of gunfire
six of them dead now six more still standing
no lessening of fire from inside the house
redridge races between the vehicles ducking from gunfire until he makes it to the back of the dodge caravan
pops the trunk and pulls out a rocket propelled grenade launcher
he sets it on his shoulder rests on the trunk to steady his aim
the rocket screams toward its target tearing through the chain fence and tearing an entire corner from the house in a fiery explosion
filled with smoke
the sounds of coughing
dazed george pushes his way through the smoke waving his arms to clear it
a bloody gash on his forehead
he finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the kitchen
or at least her top half
the rest of her is gone
george slumps to his knees with tear filled eyes
takes his wife tenderly by the hand for a moment
then the anger returns
he gets up and turns consumed now by a wild fury
firing with rage over the torn brick wall
he clips another gunman in the head killing him
george moves back toward the living room firing as he goes
redridge moves between the cars again staying behind cover
georges hail of gunfire has them pinned down
we got any more of those rpgs
that was it
redridge jumps into the drivers seat of the minivan turns the key in the ignition
jams the accelerator down with the butt of his rifle then shifts the transmission into drive
the gunmen leap clear as the minivan hurtles toward the house engine roaring
crashes through the chain fence
eli looks up from cover and see the van coming right at him
he dives clear as the van crashes through the wall into the living room
it smashes into the far wall finally coming to a stop
more dust and debris more coughing
eli tries to get up but winces in pain
puts his hand to his side it comes back wet with blood
a bad wound
he covers it with his coat stands and moves through the smoke
he finds her in the smoke
she embraces him
are you all right
as the smoke clears solara sees george pinned against the wall by the minivan
his body crushed
were going out the back
as he helps her to her feet we hear the sound of movement they turn around
the gunmen are entering the house passing through the smoking hole left by the minivan
eli reaches for his sword
met by the sound of multiple guns cocking
redridge steps out from among the gunmen
go ahead and try it holy man
you aint that fast
eli and solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles
eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack
redridge faces him and points a pistol at his head
wheres the book
eli doesnt answer
redridge cocks the pistol
i aint playing
redridge stares him down
eli just stares right back
redridge motions to his men
check the pack
the gunman carrying elis pack opens it up and tips its contents out onto the ground
the ghillie suit battery some old canned goods other odds and ends
no sign of the book
it aint here
its gotta be
redridge holsters his gun and frisks eli going through his pockets
he opens elis coat and checks the inside pockets
digs around deep inside
hello what have we here
and then suddenly he shrieks in pain
yanks his hand out to reveal elis rat teeth sunk deep into his flesh
redridge flails around violently trying to get the rat off him but it wont let go
his hand is bleeding badly
get it off
get it off me
he finally manages to shake it free
it hits the floor dazed
redridge stomps on it with his boot reducing it to a bloody smear in the dirt
eli lowers his head in sadness
redridge clutches his bloody hand glares at eli furiously
pulls his gun again and marches right up to him pressing the muzzle tight against his forehead
if you dont got the book what fucking use are you
his finger tightens on the trigger
she breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward redridge
reaches inside her dress and produces the bible
ive got it
please dont kill him
its just a book eli
no book is worth giving up your life for
satisfied redridge takes the book
runs his hand over the leather cover gazes admiringly at the gold embossed cross
you did good sweetheart
your daddy would be proud
he knew youd come through for him
solara looks at eli guiltily
she feels terrible
he said he would hurt my mom
if i didnt help him
daddys little girl
solara stands between him and eli
deadly serious now
i want you to let him go
youve got what you came for
you dont need him
let him go
hes killed a dozen of my men
if you hurt him im not coming back with you
youll have to drag me kicking and screaming
solara glares at redridge
he can tell she means it
its not worth the aggravation
he turns back to eli
take your shit and get out of here
eli gathers up his stuff into his pack
shoulders it and goes to pick up his sword but redridge puts his boot on it
eli still has a half dozen guns trained on him
he turns and walks away toward the road
as he passes solara
i told you wed both live
now do you have faith
a tear runs down solaras cheek as she watches him walk away
redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out
solara sits in the back seat staring out the rear window as it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy
she watches as eli moves away down the road getting smaller and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon
she bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears
solara in the back seat calmer now
the tears dried on her cheeks
she sits staring blankly at the driver in front
and then she lunges violently forward
clawing and biting at the driver who struggles to fight her off
his hands come off the wheel and the car fishtails wildly
the driver sees something odd in the rear view mirror
what the hell
redridge turns to see the car behind veering erratically then slamming on the brakes stopping in the middle of the road
the car screeches to a halt
redridge watches through the rear window as the drivers side door opens and the driver is the door closes again the engine revs and the car turns around racing back
down the road in the direction it came
we aint got the gas for it
shes getting away
we got the book
and we got barely enough gas to make it back as it is
we cant go chasin her
redridge knows hes right
stupid little bitch
the car moves on following the rest of the convoy
solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking wreckage of the besieged house
she runs from the vehicle to where elis sword lies in the dirt and grabs it up
solara races down the road in the car pedal to the metal
come on come on
eventually she sees him
at first just a dot on the horizon
but unmistakably eli
by now shed know him anywhere
suddenly the engine splutters
she checks the fuel gauge the needle deep in the red
she pounds the wheel in frustration
the car grinds to a halt dead
she flings open the door and leaps out of the vehicle rushing after eli on foot
as always his pace steady and slow
the sun directly ahead of him as it sets on the horizon
headed always west
solara is running up behind him a hundred yards back
he doesnt stop or look back
just keeps on walking
she finally catches up with him breathing hard exhausted
thought youd gone back to town
i cant go back there
eli im so sorry
i betrayed you
i gave them the book
you did what you believed you had to
youre not mad at me
i forgive you
she continues walking alongside him
trying to process this
this kind of compassion is totally foreign to her
she holds out the sword offering it to eli by way of atonement
i thought you might still need this
eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to him
he takes it and slings it over his shoulder
what are you going to do now
same as always
keep heading west
i mean you dont have the book any more
but i still have my faith
they walk on together into the sunset
eli and solara follow the road through burned out towns and retail neighborhoods
gutted and dead like every place else
but something is different here
things are greener
tufts of grass here and there
they attract solaras attention
eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass
it used to grow all over the place
how come its here
i dont know
less poison in the air this near to the ocean maybe
they keep walking
eli groans clutches his side
does his best to hide his pain from solara
she notices anyway
just a cramp
they walk on through the night
eli stops and sniffs the air
do you smell that
salt in the air
were close to the ocean
were almost there
they keep on along the road
a shallow uphill incline
they follow it uphill finally reaching its crest where they stop and take in the view before them
the pacific ocean
straddled by the golden gate bridge the once great structure has partially collapsed from decades of neglect and disrepair
the span sags and hangs low over the ocean the asphalt cracked and ruptured
on the other side of the bay san francisco or the little that remains of it
the city has been almost totally destroyed entire areas reduced to rubble the few buildings still standing looking on the verge of collapse
solara looks at it all in horrified awe
eli unperturbed keeps on moving still clutching his side
eli and solara make their way south across the bridge side stepping the fractures in the road
eli leads solara through the rubble of what used to be san francisco
its like walking through the wreckage of s ground zero but a hundred times the scale
they pass by the wreckage of a hotel nothing but the lobby still standing
a hilton sign protruding from the rubble
eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick poking around ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot
he steps carefully
watch your footing
step where i step
more buildings are still standing here but theyre nothing more than great dead monoliths
solara looks up at the blasted skyscrapers shes never seen anything like it
the buildings loom over her like giant tombstones
it scares her like walking through the graveyard of a dead world
this is the world before
whats left of it
they keep walking passing the toppled transamerica pyramid
once a bustling oceanside tourist spot now a ghost town
eli and solara walk along the litter strewn street passing the old ripleys believe it or not and wax museums
the celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition but slumped at their feet are charred human skeletons
eli is struggling now
he looks pale from the blood loss
his breathing labored
solara takes him by the arm to help him
a dead ruined place like everywhere else
we hear the sound of seagulls nearby the only sign of life at all
eli and solara walk along the pier until they reach its end
the original end has long since collapsed into the sea but a rickety hand made rope bridge has been affixed to the piers sheared off edge
eli and solara stand at the piers end looking out to sea
do you see that
i see it
is that it
reveal now that the rope bridge leads out across the bay to looking much the same as it always has old and dilapidated
the coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look
it feels almost like a mythic place the promised land eli has sought for so many years
a tattered stars and stripes still flutters in the breeze atop the prison lighthouse
eli and solara make their way carefully across the bridge
it feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay the waters below close enough to lap around their ankles
eli and solara arrive at the prison gates
as they inspect it for a possible way to enter who goes there
they look up
a guard in paramilitary fatigues is stationed in one of the perimeter towers
training a rifle on them
in the opposite tower another guard has his rifle trained on them too
eli looks up raises his hands
my name is elijah stone
i have a message for your boss
i need you to tell him that i have a king james bible in my possession
remain where you are
do not attempt to move or you will be fired upon
keeping the gun trained on them the tower guard uses his free hand to talk into a walkie talkie radio
we dont hear the conversation
all eli and solara can do is wait
the guard puts away his radio and shouts back down be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate
and then the massive front gates slowly open on mechanical runners with the low groan of rusted iron
eli and solara look at each other then step gingerly inside
as soon as they step inside they are surrounded by dozens of heavily armed soldiers
military more like a semi official militia
but every bit as deadly
eli and solara raise their hands
a pair of soldiers take elis pack and sword pat them both down for other weapons
the soldiers before them part to reveal a thin balding man wearing spectacles
he wears kevlar body armor over his tweed jacket and tie
he approaches shakes elis hand vigorously very excited
welcome both of you
im professor lombardi
im the curator here
what a delightful name
is that by any chance shakespearean
i uh i think its japanese
he turns back to eli
is it true what they tell me
you have a king james version
been carrying it with me for twenty five years
solara looks at eli puzzled
lombardi finds it hard to contain his excitement
i cant tell you how exciting this is
well come come
lombardi contd ill give you the nickel tour and then we can all sit down and take a look at it
he leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings
redridges remaining vehicles drive back into town and come to a halt outside the theater
redridge emerges from his car carrying the bible
walks up to the palladium and enters
what was once a cell block is now an immense library
stacked floor to ceiling with books
lombardi shows eli and solara around
behind them a pair of armed guards follow closely
yes weve been doing this for some time now
collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all across the nation
we even have a printing press that we hope to have operational soon
solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books
shes never seen anything like it
you turned the whole prison into a library
well not exactly
were more like a storage facility
were holding these books here in trust if you like
when society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve these volumes theyll be here waiting
i must ask you how did you hear about us
weve been doing everything we can to get the word out but we always like to know where our benefactors come from
i was sent here by god
lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow
is that right
well its good to know were getting such high profile referrals these days
i must say i am so excited that we finally have a king james
you know we have a talmud here we have two korans we even have that scientology book
but never a christian bible until now
i honestly believed it was the one book id never see again after what happened
lombardi appears sad for a moment
may i ask what condition its in
its a little beat up
but itll do the job
what say we take a look at it
lombardi looks at eli with anticipation
so does solara interested to know where this is going to go next
eli winces in pain puts his hand to his side
is there someplace we could sit
right this way
carnegie looks at him eagerly
did you get it
redridge holds the bible up proudly
redridge hands it over
carnegie sits back in his chair running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover
the new world begins here
he opens the book and looks inside
and then he looks up at redridge confused
what the fuck is this
eli solara and lombardi sit at one of the long lunch room tables
the two armed guards keep watch nearby
do you have something you can write with
oh yes of course
he pulls a pen from his pocket motions to one of the guards
could you please bring us some writing paper
the guard nods and moves toward the door
as he does so bring a lot of it
carnegie looks at the open bible jaw hanging loose his complexion ashen
like hes just been slapped in the face
what is it
the guard brings a thick sheaf of writing paper to the cafeteria table sets it down by lombardi
are you ready
what exactly am i writing
pay close attention and write down every word exactly as i say it
eli removes his goggles
solara cant believe what she sees
his eyes are pale milky white dead
the first book of moses called genesis
chapter one verse one
in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
the earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep
and the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
lombardi hurriedly writes down every word
carnegie sits at his desk still in shock
elis bible sits open on the desk before him
claudia is ushered in by a guard
he rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands
you told me once that you know how to read this
this blind language
well a long time ago when i was a little girl
youre going to read it for me
and im going to write it down
start at the beginning
as carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen claudia opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised lettering
for a moment there is a glimmer of recognition
a faint smile
but then it fades as carnegie turns back to her eagerly clutching the writing materials
its been so long
i dont remember
i dont remember any of it
carnegie is aghast
beat as the anger swells within him threatening to explode
god fucking dammit
he swipes violently at the bible knocking it out of claudias hands
he grabs it up and tries to rip it in two but its too thick to tear
red faced with rage he tosses it out over the box balcony
it lands somewhere in the dark auditorium below between the rows of gutted theater seats
as he paces angrily back past claudia bill is there something just go
just get out of my sight
he slumps in his chair exhausted and furious
claudia sadly turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts
some considerable time later
great stacks of paper have been filled with lombardis handwriting
lombardis pen races across the paper struggling to keep up with elis recitation
solara is curled up on a nearby bench asleep
elis coat covering her to keep her warm
eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite
he looks paler now than ever
close to death
dear lord thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me
thank you for guiding me straight and true through the many obstacles in my path
contd and for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost
the prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn
solara crosses the yard
she looks more mature somehow
determined and strong
she carries with her elis sword and something else tucked under her arm
thank you for your protection and for your many signs along the way
she stops in a nondescript corner of the yard
at her feet is a shallow mound of dirt
at the head of the mound a simple tombstone
she kneels and places a single flower on the grave
lit only by the pale moonlight barely enough to see by
carnegie sleeps soundly in bed
next to him lies claudia wide awake
she checks that carnegie is sound asleep careful not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits
claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness searching blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats
she finds elis bible in some litter strewn on the floor
thank you for the good that i have done
for whatever light you were able to shine into the darkness of this world through me
sitting in the darkness claudia opens the book and runs her fingers across the braille reading
and though we can barely see in the dim light we see the smile on her face
as solara kneels by the grave we see now that she wears elis saint christopher pendant around her neck
the tombstone reads
she unsheathes elis sword plants it in the ground before his grave
takes the book from under her arm and opens it up
its a new bible
crudely typeset from lombardis original transcription and printed on the prison press
she opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible over elis grave
we dont hear what she says
as solara finishes her reading and closes the bible lombardi appears behind her
you know you dont have to leave
youre welcome to stay here with us
youll be safe
she stands pulling elis sword from the earth
but i gotta do what i gotta do
where will you go
solara looks at the sword her fingers playing across its hilt
the blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun
there is a determined purposeful look in her eye
the sun rises through the fog on the horizon
the great iron gates grind open
solara emerges from inside the prison steps out onto the island rock
she is dressed in a flak jacket combat pants and boots
elis old pack across her back
hair tied in a neat pony tail
atop that elis ragged fur hat
thank you for the friend i made
in her hand she clutches a copy of the newly printed bible
elis sword slung over her shoulder
please watch over her as you watched over me
montage as solara walks back along fishermans wharf
through the san francisco rubble
across the golden gate bridge
thank you for allowing me finally to rest
im so very tired
the time of my departure is at hand and now i surrender my soul into your care at peace in knowing that i have carried out your will
that i have done right with my time on this earth
and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into the desert wasteland
she looks up and down the road then turns and heads toward the sun on the horizon
i have fought the good fight
i have finished the race
as she walks away into the sun her lonely silhouette on the road reminds us of eli as we saw him so many times before
i have kept the faith
