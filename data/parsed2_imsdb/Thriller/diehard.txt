we are looking east past inglewood into the orange grid of l
at night when suddenly we tilt up to catch the huge belly of a landing the noise is deafening
the usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that youve made it in one piece
as the plane taxis to its gate they stir gather personal belongings
mid thirties good looking athletic and tired from his trip
he sits by the window
his relief on landing is subtle but we notice
suddenly he hears you dont like flying do you
mcclane turns looks at the babbit clone next to him
caught he tenses holds his armrests in exaggerated fear
no no whered you get that idea
smiling ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel
after you get where youre going ya take off your shoes and socks
then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes
fists with your toes
maybe its not a fist when its your toes
i mean like this
work out that time zone tension
demonstrating bettern a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag
i know it sounds crazy
ive been doing it for nine years
the plane stops
passengers rise start to take down overhead luggage
mcclane does this but as he opens the door above the businessman blanches seeing peeking out from his jacket
recognizing the look mcclane smiles reassuringly
showing badge im a cop
pause trust me
ive been doing it for eleven
the businessman relaxes moves off
mcclane now wrestles down the biggest teddy bear fao schwartz had to offer
balancing this he moves down to another overhead takes out a topcoat and an overnighter
barely managing all this he turns she bumps noses with the bear gives a look
smiling about the bear maybe you should have bought her a ticket
he scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear shrugs
she doesnt complain
eying him neither would i
mcclane smiles with just enough of a sigh to know hes as wistful about things that might have been as she is
moves down the aisle
close on a bottle of dom perignon as the cork explodes across a large office floor decorated for christmas
a japanese man mid fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle triumphantly and looks out at an adoring audience of junior executives and office personnel
he is joseph takagi sr v
of sales for nakatomi a multinational corporation
ladies and gentlemen
i congratulate each and every one of you for making this one of the greatest days in the history of the nakatomi corporation

those things ring a bell
she turns into her name is holly gennaro mcclane though the nameplate on her door stops after the first two

holly ignores the come on turns to her secretary

ginny slowly manipulates herself out of her seat
she is enormously pregnant

holly just points to the door
he follows ginny out clearly not giving up
just then the party on hollys phone picks up and we where a five year old lucy mcclane races her younger brother to the phone winsthe wrestling match and answers
with a sense of importance
an xmas tree is in the b
lucy mcclane speaking
holly suddenly smiles
it is the first time weve seen her smile and it speaks volumes about the person hidden under a tough business exterior
with affection hello lucy mcclane

she looks up and watches ellis leave
he shoots her with a catch ya later wink

holly hides a trace of disappointment
maybe there wasnt time before the flight
you should probably make up the spare room just in case
smiling yes mrs
i do that already
hollys smile comes through again
mcclane wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest stuffed animal fao schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag comes down the american airlines ramp and into the terminal
he avoids one near collision involving his stuffed animal an act which drives him into another fender bender with a cute girl who looks like shes ready for high tide
as she smiles weaves onward mcclane looks at his own arctic gear and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend
sotto to himself california
he looks around the terminal at family reunions are going on all around his as grandparents greet grown children and their children young wives greet uniformed soldiers our babbit businessman
greets a pleasant wife and two pleasant kids
its all very traditional very touching and not the least bit corny
mcclane watches moved by the sight then looks around the waiting area just on the chance his family might be waiting
instead he spots a thin gangling black kid argyle in an ill fitting chauffeurs uniform
as he waits he beats out a rhythmn on a nakatomi corporation card with j
mcclane written on it in magic marker
mcclane pauses in front of him unsure
im john mcclane
introducing himself argyle
im your limo driver
hey nice bag
he turns and starts walking
mcclane paces him still juggling bag and giant animal
dont you take this stuff
stops do i
youre gonna have to help me man
this is my first time driving a limo
this is my first time riding in one
tilt up from the lincoln emblem on the car
both argyle and mcclane are in the front seat
just kick back and relax man
we got everything you need cd cb tv vhs telephone full bar
he looks in the back seat which is occupied by the bear
if your friend is hot to trot
i know a couple of mama bears
turning to mcclane or is he married
mcclane tries to get comfortable scowls as a rustling noise reveals wrappers and styrofoam from taco bell
he scowls at argyle
the girl was off today
hey i didnt expect you to sit up front
back to the topic so your lady live out here
the past six months
thinking about that meanwhile you still live in new york
youre nosey you know that argyle
hey im sorry
when i was a cabdriver see people expected a little chit chat a little eccentricity and comaraderie i forgot how stuck up you limo guys were so excuse me
amused its okay its okay
instantly so you divorced of what
mcclane gives up
she had a good job it turned into a great career
but meant her moving here
closer to japan
so why didnt you come
cause im a new york cop who used to be a new york kid and i got six months backlog of new york scumbags im still trying to put behind
i dont just get up and move
to the point you mean you thought she wouldnt make it out here and shed come crawling on back so why bother to pack
mcclane grins he like argyle even if he is direct
like i said argyle
popping in a cassette mind if i play some tunes
a hard rap song blasts from the speakers
how bout some christmas music
that is christmas music
and damned it if isnt the fat boys of run dmc doing a revisionist number on white christmas or something
mcclane gives up looks out the window
convertibles with christmas trees in their back seats time temperature signs which reads degrees palm trees trimmed in christmas lights intermittent west side token happy chanukahs
it is clear that christmas l
style has its own unique style
tilt down from one of the stars of this film the well lit impressive and spanking new nakatomi building
the limo pulls up parks and argyle gets out
mcclane lets himself out which is fine because argyle doesnt remember hes supposed to do it
they both go to the rear of the vehicle
argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk
so you go on upstairs to the party your lady sees you you run into each others arms
music comes up you live happily ever after that it
its corny but i could live with it
what is it dont work out that way
where you gonna stay
ill find someplace
he looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights then back at argyle whos made no attempt to open the trunk
tell you what
ill pull into the parking garage and wait
you score with your wife give me a call on the car phone and ill leave your bags inside at the desk
you strike out
ill get you to a hotel
he hands mcclane a business card with the number on it
taking the number youre all right argyle
just remember that when you sign for the tip
pointing to the building theyre paying for it so dont be shy
mcclane grins heads inside
beautiful and on first glance deserted
finally a sound in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a security guard hidden until now behind a massive desk
mcclane goes there signs in
the guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console
just type it in there
mcclane is confused for a moment then he moves to the screen
he gives the guard a look
the guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try
mcclane types mcclane holly
the screen replies frowns
simultaneously inspired and suspicious he types again
mcclane types gennero holly
this time the screen changes shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of the th floor with hollys office blinking
when you have to take a leak itll help you find your zipper
pointing take the express elevator and get off at the noise
mcclane nods moves off
he moves to the elevators and as he does his experienced eye takes in patrolling a different area
which are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby
mcclane reacts with bored professionalism nods to the guard
lots of hardware
the guard shrugs
mcclane gets in the elevator
mcclane hits and reacts to the hyper powered speed with which he rises
he rotates his head getting out the travel cricks
as he approaches the th floor we hear a tremendous thumping throbbing noise
mcclane stops and listens before he realizes its the party
as the doors open the noise attacks us
mcclane moves around the edge of the party gradually spiraling inward
he grabs a glass of mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray sips
spotting open beers in an ice bucket he tosses the punch into a potted plant even burying the plastic glass
sipping the beer he moves through the dense party
people he doesnt know throw streamers over him
a woman kisses him
a man kisses him
to himself shaking his head california
finally he queries a dancing woman
the music drowns out their words but she nods points off in some generic direction
mcclane heads that way cuts around a christmas tree loses his bearings
he sees who has an air of authority
mcclane goes up to him
excuse me im looking for holly gennero
howd you know
ive spent half my life on airplanes i can recognize someone who just got off one
shaking hands im joe takagi mr
i have something to do with this company
so ive heard
takagi smiles leads the way
as they approach hollys office door mcclane notices the name there is again gennero
holly went to the vault room to fax some documents
she should be back any
ellis is behind the desk
hes sniffling and just as they come in he sweeps the back of the slick desktop with his hand
both mcclane and takagi catch on
but takagi tries to hide his awareness
i just had to make a quick call and this was the nearest phone
as ellis rises ellis this is john mcclane
with meaning hollys policeman
to mcclane ellis is in charge of international acquisitions
shaking hands with ellis that explains the recent deal with bolivia
ellis reacts runs a checking finger under his nose
sotto relax ellis
im off duty
eager to change the subject to mcclane can i get you anything
watered down champagne punch
grinning im fine
looking through the glass you throw quite a party
i didnt know they had christmas in japan
hey were flexible
pearl harbor didnt work out we got you with tape decks
he likes this guy
actually its kind of a double celebration
we closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to holly
the door opens
holly comes inside
all set joe
the contracts went over the wire and surprised john
does the sound of the party stop for him
we know it
its more cryptic
we sure hope so
recovering i was hoping you made that flight
quietly i was hoping you were hoping that
she laughs kisses him on the cheek
ellis notes the awkwardness
to mcclane you wifes made for this business
she know how to drive a hard bargain
i remember our first date
show him the watch
as she hesitates go on show him
whatre you embarrassed
to mcclane a little token of our appreciation for all her work
he takes hollys wrist holds it up
mcclane smoothly takes the wrist away from ellis looks at the watch
nice but one of us is three hours out of sync
i think its me
to holly pointedly is there a place i can wash up
happy for the excuse sure
they go out
alone takagis look at ellis shows his disapproval of certain snow at christmas
an emory freight truck turns off olympic into the underground parking garage of nakatomi
it goes down the ramp and passes argyles black limo
the drivers seat is empty
argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by the tinted rear windows
he is making a drink from the bar with the tv on and his rap music blasting from the cassette player oblivious to the truck passing behind him
the emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down
as the truck idles the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard
tilt up from mcclanes bare feet
he is clenching and unclenching his toes
surprised actually feeling tension decline son of a bitch
holly sits on the desk here watches him remove his jacket tie shirt etc
begin to wash up in the private bath
what are you doing
its a long story
you know i think that ellis has his eye on you
pause i have an eye on his private bathroom
mcclanes face shows his relief or rather his attempt not to show any
so where are you staying
this all happened so fast i didnt even ask you on the phone
mcclane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway
well cappy roberts retired out here a couple years ago
he said i could bunk with him
where does he live
no pomona thats it
youll be in the car the whole time
look lets make this easy
i have a spare bedroom
its not huge but the kids would love to have you at the house
mcclane fixes her with a look
they would huh
beat honest i would too
they lock eyes for a moment but its an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other
just then a man and a woman both a little tipsy open the door to the office see that its occupied and beat a hasty retreat
the interruption temporarily dents the mood
holly tries to smile
but for mcclane its the last frustration
ive missed you
especially my name
you must miss it every time you write a check
when did you start calling yourself ms
caught this is a japanese company you know
they figure a married woman shes on the way out the door
i remember this one particular married woman she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash
i mean talk about your wind chill factor
didnt we have this same conversation in july
damn it john there was an opportunity out here i had to take it no matter what it did to our marriage
my job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be
oh here it comes
one of those meaningful relationship conversations
i never shouldve let you get those magazine subscriptions you want to know my idea of a marriage
its a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots console each other when theres a down
and when theres an up well hell a little goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldnt be too bad
quietly i needed that john
pause i deserved that
theres a clumsy pause as if shes almost challenging him to say
something but he sets his jaw says nothing
just then the door opens and ginny leans inside
takagi is looking for you
he wants you to say something to the troops
ill be a second
oh this is mock bright radio voice hi
john gennero here
im the sensitive and supportive man of the eighties
ginny looks puzzled goes out
holly sighs moves to the door
ill be a few minutes
wait here dont i always
immediately he slaps his forehead contrite
to himself schmuck
the guard at the front desk notices the emory truck on his monitor
the guard continues to watch the emory truck and only half notices as a mercedes pulls up in front of the building and two extremely well dressed businessman late twenties
climb out and start up the stairs for the door
as they cross the lobby to the guards table to sign in we hear their conversation
animatedly so kareem rebounds listen this is a great play feeds worthy on the break over to a
to magic back to worthy in the lane and suddenly the other man pulls out a walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the guards forehead
before the guard can react he pulls the trigger
the speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone for the rest of the action
the killer moves behind the desk stepping over a small pool of blood from the guard
his name is kyle big with long blond hair like a rock drummer
karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video monitor of the emory truck
the first man theo opens his briefcase takes out a portable cb radio and speaks into it
the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the service elevator
mcclane looks at all the lavishness around him and picks up a phone by the toilet
he opens his wallet and takes out the phone number argyle have him
a photo of his children stops him
its of holly the two children and himself in happier days six months ago before nakatomi came calling to hollys door
mcclane flips it over
on the back in crude but painstaking hand of a five year old it says we miss you daddy
love lucy and in more primitive letters john
mcclane returns the photo to his wallet dials the number
theo enters the small control room and comfortably sits behind a maintenance keyboard
whistling a vaguely familiar tune he types in some commands and locks down the passenger elevators up to the th floor
then with several more computer commands systematically causes theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls out the wires from beneath the panel
the doors to a service elevator open to reveal hans gruber impeccably dressed lean and handsome he steps out into the lobby like he owns the building and in a
way he does
theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses hans a hans goes to the front door waves the card over a magnetic plate
an led blinks and the door locks with a thud
hans looks out at the street
appropriately enough not a creature is stirring
century city is quiet
an elevator opens revealing ten more men all armed with kalashnikov machine guns are carrying canvas kit bags
one of them eddie a rugged american in his twenties goes to the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his cloths
meanwhile a karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his brother tony first playfully grabbing him
they head for the basement stairwell b theo leaves the control room and nods to hans
c eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered uniform takes his position behind the front desk
looks at his watch and seems pleased
he steps into the service elevator with the others and presses the button for the th floor
the entire sequence has taken maybe sixty seconds
ellis bathroom th floor same mcclane is still barefoot his pant legs now rolled up above his ankles
he stretches his toes again
damn it works
he lights up a new marlboro dials a number on the bathroom phone
a large sign says pacific bell employees only
inside tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines but what he has in mind wont require a doctorate in electrical engineering
karl comes over gives his an elder brothers punch on the arm points out what to do
together they focus on four cpv plastic conduits which run out of the main panel over their heads
opens a case revealing a compact electric chainsaw
on phone argyle
argyle is reclining on the seat
the music is on so loud that it is nearly impossible to hear
hey john whats the word on you and your lady
the votes not in yet
karl cuts through the four tubes one at a time
mcclane on the phone
mocking votes not in yet
whats that supposed to mean
what do you want all my children
were making progress
after i get my foot out of my mouth well really be cooking and then i can he stops and gently taps the phone cradle
no dial tone
argyle looks at the phone
mac you there
he turns down the music but there is on one on the line
to himself well call me back john
you got the number
he hangs up and turns the volume back up
mcclane hangs up the original phone and then tries the other one on the desk
it too is dead
hans and the others approaching the th floor
as they grow closer we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder
the men cock their weapons and brace themselves as the car stops and the elevator doors open
on the sound of gunshots mcclane grabs his shoulder harness off the back of the chair moves quickly to the doorway
he looks down the hall
two terrorists france and fritz armed with m machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one
they open a door look in from the hallway and move on quickly to the next
they are four offices away and moving fast
mcclane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell door too far to reach without being seen
steps back throws off the safety on his beretta and braces himself
he opens the door peers through a crack at quick cuts as mcclanes eyes scan their weapons
hes totally outgunned and he knows it
franco and fritz reach the office just before ellis and throw open the door revealing the man and woman who interrupted holly and mcclane a few minutes before now in
the throes of passionate lovemaking on the desk
the two terrorists smile at each other then enter the office
a moment later the man trying desperately to pull up his pants and the woman buttoning her blouse are pushed out into the hall and toward the larger group by
the other terrorist franco goes to ellis office and opens the door
close on mcclanes bare feet padding quickly up the concrete stairs two at a time
we follow him up then out onto the a th floor a this is the mezzanine floor immediately above the main nakatomi lobby
mcclane sees theo and kristoff wheeling carts of equipment
mcclane ducks back into the stairwell he runs up another flight and out onto eventually it will be one large secretarial pool but only a portion is completed
half finished partitions and office furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere
one end has a few lonely finished working areas
mcclane moves quickly to a desk and picks up a phone
he looks out the window at a high rise apartment building a half block away sparkles with lights
mcclane stares at a pretty girl in her bedroom
shes wearing drop dead underwear right out of the victorias secret catalog
as we watch she flops down on her bed and with one long leg in the air effortlessly dials a call on her high tech phone
it seems so easy
frustrated he watches this knits his brow
th floor hostage floor same the employees have been herded to the center of the room where the desks have been pulled back
many people are whimpering
she looks around the room for mcclane
shes so intent on this that she doesnt see one terrorist waving her forward
exasperated he shoves her
her glare at him shows us her mettle
as the employees are bunched together ellis seeks out holly
hes clearly scared but trying to fake courage
he pats her hand reassuringly
hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group
he reaches into a pocket
several people cringe
but what he comes out with is a bottega venata pocket notebook
he checks his own scribblings like a dais speaker
soothing in control ladies and gentlemen due to the nakatomi corporations legacy of greed around the globe it is about to be taught a lesson on real power
will be witnesses
if our demands are not met however sad smile you may become participants instead
beat checking notes now where is
where is the man who
slight smile used to be in charge here
takagi is shoved forward
hes worried but far from cowed
hans steps towards him
extends a hand
quite civil mr
how do you do
my name is hans gruber
takagi is confused by his charm
hans waves politely in the direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the executive away
camera adjusts to show holly concerned
stairwell rd floor same mcclane pauses outside the stairwell door to the rd floor he presses the handle and cracks the door open to reveal a computer floor
the computer machinery drones on under the lights behind plate glass windows
mcclane quietly closes the door and moves to another floor
mumbling to himself construction
hans takagi karl and tony
hans alone seems relaxed
we recognize it as a snatch of wagner
takagi stares at him speechless
smiles i have two myself
beat as he exits im told arafat shops there too
mcclane starts to open the stairwell door to the machine floor when a noise above him gets his attention
he moves silently up one flight to the roof
quietly he cracks the door and looks out onto a machine floor on the lower level of the roof
three terrorist james uli and heinrich are unpacking the wooden crates we saw in the garage from the service elevator
its not clear what theyre doing but it seems very military like and ominously defensive
heinrich points up to the ceiling and says something in german
the others nod
heinrich starts to turn towards the camera and closes the door and slips back down the stairs
hands enters looks around
and when alexander saw the breadth of his domain he wept
for there were no more worlds to conquer
to takagi the benefits of a classical education
hans admired a scale model of a bridge
behind him are photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed
karl and tony listen
i always enjoyed models as a boy
the exactness the attention to every foreseeable detail
defensively this is what this is about
out building project in indonesia
contrary to what you people think were going to develop that region
not exploit it
hans straightens looks hard at takagi
i believe you
smiling i read the article in forbes
takagi looks confused
hans puts a friendly arm around takagis shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where theo types in commands onto a built in computer console
takagi we could discuss industrialization of mens fashions all day but im afraid my associate mr
theo has some questions for you
sort of fill in the blanks questions actually
sits fingers poised over the keyboard
hans sits opposite
takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table has just read the screen blurts i dont have that code
beat to hans you broke in here to access out computer
any information you could get they wake up in tokyo in the morning theyll change it
you wont be able to blackmail our executives or threaten hans barks him to silence takagi complies
hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet
im not interested in your computer
beat im interested in the million dollars in negotiable bearer bonds you have in you vault
on takagis reaction
i know about them
the code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault
what kind of terrorists are you
amused who said we were terrorists
he tiptoes along gun held ready
he can hear the mumble of voices from the conference room moves slowly towards it
hans slowly takes out his walther and his silencer
he feels his silencer a moment as if making a decision then slips it back into his coat pocket
weighing the gun the code key please
its useless to you
theres seven safeguards on our vault and the code key is only one of them
youll never get it open
hans lifts the gun
then theres no reason not to tell it to us
aside to karl i told you
its not over
hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster turns back to takagi
this is too nice a suit to ruin mr
im going to count to three
there will not be a four
give me the code
he cocks the gun i dont know it
get on a goddamn jet to tokyo and ask the chairman
im telling you
youre just going to have to kill me okay
he pulls the trigger reacts as if shot
the glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and dripping
takagi is still seated but the chair in flat on its back blood flowing out into the carpet
hans springs to his feet we do it the hard way
tony see if you can dispose of that
the body karl youd better check heinrichs work up on the machine floor
karl in the midst of handing theo a fifty dollar bill nods
stunned sees hans move and tries to retreat
but his gun bumps the underside of the table hears it
karl is the first to move springs through the door finds nothing
he checks two adjoining rooms the first is deserted
returns to hans
nods see to heinrich
to theo now
you can break the code key
grins you didnt bring me along for my charming personality
as he heads for the elevator
under his breath though you could have
hans smiles confident in his team and follows
camera settles on the door that karl found locked
slowly lets out a breath praying softly argyle
tell me you heard the shot
tell me you heard the shot and youre calling the police right now
argyle is on the car phone
the music is playing
im working honey
course ill be by later to pick you up have i ever lies to you
he thinks im cruising to palm springs
heinrich presses something into a niche here scrambles like a monkey to a new position
helped by one of his men he jumps down moves to another area climbs up again removing something from his shoulder bag
hans and theo enter the safe room
the huge corporate safe looms in front of them
theo places three kit bags onto a table and rolls up his sleeves
he swivels a computer console into handy reach sits down
thirty minutes to break the code
two hours for the five mechanicals
the seventh lock
thats out of my hands
if out plan works
the fbi will get rid of it for us
theo grins begins typing
he types begin algorithm code program
random numbers and letters begin going by aaaaa aaaab
mcclane moves out onto the st floor angry at himself
why the fuck didnt you stop him
beat because you ignorant sonofabitch youd be dead too
suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head
his look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire alarm switch by the door
an alarm sounds
quickly firemen move to their machines as a voice of a dispatcher drones
main wilshire units
two alarm fire at nakatomi plaza the voice continues as the station doors open and we a fire alarm indicator light showing which floor has sounded the fire alarm suddenly
begins flashing emitting short loud beeps
eddie the terrorist in the guards uniform and manning the station immediately picks up his cb
mcclane stands at windows looking northward for fire trucks
suddenly we see the flashing red lights of four engines in traffic two miles away
come to papa
im gonna kiss your goddamn dalmatian
he rides the elevator back to the th floor with tony
calmly to eddie on cb call give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm
then disable the system
looks across at tony presses talk button again eddie
what floor did the alarm go off
theyve heard the alarm here too
heinrich marco and uli hear the alarm and continue their mysterious work
mcclane stands silhouetted against the window
in the distance he can see another fire truck swing off santa monica onto avenue of the stars
suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out then on the second
mcclane watches in disbelief
the trucks slow and turn down separate side streets heading for home
realizing son of a bitch
just then the elevator bell rings and we hear the elevator doors open
a figure tony slips into the shadows his machine gun drawn
we move with him from the elevator area until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire floor
mcclane is gone
under a desk
he takes in his options
the feet of tony
they move slowly in his direction
mcclane looks down the aisle next to the windows
it leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past tony
he moves steadily toward the area where we saw mcclane
the fire has been called off my friend
no one is coming to help you
you might as well come out and join the others
fingers the trigger of his machine gun i promise not to hurt you
moving more confidently he steps up to mcclanes desk then around it and fires a blast into the space
it is empty
as the sound of the machine gun fades he listens and hears another sound a noise coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles
tony heads toward the noise
sensing a trap he moves past each cubicle carefully checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one
the sound is just around the partition
he tenses then spins into the cubicle
a radial arm saw spins noisily
grins at his nervousness
he moves to turn it off not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of mcclane steps into frame behind him mcclane shoves his pistol barrel against tonys temple
dont move or name your beneficiary
mcclane cocks his beretta
tony watches him calmly
you wont hurt me
smug because you are a policeman
there are rules for policemen
my captain keeps telling me the same thing
mcclane suddenly pistol whips tony across the head
tony reels then swallows worried for the first time
suddenly tony spins to the side and mcclane fires but the big mans momentum slams mcclane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall
tony fires his machine gun but mcclane kicks him into the desk
he locks his arms around the big mans neck in a hold that sends tony reeling into the hall
mcclane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions
they careen across the hall into the stairwell door opening it and crash into then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below
for a moment both men lie still
mcclane still holding onto tonys neck releases it and the mans head flops sickeningly to the side
for a moment mcclane just looks at the dead man
then slowly methodically he begins to search him
he turns all his pockets inside out looks at his clothing labels stares long and very hard at a california drivers license with tonys picture on it
he expertly examines the machine gun when a hissing sound coming from somewhere attracts his attention
he rises moves cautiously to the source
its tonys cb which has fallen from the dead mans waist during the struggle
mcclane stares at it formulating a plan
pan from tonys now shoeless feet to mcclane who sits on the floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorists boots on his own feet
he ties the last lace and tries to take a couple of steps
he winces in pain goes off balance
quickly he starts taking the boots off
a million terrorists in the world and i kill the one with feet smaller than my sister
he yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage
then he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretarys chair
he starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper
then his eyes fall on some xmas decorations nearby
he smiles to himself
tight on mcclanes back as he pushes tonys body on swivel chair into the elevator
note we cannot see tonys head camera adjusts as mcclane pushes the buttons for the th and th floors
we notice hes got the dead mans machine gun and that a wooden desk ruler protrudes from mcclanes back pocket
the elevator doors close and the car starts down
after its dropped only half a floor mcclane forces the doors open with his fingers stopping the car between floors
using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors then opens the outside doors of the floor above st with his fingers and pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor
then up onto the roof of the car
once on the roof of the car he reaches over the edge and removes the ruler closing the inside doors and setting the car in motion again
the hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center of the open floor guards flanking them
the elevators are barely visible from the edge of the group which is where ginny and holly are sitting
ginny winces uncomfortable on the floor
holly soothes her
hans stands in front of them like a stern camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk
i wanted this to be professional efficient adult cooperative
not a lot to ask
alas your mr
takagi did not see it that way
harder so he wont be joining us for the rest of his life
as that sinks in we are prepared to go any way you make us
when we have achieved our aims you can walk out of here
or be carried out
decide now each of you
but remember that we have planned everything to the last detail
we are completely in change
a ding attracts his attention
the elevator doors open and fritz guarding the area
whirls gun held ready
his jaw drop as he sees still and dead flopped in a swivel chair a red santa hat gaily placed on his head
indicating the hostages get them over there
the guards quickly hustle the hostages away as hans crosses to the elevator but for before
sees the body
she knows her husbands abilities
not to mention his twisted sense of humor
as fritz stands there confused hans comes to the elevator with franco lifts tonys chin and sees that his neck has been snapped
he sees a folded piece of paper in tonys collar takes it out
it reads now i have a machine gun
ho ho ho
perhaps a security guard we overlooked
hans lifts tonys chin again lets the head flop over
thoughtfully security guard
theyre usually tired and burned out old policemen growing fat on a pension
mcclane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him
camera adjusts from fritz in the b
to hans and france just below
mcclane is writing in his weather beaten cops notebook
the first notation is number of hostages holly odd
then it says number of terrorists
as we watch he adds
h in lobby
and with hostages
plus ones on h roof
slightly spooked we have to do something hans
not pleased yes
we have to tell karl his brother is dead
tell him to come down
now mcclane writes hans leader
as fritz calls karl on his cb hans looks at franco
franco you and fritz take the body upstairs and out of sight
i dont want the hostages to think too much
on top of the car listening to the conversation below
franco and fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close
the car accelerates upward and mcclane grabs onto the heavy grease coated cables to keep his balance
already his clothes are soiled his face and feet arms and hair are dark from the dirt and sweat
the car speeds up the shaft passing the car bringing karl down to the hostage floor and stops at the machine floor
the doors open and mcclane hears them roll the chair with the body off the car
mcclane looks up
a metal catwalk runs around the inside of the elevator shaft
pulls himself up onto it
as he moves along the catwalk looking for a way out he passes an unmarked metal door x
mcclane pushes it open and looks in
takes out a coin
he stops switches to a nickel
throws it into the void
it is a full four seconds until we hear it ching and bounce on concrete far below
you dont have to be a mathematics whiz to know its a long drop
he moves cautiously around a corner and we see a metal ladder leading up to a door marked pump room
opening the door mcclane enters a darkened damp and full of pipes and goes to another door
he cracks the door and looks out
the lower level of the roof
open and deserted
only a heliport above him is higher
widen as a filing cabinet is flung across the floor drawers slamming out papers flying
karl has done this and hes barely started
he flings a lamp against a wall punches a hole into the plaster
finally hans goes to him lays controlling hands on the mans shoulder
i know what you are feeling
but this is not productive pushing him away he was my only brother
my only family
a flat statement i want blood for my blood
he starts to move
hans stops him
heinrichs team must finish planting the detonators
and theo needs time on the vault
after the police come theyll waste hours trying to negotiate
thats when we search for this man
we do not alter the plan
quietly and if he alters it
for once hands doesnt have an answer
theyve heard the alarm can see and sense the agitation among their captors
ellis slides over to holly
they dont look happy
somethings gone wrong
shaking her head john
christ he could fuck this whole thing up
what does he think hes doing
how about his job
his job is miles away
without him they might let us go
at least we have a chance
quietly tell that to mr
mcclane climbs to the heliport and leans against the leeward side of a wall surrounding it
shielded from wind he pulls out the cb turns to channel nine and starts broadcasting
terrorists have seized and nakatomi building and are holding or more hostages
i say again hans karl fritz and france hear the clear signal over hans unknown number of terrorists six or more armed with automatic weapons at nakatomi century city
somebody answer me goddamnit
karl looks almost
its the best place to transmit
a supervisor weaves her way back from the break room toward a dispatcher who is monitoring the call
its the same address as that fire signal frowning the false alarm
ill handle it
she plugs in her headset
her condescending arrogant tone is like the one in the famous tape where the dispatch lady spends so much time on red tape that the patient dies
into mike attention whoever you are
this channel is reserved for emergency calls only no fucking shit lady
do i sound like im ordering a pizza
with franco and fritz
no one kills him but me
its an order and the look he gives the other two backs it up
karl checks his magazine slaps it into his rifle as the elevator opens to the roof
mcclane moves around the roof circling the helipad making sure he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed
he cant see in all directions at once but hes doing the best he can
theyve already killed one hostage and theyre fortifying their positions while were bullshitting
now send police backup asap
sir ive already told you this is a reserved channel
if this is an emergency call dial on your telephone
otherwise i will report you to the police to the radio fine
hey come down here and fucking arrest me
send the police
suddenly machine gun shells rip into the concrete wall in front of him
the noise is deadening as we both supervisor and dispatcher reach for their headsets in pain from the intense sound and running
tracer bullets rip into the wall behind him
he reaches the corner and sees the other two terrorists moving toward him
before they see him he leaps down to the next level out of range of karl
the dispatcher looks critically at the supervisor in the sudden silence
have a black and white do a drive by
tight as one after another after another hostess twinkie is stacked up on the counter
camera widens and we see the young male clerk who stifles a smile
another teenage employee behind the counter also smothers a laugh
the customer is powell young for a police veteran old for the rest of the world
thought you guys just ate donuts
theyre for my wife
if i knew she was gonna eat a dozen at a shot i woulda bought stock in the company
the clerk nods and puts them in a bag
as powell pays suddenly his belt radio crackles to life
dispatch to one adam ten over
powell grabs the radio speaks into it
one adam ten go ahead
investigate a code two at nakatomi plaza century city
thinking nakatomi plaza
he moves to the door steps outside
powell looks towards the horizon and up
there it is nakatomi in all its gleaming glory
one adam ten do you copy
powell is already moving to the car
he tosses in the twinkies hops behind the wheel
into police radio roger dispatch
im on the way
and he burns rubber leaving the store running for his life from fritz and franco doesnt realize he is being herded around the building toward karl
suddenly mcclane turns a corner and sees karl
the big man fires a burst and mcclane ducks back stopping at the exterior door to the pump room he used before
it is locked from the inside
he blows the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and slips into the darkness of the coming quickly out of the pump room mcclane picks his way
over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door to the elevator shaft
the dimly lit shaft yawns before him
he starts down the ladder back to the catwalk moves along it stops
the catwalk ends and the elevator is gone
karl crosses starts to open the door to the elevator shaft when suddenly their radio crackles with karl
did you catch him
no but hes in the elevator shaft
the elevators are locked off
he cant escape
just shut him in and return to base
hans he killed by brother more firmly karl i know you want him but the police are probably on their way
maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake but not if they hear gunshots
if you lock him in hell be neutralized now do it
karl turns off his radio
in the light of their flashlights the two other terrorists look at karl in stunned disbelief
he opens the door to the elevator shaft
hes overheard enough of this to realize hes in deep shit
he backtracks to the air shaft door strikes a cigarette lighter
karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk his own gun held ready
hearing karls approach mcclane thinks fast looks down at his narrow confines and then at and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides
quickly mcclane lets out all the slack in the sling
then he braces the weapon across the outside opening of the air shaft door and lowers himself into the meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent over
it like a kid doing a half asses skin the cat on a swing set
his feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they reach the top of the air duct then dangle in the open space
he straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch the bottom edge of the duct
suddenly he feels something give above him and looks up
it was designed to carry a gun on a man not vice versa
the few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips
when theyre gone
he will be too
he moves silently toward the corner
now only inches from the bottom edge
mcclanes arms are fully extended now
he hears karl on the metal catwalk
his muscles strain and quiver
one of the canvas end slips through the clip
he grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing boom
above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside the door
around the corner karl freezes unsure of the sound holding onto the ledge by his hands
with every ounce of strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct clawing for a hold
he rounds the corner and sees mcclanes rifle lying beneath the doorway
he moves to the small door shines his light and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire
the shaft is deserted
moving his light around he sees the air duct
without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump room door
he lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space
he awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and thumbs it on
the flickering glow shows him this aint no place for claustrophobics its a long long long dark and narrow corridor full of weird shadows
the far end if there even if one
for a moment there i was worried
he turns out his lighter and starts crawling
the three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit karl leading the way through the door
karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms
the others checks these while karl approaches the camera trigger finger itching
almost immediately the others return
a whisper nothing
karl looks puzzled
then he thinks mentally retracing mcclanes few options
karls eyes scan the architecture here and then suddenly he looks up
the ceiling is criss crossed with air ducts
he fires a burst into the ducts
mcclane remains motionless in the air duct
three quarter size holes inches from his face show how close karl came to nailing him
sweat covers his face drips silently onto the aluminum
karl listens patiently for sound
just then the two other terrorists return
karl hesitates a moment fighting his instincts before finally turning to go
suddenly the duct mcclane is in groans slightly under his weight
karl stops and looks up at the matrix of aluminum duct work trying to single out the source of the sound
he steps back into the room and raises his rifle
holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly of mcclanes air duct feeling for weight the weight of a body
mcclane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the aluminum fifteen feet away
there is a pause and another three feet closer
he can hear karls footsteps on the concrete moving slowly below the duct
his eyes are fixed above him on the air duct
he presses the barrel up again
silently he moves his hand slowly draws his beretta
the next indention presses up six feet away
mcclane points his gun downward and waits
stops directly below him
the barrel starts up and just touches the duct under mcclane when franco returns to the door and calls karl
karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves
he hears the door close and lowers his head
the large led window in the front of the safe beeps and letters creep by access code accepted
we hear a clunk
camera adjusts to show theo who grins
now his computer screen reads lock disabled
do you wish to proceed
theo puts goggles on his eyes holds out his hands towards kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel
kristoff gives him a giant drill
you bet your ass im gonna proceed
he turns on the drill the street is empty quiet
a lone police black and white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the nakatomi building
he starts up at the tower
it seems calm its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday decorations on the streets
powell slows to a stop and scans the premises
in the lobby we see eddie sitting behind the desk
powell reports to his radio
no signs of disturbance im going up for a closer look
he pulls in and parks in the front
mcclane punches out a ceiling vent and drops down into the machine room
for a moment he stands listening for sounds of movement
the floor is quiet
he goes to the stairwell
the edge of the roof
suddenly a tall terrorist james moves along the wall and looks over at powells car
the elevator doors open on karl franco and fritz
they step out onto the darkened floor
we see large number painted on the doors of this floor
they move quickly toward the windows on the avenue of the stars side where a terrorist alexander with a bar rifle has set up a machine gun nest under a
half opened window
directly below him we see powells car
alexander pans the police car with his weapon finger on the trigger
this is clearly a man hungry for action
hans watches from above
he raises his cb
his usual calm eddie
eddie picks up his cb
he watches powell coming up the stairs
to cb had a feeling youd be calling
let him in
eddie is a little startled but he moves quickly
also hears this and his eager expression fades
but orders are orders
powell tries the front doors
eddie comes hustling across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card
powell steps in and looks around
bland holiday muzak filters from speakers here
let it snow we got an emergency call that there was a problem here
mcclane makes his way to the avenue of the stars side of the building enters the board room where takagi was shot
mcclane goes to the windows and looks down at the street
mcclane waits expectant
but no commotion no shouting
wheres the fucking cavalry
powell walks casually across the slick floor eyes panning the area
eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his monitor screens
we already had that false alarm you ask me the goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase
they been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it
to the screen oh shit come on i got fifty bucks on you assholes
powells face shows us hes starting to think hes wasting his time
the silent tension is driving him crazy
come on come on
whos in that car stevie wonder
he makes up his mind
he lifts one of the big chairs and swings it at the window
the tempered glass whitens on the first blow
james sees the glass whiten below him and shouts into his mike
heinrich hears the radio and shouts to marco who grabs his machine gun and runs
eddie watches confidently as powell moves through the lobby looking for signs of trouble
uli is there gun held ready
board room th floor mcclane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist marco appears at the door
both men react but marco already has his gun up
he fires a round at mcclane
the bullets rip into the table top and the chair and mcclane goes down behind the table
th floor board room marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table but finds no one
he looks around frantically than squats beneath the table and sees lying prone his pistol trained on him
drop it or youre a rugstain
just then heinrich the terrorist steps into the doorway sees the situation
marco dives sideways but heinrich still isnt quick enough
mcclane fires twice and heinrich drops sprawling in the hallway machine gun firing blindly until he hits the floor
they can faintly hear the gunshots
holly pales all powell can hear here is let it snow let it snow
he stops just a yard from seeing the armed terrorist turns back
he turns back
marco springs on top of the huge table
mcclane rolls on his back so he can cover either angle but it is clear that marco is in the more enviable position
on the table top slams in a fresh magazine and smiles
next time dont hesitate
he leans his machine gun over the edge
aims directly above him and fires twice into the underside of the table
the bullets rip through the table and marco who drops beside mcclane
thanks for the advice
powell heads for the door
eddie moves to lock up after him
sorry to water your time
powell goes out
mcclane rolls out from under the table goes to the windows and looks down in time to see powell heading for the car
oh man please no desperate he leans on the glass
which cracks again on the verge of going
looks over his shoulder at the body of marco
powell check in on his radio
unconsciously he begins to hum the muzak he overheard in the lobby
one adam ten to
we had a wild goose chase on that
everythings okay here
waiting loosening his tie he murmurs oh the weather outside is frightful but the
the uh dum de dums delightful
roger one adam ten
we thought it was a crank call anyway
clear to code eight
putting the car into gear
let is snow let it snow let it snow suddenly marcos body crashes onto the hood of his car
terrified jesus h
grabbing for his radio this is one adam ten suddenly a barrage of machine gun fire from alexander on the third floor drowns out his call
powell ducks and flattens against the seat as bullets blow out the front window covering him in glass
roger one adam ten please repeat
but powell accelerates in reverse away from the building keeping his head low and praying he doesnt hit anything as the bullets follow him digging into asphalt
a half block away his car runs off the pavement and down a slope finally bouncing to a jarring halt in a parking lot which is destined to become police
a few pages from now
powell sits up and clutches the mike
one adam ten under automatic rifle fire at nakatomi
requesting immediate backup and swat assistance
mcclane looks down at powell and grins
welcome to the party pal
widen from a police scanner
we take in the action here all color coordination and slickness
richard thornburg local tv news reporter is on the phone to his girlfriend
into phone of course i can get us a table wolfgang and me were like that
i interviewed him
hold on babe
he covers the mouthpiece because hes become aware of whats coming from the scanner
various voices attention all units
officer pinned down by automatic weapon fire at nakatomi century city request assistant etc intermixed with all this guys you want to cut through the red tape
they practically turned this car into swiss cheese
pleased all right
he drops the phone pick up another
shouts mary this is dick
i want a remote truck and a crew to meet me at the south gate in fifteen minutes
listens damn right fifteen
listens where are we going
hearing gun shots for an emmy
now hearing machine gun fire thornburg hangs up the second phone
runs out of the room
camera pans back to the first phone
sirens wail as the first few police cars arrive
powell sees them waves them back points to the third floor
he leans back and closes his eyes luxuriating in the sound of wailing police sirens
he looks at holly
i never through id love to hear that sound
hans karl fritz and franco confer
in mid speech all of you stay at your posts
we knew that police action was inevitable
an odd smile in fact its necessary
so let them start their feeble efforts until them stay calm
we have the hostages remember
we are still in charge
suddenly hans cb crackles to life
picking it up i told all of you
i want radio silence until further a mcclane th floor board room a hes got a cb on the table and on and his cops notebook is out again
hes already upgraded the number of terrorists
minus and added other information
as he speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped their sidearms etc
gee im sorry hans nobody gave me the message
you shoulda put it on the bulletin board
anyway i thought you and franco and karl and the other boys might be lonely now that i waxed tony and marco and their buddy
so i invited some of the guys from my card game
in the office the terrorists react startled as mcclane name drops
how does he know so much about waving for silence ah how nice of you to call
i assume you are our mysterious party crasher
you are most troublesome for a
th floor on mcclane intercut moving down the corridor
now armed with marcos machine gun and carrying heinrichs kit bag he seems more lethal
into cb bzzz
sorry hans wrong guess
would you like to go for double jeopardy where the stakes are double and the scores really change
he rolls heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of gauloises in the mans pocket
he takes them pats the dead mans face
sotto to the body bad for your health anyway
who are you then
just the fly in the ointment hans
the monkey in the wrench the pain in the ass mcclane stops in mid speech
hes just opened the kit bag heinrich had over his shoulder when he died
now mcclane takes out the contents
dozens and dozens of explosive detonators marked danger and a chunk of cello wrapped plastique the size of an electric razor
he whistles in surprise to himself
in the office hans turns off his mike for a moment turns to karl
check on all the others
dont use the radio
see if hes lying about marco and find out if anyone else is missing
hans goes back onto the cb
meanwhile mcclane smiles at the tell tale static as hans goes off and on
he knows whats happening
now he starts to walk down a corridor eyes panning from elevator to the stairwell doors
are you still there
i wouldnt think of leaving hans
unless you want to open the front door
im afraid not
but you have me at a loss you know my name but who are you
scornfully just another american who saw too many movies as a child
another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks hes john wayne
actually i was always partial to roy rogers
i really dug those sequined shirts
harsh do you really think you have a chance against us mr
a light blinks on the elevator
long pause yipee yi yea
mcclane goes quietly through the stairwell door and is gone by the time the search party steps onto this floor
hans sits quietly
karl steps off the elevator and goes through the crowd of hostages to hans
quietly he wasnt lying about marco hes thirty stories down on the street
the other man is heinrich and i found his body upstairs
pause hans looks alarmed and his bag is missing
he had the detonators
into cb theo
with kristoff he has drilled two holes in the safe and is working on a third when he hears the cb
he turns off the drill answers
we may have some problems
how is your schedule
theo moves to his computer screen which shows a schematic of the safe and blinking icons and the words mechanicals and disabled
three down four to go then dont waste time talking to me
suddenly all react to a nearby cb transmitter which broadcasts
this is sergeant al powell of the los angeles police department
if the person who radioed for help on this channel can hear me acknowledge this transmission
i say again
to cb i read you powell
you the guy in the car
powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks up at the building
behind him technicians city power and light personnel swat officers in protective gear etc
arrive from all directions
a trailer is being backed into a parking lot which will become the police center of operations
it is like watching a small town being constructed right before your eyes
to cb whats left of him
can you identify yourself
just listen fast because this is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy
now heres the skinny theres thirty or so hostages on the th floor with probably or guards to cover a group that size
the leader here is named hans and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with they got machine guns and sidearms up the yin yang
on top of that one of em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit kate smith
note the following dialogue is said over mcclanes
we have to find him and shut him up
hes telling them everything shaking his head calming the police are irrelevant
weve waiting for the fbi
until they arrive we cant finish out work
meanwhile let this fool waste time for the police
fritz go help uli find the bag
the camera tightens on him we must find those detonators
how many are there
thinking about it figuring theres at least one to cover the lobby a couple with the hostages
id say they came in with about a dozen
but theyre down to nine now including the skydiver you already met
these guys are mostly europeans judging by their clothing labels and theyre well financed and very slick
how do you know
ive seen enough phoney ids in my time to recognize that the ones theyve got cost a fortune
add all that up and i dont know what the fuck it means but these are bad ass preps and theyre here to stay
we notice that everything mcclane has said about clothing and ids and police jargon etc
has set off a little buzzer in powells brain
i hear you
on a hunch partner
and las finest are on it so light em if you got em
im ahead of you
uh what do i call you
what the hell
if you think of anything else you think we need to know dont be shy okay
in the meantime i want you to find a safe place and hole up and let us do our job
to cb theyre all yours al
mcclane turns off his cb and sits against the wall
an unmarked police car pulls up across the street from nakatomi building and a man in a sportcoat climbs out
stocky his hair a little too perfect the very fact that he is the deputy chief of police operations on a christmas eve gives some evidence to his position in
the pecking order
his name is dwayne t
robinson and he moves brusquely past police technicians and goes to the forward group of officers
whos talking to them
powell turns around i am sir
sergeant al powell
well what have you learned
what do they want
dont know sir
we havent heard a peep from them
puzzled then who the hell have you been talking too
we dont exactly know sir
he wont give us him name
he appears to be the man who called in the report
hes killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others
exasperated he claims
powell has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists pulling your chain
or some kind of nut case who i dont think so sir
i think hes a cop
maybe not lapd but definitely a badge
how do you know
things he said
like knowing how to recognize a phony exasperated recognizing phony ids
christ powell he could be a fucking bartender for all we know
something draws robinsons attention
he looks at pulling up and parking just beyond the barricades
richard thornburg gets out starts supervising the positioning of cameras
hans examines building plans at hollys desk
behind him the tv is on the sound muted
tv cops triumph over oafish bad guys
hans looks up as fritz brings in holly
have a request
what idiot put you in charge
evenly you did
on his look you murdered by boss
waving towards the hostages theyre looking to me
personally id pass on the jab
i dont enjoy being this close to you
hans is impressed by her candor
and shes easy enough on the eyes
we have a pregnant woman out there on his look relax shes not due for two weeks but a marble floor isnt doing her back any good
id like permission for her to more to one of the offices where theres a sofa
but ill have a sofa brought out to you
and unless you like is messy youd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom
nods yes youre right
it will be done
he nods to one of his men and she is waved to the door as she goes mr
takagi chose his people well mrs
he nods thoughtful
she goes out
hans suddenly notices a slide special bulletin has appeared
this changes to a shot of the nakatomi building with live supered over it
richard thornburg is in front
the camera tightens on him
this is richard thornburg speaking to you live from century city
where los angeles has joined the sad but world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome spectre of international terrorism
as thornburg continues we pull back
were with argyle in the back seat of the limo
reaching for the remote what else is new
the camera pulls back and we see the nakatomi building rise up in the b
stunned holy shit
were told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits
argyle is already bailing out of the car
argyle looks at the metal gates swallows
he jumps back in the car
argyle pours himself a stiff drink
on tv since all the telephone lines have been cut the only contact with the building had been through the use of cb communicators which the terrorists brought with them
strangely enough so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police
but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to indicate
argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front seat and turns on the cb
signs of activity along the edges and shadows of the area
men and vehicles
the snap of weapons and breeches
footsteps running in unison
powell picks up on this turns to robinson who is standing with the swat captain mitchell
whats going on
whats it look like
were going in
flabbergasted going in
are you out of your mind
theres hostages in there for all we know all we know
we dont know shit powell
if theres hostages why hasnt anyone asked for ransom
if theres terrorists wheres their goddamn list of demands
all we know is that someone shot up your car and it could be the same flake youve been talking to on the radio
what about the body that fell out of the window
who the hell knows
maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the dow jones and opted for early retirement
chief were ready
into radio rivers
over radio yo
begin your reconnoiter
inside the building sadly realizing that the marlboro pack has only two more to go
he savors the dregs of his current number then suddenly becomes aware of an almost eerie quiet
he moves to the window
hints of activity in the darkness
a light flares extinguished
shadows move on trailer walls
spooked into cb powell
al you still with me
whats going on
robinson looks at him warningly shakes his head
im here roy but im uh kind of busy
lets talk later okay
al whats wrong
did something realizing oh god
youre coming in
thats it isnt it
christ powell i told you what youre dealing with here i said well talk later roy
if youre what i think you are you should know when to listen when to shut up
and when to pray
hating himself powell disconnects watches lights snaps on in the parking lot to illuminate the area
also hating himself mcclane does the same thing
pale he moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be brutal
he hunches over his communicator
theyll be coming
theo watch the screens
be our eyes and ears
pause wait until theyre close
slips away from the desk a computer card in his hand
he meets up with another terrorist and they move behind a slit in the wall
eddie waves his card at the sensor and a metal grid crashes into place
they hold their weapons behind it ready
all now with earplugs in their cbs taking up positions the swat team leader moves in sop style to the door scans it carefully
mitchell listens to cb radio
over radio were in position
mitchell looks at robinson who is visible tense
robinson hesitates then gives his approval with a nod
to cb go
the security cameras on the walls pan and zoom kristoff drills away is rewarded with the message fifth lock deactivated
do you wish to continue
nearby theo sits at a bank of monitors
screen after screen pinpoints all the police activity outside down to the last detail
suddenly we recognize that tune hes been whistling
its singin in the rain
into a throat mike it was the night before xmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring expect for the four assholes coming in the rear in
standard x cover formation
eddie and another terrorist uli take up prone firing positions using the gaps in the steel partition like gunpoints
mitchell and robinson watch from behind the cover of a police car as the swat officers remove a portable welding torch and begin cutting their way through the locks
he moves painfully to the window and looks out
he cant see a thing because of the lights
to himself no
suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building
worriedly theyre shooting at them calmly its panic fire
they cant see anything
under breath theyre shooting at the lights
more shots ring out from the building going over the swat officers heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind mitchell and robinsons head
the glow fades
a moment later the next light twenty feet away dies
theyre going after the lights
the two swat officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear
call them back
no theyre almost in
suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the swat men become sitting ducks
he calmly speak into his cb
dont get impatient
just wound them
eddie and uli fire
they hit one of the officers in the leg the second one in the arm
on radio send in the car
an armored car wheels toward the building and starts toward the wounded men
james and alexander quickly load two crates onto the service elevator and push the button for the rd floor
as the car starts down they remove an anti tank gun from one of the crates
well what have we here
the policeve got themselves an r
james alexander southeast corner
the service elevator arrives on the rd floor and james and alexander move across the room toward the windows with the anti tank weapon
at the window they prepare the weapon for use
outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the sheltered side of the vehicle
alexander quickly sights on the armored car
to hans cb i have them o
over cb fire
a blast roars from the third floor window and the shell hits the armored car
the car pitches forward like a beast whose front legs have been shot out from under it its front axle destroyed unable to move
alexander looks back at james and grins
he watches from his window
coldly picks up his cb
hit it again
he picks up his cb
hans you motherfucker youve made your point
let them pull back
thank you mr
cowboy ill take it under advisement
his it again
mcclane slumps to the floor below the window
he feels helpless then notices his kit bag
james runs back to the crate on the elevator
they look on in horror as the armored car sits helplessly on fire
on the police radio channel we hear the screams of men inside
to radio rivers
voice over on radio yelling this is rivers
weve got one dead
rodriguizs bleeding bad
weve got to get the fuck out of here
to radio rivers hang on
thats an order
hang on well get you out
james opens the box of shells and takes two and starts back across the room
like a football
it sits on the seat of a secretarys chair with castors
we pull back to see mcclane press three detonators into the top then cover the explosive with a typewriter tying it securely in place with electrical cords
wheels the chair to the service elevator opens the door and block them with a fire axe
he looks in the top of the car can just be seen thirty five floors below
james hands the shell to alexander who expertly loads it into the anti tank gun
alexaneder lifts the gun to his shoulder and aims
mcclane push the chair into the shaft
for a long moment there is nothing then the shaft is filled with light then sound an ungodly roar and mcclane is thrown back across the elevator corridor against the
other back of doors by the concussion wave
the explosion like a firestorm rips across the floor the police take cover behind their cars
powell robinson and mitchell look like theyve seen the face of god as the building rocks from the blast
henrys cigarette falls from his mouth as a desk is sent hurtling across avenue of the stars into the trees across the street
watching it on tv feeling it all around him
dick thornburgs crew is taping
in awe unreal
to the cameraman did you get all that
thornburg looks at his competitors still setting up
eat your heart out channel four
the hostages are shaken and the terrorists guarding them arent too sure of themselves either
only hans is relatively calm
theyre using artillery on us
you idiot its not the police
pause its him
she comforts ginny
he sits up and lifts the cb
al the guys in the car did they make it
on the street watching as the survivors are pulled out of the wreck and to safety
on cb safe and sound thanks to you
what the fuck was that
the plastique i found
worried is the building on fire
no but its gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors
looking off nodding one spotters say you got two with that blast
are you sure
before powell can answer robinson comes running up to him
is that him
reaching for powells give me that
angrily at mcclane now listen to me mister i dont know what you think youre doing but demolishing a building doesnt fall under the definition of help
theres hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass glass my ass
who the fuck is this
this is deputy chief of police dwayne t
robinson and im in charge of this situation
mcclane leans tiredly against the elevator door
well from up here it looks like youre in charge of shit dwayne
i havent seen such a fucked up operation since the bride of frankenstein
ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass
im not the one who just for butt fucked on national tv dwayne
now if youre not part of the solution stop being part of the problem
get off the goddamn radio and put al back on
mcclane is so furious hes out of breath
argyle nods in agreement
tell em mr
there is a long pause on the cb then hello roy
howre you feeling
pissed pretty fucking unappreciated
other officers including robinson monitor the conversation
hey i love you
looking around so do a lot of the guys
so hang in there man
hang in there
tired touched thanks
as it snaps on
were in the studio set
as the picture stabilizes of the nakatomi building sources say that the terrorist leader hans may be this man hans gruber
a slide of hans appears behind her
at the same time the camera pulls back
we realize were on the hostage floor and hans has just turned on the set out here for his guests
he smiles modestly as they recognize him from the on air shot returns to the office
on tv a member of the radical west german volksfrei movement
strangely the volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own
on tv obviously gail whatever his affiliation its safe to say that grubers terrorist actions in los angeles tonight are well terroristic
as the bullshit continues ellis suddenly stands head towards the terrorist office
immediately the chief guard here fritz moves to intercept ellis
where are you going
im tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first
or your husband
to the approaching fritz hi there
worried what are you going to do
hey i negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast
i can handle these clowns
to fritz i want to talk to hans
he doesnt wait for an answer
fritz follows him
in mid speech angry you wouldnt let me kill him when i had the chance if youd listened to me he would be neutralized already
i dont want neutral
i want dead all turn at a rap on the door
ellis is there
hope im not interrupting
to fritz what does he want
as fritz shrugs its not what i want its what i can give you
look lets be straight okay
its obvious youre not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses am i right
karl looks at ellis and then at hans as if to say let me plug this asshole right now
but hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head turn back to ellis
politely youre very perceptive
flattered hey i read the papers i watch minutes i say to myself these guys are professionals theyre motivated theyre happening
they want something
now personally i dont care about your politics
maybe youre pissed at the camel jockeys maybe its the hebes northern ireland thats none of my business
i figure youre here to negotiate am i right
you figured this all out already
hey business is business
you use a gun i use a fountain pen whats the difference
to put it in my terms youre here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didnt expect a poison pill was gonna be running
around the building
smiling hans baby
im your white knight
dryly i must have missed minutes
what are you saying
the guy upstairs whos fucking things up
i can give him to you
as hans reacts with real interest for the first time we by the cb
he suddenly reacts to a groan from mcclane
you all right
hes by an open desk drawer having just ripped open a package of twinkies hes found
he grimaces mouth full
yeah just trying to handle some year old twinkies
what do they put in these things
reciting sugar enriched flour partially hydrogenated vegetable oil polysorbate and yellow dye
laughing you sound like a man with a couple of kids
not yet the wife in working on our first
you got any kids back on the ranch
mcclane swallows twinkie with a grimace takes out his wallet flips it open to a picture of himself and holly and the kids in happier days
and id sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with al junior
its a date
you buy the ice cream
mcclane laughs stares at the photo when suddenly another voice besides powells comes over his radio
on cb touching cowboy touching
pause or should i call you mister mcclane
mister officer john mcclane on the mcclane freezes
how much do they know
reacts gleeful writes down the name
to mary get on the phone to our new york affiliate
reacts signals an aide whos already writing too
fighting to stay calm sister teresa in third grade called me mr
my friends call me john mac
i have someone who wants to talk to you
a very special friend who was at the party with you tonight
mcclanes face falls
eyes closed he waits for the voice that tells him its all over
hello john boy
mcclanes eyes open showing equal parts of shock and hope
in the office camera adjusts to show ellis as hans gives him the cb
ellis has a cigarette and a terrorist brings him a diet coke
john theyre giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you
i know you think youre doing your job and i can appreciate that but youre just dragging this thing out
none of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the la police and theyre just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the
carefully ellis what have you told them
i told them were old friends and you were my guest at the party
mcclane sighs partially relieved
hans meanwhile narrows his eyes
you shouldnt be doing this
tell me about it
he looks at hans who gives him a nod
john listen to me
they want you to tell them where the detonators are
they know people are listening
they want the detonators of theyre going to kill me
ellis gives hans a big ok sign
hans returns it
and others listening intently
mcclane closes his eyes and leans his head back again
he knows what is going to happen even if this poor bastard ellis doesnt
john didnt you hear me
to cb quietly yeah i hear you you fucking moron
john i think you could get with the program a little
the police are here now
its their problem
tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt
hey im putting my life on the line for you buddy
dont you think i know that
put hans on
hans listen to me that shithead doesnt know what kind of scum you are but i do good
then youll give us what we want and save your friends life
youre not part of this equation
its time to realize that
saying this hans takes out his gun points it at ellis smiling
ellis smiles too
what am i a method actor
hans babe put away the gun
this is radio not television
that assholes not my friend
i barely know him
i hate his fucking guts desperately sincere ellis for christs sake tell him you dont mean shit to me john how can you say that after all these years
ellis looks at hans and shrugs well i tried
hans nods understandingly
he takes the cb presses the talk button and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the walther up to ellis forehead and pulls the trigger
he was expecting the shot but it still chills him
she lowers her head sadly
around her the others go crazy as they see ellis blood splattered on the glass walls on hans office
he throws open the door to let mcclane and the police hear the screams of the hostages
talk to me where are my detonators
where are they or shall i shoot another one
sooner or later
taking a shot i might get to someone you do care about
after a beat go fuck yourself
powell fends off robinson who wants the cb
goddamn didnt you hear him
he practically pulled the goddamned trigger himself he gave that man to them christ cant you read between the lines
he did everything he could to save him
if he gave himself up theyd both be dead
and maybe theyd at least be talking to us
now tell your partner to stay out of it or so help me if he lives through this ill put him behind bars myself
amused hes alone tired hunted and hasnt seen diddly squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what youre going to do to him
robinson wake up and smell the shit youre shoveling
cold anytime you want to go home sergeant
consider yourself dismissed
they lock eyes
you couldnt drag me away
over cb attention police
its asses and elbows time
tape recorders are started
starting to speak this is taking the cb away this is deputy chief robinson
who is this
this is hans gruber
i assume you realize the futility of direct action against me
we have no wish for further loss of life
what do you wish for mister gruber
i have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison
the american state department enjoys rattling its saber to its own ends
now it can rattle it for me
listening to this with expressions ranging from astonishment to dismay to outright derisive amusement
the following people are to be released from their captors in northern ireland the seven members of the new provo front
in canada the five imprisoned leaders of liberte de quebec
in sri lanka the nine members of the asian dawn movement
sotto asian dawn movement
off mike a shrug i read about them in time magazine
on mike when these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the
los angeles international airport where you will be given further instructions
you have two hours to comply
are you insane
i cant authorize
do you think theyll even try to do it
on another channel theo
are we on schedule
theo and kristoff have been rewarded with another lock one more to go
then its up to you
the graphic on his screen flashes warning electro and you better be right because this ones going to take a miracle
its christmas theo its the time of miracles
so be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock
hunt the little shit down and get those detonators
franco is checking the explosives fritz is with him
ill check the explosives
you just get those detonators
as he talks he essentially patrols the floor hes staked out constantly looking into every dark corner gun held ready moving toward the stairwell
al you there
im here cowboy
speaking of cows did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life
that doesnt even make any sense dont tell me partner
im just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang
the way you drove that car i figured you for the streets
in my youth partner
in my youth
gail and harvey have company a man from the senator paul simons school of grooming
in mid speech author of
holding up a copy hostage terrorist terrorist hostage a study in duality
hasseldorf what can we expect in the next few hours
well gail by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the helsinki syndrome
as in helsinki sweden
sam sighs shakes his head
over monitor uh
basically its when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and projection of dependency
fritz drags ellis body out of the office and throws it on the floor
over hans tv what can only be described as a strange sort of trust and bond develops
weve had situations where hostages have embraced their captors after their release and in one case even corresponded with them in prison
hans turns looks up at the ceiling
too dim up there to see from here
he sighs sets his gun down on a buttress starts to climb up not enjoying it
robinson looks at a young cop reacts startled the
right over there
robinson looks at powell adjusts his clothing fixes his tie
dryly you want a breath mint
robinson glares at him then they move together towards headlights still on dominating the area where it sits
robinson steps up sees they get out
one big back lit silhouette one little one
showing badge im special agent johnson of the fbi
this is agent johnson
stepping forward plastic smile dwayne robinson lapd
im in charge here
not any more
as robinson reacts we go to he checks the plastique not pleased
he turns drops to the floor
he lands knees bent
looks directly at a pair of bare feet
a gun barrel drops into the shot close to his head
and then hans turns looks up
the transformation in his expression and bearing are mind boggling
hands shaking eyes filled with fear he swallows looks up at mcclane and in a perfect american accent says ohgodplease dont kill me dont kill me youre one of them
i know it thrown unsure whoa whoa easy man
i wont hurt you
who are you
what are you looking for
hans eyes dart towards where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out barely visible
a way up to the roof
i thought i could signal for help he starts in that direction
they got a guy up there
you want to stay alive keep moving
you hear me
hans realizes this tack wont work
he follows mcclane
youre an american
friendly easing the mans fears only if new jersey counts
the poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile
in mid speech to fbi weve got thirty maybe thirty five hostages probably on the th floor
seven maybe eight terrorists
to big johnson sounds like a standard a scenario
big johnson nods in agreement turns to robinson
well handle it from here
when we need to commandeer your men well try and let you know
he starts to move away with his partner
angry arent you forgetting something
johnson and johnson turn
robinson wants powell to shut up
pointing to the building john mcclane
hes the man who gave us all the information weve got
hes the reason youre facing seven terrorists instead of twelve
who is he
nodding he may be a cop
were checking on that one of yours
too quickly no sir
after a moment if hes not a terrorist and hes not a hostage
hes just not part of the equation
they start to walk away
thats the same goddamn thing the terrorists said
to big johnson thats one good thing
sound like were dealing with pros
mcclane and hans walk together
hans is still a nervous wreck
nodding there was a party celebration all of a sudden they were there shooting threatening us mcclane looks at this poor civilian on the edge of going to pieces
he puts his hand on his shoulder
hans nods still frightened
mcclane takes out his spoils of war the marlboros
he sighs takes one offers the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to share a cookie
mcclane takes out a lighter does his and hans
hans nods grateful
then peers at mcclane
you dont work for nakatomi
and if youre not one of them
im a cop from new york
puzzled new york
explaining they invited me to the xmas party
hans eyes take in his bare feet
better than being caught with your pants down right
extending his hand john mcclane
shaking hands william clay
smiling call me bill
mcclane nods friendly like and his eyes glance casually over at in alphabetical order
camera moves over the cs campbell bill you know how to use a handgun
hesitant one weekend i went to a combat ranch
apologetic you know that game with the the guns that shoot red paint
must sound pretty silly to you
sounds better than nothing
mcclane takes out his baretta pops out the magazine jams in a fresh one and hands it to him
time for the real thing
mcclane turns moves on
we stay on him until he reacts to a click
he slowly turns hans is
well hans again from expression to posture
he holds the pistol aimed at mcclanes face and talks calmly into his radio in german
to mcclane put down your gun and give me my detonators
mcclane just looks at him
nods indicating mcclanes gun again put it down now
that was tricky with the accent
i bet you do a great ed sullivan
why do you need the detonators hans
i already used the explosives
im going to count to three
like you did with takagi
mcclane raises his machine gun aims at hans
hans pulls the click
click click click
mcclane steps in carefully reclaims his pistol
you think im a shmuch hans
hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator
you were saying
mcclane whirls in time to see coming out of it firing
mcclane fires back killing fritz
karl and franco take cover
mcclane ducks into a water cooler alcove looks back at hes gone a swinging office door the only evidence of his passing
mcclane curses himself then retreats into a where he ducks and dodges as bullets ping and ricochet all around him
ducking rolling he fires at mcclanes bullets rake his middle throw him over a desk his weapon flying he slides right into a glass door
it smashes around his head
bright arterial blood fountains up hope rising at the prospect of an equal battle his face suddenly falls as bullets fly in from an unexpected direction
he turns has reappeared and snatched up francos weapon
fires moving trying to keep from bring flanked
one of his shots shatters a glass panel raining down shards near hans who escapes with only superficial scratches
looks at the glass around him gets an idea
he shouts to karl in german the glass
shoot the glass
and saying this he demonstrates
karl follows suit
as glass flies everywhere mcclane sees one option takes it
blasting a burst to keep their heads down he whirls jumps on top of a long counter and runs across the room
their bullets follow him six inches behind his moving form
big cray units groan with electronic squeals and sparks as a million gigabytes goes to ram heaven
mcclane reaches the end of the counter dives and rolls to the floor goes right down on a jagged shard
he groans keeps going hes out gone safe
karl looks pissed as hell
behind him hans sifts through rubble then comes over smiling
hes holding the bag of detonators
we are back in business
on monitor here all depends on what we mean by terror
if clauswitz could say war is the last resort of deplomacy couldnt we just as well say that terrorism has an equal claim to
mary comes inside grinning ear to ear
thornburg looks up from his danish a cute little chin napkin protecting his shirt collar
you got something
waving a paper just mcclanes name badge number police record vital statistics
the ringer and his familys address right here in l
as thornburg grins we go to eddie and uli are guarding the hostages
hans and karl return
hans tosses the bag of detonators to uli who grins leaves
holly has watched all this nervously
but ginnys eyes follow karl who doesnt share the mood of the others
that one look pissed ms
relieved thank god
explaining hes still alive
the door jars open
mcclane all but crawls inside
as he passes the camera we see his dragging foot leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum
theo and kristoff react delighted as they get the message sixth lock deactivated
suddenly a buzzer sounds and the graphic flashes electromagnetic seal engaged
cannot you better heat up that miracle you were talking about
we broke through on number six and the electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer
unphased well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and ill be right up
wincing in pain mcclane washes his foot in a sink basin
he washes a deep cut soaps it but the pain doesnt relent
when a voice speaks he jumps realizes its the cb
on cb roy
you still with us
but all things being equal id rather be in philadelphia
by the way chalk up two more terrorists
they boysll be glad
we got a pool going on you
mcclane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace shows that is still hurts like hell
through his teeth yeah
whats the odds
you dont want to know
suddenly remembering an nypd course in first aid from ten years ago mcclane removes the improvised bandage check the cut more carefully
as he work put me down for twenty anyway
im good for it
so what got you off the street al
you liked lousy coffee or what
powell doesnt answer right away
at the same time mcclane swallows seeing a gleam inside his foot
he gingerly probes and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from its angled gash his mouth twisted in a silent scream all the way
realized i couldnt do what i had to anymore
at least not out there
i had an
mcclane throws the glass across the room forehead bathed in sweat
weakly they way you drive i can see why
beat serious i
i shot a kid
realizing what hes hearing for the first time mcclanes face shifts to a new kind of pain
soft eleven years ago
oh it was dark
he was big for his age
damn ray gun he had looked real enough
yeah i had all the right excuses
i really couldnt draw my gun again
i didnt mean to make a joke of it
offhand hey you couldnt know
i still feel like shit
then this wont matter
reluctantly lapds not calling the shots anymore
and as mcclane reacts we go to hans and theo lean over a monitor watching a dwp truck near the parking garage
tapping the screen theres the city engineers
theyre going into the street circuits
but who are these guys in the suits
thats the fbi
ordering them to cut the buildings power
theyre as regular as clockwork
or a time lock
on theos look the circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident
you ask for miracles theo
i give you the fbi
when youre hot youre hot
as we saw on theos screen the johnsons and robinson and powell are my a manhole with a city engineer
a big control box is there cables snaking into the ground where another city worker finishes welding a last connection
were spliced in down the line
the engineer throws giant levers
inside the manhole sparks sizzle and massive contacts clunk
one by one all the light on all the floors go out
in the bathroom ripping off his shirt and tying it around his foot he reacts into cb powell
whats going on
watching the others ask the fbi
theyve got the terrorist playbook and theyre running it step by step
mcclane reacts worried he knows better
groan with this new problem theo and kristoff and hans huddle over the computer monitor screen as if it was a warm fireplace
theo points to the computer screen all they can do is wait
we hear the humm of a portable generator
the lights go off
the computer screen stays on
theo looks over at the safe
it still reads fiber optic time lock cannot be disarmed at damn
it didnt go
theyre on the building circuit
its too local
encourage them to be bolder
the only thing left for them is the city grid
worried typing they may not do it
just as the johnsons are looking smug
all the floors go back on one by one
turning to the engineer cut it again
i cant go wider here
to robinson looking for help id have to call downtown have them take down one of the city grids
youre talking ten square block ten blocks
to big johnson are you crazy
its christmas eve thousands of people the mayorll scream bloody murder ignoring robinson to the engineer we must shut down the building
i need authorization authorization
how about the united states fucking government
lose the grid or lose your job
the engineer looks at robinson
the engineer looks at his guy in the manhole shrugs
takes phone central
this is walt out at nakatomi
i want you to shut down grid
listens no shit its my ass
just shut it down now
and then the floors of the building all go emergency lighting flicks on
an alarm beep beep beeps
changes to fiber optic time lock deactivated at source
with a dramatic hum worthy of the vault door opens
the fbi guys look at the dark building than at the lapd guys
that should shakeem up
with all the power shut down those bastards are probably scared shitless
the safe door finishes its ponderous move clunks to a halt
theo and kristoff laugh give each other high fives
even hans loses his usual cool slaps theo on the back as theo and kristoff cheer
drives along a residential street
we see the nakatomi tower in the b
spotlit by the police beams
thornburg checks a map points a turn out to the driver
powell looks up at the dark structure lit only by emergency lighting
he sidles over to the fbi men
dryly what do we do now arrest them for not paying their electric bill
sharply we let them sweat awhile
then when theyre expecting helicopters
pause we give them helicopters
nodding right up the ass
into another communicator this is johnson
no the other one
i want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes
damn right fully armed
were on our way
into cb attention in the building
hans talks while theo and kristoff tackle the problem of unloading the racks and racks of bonds and transferring them to the black cases
this is hans
this is agent johnson of the fbi
the state department has arranged for the release of your comrades
the helicopters you requested are on the way
i hear you fbi
well be ready
he disconnects smiles at theo
when they touch down and we blow the roof theyll spend a month sifting through the bodies and rubble
by the time they figure out what went wrong
smiling at the irony well be earning twenty percent like nice fat capitalists
disconnecting grinning by the time he figures out what hit him hell be in a body bag
the johnsons exit
powell and robinson look at each other unhappy
powells cb hisses powell listen
powell moves off to be alone
im here john
mcclane tries walking on his foot
he winces in pain clearly at the end of his resources
long pause look
im getting a bad feeling up here
id like you to do something for me
look up my wife
dont ask how youll know by then
and tell her
ive been a jerk
when things panned out for her i shouldve been behind her all the way we had something great going until i screwed it up
she was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me
shes heard me say i love you a thousand times but she never got to hear this
pause you get all that
clearly touched i got it
but you can tell her yourself
just watch your ass and youll make it
i hope so
but thats up to the guy upstairs
pause struck by a thought upstairs
thinking to himself hans you bastard
what were you doing
stand by powell
i gotta check something out
he moves towards the door limping hurriedly out of the room
thornburgs got one foot literally in the doorway but since paulina still has the chain on its not quite enough
to paulina one minute thats all we ask
you could be denying them their last chance to talk to their parents
holly says i couldnt let strangers into strangers
im with kflw tv thats affiliated with the fcc and im sure you know thats the united states government
just like the ins
as she wavers
mcclane hobbles in here favoring his foot
he retraces his steps earlier mentally replaying his meeting with hans
i was here
his eyes flick over the area
then he looks up
seeing something he moves closer
he sets down his cb and then with difficulty he climbs up on a thick pipe flicks his lighter and hold its high
explosives are everywhere
he reacts quickly extinguishing the lighter
he follows the detonator lines with his eyes
oh my god
he drops to the floor winces in pain picks up his cb
powell listen to me
youre being double crossed
the whole roof of this building is suddenly a gun barrel is pressed against his head
karl takes his baretta tosses it away
then karl takes the cb
smiling karl smashes the transmitter underfoot
powell is beside one of the radio monitoring officers
into cb roy
to the officer i thought you had him
he said something about a a double cross
looking off tell me about it
showing two helicopters in the distance heading this way
karl hovers over mcclane who hasnt moved a muscle
quietly were both professionals
but this is personal
mcclane drives his elbow into karls face
karls weapon clatters on the floor
mcclane follows his first blow with another
karl recovers and with a spinning karate kick slams mcclane back
eddie turns from a window where the chopper lights loom closer
camera pans across the room to the doorway of the office where hans nods stands
i know youre proud of your daddy
shes speechless watching in shock as shows thornburg at hollys house
hes squatting down with his microphone to interview the children in their p
his voice is soft comforting
to the children because hes a very brave policeman
and your mom has shown just as much courage
but is there something you would like to say to them if theyre watching
says nothing but lucy looks at the camera
she struggles to stay composed
she slowly turns her head looks at hans
hes looking away from us at the picture of the children on her desk
he turns back and looks at her
how nice to make your acquaintance
he raises his weapon
but he only shoot it into the ceiling making everyone jump
shouting on your feet everyone
quietly to uli youll lock them up there and come right down
uli nods and he and eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs
hans moves forward
grabs holly himself
mcclane and karl move towards each other each sizing the other up each looking over the terrain
better this way isnt it
i mean any faggot can shoot a gun
this time karl doesnt take the bait
then when he does charge its unexpected
the two men fight brutally karl bringing years of martial training to this moment mcclane bringing nothing but the street
you shouldve heard your brother scream when i broke his fucking neck
karl steps in quickly with a deadly move
mcclane twists free slams an elbow into karls kidney
karl backs off circles mcclane with new respect
through the canopy we see another flanking chopper
johnson and johnson are here helmets and mikes on
big johnson checks aerial maps while little johnson checks ammo clips for his sniper scoped assault rifle
shouting to the pilot stay low
theyre expecting transports not gunships
shouting over the noise of the rotors what do you figure on breakage
i figure we take out all the terrorists and lose percent of the hostages
i can live with those numbers
theo and kristoff load the bonds into the big cases which carried all their gear when they entered
as hans and eddie come in they look curiously at holly
a little bonus for us
shoving her forward violently a policemans wife might come in handy
he picks up a cb speaks into it
i have some news for you
tilt up from the cb radio karl smashed
karl and mcclane are in the b
almost toe to toe all their tricks played out going at it with animal instinct
pause then on a new channel karl
he looks at theo
uli herds the hostages up onto the roof pushing the last few out
they float toward us hugging the street their prop wash shaking the trees
following them with their eyes for once sharing the same opinion
they see their very own christmas decorations the friendly copter lights and begin to smile and cheer
uli smiles to himself moves towards the door theo closes the lid of a bond stuffed case carries it out of the room
hollys eyes follow his exit while the others continue
to hans scornfully after all your posturing all your speeches
youre nothing but a common thief
im an exceptional thief mrs
and now that im moving up to kidnapping you should be more polite
he slaps her
karl drives mcclane back with a sweeping head kick
mcclane is staggering
he gets in one hard punch and then karl charges at him
mcclane falls backwards drives his legs upwards propelling karl into the air karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine becomes entangled
jumps to his feet yanks the other end of the chain
is jerked upwards by the neck
he twitches like a captured fish starts to turn blue twists the chain end around a pipe as karl stills
mcclane snatches up his baretta from the floor runs out
we can see the tailing chopper through the open port of this one
big johnson leans over slaps the shoulder of his pilot
just like saigon eh wally
my kind of town
the door rattles
his back to the camera uli goes to the door opens it and two bullets come out his back
smoking baretta in hand mcclane vaults over the body before it has even stopped twitching
as the hostages squeal and scream mcclane snatches up ulis machine gun runs out onto the roof
he charges through the crowd spots ginny near the edge of the roof
she meets him halfway
wheres holly the took her after they saw the kids on television what
god he looks off to the choppers
he turns shouts
listen to me
all of you get down to the lower floors youre all in danger
what are you crazy
were being rescued
those helicopters there wont be shit for those helicopters to land on because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives
now get below but
were safe up here safe my ass
this aint a helipad its a launching pad
and he fires over their heads
they scream head for the door as he hoped
he fires again raking a line across the roof
they really haul ass
a young fbi agent is here with a rifle and a partner
into throat mike looking out the door flight leader this is wing
i think theyre on to us
one of the terrorists is firing on the hostages
into mike roger wing
to the pilot swing around
raising his rifle give me a clear shot
the pilot nods
supervising the work schnell schnell
der zeitz ist kurz
something catches his eye
he turns looks at through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages coming back into the room
mcclane herds the last of the hostages inside starts for the door himself when with a roar and a chatter of rotors the lead chopper zooms overhead
mcclane throws himself down on the ground looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then from the open side gunfire erupts
shocked mcclane dives out of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door
descending screaming and howling as a chopper sweeps past a window on a loop back towards the roof
both johnsons fire away bank and well nail him
hans whirls towards kristoff
blow the roof
but karl and uli are up there camera adjusts to show the remote detonator on a table
hans goes to it
mcclane dives away from another burst
you assholes im on your side
they come in on another pass
desperate he looks around see a fire hose
makes up his mind
with the chopper looming up behind him he slings ulis weapon runs to the fire hose unreels three yards loops it around his back and under his legs
he looks over the edge hesitates fuck this
bullets hit all around him
he jumps hans extends the antenna
hits the button
the helipad explodes
a fireball rolls into the sky
lose their footing on the floor
dust and debris fall down but theyre okay
strains to avoid the rising fireball
its caught in the explosion
it tips over a rotor hits the roof it crashes explodes tumbles down the side of the building
dangling against the side of the building he ducks and winces as flaming debris soar past him
flame roars towards it engulfs it
it jerks on its foundation pivots degrees as several bolts slip drops several more feet
he swallows then kicks against the side of the building his bloody feet leaving smears
the shatterproof glass doesnt budge
wincing as more flaming debris sizzles by mcclane levels the machine gun kicks off from the building swings back ten feet reaches the zenith of his arc fires the gun
and sails back in mcclane smashes through the shattered glass sails inside rolls onto the floor plowing through furniture and decor
finally he stops catches his breath with relief
rises to one knee the fire hose mounting is blasted off the roof sails past the the hose mechanism tumbles downward
mcclane is yanked off his feet dragged towards the window
it slides down the side of the building
the hose plays out on the edge of the windowsill dragging mcclane towards his death
claws at the floor
inches from the shattered window he braces his legs against the sill groans as he fights the weight of the hose and the reel
one foot slips
only his already wounded foot keeps him indoors
he scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig gets free just before the hose nozzle crashes out and into the great beyond
winded strength ebbing he staggers to his feet just in time for to recoil from another staggering explosion
they scream cry out as holly covers her head from falling plaster the men work like automatons piling up the bonds
recovers from another aftershock runs up the steps is momentarily amazed to hear a ding from the elevator he looks at where suddenly the wall explodes outward as an entire
elevator crashes through the wall swinging on its cable like a demolition ball on a crane
mcclane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like schrapnel reaches the apex of its swing drops down in an arcing turn the elevator crashes into the
the section mcclane in on snaps loose
at the last minute mcclane leaps towards and catches it as stairs and elevator crumble behind and beneath him
with his last effort he hauls himself onto the balcony and them moves off
the police are scrambling for cover
powell and robinson are open mouthed
argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat the stuffed animal held over his head as much for company as protection
as the building ceases to rock argyle sneaks a peek out from under the fur
and sees at the delivery truck
he steps into a white paramedics jumpsuit and zips it up
he hops into the cab and pulls the truck away from the loading dock
he creeps forward looks carefully into theyre getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds
suddenly the camera focus changes to holly
mcclanes face shows his anguish
he checks the weapon he took from uli
under his breath shit
he checks his baretta
he thinks desperate
he takes the bullet from the rifle clip adds it to the baretta clip
he slams the pistol clip back really worried
mind racing he looks all around the room
his eyes fall on a tape dispenser
he thinks again
steps towards it theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into the back
a car engine fires up inside the delivery truck
realization dawning he vaults into the front seat
a paramedic van shoots out of the back of the pacific courier delivery truck
flooring the limo argyle crashes into the van which careens into the wall
theo staggers out in time for argyle to deck him with one punch
looking around wheres the camera when you need them
the last of the money is piled on
hans hangs onto holly while eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags
kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape
suddenly he is cold cocked by a rifle butt
mcclane steps into view in the doorway backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above
he holds the machine gun ready
hans turns not that surprised
grinning he yanks holly into view
no words need be said
holly we have to stop meeting like this
taking in the vault so thats what it was
a fucking robbery
thinking so why nuke the building hans
with a shrug when you steal six hundred dollars you can disappear
but when you steal six hundred million they will find you
unless you play dead
tight smile which happens to be your next role
drop your gun please
hans pushes the gun against holly again really hurting her
eddie quickly raises his weapon
to eddie nein dies ein ist mein
to mcclane this time john wayne does not walk off into the sunset with grace kelly
that was gary cooper shithead
no more jokes drop it or she gets it between the eyes
slowly putting down his gun whoa hans now youre the cowboy
yippe ki yea mother fucker
now you are fucked
he aims holly now
instantly holly sidesteps jabs her elbow into hans face
at the same moment holly moves mcclane grabs his baretta from its hiding place taped to the back of his neck shoots hans high in the chest
the bullet passes right through hans and the window behind him splatters with blood and shatters
even while this is happening mcclane spins eddie takes a gunshot drops just like on gunsmoke
hans drops his weapon staggers looks down at his own blood in shock
you were right about us americans
he blows smoke from his pistol barrel we are cowboys
incredibly hans still stands eyes filled with shock and disbelief
he reels falls against the windowsill starts to topple and then he grits his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he grabs and
she is yanked off her feet
hans goes out the window pulling holly with him
mcclane leaps forward catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute
the roof still in flames mcclane hangs halfway out of the window jagged glass raking his face straining to hold onto holly as hans drags her out
mcclane braces himself against the window frame and strains to pull holly closer
with a moan she catches the windowsill with her inside hand
mcclane stretches with his other hand begins to inch towards hollys wristband
a death grip on the watchband
we widen see that blood flecked teeth gritting he is straining with his other hand to bring up the gun he is still holding
hollys scream alerts him
hans locks eyes with mcclane one last time starts to pull the trigger as mcclane releases the latch on the watchband
the overtaxed metal snaps links flying hans face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop
we listen to his scream all the way down finally hear him hit
mcclane pulls holly back into the room and holds her
its okay babe
he looks down at hans body then back at the scrap of wristband hes still holding
you got a warranty on this
she laughs through her tears holds onto him
smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor
thornburgs remote truck careens into the parking lot
a crowd watches as the front doors of the building open
we see mcclane who holds up holly and in turn is supported by swat men
as reporters start shouting questions mcclane breaks free of his entourage and holding holly pushes into the crowd
calling out al
al you here
the crowd eddys and surges
suddenly powell is there and mcclane knows its him
they stare at each other ten feet apart and then theyre grinning extending their hands
but somehow a shake isnt enough and theyre embracing each other like men whove lived through combat together
which in fact is the truth
man you were my rock
i couldnt have made it without you
hey this is my wife
taking powells hand correcting holly mcclane
hearing this mcclane grins pulls her close
to her a pleasure
i guess john doesnt need me to give you that message anymore
mcclane begins to make silent ixney gestures in powells direction
you know about him being such a jerk and how hes really sor seeing mcclane ee
uh im sure hell fill you in
just then robinson barges forward
i want you for debrief mcclane
youve got some things to answer for ellis murder property damage interfering with police business a scream causes mcclane to turn
there in the doorway is karl clothing and body scorched
easily as crusted in dirt and blood as mcclane he holds his machine gun
as the crowd panics trying to escape karl locks eyes with mcclane and levels his gun
mcclane throws holly to the ground and grabs the dumbstruck robinsons sidearm
but he doesnt get off a shot a lone gunshot stops karl knocking him back through the doorway
mcclane looks back to see powell still sighting down the barrel of his
his hand is rock steady
he sees mcclanes look
shrugging you were right
you couldnt have made it without me
suddenly mcclane and holly squint as lights pan onto them
thornburg pushes his way forward mike extended like a weapon
any comment on your incredible ordeal
what are your feelings now that its all over
without a beat holly punches him in the chops
he falls dropping the mike with an electronic squeal
mcclane looks at his wife amazed
behind them thornburg sits on the ground nurses his lip turns to his camerman
eager did you get that
mcclane and holly continue on turn towards its a little smashed up but still running
argyle is standing beside the open door
mcclane and holly get in and argyle closes the door
getting in the front if this is their idea of christmas i gotta be there for new years
camera adjusts to show the read window where mcclane and holly are kissing
as they drive off we twentieth century fox script department w
