written by stephen gaghan based on the book see no evil by robert baer exile is not a material thing it is a spiritual thing all corners of the earth
exactly the same
and anywhere one can dream is good providing the place is obscure and the horizon vast
if a triangle could speak it would say that god is eminently triangular
the minarets of shia mosques dot the skyline
the sun rises through the smog
keening sirens call the faithful
a group of bearded turbanned men in white robes carrying korans walk down an empty street
as the religious men pass a nondescript metal door a thumping sound rises
the door cracks open and three muslim women in full black sack emerge
the door shuts quickly behind them
stay with the three muslim women as they walk away
click click click on the cobblestone
we hear giggles
one of them reaches down and removes stiletto high heels which disappear under the black cloth
down two flights of crowded stairs theres a bar dance floor low couches minimal lighting wasted people
wealthy young iranians sit at a table littered with ice buckets and bottles of absolut and johnnie walker
and with them is bob baer s professionally nondescript he could be anything a salesman a high school teacher
his face is ever changing and his eyes miss nothing
bob is the only american in the place and still you almost wouldnt notice him
arash amiri s a confident young iranian yells over the music
beside him is his brother
have you ever tried liquid mdma
bobs forehead is sweating and his hair is sticking to it which he wipes away as he sips his scotch
no i never tried it
the music is louder
arash proudly shouts over it tehran is the world capital
bob doesnt respond
arash shouts again so hows the kid
arash just stares
bob sips his drink
are we gonna do this
a girl begins to dance in front of arash
after prayer distant pov down to the street as two cars pull up
bob gets out of one walks to the rear opens the trunk the trunk slams
bob carries a worn attache case
the amiris get out of their car oblivious shiite party boys
bob walks happy
dour men at cafe tables miss nothing
corrugated metal shutters close sealing out the light
arash ushers bob through the gloom toward two military cases
bob expertly flips one over and opens it
inside a stinger missile neatly disassembled
he finds the serial number j w
a smiley face is scratched into the metal of the stinger
bob tries to activate the stinger
arash and his brother perspire
bob is perspiring
bob thinks he hears faint mouth breathing from behind the curtain closing off the rear of the shop
bob opens his attache case
he removes a pouch
the pouch holds a battery
the battery has a serial number
bob finds j w
a perfect match
he removes the dead battery and replaces it with the live battery
he activates the missile
everyone is relieved
bob moves to the next military case
he replaces the next battery and activates the second missile
arash and his brother share a celebratory glance
arash suddenly takes one case and drags it through the curtain
bob hears low voices
he turns questioningly to arashs brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot
then arash reappears passing by bob
you said they were both for you
arash tosses an envelope at bob what do you care
bob glances in the envelope
behind him the amiris are picking up the other case
bob moves toward the curtain
in the back of the shop bobs eyes adjust
several robed shapes ghosts in grey light carry the case out a door
the barrel of a gun touches the side of bobs head
the sound of a shell chambered and a mouth breather
bob raises his hands
the barrel slides around to his forehead and bob is staring into the blue eyes of mohammed sheik agiza s bearded and calm
i was looking for the bathroom
msa seems remarkably serene then he screams in arabic
you dont speak farsi do you you son of a goat
msa screams again tightening his finger on the trigger then he backs out the door never losing aim on bob
the high pov down to the street
the amiris exit the kebab shop carrying the remaining military case
camera adjusts to incorporate someones hand on the rooftop
and next to it a remote control trigger device
as the amiris carry the case toward their car bob appears in the doorway and heads up the street toward us
behind bob in the distance the amiris get into the car
bob glances up at the roof and nods once continuing to walk toward camera as the car explodes
bob walks on as if nothing happened
tight on the game of asteroids
the version from the s
black and white triangle spaceship spinning shooting white dots at drifting rocks breaking them up only to create more rocks
a hand rapidly hits the firing button
robby baer concentrates hits hyper space smiles remembers he has a retainer hides his smile
he glances over at a cafe table where bob and margaret baer s frank and guarded in a way that is compelling are having morning coffee
we realize that all around them are iranians that a crowd is massing in the street outside and that bob clearly doesnt want to have this conversation
if you go back you get promoted
which could open doors later
those people back there dont know whats going on
they dont wanna know
have you thought about college
has that made it onto the radar screen
and its not like anybody else could roll in here
its not like its just reading reports
i took pakistan because of the hardship pay
the private school bobs expression not unkind but familiar to her says he knows exactly why she took pakistan
i believe in what im doing too
they look at each other
well then here we are
here we are
in the street its turning into a full blown protest
lets say somehow i get a branch or even a group then what
will you come
will you bring robby
now margaret looks away
a student leader is up on a platform brandishing a coke bottle shouting in farsi into a bullhorn
whats he saying
hes against the ban on coca cola
he says you have to fix your soul which is not something you can put on a soft drink
we see the faces of the protesters silently staring their mouths covered by black tape
at a kitchen table riley almost puts his hand in a bowl of dry cheerios squishes it around then throws a handful on the floor
you are a cheerio dissemination device
yes you are pull back to find his father bryan woodman american late s in a shirt and tie
blonde and blue eyed like a modern t
lawrence hes lost in the child sharing his sense of wonder
dont let him do that please
his wife julie woodman sleepy american very fit in sweats cooks bacon at an older range
they have the worst house in the best neighborhood and have yet to properly furnish it
an evolutionarily perfect machine for the spreading of imported cheerios to all corners of the kitchen
the toddler smiles at him
julie puts four plates down
they both notice the empty place setting
just then a golden boy max enters the kitchen
mommy i want bacon
you have bacon
max sits at the table
i want real bacon
you have real bacon only its made from soy beans
max looks at his plate
i want pig bacon
bryan drives a bmw wagon along lake geneva the fountain spouting into the sky
a kite is wedged upside down in the foot well

a brightly lit bryan listens to an ear piece in front of a colombe suisse de banque banner
our position is that there is at least twelve dollars of instability premium in the market
protests in iran
threat of more strikes in venezuela
the turks still making noise about russian crude through the bosphorus

across the small trading floor bryan is sealed off in a mini tv studio then the lights switch off and bryan leaves the booth tighter on bryan as he walks

a small sign reads research
three tvs play cnn a black and white image of a pinched old man army tanks rolling through iraq in night vision
bryan is on the phone
we hear a three year old voice hello daddy

on bryans desk mounds of research books reports numbers

an abrupt three year old hang up
bryan looks up and sees his british boss holding a fancy invitation

vincent sticks his head in the door september t i ticked up fifteen cents and is rebounding

vincent tries to snatch the invite
through much finagling we have an audience with the emir

the towelheads love children
on tv john d
rockefeller in a safari hat leads a group in baptist hymns on a croquet lawn while the tanks roll through baghdad
tundra seen from the air in the ex soviet republic
a giant ditch cuts the landscape
in the giant ditch is a giant pipe leading to a ramshackle oil facility of shipping containers scattered around a derrick
a herd of goats scamper out of the way of agiant bulldozer with wheels as big as a house
marching music comes from a tin speaker on a wooden pole
animal pieces roast on a grill made from oil drums
oilmen cluster around makeshift wooden tables
bennett holiday african american a clean cut lawyer maybe horn rims starting to grey sits at a table with russian oil execs
the leader eats ribs with tiny teeth
are you a director or executive of this company
the leader gnaws on a bone
bennett points down to a mess of contracts and legal papers in front of him
is this your fax number
the leader speaks rapidly in russian
bennett is baffled
finally an underling translates
he says we eat every part of the pony
ask him if hes been receiving faxesat this number
ask him if this is his phone number
to the leader is this a number to reach you
again the leader speaks in rapid russian
he says the weather in siberia is very cold
im asking you about this payment
who is this person on the account
bennett notices a russian oskar werner type wearing thick framed glasses smoking and staring at him
another russian glances at the paperwork
bank is no more
i know bank is no more
im trying to find out where the assets went
the russians nod to the music coming from the poles
now the leader speaks in surprisingly good english
this is marching music composed for stalin
inspiring for workers
the leader smiles at bennett
its a scary smile
the thick framed glasses guy is still staring
the investment dollar that matters is one that has army behind it
we are very good friend of united states
who you want arguing for you in the hague
the leader spreads his arms expansively to take in the miles of empty tundra around them
from right here we light and heat europe for next fifty years
killeen and kazakhstan partners forever
a distant shot of the small cluster of humanity in the vast steppe marching music drifting across it
youre not taking this seriously
you dont think this is a problem
one wall is a map of the world except where there should be jagged country boundaries are perfectly straight resource lines
its color coded the world divided into energy corporations exxon mobil british petroleum a u
attorney is looking into your relationships in kazakhstan and the u
government is holding up approval of our merger
at one end of a long table in a corporate boardroom president tommy barton s a hatchet man of zen like corporate efficiency heads a group of executives
a small placard labels this faction connex
the board thinks its a problem
janus certainly thinks its a james jimmy pope s a powerful presence leavened by connecticut minor chords speaks from the far end where an opposing faction is labeled killeen
is the caspian a lake or a sea thomas
thats an important legal point oh give me another lecture on subsurface rights thomas
he is imposing in a lyndon johnson visits congress sort of way
if the caspian is a sea you can make deals with the stans but if its a lake then the rights are shared equally by all countries including iran
and by an act of our congress it is illegal to trade with iran so we cant be in business with any of those countries even though they have oil
and we sell it
this is our business tommy selling oil not finding it
anyone can find it
jimmy motions out the window a monkey can stick a straw in the ground slurp it out and boil it right thomas
but you wanna make it commercial you wanna turn it into a commodity then you gotta be able to move it and to move it you gotta have relationships
take the gulf thats enough jimmy
no i want to talk about the gulf and how a goddamn e mir what is an e mir anyway king
its a king how some podunk king tossed you out on your ass
jimmy pulls out a sharpie walks to the resource map and defaces it drawing the outline of an actual country kazakhstan in central asia home of the tengiz field
every company in the world wanted into kazakhstan into the tengiz but killeen got it and then connex wanted killeen and here we are
i made investments
investments that will bear fruit for this company
hell tommy weve all got the foreign corrupt practices act committed to memory
ive got a little copy taped to the wall of my head
thank you jimmy
you know how much we appreciate hearing your point of view however mr
janus and i have asked connexs washington counsel sydney hewitt to come down here and talk about strategy for the next thirty days
the eyes all shift to sydney hewitt
s alabama smooth accent and ever so certain
in a way i feel like switzerland and id like to remind everyone in this room that theyve signed confidentiality agreements
and allow me to introduce my associate bennett holiday who will be how should i put it building consensus day to day
bennett the only african american in the room takes in the faces now all staring at him
all the white faces
business class cabin
bennett looks out the window
his pov of clouds and farmland and the mississippi river
sydney emerges from first with a scotch and sits
you just visited what someday soon could be the most profitable corporation in america
provided the government approves the merger provided we dont start running cars on water
provided theres still chaos in the middle east
this aint the sec anymore son and maybe you got a couple scalps on your belt from your time over there enron world com but now the job is find
the problem fix the problem
and if you dont find a problem then there is no problem
bennett notices that sydney wears a mickey mouse watch
and when the government approves this merger its gonna buy a lot of houses out on the vineyard maybe even yours so of course its delicate all around
whos this u
attorney donald farish the rd
whats his agenda
whos behind him
is it a political force
is he a glory boy making a name
i know him
he taught a class of mine at georgetown law
sydney knew this of course
sydney looks bennett over then he chuckles the effect of which is unsettling
well there you go he taught a class of yours at georgetown law
whiting did say to me i have a feeling about this young man
he said he can position himself
hold these guys in a circle
ask the careful questions
i dont need to tell you this is a hell of an opportunity for you to catch those peers who have spent how should i put it less time on
the government dole
and get rid of that fancy watch it makes you look like a jew
sydney disappears back up into first class carefully pulling the curtain in place behind him
bright sunlight beside the gulf
foot tall loading tanks with portraits of the emir
this facility is under construction by pakistani and filipino laborers
angle on saleem ahmed khan heavy set with glasses and his son wasim tall bright wearing electric blue jumpsuits while painting a brown handrail green
a van stops beside their team and someone yells in urdu
they drive with other workers across the refinery
a huge sign in mandarin declares the project funded by china gas and electric the chinese oil conglomerate
chinese engineers in white have rounded up a group of pakistanis who stand together sweating in the extreme heat an image not much changed since colonialism
your services are no longer needed here at the china gas and electric facility
a pakistani translates into urdu for the group
find saleem and wasim in the crowd what did they say
i cant hear
theyre letting us go
the whole group
the whole group
in the distance the engineer is droning on
we know you have worked hard and wish to thank you for that hard work with a small cash bonus which you may collect on your way out of the
what did he say
i cant hear
i cant hear
hes telling us to scram
what do you mean scram
angle on the engineer pointing toward the exit of the facility
he turns to another engineer nearby
look at them standing there
like blue cows
get them moving
wasim and saleem cross the desert near the lng facility
the chinese are smart people but such bad drivers
they should not be allowed even to wash cars
wasim doesnt say anything
they walk in silence
then when i was your age in pakistan there was always in the distance snow covered mountains
three hours away but right there white across the sky like you could reach out and touch them
snow covered mountains
ahead is transient worker housing
wasim takes in plywood fencing surrounding identical huts
as soon as we can well get a real house and bring your mother here
wasim just looks at his dad who puts his arm around him
the refinery and power lines shimmer behind them
sterile white trailers in neat rows with laundry hanging out of windows
men wash at a communal shower
wasim begins stripping off his grimy uniform
saleem shouts to a few men batting a cricket ball around
massive power lines drape from steel pyramid to steel pyramid
a group of teenagers including wasim and farooq a self styled leader drink home fermented alcohol from a styrofoam cup
they wear jeans t shirts caps
ragged unbathed theyre wasted
farooq takes a gulp makes a face swallows shouts ow ow ow ahhh he throws up
the kids laugh
he comes up composed an announcement
if man is made in gods image then god is deeply messed up
farooq shoves the cup at wasim
he tries to push it away
afraid of the buzz
im afraid of your breath
wasim points at a silent kid hanging back from the group
hakim hasnt had any
and hakim wears jewelry
he thinks that little bracelets gonna get him girls
they start chanting hakim hakim hakim in encouragement
hakim sphynx like just looks at them
to another kid whats wrong with your brother anyway
hakim looks to his brother then lifts up his shirt
there is a recent scar where a kidney would be
you can drink with one
you dont need two
hakim isnt sure
i want to talk to your uncle about work
you have to introduce me
there isnt any work
quit pestering me
hakim hakim finally hakim sips and holds his side
the boys cheers are thin and vulnerable in the immense desert
in the distance a luxury car is parked
military officers snap a picture native boys in desert
a line of commuter traffic from inside a car
bobs eyes appear in the rearview
he sits in traffic
bobs freaking out about this other missile
wheres the missile
who has the missile
he wrote a memo
the division chief a woman in her s patrician and smooth stares out of the glass box office toward the trees
fred franks s a saltine dipped in milk i just finished convincing the
brits and french intel we had nothing to do with the amiri job
now what do we say remember that thing we had nothing to do with well theres something missing
the division chief finishes listening patiently
okay heres something
put him up for a promotion
bobs a good guy
he saved our ass in beirut in
terry likes him
well get him an audition downtown
youll get him an audition bob exits into downtown d
c the traffic lightening
he goes through a tunnel
the idea of promoting bob gains traction bobs a hero
theyll give him something good
he is an iran expert
fred bobs never had a desk job never done nine to five
can he show up to work everyday
can he stay on message
ill prep him
bob waits in a hard back chair
its a spare functional highly polished place
marines like statues stand guard
voices come from a partially open door across the hall
imagine gasoline ten dollars a gallon at the pump
or heating oil that costs twenty five hundred a month for a two bedroom apartment
if oil goes to a hundred a barrel the u
turns into a third world country
that is a fact
do you have any analysis to back up that fact
in the next fifteen years the north sea and alaska dry up
two million barrels a day to the u
that is a known fact
the deputies meeting
a small room with recessed lighting filled with the rung below the top tier of washington bureaucracy
navy steno guys record the conversation
i need data supporting known facts
because what i know is that in the entire region when we even whisper our support those people are delegitimized
terry george s deputy cia chief quite a good guy to those in power speaks to a distinguished gentleman s
through the partially open door one third of bob is visible
iraq had no established ethnic majority
its like trying to organize louisiana
iran on the other hand is persian the deputy national security advisor marilyn richards s sculpted hair with the soul of a seventy year old white republican male is in
charge there has been some good news concerning iran lately
for iran yes the president is very interested in iran terry
marilyn takes in the presence of the distinguished gentlemen sitting near her
terry slides a file across the table to her
i know that marilyn
in fact we just pulled one of our officers out and i took the initiative to ask him to come down here
he infiltrated hezbollah in beirut in the eighties won himself some nice medals
were thinking about giving him a station
beirut in the eighties is that a resume builder
polite chuckles follow terry george to the doorway
terry george appears crooks a finger
as bob passes dont chomp down on any bait
he looms over bob pointedly taps bobs files were fine
iran is fine
bob sweats slightly as he plows on reading from notes
and our analysis seems to be on the mark
and were getting good satellite coverage
bob is clearly working from a script
terry george is pleased and gives bob the slightest of approving nods
and were reprogramming resources into iran
our next review will show that thank you for coming over mr
welcome back and forgive me if i wade right in but forgetting for a second your bureaucratic checklist im trying to get undigested information so if you could give me
a reading of the temperature over there
bob glances at terry
exasperated marilyn continues
india is now our ally
russia is our ally
even china will be an ally
everybody between morocco and pakistan is the problem
failed states and failed economies but iran is a natural cultural ally of the u
the persians do not want to roll back the clock to the th century
i see students marching in the streets
i hear khatami making the right sounds
and what id like to know is if we keep embargoing them on energy then someday soon are we going to get a nice secular pro western pro business government
the steno guys type away
a long beat on bob
of course it is mr
thank you for your time
bob looks to terry who nods
bob starts to leave
sotto to the room intelligence is the misnomer of the century
he cant help himself they let young people march in the street and then the next day shut down fifty newspapers
they have a few satellite dishes up on roofs let em have my two dads but that doesnt mean the ayatollahs have relinquished one iota of control over that nation
the steno guys hands are frozen
baer the reform movement in iran is one of the presidents great hopes for the region and crucial to the petroleum security of the united states
these gentlemen are with the cli
bob has no idea what this is or whether he should answer
the committee for the liberation of iran mr
weve had iran in embargo for almost thirty years we backed their neighbor a neighbor we invaded twice in a ten year war against them were hanging on by a
thread with a massive occupation force so i got news for you
thomas jefferson just aint that popular over there right now
silence except for the steno guys clicking away then complete silence
terry george stares at bob a long beat
that will be all mr
bennett exits a cab walks up the steps with an overnight bag
a man s tough and well preserved in a dark suit and tie waits on the stoop with a folded paper
i hear phrases thrown around like the corrupting influence of money or the evil influence of dollars in politics when more money was spent on the syndication rights to seinfeld
than on the whole of the last presidential election
bennett just walks past him to open the door
a nice three bedroom that is part of the quiet gentrification movement not yet reflected in the streets
cable news plays silently in the living room
theres a goldfish in a small aquarium
through a door bennett and the man are in the kitchen
a small tv plays c span testimony on campaign finance reform
danny dalton s an oilman testifies
last election cycle i spent three hundred thousand
i got pictures of myself with the president that i use all over the world
people dont know danny dalton but they know the president of the united states and they see that i know the president of the united states
bennett has showered and changed
he makes coffee
the man sits at a dinette
he lights a cigarette
im not making this coffee for you
im making it for me
you im making oatmeal and then you sleep
you look like shit
bennett just stares for a moment
bennett takes the oatmeal off the stove sets a bowl in front of the man whose fingernails are black whose dark suit is filthy
are you working
i had a little trouble at work
bennett grabs his travel coffee and starts away theres some beer in the fridge for after you wake up so you dont die on my floor of the dts
and no smoking in my house
bennett leaves the kitchen
the man yells after him
i dont need your goddamn hospitality
the front door slams
the man glances up at a photo of bennett jr
at his howard university graduation
and next to it the man bennett sr
graduating years earlier
on tv old white senators listening judiciously
in our country we dont stuff dollars into ballot boxes
what we do is turn money into votes and what turns money into votes is free speech the ability of a candidate to get his message out and that takes
money real money meaning not so loosely translated money is speech
and last time i checked speech in the usa is protected
you cant limit my advocacy just because it works
i have a sovereign inalienable right to petition my government
tilt up to find bennett senior part of a six pack dangling from two fingers staring at a wall covered with an intricate matrix of killeen oils limited partnerships and
strategic alliances all over the world
the money i gave the president is the best investment i have ever made in my business
next election cycle i plan to double it
and why is it some dirty little secret that its in americas interest to do business overseas
stares up at the wall
he pops a beer
bryan and julie and the kids arrive at the manicured entrance of a vast impressive estate their rental wagon anomalous among bentleys and rolls
an arab valet opens julies door
the kids are excited
a geometric sculpture garden
giacomettis and henry moores
a tv monitor plays video of gardens and flowers
guests cluster together
you could almost tag labels on them arms dealer ambassador minister of trees
bryan and julie and the kids wander into the party
im probably the tenth guy this month to pitch something like this
its like the godfather
emir i come to you on this special day
vincent is riding motorcycles through cambodia through land mines
some charity thing
thats guilt not charity
hes catholic and cant view himself as a shallow model f
r which he is
and when war breaks out in some energy producing country hes the first one into work
bryan looks at her
youre a man who supports his family not a boy
i thought you like him
i do honey
for you i like him very much
she takes his hand as they walk
please attention please your host his majesty the emir
on a tv monitor the emir hamad al subaai s bearded overweight sitting in front of greenery his two sons behind him addresses his party guests
it is my pleasure to personally welcome each of you to the casa de las palmas our oasis of palms in the south of spain
the emir his two sons prince meshal late s weak chinned effeminate with longish hair and prince nasir s handsome with large expressive eyes close cropped hair powerful and serious
are across a table from the emirs prerecorded speech drones on and symbolic of the affection of my people for each of you
at nine oclock we will have wonderful music from the london philharmonic
please eat and socialize and enjoy
the emir ignores himself on tv and turns to business
he recently had a stroke and was filmed from his good side
a slight slurring i am happy to welcome the chinese to my country and optimistic you will not be nearly as greedy as the americans
assiduous nods from the chinese oil executives as the kings young japanese secretary slides contracts across
bryan and julie watch max tentatively approach the pool
nearby riley has introduced himself to an arab family
arabs are very family oriented as a people
is that racist
max a book oriented rather than water oriented child is afraid to jump in
not if what youre saying is positive
a bigger boy fakes like he might push him in
bryan starts to his feet dont
let him work this out
its important for his autonomy
max finds his courage jumps and disappears beneath the surface then bobs up happily
hedge strategies are tough for these guys
oil goes up the people wonder why those extra billions arent in the treasury
prices go down no ones thanking them for saving a few bucks
julie looks at her husband to determine whether hes testing his pitch or in need of encouragement
make a game of it
pretend theyre six year olds and you have to get them to eat carrots and all they want is dessert
make it about good parenting
the house is a genius home
one of my sons had it wired by experts from the united states
the emir sort of wilts fading out
prince meshal foists a remote control on his father
the other son prince nasir observes his father and brother
the emir rouses
he presses a few buttons
the monitors show the estate lawn squash court guard house
on tv the image of a rear guard house
suddenly the gate slides back stops slides the other way
your highness that is incredible
to prince nasir prince nasir isnt that amazing
the emir presses the remote
on tv seven swimming pools
meshal proudly shares the moment with his father
oh look its getting dark better turn on the lights on six of seven monitors pool lights turn on shimmering turquoise
one pool remains dark
the emir notices the dark pool
he presses the device
on the monitor the lights go off
he presses again
six pools light up but one is still dark
the emir ignores his son and speaks for the room
send a fool on a fools errand
meshal frantically tries to make the pool light come on
children scream shouting playing tag in the crepuscular light beside the dark pool
max is among the children
the sound of electricity
we push toward a darkened pool light
the cover is cracked and the light is filled with water
blue light arcs inside the cover
the sound of electricity is louder
pictures of the emir with nixon carter ronald reagan poppy bush clinton bush ii
two gulf businessmen reps of the emir appear and address bryan who is waiting
we regret that his highness will be unable to see you
however we are authorized to hear your proposition on his behalf
bryan looks around
the real worry facing you guys is another year of record pricing
there are no more elephant fields
not even in natural gas
as structural alternatives are more fully realized youll need a new strategy to maximize every penny from your existing resources particularly in a climate of falling prices
one businessman turns to the other there are two kinds of people in the world those who control subsurface mineral rights and those who want to steal from them
bryan didnt understand a word
the kids are organizing a game of shark and minnows
an older kid explains to max youre the shark and you try to tag us as we swim across
max is uncertain eyeing the dark water
from somewhere distant the london philharmonic begins to play
you jump in and count one two three then we all try to get to the other side
max stares at the dark water
its not inviting
finally he jumps
he hits the water and goes rigid almost skittering across the surface flopping uncontrollably
bryan walks back across the lawn when screams come from the pool area ahead
bryan hurries then runs
the voltage is audible as max rolls onto his back floating lifelessly
security prevent people from diving in
a bystander yells cut the power
cut the power
bryan enters the area
he sees julie being restrained
and a body in the water
as the estate goes dark bryan dives and holds max wading to the side with the lifeless body
a donkey train passes a derrick under a gathering sky
on the back of one donkey the stinger crate bounces along
the donkeys move through the antaean field as lightning cuts the distant clouds
freight boats and water taxis plow up and down a river back and forth back and forth as wasim enters along a wall in the foreground
he wears his best clothes and looks freshly scrubbed as he picks his way along
he ducks down an alley stops
nervous he catches his reflection in a shard of glass of a boarded up window
abu khalifa thank you for this opportunity
i am a hard worker
i will not let you down
a scraggly warehouse the most basic of operations
workers carry goods in and out
wasim walks with abu khalifa a gruff foreman
two of my wifes kids got deported for not having work
you dont have to pay me
let me show you how hard i work
and then decide whether to pay
for a moment it seems like this offer may win the day
i already have a long list for that too
and if you want to work in this country learn how to speak the language
wasim tries and fails to hide his disappointment
a mound of dirt under a blanket
a small mound
an episcopal minister saying something soundlessly
the mourners are bryan and julies age which means they have small children
mourners holding children
bryan holds riley and julie stands beside them
julie is weeping
she notices bryan is completely stone faced
julie watches two boys chase each other through the crowd playing tag stifling their laughter
tight on johnny and ponyboy just before they run to catch the boxcar in the outsiders
why are they running after him
maybe he has a knife or committed a crime or something
wasim farooq other men and boys watch a small tv in a cheap trailer housing for immigrant labor

we got skewers of lamb
i like lamb
the childrens faces are lit by the tvs glowing light
against a wall young men are frisked by police who tap their legs apart with batons
above them a watchful portrait of the emir in epic pose astride a stallion
a line of pakistani and filipino men winds out of a building
people are paranoid
as more men arrive police in riot gear watch them shouting in arabic into a bullhorn
yunus watches wasim and saleem
he mimics how his brother stands
an old man tries to talk to them
cant remember the streets this hot
saleem looks around sees if anyone was listening then takes the old mans arm
you dont want to talk here
suddenly a policeman shoves saleem from behind
saleem turns to the officer already apologizing but wasim steps between them
the cop pushes wasim with his baton
is that right tough guy
whats your name tough guy
wasim doesnt say anything
yunus watches his father and brother
the cop pokes wasim again with the stick whats your name
the policeman swiftly brings his club down on wasims head dropping him to his knees
other policemen close
saleem gets in the middle but is beaten down
wasim tries to reach for yunus who is screaming and hitting at the policemans legs
a club comes down on wasims head perfect calm at a beautiful rural ivy league campus with students strolling between buildings
tight on note cards of conversational topics and reminders to be natural
a perfect mother and father coach their perfect nervous daughter
i learned the value of diversity in my time at the model u
and across the rich leather and wood anteroom of a princeton admissions office bob and robby also wait

an admissions officer signals to robby who disappears through the door
a college dive restaurant
the workers are all lebanese immigrants
bob and robby eat at a small table

bob quickly finishes a glass of cheap white wine
robby you know i live

robby liberally uses the hot sauce
two lebanese men at another table nod in approval
robby fires off arabic

robby turns back to bob and says whats really on his mind

bob and robby are the only occidentals in the place
bennett exits a cab in front of the justice department building
the fbi looms just down the street
donald farish iii s longer hair than you would expect talks on his cell phone feet kicked up on the desk
two assistant u
attorneys stare at bennett

looks at the assts
they dont smile
why dont you tell me what you have so i can respond
farish looks at his guys
they all choke back laughs
i used to think something was wrong here
now i know somethings wrong here
he stands tall imperious
walks around his desk
perches on the edge towering over bennett
either you dont find anything because you dont know how to look
or you do and they carve you out and light you on fire
to his guys thats gotta be the play right
bennett doesnt say anything
farish picks up a file scans it bennetts particulars therein
youre so under qualified its laughable
sydney hewitts new boy

i guess you guys really have a handle on the angles
attorney team shares a moment at his expense
lets talk about our old friend the holder memoranda
in charging a corporation or sentencing a company after a guilty plea cooperation will be factored in which includes waving the privileges afforded their attorneys
i remember you now
strong a in environmental law
to the assistants he was an easy grader
the sharp sounds of squash
looking through the opaque square of plexiglas in the door to a squash court sydney and bennett grunt and lunge and sweat
i took a bit of a temperature reading
the other associates seem to like you
thats not really a good sign
im sorry sir
high angle down to the fishbowl aspect of the court
sydney has a very good serve
as they talk he wins three points in a row bennett lunging at the spinning ball
sir i dont want to get ahead of myself but kazakhstan

the federal prosecutor is a good man

somebody they can squeeze
like an informant

the casual bar of a fancy d

bennett turns to see donald farish iii joining a far table
well bennett as they say in the bible there are many many ways to light europe
a light switches on
bryan and julie are both awake listening to riley crying down the hall
its unnerving but neither one moves right away perhaps hoping hell fall back asleep
i wish i could just believe hes floating around on a cloud or in the corner watching us
julie wants bryan to comfort her but he doesnt
that minister eulogizing our child made me sick
how do you eulogize a child
he was great at playing
he loved popsicles
she rolls into him and he holds her but hes staring at the ceiling as the childs cries echo down the hallway
bryan opens the door to his sons bedroom
riley is standing in his crib crying inconsolably
his voice catching i want to look out the window
he holds up his arms for his father who lifts him
they walk to the window
riley stops crying instantly as children will and shimmies out of his dads arms
at the window they stand together silhouetted against the dark night and distant street light
bob and fred franks walk down an institutional white corridor
nothing like the straight poop to wake em up on the th floor
and the amiri brothers
darn nice work
howre you finding everything
must be a little slow paced a little dull
intelligence work isnt training seminars and little gold stars for attendance
what do you think intelligence work is bob
they turn a corner which gives way to another institutional white corridor
its two people in a room and one of them is asking a favor thats a capital crime in every country on earth
a hanging crime
another white hallway
its assessing the information gathered from that favor and balancing it against all the other information gathered from all the other favors
opens a door to a white windowless room
its so white its hard to see the lines of anything
people around a conference table

bryan nods and the lights go off on bryan
he stares go home

stan hits his remote lock and leaves bob standing there
wide shot of bob alone in the mall lot gently sloping to ikea cobalt blue in the distance
the bolt action of a gleaming hunting rifle
the oilman whose congressional testimony was broadcast on cspan sights a weapon
is the caspian a lake or a sea
looks like lake michigan
size of lake michigan
the red sea opens into the indian ocean jimmy pope and other hunters drink and clean thirty ought sixes their faces lit by firelight
like a pond
france and russia want it to be a pond thats for damn sure
the caspian i mean
in some court somewhere right now
moot point hopefully
an animal carcass rotates on a spit over the fire
janus chairman of connex and dean whiting founding partner of your firm are proud members of the committee to liberate iran
here is too
is for dalton
i was on the other side of the tengiz deal
the other side
el presidente nazerbayevs best pal in the whole world
its a beautiful field
goddamn is it a beautiful field
danny hands a clean checked rifle to bennett
i guarantee well let the air out of some tomorrow
a herd of zebra trots across a field and distant gunshots crack through the pine forest
this is a private game preserve acres of conservation
a large sign shows a buck in cross hairs and ranch experience wildlife from four continents in texas
i believe in getting inside their personal space
so its you and him and nothing else
thats eighteen yards for a tiger or rhino
bennett and jimmy ride in the back of a wagon a modified shooting platform pulled behind a jeep
six billion barrels of oil a billion of natural gas liquid fourteen trillion cubic feet of danny d
s conversation floats up from a lower platform
man i mean to tell you by the end you got blood of lions baboons rhinos on your dungarees
bennett wearing an orange vest over his casual clothes seems uneasy
jimmy yells down to his friend
thats kenya danny not one of these turkey shoots
bred animals kill too jimmy
jimmy continues his thought to bennett
fucking slant drillers
dont know why i ever sold em my company in the first place
here take your pick
he hands bennett a thick catalogue
angle on catalogue pages of animals you can shoot with pictures and description
addax this large african antelope is white with a gray masked face
its horns corkscrew up making multiple twists in both sexes
large males can weigh lbs
both males and females make handsome trophies
the tengiz is the holy grail
you get into that stream nobody in your family will ever have to clean a toilet again
i have a feeling this u
attorney has a source
like somebody who didnt get into tengiz and is pissed off about it
any idea who that might be
jimmy looks at bennett like he was just born
how bout every other oil company in the world
re the catalogue whats your fancy
bennett randomly picks an animal from the list
calling to driver floyd
bennett sees in the distance beater boys mexican men in orange jackets flushing quail for a party of hunters
in the distance a massive kudu tame as a house cat unafraid of guns or people stands near a feeder
jimmy looks at him
im not sure jesus h
kudu is rare
get that gun up
bennett lifts the rifle
through the cross hairs the kudu is gigantic and unaware of the hunters
hes got inch horns
the kudu looks at bennett
an uncomfortable beat come on son
he wont wait all day
finally bennett pulls the trigger
the gun is loud
he stares then slowly pulls back from the scope
hes gonna run a bit
the sound of their feet tromp tromp tromp as jimmy and bennett move through dense thicket looking for the wounded animal
my granddaddy was a wildcatter
same with my daddy
thats how i got my start
luck and hard work
nobody handed me shit
now i got libraries and parks named after me
and ill probably ruin the grand kids
you wearing a wire bennett
mind if i pat you down
jimmy checks for a recording device
we all tell ourselves little stories bennett
sometimes im the flame burning in the jefferson memorial
other times im a guy with his nose pressed up against the windows of a whorehouse suddenly theres a rustling as a large animal passes somewhere close
jimmy looks at him
this deal snapped the lights on in the kitchen and the rodents all scurried
now youre standing there under the lights trying to point to where they all went
dont be the one caught out in the kitchen
jimmy unslings his rifle and motions to where obscured in the thicket a pair of intense dying eyes stares back
whatd your daddy do bennett
i dont know who my father is
on bennett as jimmy fires bob rides in a taxi through the streets of beirut a city that was once the paris of the middle east dust noise construction cranes
and knock off designer clothes
they turn off the wide airport road into a warren of narrow streets
the cab stops and the driver turns southern suburbs
bob happily waves him on
how can you tell if youre talking to a shiite or a sunni muslim
if you feel like shee iteing your pants you know
the driver glances at bob in the rearview
outside a man has a gun stuck in his waistband
another man on a roof has a rifle
a paranoid guarded place
they turn and suddenly a metal gate is across the road
men pour out around the car
flannel shirts olive drab army shirts beards no beards guns in waistbands
bobs door is opened and he is yanked from the cab
im here to see said hashimi
they roughly frisk bob
they take his pen remove his belt check his passport its canadian
the name is seymour risen
they check his license the name is seymour risen
bob is pushed into another vehicle
someone pulls bills from bobs wallet and flips them to the cabbie
the gate rises
the car pulls away
the gate drops
the cabbie is left standing there holding the bills
s arab architecture
no direct sunlight or sight lines
local farmers workers wait
flannel crosses to olive drab
both have guns in their waistbands
they talk quietly then laugh
bob sits on a low couch
opaque glass separates two rooms and shadows move behind it
someone offers bob hot tea
a door opens and a man signals for bob who gets up holding his pants
an air conditioner hums in the wall
said hossein hashimi s tolstoyan grey beard turban rheumy eyes the spiritual leader of the hezbollah sits in a high back chair in a corner
bob sits in a high back chair near hashimi
the young men revere hashimi and guard him carefully
i have a good feeling about american people bob
a good people
a welcoming people
there are ten million muslims in the u
i have over followers in detroit alone
thank you for this audience
i have a business proposal for mussawi
one that benefits everyone
hashimi nods magisterially
mussawi is an energetic young man
your arabic is very good
the power cuts out
the air conditioner slowly dies out
its near dark in the room
the guards move nervously toward bob and said hashimi
i thought it would also be prudent to say i have no interest in hezbollah
this is business and it doesnt concern hezbollah
in the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck
after a beat hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on bob
if what you say is true consider yourself welcome in lebanon
the generator comes on with a distant whir
the lights come on
a man crosses to the air conditioner reaches up and trips the circuit breaker bringing it back to life
an ancient grotto where the early christians used to hide be discovered and executed
a tourist attraction its a cool vast dimly lit subterranean space
bob reads a description of a stalactite formation
he is alone waiting for someone
the grotto echoes
in the distance two arab school children playing with the echoes do a little dance step and rap out in broken english a well known american song
i gotta ask you one question
bob turns to look at mussawi s closely shaved bullet head seemingly good natured a businessman he speaks english with a new jersey accent
only one of them was propelled by gas and the other by the papers said heart attack
bob nods pleasantly
he saw an engine coming at him at feet per second and his heart stopped
this settles a beat
rumors of bob but never bob
it is bob right
what is it you tell people you do these days bob
im between state department and defense
bob surreptitiously looks around to see if mussawi is alone
its clear bob makes him nervous as well
just me buddy as requested
bob reaches inside his jacket
mussawi reaches in his
im getting some information jimmy
my name is mussawi
bob hands a picture to mussawi
mussawi glances down at the picture
it surprises him
angle on the picture of prince nasir crossing a street
bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar figure
mussawi glances at the number
hes traveling to beirut
its dangerous to travel
i want you to drug him put him in the front of a car and run a truck into it at fifty miles an hour
its good to have you back in town bob
mussawi turns and walks away singing some familiar song
drifting above tall glass buildings
construction cranes everywhere
tall glass buildings rise out of the white desert
pan and find bryan woodman staring out the window
hes on his cell phone
theres an arrow on the ceiling pointing the direction of mecca
the bin laden group air conditioned mecca
one of their big projects
they made billions and billions
no response on the phone
women are covered head to foot walking five feet behind the men
degrees and humid
i walked out of the airport and it was like a wall fell on me
all the arabs in white sheets
it says its hot and i dont have to work
id like to see them play baseball dressed like this
he dwindles away
silence on the other end of the phone
no im fine
how are you
he looks down at the swimming pool of the luxury hotel a peaceful blue aberration in the desiccated landscape
bryan stands alone under a vaulted atrium
an arab man in white separates from a group and ushers him outside
tapioca dunes drift away for miles
an oryx nests with two of its young
a range rover splits the dunes
on the deck of an elegant desert house composed mainly of tents and sails a supplicant beseeches a favor from prince nasir who reads a newspaper and watches tv
your generosity is bigger than a mountain that shades us from the burning sun
i humbly ask for my citizenship expiry date to be extended
the prince nods his assent
across the deck bryan sits with the princess al subaai a westernized young woman with dignity beyond her years
they watch as nasir is served coffee by servants who make sure not to block his view of the financial news
the supplicants stare at the princess
they hate me being here dressed like this
my husband tells them shes a medical doctor shell examine your children but only without a veil
a secretary checks a list and ushers another supplicant forward
the money given for my childrens education was spent on farming and camels but your benevolence is like the shade of palm trees in an oasis
nasir nods then makes his way over
bryan watches the princess smile
her husband kisses her cheek
my father has ordered the marbella estate to be razed
there will be a park
to lose a first born son
nasir doesnt know what to say
were very sorry for your loss
a house main was run in the wrong place
the covering for the wiring had deteriorated
bryan just stares at him
youre very angry
you cant possibly understand
tight on a falcons face
heat ripples across flat white desert
an ancestor of mine owned this birds ancestor before christ was born
the falcon catches an updraft and rises effortlessly
six more north field blocks will be available for development
we would like to offer your firm the right to represent them
twenty seven twenty eight million cubic meters per day
well be in the stream for what ten one hundredths of a cent which is roughly
seventy five million dollars
seventy five million dollars
how much for my other kid
prince nasir stares at bryan
if i were your economic advisor id tell you its not the dumbest thing youve ever done but itll probably be the dumbest thing you do today
but why would you need an economic advisor
twenty years ago you had the highest gnp in the world and now youre tied with paraguay
your second biggest export is second hand goods
followed by dates on which you lose five cents a pound
you want to know what the business world thinks of you
they think a hundred years ago you were chopping each others heads off in the desert and thats exactly where youll be in another hundred
so yes on behalf of my firm i accept your money
ill have the money forwarded to your firm immediately
and ill give you another hundred million for the other kid
they look at each other
so now that youre my economic advisor tell me something i havent heard
bryan stares a beat thinking
you want an idea heres an idea
he draws in the sand he draws nasirs kingdom the persian gulf iran
your kingdom is here
the north field is here
europe is here
because of trade restrictions and outdated alliances youve been selling your gas for peanuts loading it on ships and waving as it sails away
re the stick but pretend for a second this is excess iranian pipeline capacity
he lays the stick across the circles in the sand like an overland pipe running to europe
here is your route
you commoditize it you control it you take it right to the front door of every home in europe
your profit just went up by a factor of three possibly four
i think thats a pretty good idea
overhead the falcons spiral higher and higher chasing
each other in the sky
the rising murmur of amens a cavernous mega church a religious wal mart with worshippers in stadium seating
reverand stewart s intelligent and sincere wears a headset and when jesus had been baptized just as he came up from the water suddenly the heavens were opened and he
saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him
and a voice from heaven said this is my son the beloved with whom i am well pleased
let us pray god open our hearts to your word and open your word to our hearts
danny dalton his wife and children sit in good seats up front
danny has a flag pin on his lapel
this is the third in our four week series on luke
and jesus continued to grow in wisdom stature and in the love of god and those who knew him
the task is not getting more of god but letting god get more of us
high above the pulpit dead center of the auditorium is a giant american flag waving under the cross
slowly the murmuring rise of different prayers
a long narrow mosque packed with men kneeling shoulder to shoulder chanting prayers
most of them are under thirty
their movements are unified and ecstatic
they will try to disguise the difference to make muslims who speak about religion appear to be fanatics or backward people
boys study at small desks
boys lined up
even smaller boys at smaller desks
a circle of teenagers round shouldered melancholy including farooq and wasim sit at a table eating lamb and french fries
they will tell us the dispute is over economic resources or military domination and if we believe that we play right into their hands with only ourselves to blame
there is a remarkable contrast between the setting at the government barracks sterile poor and the mosque warm rich
the teenagers wear serious expressions and try fail to be respectful as they gorge
the divide between human nature and modern life cannot be bridged by free trade
it cannot be cured with deregulation privatization openness or lower taxes
the cleric is a serene man whose beard and glasses make him appear older than his age
wasim watches as he talks in hypnotic cadence making eye contact with each boy in turn
the pain of living in the modern world will never be solved by a liberal society
the clerics sympathetic gaze falls on wasim who is bruised with black eyes from his beating
liberal societies have failed
christian theology has failed
the west has failed
he serves more lamb and vegetables to wasims plate
wasim begins hungrily eating again
boys pull a plow in the fields
the sound of bees
the divine and the worldly are but a single concept and that concept is koran
they walk past bee hives spaced across the desert
farooq and wasim and two others are with him
no separation of religion and state koran
instead of kings legislating and slaves obeying koran
they stand in a corn field growing in the desert
the boys are impressed with themselves as only young uneducated men can be when discussing philosophy and politics with a learned man
the true confrontation is over islam
they must eradicate islam in order to rescue their own doctrine from extinction
true islam will end up partial islam
and partial islam cannot exist
the cleric bends down to pull a weed
do you believe me when i tell you this
wasim watches farooq nod emphatically
they are full and the cleric seems to know everything in the world
the cleric surveys the boys with quiet exaltation his tenderness and compassion begins to affect wasim
now who would like sweets before prayer
a banner reads union of arab nations beirut lebanon wide steps in a wide plaza
a crowd watches as important men including prince nasir sweep down the marble stairs to microphones
the press snaps photos
we begin the process of empowering a new generation of arabs with the skills and training necessary to succeed globally
bryan claps dutifully
but hes on the phone the cord dangling from ear to blackberry which reads work
he invited me to come with him
i think he thinks hes somekindof reformer
hes got a nice jet
okay very nice
hold on a sec he glances at the blackberry screen
another call julie home
he hits ignore call
julies fine with it
our point document is an agreement on principles calling for greater political freedom good governance and transparency advanced civil liberties and human rights womens rights and judicial reforms
bryans phone vibrates again julie home
he turns the phone off
however unlike washingtons greater middle east initiative we respect each countrys right to move at its own pace
one leader after another solemnly shake hands with nasir as a photographer records the moment
in the crowd with a students backpack at his feet
prince nasir moves down the steps
bryan and the rest of his entourage join him heading toward black limousines
weathered man picks up his pack moves around the crowd slips past a barrier
to prince nasir you are a good man
i want to shake your hand
the bodyguards and police start shouting in arabic
dont move weathered man wears a serious expression heading straight for nasir who turns and sees him you are good man
like sadat you will shake my hand
the guards are screaming
people start scattering the weathered man is reaching in his backpack bodyguards grab nasir hustling him toward a limo
bryan lunging after them the weathered man is tackled and pummeled
the limos race away sirens blaring flags flying
the weathered man is held and searched
they find pens and pads
his spilled bag held books
nasir and bryan in a stretch with bodyguards as they race away with sirens blaring and flags flying
bryan is pale
he watches prince nasir settle back into his seat
an aide fires arabic at him
your highness do you still want to meet and greet
everything as scheduled
nasir looks out the window
he switches to english for bryan but is speaking more to himself
respect the right to move at their own pace
respect the right to do nothing is more like it
except condemn israel and strengthen the conservative religious movements
prince nasir and his party enter the hotel and sweep through the lobby
they approach the elevators
bryan and prince nasir and one bodyguard enter an elevator
the elevator tones at another floor
the elevator stops the door opens and bob stands there
nasir motions for them to squeeze together for bob
the gate closes
the lift creaks and begins to rise
nasir is looking at bob
dont see many occidentals these days
bob doesnt say anything
its too bad
bob nods again
as the elevator moves higher more light floods in through the wire mesh
bobs eyes meet nasirs
prince nasir bryan and bodyguards sit with a larger party across the rooftop garden
bob sits by himself eating a sandwich
from below there is the distant thumping of a car stereo
a little bird dances along the railing watching for crumbs
all of beirut is spread out below
push past the bird over the railing where seven floors below a toyota land cruiser pulls around the hotel
an employee approaches another employee at the desk and furtively pulls her away
angle through a door to the front of the hotel which is now completely empty except for the toyota land cruiser with dark tinted windows and five antennae
the stereo is thumping some odd american song
bob puts down bills for his check
the waiter is nowhere to be seen
theres no one behind the bar
no one at the waiters station
bob glances over at prince nasir who is laughing at something in the wall street journal
shots of the empty lobby someone dinging the bell
everyone has disappeared
bob outside his hotel room door
the hallway is empty
bob enters his room chaining the door
he turns and three men with guns are standing there
hes slammed against the door
duct tape around his mouth his arms taped back his legs wrapped
a black duffel bag goes over him swallowing the light
the duffle is heaved into the back of the land cruiser with a thud
the trunk gate is slammed the doors of a ups truck open
boxes loaded on a dolly
follow the dolly into a small warehouse
roll past a few desks some lamps
the dolly stops
tilt up to find bennett finishing a file and starting another
and beyond a dozen paralegals and the mountain of boxes holding
million pages of documents
bennetts phone vibrates loudly
he checks the number
tight on a hand written business card that says if you find me call my son bennett jr
at this number
bennett takes the card from a bartender and finds his father slumped in the corner of a seedy bar
a rundown kitchen
the windows are sealed
in another room three men eat lunch sharing a two liter bottle of mecca cola gossiping in arabic
on a wooden table is a generator a homemade shocking device the size of masonry brick with a long wire to the generator and a thick pair of rubber gloves
bob is duct taped tightly to a chair
his face is battered
his mouth is cracked
hes severely dehydrated
his hands and feet are dark purple and swollen
a door opens
mussawis voice bob what do you know about torture methods used by the chinese on the falun gong
number one method
whats your guess
did you guess water dungeon
bobs pov of mussawi crossing to the generator
he uses the hand crank which makes a grinding sound
number two method
number two twisting arm putting face in feces
not interested in two
number three they call pulling nails from fingers
what do you think bob
does number three sound good to you
he lets go of the generator and picks up an evil looking pair of pliers the size of bolt cutters
bobs pov over his own hands as mussawi approaches
the purpose is to get them to recant their beliefs
mussawi circles behind bob who tries to speak but his throat is too dry
other men hold the chair steady
what if i had to get you to recant
that would be difficult right
because if you have no beliefs to recant then what
bob wiggles his hands as if they could escape
someone mashes bobs right hand flat splaying the fingers
youre fucked is what
the pliers fix on the nail of his pinkie
bob youre gonna give me the name of every person who has taken money from you
bob stares at him
slowly mussawi pulls with the pliers
bobs eyes half close
mussawi jerks away
theres a fingernail in the pliers
bob is dazed
they throw water in his face
come on bob
help me out here
as water drips down bobs face he holds his tongue out and drinks
his voice returns
jimmy youre not one of these koran thumpers
the pliers attach to another nail
the name is mussawi
tight on the pliers and nail as ever so slowly it is ripped from bobs hand
bobspov as his eyes open water in them again his hands in the foreground all the nails are gone
mussawi leans in tight furious
you fucking fuck fucking fuck stupid fuck what the fuck
this is war you fuck
youre a p
give me the fucking names
from bobs pov mussawi loses his shit
he starts battering bob blood flying in ropes the chair sliding across the floor
the men watch without expression
the force of a blow knocks the chair over and bobs pov is tilted against the floor
he hears his heart and ragged breath
from this angle he sees mussawi cross to the table where he picks up a handsaw
im cutting his fucking head off
his feet approaching bob
then a door slamming open
and more feet sandaled in jalabas
bobs pov of hashimis men entering the room
the said is very angry with you mussawi
the said keeps his word
youre our guest too mussawi
an empty mecca cola plastic bottles and other refuse then bob freed from the tape appearing to be dead
his eye lids flutter ever so slightly
jerks into consciousness
his eyes fix on a postcard leaning against a cola bottle
his pov of the picture on the card an orphanage with said hashimis picture inlaid
and written on the card is passed from one ancient vessel to another as we slowly pull back to reveal hundreds of boats in a beehive of unregulated trade
rolls up next to a private jet
the fuel begins to tick thousands of dollars spinning by on the pump
bryan and prince nasir and others pass by and climb the steps to the plane bob in a six bed room
no cards or flowers
his hands are bandaged
filling a street and intersection thousands of muslims praying genuflecting as far as the eye can see
farooq and wasim among the praying men
they genuflect bennett sprawled over his desk asleep
theres no telling how long these guys have been here
a paralegal holding a piece of paper wakes him
i found this
bennett snaps awake
he looks at the document
i dont read russian
get it translated
man i was dreaming about something good too
bennett wanders over to the desk of another paralegal
on one side theres a big stack of a papers hes moving to another stack
in the corner of the desk is a tiny stack
what are these
stuff that doesnt make any sense
bennett idly fingers a piece of paper a receipt
oh that ones kind of interesting
the lily school
a boarding school in switzerland
paid by wire transfer
bennett scans the paper then turns to the room
everybody stop what youre doing
they look up bleary
were starting again
i want you to ignore any document that doesnt pertain to vidak limited
someone tosses a file in the air
bennett goes to his desk looks up a number dials the number
a voice answers in russian
to the room does anyone here speak russian
the paralegals just stare
someone in the back shouts yeah
the fantail of prince meshals yacht song of roland one of many beautiful boats anchored off juan les pins
a dinner party in progress
the tinkle of crystal and music
a gold cigar cutter slices off the tip
dean whiting meshal and reza barhani a middle man light expensive cigars in a book lined study on the boat
capitalism cannot exist without waste
on the walls pictures of meshal as a child with reagan qaddafi
as a teenager with clinton king fahd mitterrand chernomyrdin
we should write thank you notes to mr
the usa for producing one quarter of the worlds garbage and one quarter of the demand
youre certainly welcome
our pleasure really
but meshal is either wary or stupid or both
reza points to a glass case where a huge leather bound book is displayed
prince that is a rare treasure
the first arab edition of dr
its his but means nothing to him
prince is there anything we can do for you
the prince thinks about this for a beat
americans are very happy to drill holes in other peoples countries
ive heard of you
the cats paw of the saudi princes
whiting and reza exchange a quick glance but this is what dean whiting lives for
i know your brother the foreign minister
i know your father too
he threw the second creepiest party ive ever been to in washington
and from what i can tell you could probably use a bit of a cats paw yourself
second born son so beaten down by his family he cant even tell me what he wants when hes asked straight out a grown up baby who hates his brother
and maybe wants to be king maybe
well prince are you a king
can you tell me what you want
the prince is at first taken aback but then takes a beat to consider the offer
whiting and the middle man wait
i do have one small dream a selfless dream
at my house i have a perfect one third replica of hyde park
i have ducks and deck chairs from the real hyde park
i wish for a monument to the success of the moors in europe in the th century
that already exists
it is called the alhambra
a replica in my country to inspire the people and a new cordoba valley from which to view it
it took the masters a hundred years but i believe we can do it in ten
by the way do you know that my brother does not believe in god
whiting sips his cognac and considering the prince does indeed look like a cat digesting a canary
wind ripples across the leaves of corn
wasims hand pulls weed grass
farooq smiles mischievously
wasim farooq play soccer
farooq is a natural athlete
the spider is a symbol of the sin of man
he bites the finger of peter parker who is now half dark and half light
a real spider captures then stings and immobilizes then watches as the prey takes days to die
theyd never show that
suddenly they stop
mohammed sheik agiza the blue eyed egyptian has been watching them
they are embarrassed
are we in trouble
msa smiles a patient charismatic spooky smile
they already know each other
look around you at your family
in an open air classroom the cleric leads young children in recitation of the koran
boys walk to class
boys plow a field
look around you at your brothers united by faith in god almighty and submission to his law
a bull sleeps in the shade
wasim is still a virgin
wasim lightly shoves farooq
that is good because fornication is a serious crime
im a virgin too
it is an attack on honor and shows contempt for sanctity and encourages profligacy in society
the call to prayer sounds across the madrassa
they wash before prayer
when god almighty has chosen us for important work we have no choice but complete submission
spreading prayer mats on the ground where they stand they begin to pray
in the field the boys pulling the plows have begun to pray
the division chief enjoys a cigarette in a leafy courtyard of the cia office park
fred franks hurries toward her
he stays upwind of the cigarette
we just received a dispatch from damascus eight minutes old
mussawis shopping a story that we sent bob to beirut to assassinate prince nasir
the division chief drops her cigarette in a coffee can
terry george looks up from papers on his desk
hes got his hand over the phone and he isnt happy
can we get this guy
i mean now real time now
ill call you back
terry hangs up the phone
the division chief and franks exchange a glance
practical answer is no
not before he goes into another mosque or newspaper and this story gains traction
hes got bobs name
not his real name
but hes shopping photos of them doing the deal long lens
photos of bob being held
hes lucky hes alive
the whole contact was a set up
mussawi apparently now works for iran
first he tortures our guy then peddles the cia connection
this is not good at all
after a moment to think he spits this out quickly put some air between us and bob
bob has a long history of entrepreneurial operations
we havent really had a handle on bob for years
after nine one one some people got too much leeway let their emotions get the best of them
these are complex times
theres already an active investigation into bobs actions in help me out here they begin to spin the line together
the amiri brothers job
were trying to find out who might have hired bob for the amiri brothers job
could the same people be behind the nasir job
a lot of people seem to want this prince nasir dead and bob knows a lot of people
fill in the rest send me everything
is that it
fred is impressed
you dont get to be terry george without some skills
at the end of a depressing hallway bob sits in a chair his bandaged hands in front of him
you first established contact with the amiri brothers in
you met them at a party in the south of france
bob is framed by two not bright cia security officers
party given by reza barhani
were you aware they were involved in the illegal arms trade
of course i was aware
its why i went after them
were you aware these two men were iranian intelligence officers
bob cant believe the question
what do you think
this is a diplomatic incident
two men were murdered
weve been tasked with the damage assessment
well need you to turn your passport over to us
bob in his bed
he stares out the window at a red brick wall a fragment of sky
he sees margaret in the doorway
in their helpful way they told me you were at one of six places but since you were a number and not a name did i happen to have that
no is the answer to whether i have your number
she rests her hand on the railing of the bed
on the verge she looks away then back again
they wouldnt give me any information
i didnt know how to find you what id find
he pulls her close careful of his bandaged hands
hey into his chest they wouldnt tell me a thing
not one thing
he holds her
as she becomes aware of the bandages on his hands as her worry has been abating anger has ineluctably filled in behind
where were you bob
he looks at her he cant tell her the truth
were you back in beirut
he just stares
this is infuriating
bob please tell me where you were and tell me what happened
bob motions for her to come closer
i saw these shiites selling an egyptian a missile
i had a feeling about this guy a sunni nut job but im back here where i got on the wrong side of terry then an opportunity just happened to
come up involving someone i worked with before not a radical i mean he went to rutgers only now he flips wants to cut my goddamn head off
and now they got me isolated away in here and they send these suits around asking me nonsense questions about bad people who are no longer with us no longer
with us on their goddamn orders
so you tell me what happened
you tell me margaret
margaret doesnt know what to say so she says nothing
arabs strolling along the street
nasir and hisfamily shop in an expensive jewelry store
arabs stare out windows at the rain
doors are open
smoke is in the air
a young woman walks by holding the hand of a much older man laughing at something hes saying
bryan plays monopoly with a group of young arab men
they are using real money
the bank is stacks of hundreds and fifties and twenties
they smoke and drink
an arab youth moves the silver top hat
shit park place with hotels
bryan holds park place
the arab youth takes off his diamond encrusted rolex and tosses it toward the bank
where are you from in the states
no one has heard of it
its near los angeles
movie stars convertibles
el segundo is like saudi arabia with a surf break
they hoot and protest
they dont believe him
its a desert town on an ocean controlled by an oil company
tankers lined up offshore
theres this smell in the air
they pass out flyers to families moving in
this town is a quiet town where everyone works and our families are happy
if you have a problem with it or if you dont like the smell you can leave
if anyone works it cant be saudi arabia
they all laugh loudly then the laughter fades as they realize julie and riley are in the hotel room
julie eyes the money and the asian girl in the corner
he wanted to say good night to his father
riley goes over and stiffly gives bryan a hug
a vending machine hisses filling a cup
bob presses the extra dark button bandages on the tips of his fingers
bob looks over and sees people staring
they look away
bob stands in front of an assistants desk
shes in a meeting
what about fred
hes in a meeting
bob behind his desk
he turns to his computer
on the screen cia proprietary software
he brings up a search for prince nasir al subaai
finally he hits return
bob carefully types with his damaged fingers
bob takes a sip of coffee
the wall clock reads
bob athis desk
the clock reads
he hears a distant tone
tone tone tone
its a computer pop up tone
and its getting closer
angle through the glass boxes at distant offices
workers turn check their computers one after another
tone tone tone
bobs computer tones
on the screen a pop up box reading this computer is a middle class suburban neighborhood so new the landscaping is still tied to stakes
half built houses at the ends of streets
kids playing wiffle ball
bob pulls up on the quiet street
he checks the rear view where a car with two men are following him
bob pops a book on tape in and waits
its anna karenina in farsi
fred franks pulls into his driveway and gets out of the car
his wife appears at the front door and his kids gambol around exactly the tableau bob has never had
fred doesnt see bob until bob is right on him
fred turns and sees bob looks around uncomfortably
whats going on fred
to his wife honey take the kids inside would you
ill be in in a sec
bob and fred watch the family go up the walk
bob fbis got it
nothing i can do about it
you know that
its a criminal investigation
two men were killed
this bureaucratic defense sends bob over the edge i was almost killed fred
my hands were mutilated
and theyre asking me about the amiri brothers
you gotta understand
this wrecks careers
i shouldnt even be talking to you
i typed in prince nasir al subai and my computer gets seized
im advising you to drop it
where did this prince nasir job come from
why was i tortured
why am i being investigated
why was i sent
freds kids look out the window
lifting up to see bob isolated in the grid of identical treeless houses
the secretary of defense projected onto a giant screen
in whatever lies ahead the united states will remain a friend to the iranian people
a large ballroom at a washington hotel
its a lunch meeting of the committee to liberate iran packed with washington hawks middle aged white men in gray suits
they have suffered years of brutal repression years of domestic terror from their own rulers
at the head table reza barhani tommy barton of connex reps of halliburton bechtel danny dalton dean whiting
a new regime would bring deliverance for iran
iranian resources are abundant its culture is rich its citizens are talented
and given a chance there is no limit to what the iranian people can achieve
on the other side of the doors bennett stands with three hotel security guards
the secretary of defenses voice travels through the doors muffled
youre not on the list
you dont have a badge and you dont have a wristband
bennett looks at the three guards
he pulls out a card and scribbles one word on the back
take this to sydney hewitt
inside the room the guard makes his way to sydney hewitt and hands him the card
their hopes are the same as all people in every land to lead lives of dignity in a nation at peace
and america will help them
applause as sydney looks up sharply
at the head table dean crutcher reza and tommy clap along heartily
tommy his personal lawyer at his ear not to my recollection bennett and sydney square off against tommy jimmy their personal lawyers one apiece
killeen oil through daniel dalton and petroka energy consultants created assetless shell companies owned by the heirs of president nazerbayev
checks his notes at the upstream division meeting held in january of in sun valley idaho
i was at the meeting but i dont focus on those kinds of details
wherein it was described that killeen bore all financial risk but president nazerbayevs children while attending the lily school in switzerland were entitled to all of the profits seventy million
tommys personal lawyer leans in and whispers in his ear
i attended the meeting but as i said i dont focus on those kinds of details
daniel dalton jr
and petroka energy consultants a firm retained by killeen well prior to connexs involvement oh fer chrissakes tommy we both got letters from the grand jury its not your own
private little pity party a good faith purchaser is in good faith only if they didnt know about the problems at the time of the purchase this is the oil business were talking about right
the lowliest little shareholder knows we deal with some of the most stank places on earth it is illegal to offer gifts money or the promise of money or anything
of value to influence foreign officials oh is it
i have personally seen a bill from this law firm to the government of saudi arabia for million dollars
a one line bill for services rendered
the business of whiting sloan is not under discussion at this time
well it oughta be
dannys a good man
hes a friend of mine
the arab youth exits the hotel and runs across the wide waterfront square
he cuts for a lone figure sitting on wall
he runs up to bryan
theyve sued the emir on the isle of jersey and frozen his money
he was in bulgari and his credit card stopped working
prince nasir tosses a newspaper at bryan some people cousins of mine actually sued my father in the commonwealth alleging that he broke agreements to repay funds transferred from the
bryan follows nasir
he glances at a photo of aggrieved arabs leaving court with dean whiting looking protective
a mareva injunction
aggrieved about what
that he tried to cut their allowances from one hundred thousand a month to eighty
they pass wife children hangers on
room after room
there are years of corrupt layers in the middle east and you have to break the ice
there must be structural changes
i tell them with just one of your boats you could revolutionize yemen build desalinization plants
the man with the foot boat needs a foot boat
the man with
they dead end in a small office
the emirs japanese secretary half rises
i want to see my father
the secretary shakes his head
nasir is furious
my cousins arent bright enough to be anything but finger puppets
my brother has faith only in his own cunning
then again what should i expect his mother was a whore
and hes hired american lawyers
what do you suppose they are thinking my brother and these american lawyers
bryan takes in the hangers on in expensive suits peeking from the doorway the view to lake geneva
what are they thinking
theyre thinking were running out
were running out and ninety percent of whats left is in the middle east
so if you look at the whole progression from versailles through suez gulf war one gulf war ii its really shaping up as a fight to the death
so what theyre thinking is keep playing keep buying your toys keep spending fifty thousand dollars a night for your hotel room but dont invest in your infrastructure dont build
a real economy so when you finally wake up they will have sucked you dry and you will have squandered the greatest natural resource in history
the prince remains impassive
after a beat come with me please
nasir speaks privately with bryan
i studied at oxford
i have a phd from georgetown
i want to create a parliament
i want to give women the right to vote
i want an independent judiciary
i want to start a new petroleum exchange in the middle east and cut the speculators out of the business
why are the major oil exchanges in new york and london anyway
ill put all of our energy up for competitive bidding ill pipe through iran to europe like you proposed ill ship to china anything that achieves efficiency and maximizes profits
for my people profits which ill then use to rebuild my country
thats great thats exactly what you should do
exactly except your president calls my father says ive got unemployment in texas kansas washington state
one phone call later were stealing out of our social programs to buy overpriced airplanes
we owed the americans but weve repaid that debt
i accepted a chinese bid the highest bid
and suddenly im a terrorist
im a godless communist
nasir hopes takes the newspaper out of bryans hand
tight on dean whiting with the aggrieved royals
who represents not only these aggrieved royals but also connex oil
theyre pressuring my father to invalidate the chinese contracts
they underestimate him
this is about his legacy to his people
wasim sis studying slowly sounding out the words
he writes crudely formed letters
he sees farooq goofing around with friends
we are a small group the ones who carry convictions and ambitions
and an even smaller group from this group are the ones who flee from the worldly life in order to spread and act upon these ambitions
mohammed sheik agiza leads the boys through underbrush on the communal farm
they approach a small farm shed
and an even smaller group from this elite group are the ones who sacrifice their souls and their blood in order to bring victory to these ambitions and principles
msa pulls mats aside revealing a hatch in the floor
he opens the hatch
a stinger missile case is hidden below
he drags out the case
they help him set it on a table
so you are the cream of the cream of the cream
it is possible for us to achieve glory only by traversing this path
msa opens the case and as he shows off the stinger we notice a smiley face scratched into the metal
good quality but nearly impossible to hit anything
msa lifts out another device a conical shaped charge
by shaping the charge this will send a blast of molten copper through thirty inches of steel
the boys are wide eyed
this is the coolest pocket knife theyve ever seen
death fist iii
brosnan is bond
bob walks past posters in an air conditioned theater lobby
a bored concession stand worker ignores him
stan why did mussawi double cross me
why does no one care that a sunni radical named mohammed sheik agiza has our missile
and why did they open a damage assessment on the amiris
and on me
for doing my job
an empty matinee
bob sits next to stan goff
questions two and three seem obvious to me
missiles are everywhere
christ casey gave em out like party favors
this damage assessment well lets just say nasir wasnt a home run
about fall out
theyre worried you may want to talk about it
but if youre already under investigation
what about mussawi
mussawis a soldier
hes just like you
bob stares at stan who continues
maybe he found god
maybe he was having a bad day
maybe americans shouldnt travel these days
did prince nasir hide mohammed sheik agiza in the water ministry
does he fund terrorist organizations
tell people what they want to hear and they have a better chance of believing you
people were paid to lie coached on their polygraphs
single sources spread through different intelligence agencies that dont communicate with each other
you know how its done
whos worried about the nasir job
stan whos worried about me talking
on the screen a loud action beat
stan leans over and hulking structures in concrete like albert speers vision of heaven as danny d
rants at bennett some trust fund prosecutor got off message at brown thinks hes gonna run this up the flag pole make a name for himself maybe get elected some
two bit no name congressman from nowhere with the result that russia or china can suddenly start having at our expense all the advantages we enjoy here
no i tell you
but danny these are sovereign nations
what is a sovereign nation but a collective of greed run by one individual
but danny theyre codified by the u
legitimized gangsterism on a global basis that has no more validity than an agreement between the crips and the bloods
passing people shoot sidelong glances
a group of men in suits are clearly waiting for danny d
corruption aint nothing more than government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation
thats milton friedman
he got a goddamn nobel prize
we have laws against it precisely so we can get away with it
corruption is our protection
corruption is what keeps us safe and warm
corruption is why you and i are here in the white hot center of things instead of fighting each other for scraps of meat out there in the streets
is how we win
finally you broke the law mr
oh who gives a shit
you have million dollars hidden away and the only question i can see of any relevance is whether youll get to keep any of it
the two men are tiny against the architecture the nations capitol going on with its day around them
sydney approaches bennett who eats his lunch outside the law offices of whiting and sloan
howd it go
think youll get invited on any more hunting trips
he has kids
hes got a wife
he broke the law
sydney holds out a golden envelope to bennett
janus himself wanted me to extend an invitation to oilman of the year
hes being honored so it should be a nice weekend
get a massage
perhaps the slightest flicker of distaste crosses bennetts face
on the reverse the capitol building is so close you could reach out and touch it
a vast hotel suite silent until the emirs electric wheelchair rolls into sight
he rolls across marble through rooms until he approaches prince nasir and prince meshal
a long beat before the emir speaks in arabic
i am tired
the emir raises his hand
nasir gets control of himself
who will be emir
the emir looks away then back at prince nasir
prince nasir looks from his father to brother and back
i would ask you to remain as foreign minister
prince meshal sticks out his hand
nasir ignores it and speaks to his father
you cannot do this
he is barely qualified to run a brothel much less a country
i like europe the precipitation
i will be happy to stay here
my decision is final and i ask you to support your brother
i cannot do that
the roar of water as the fountain cascades down
riley plays along the low wall beside it
bryan and julie hover nearby
around them people speak german and french
sure it looks like just hanging around in a hotel but thats how these people do business
its world historical stage time
with the delivery deals we can make in europe transport through iran this guy might be able to revolutionize not just his country but the whole region
his dads about to keel over and prince nasir could be like mossadegh in iran in with a real democracy springing up organically
i mean if we could just be a part of one of these countries getting a parliament helping them find efficiency showing them how real incentivized capitalism can do its
job stop it
look at me
the fountain shoots up and cascades down
riley leans toward the water and for a second his feet lift up
bryan starts up but then riley is playing again
julie the little trading company i work for is now the chief economic advisor to prince nasir
do you know what this means
its like someone put a giant atm on our front lawn
heres a question how do you think it looks to profit off the death of your six year old
this gets through but then fuck you
i changed the diapers and put cream on rashes and gave bottles in the night and went to doctors check ups and worried about percentiles
i did everything right
i did everything right
they look at each other and for a second it seems he may melt and hold her but he doesnt and its cruel
bryan were going back to america
she heads for riley who lets go of a balloon
it floats up past the watch signs plastered on the buildings
a phone rings a muted electronic beep
dean whiting answers the phone
hello is this mr
this is hometech security
he reaches for the bedside light and snaps it on
whiting is a lump on the far side of the bed
this is mr
were showing a motion sensor failure in your downstairs study
whiting glances at the wall readout on his alarm downstairs study flashing
like i said were getting a failure message
you want me to stay on the phone with you while you walk around or send a car
whiting reaches under his bed and pulls a gun box
he flips the combination
he selects the largest and switches off the light
ill walk around
whiting closes the bedroom door and switches on the hall light
lots of closed doors
he walks down the stairs
he reaches around a wall and hits the living room lights
he crosses the living room and library hitting lights as he goes
then a kitchen
the house is quiet
whitings study unlike the standard upper crust decorating of the rest of the home has a specific middle eastern flair
pictures of whiting on a camel with persian friends at oxford in the sixties
whiting is an arabist
the motion sensor light is on
whiting tries a window
howre we doing mr
he tries another one
theres a sliding glass door that leads to a patio and pool
whiting tries it and it slides open
the sliding door is unlocked
he turns slowly
the room looks different
there is an alcove with a wet bar and walk in closets
did you leave it unlocked
send a car you imbecile
he looks at the alcove and closet
just then the desk phone rings startling him
the phone rings and rings
on the wall behind whitings head are beautifully framed photos with kissinger clinton king fahd
rack focus off whiting and slowly zoom to
of dean whiting and the old emir nasirs father
its early morning
a couple of drunks at the counter
bob is at a booth with a mug of coffee
dean whiting appears outside the window enters the restaurant sits
you were in beirut in
i lost friends there as im sure you did
i got a peek at your file
youre a good man one whose experience is narrow and deep
your entire career youve been used and probably never even known what for
i didnt used to need to know
a grand slam breakfast is set in front of bob
in this town youre innocent until youre investigated
bob looks up and squints at the waitress name tag
bacon looks perfect deborah
bob puts syrup on the pancakes
eats a piece of bacon
innocent until investigated
it has a nice ring to it
i bet youve worn some miles on little sayings like that
very wise gives the listener the sense of law being written as its spoken
if anything happens to me or my family an accident an accusation anything then first your son will disappear his body will never be found
then your wife
her body will never be found either
this is guaranteed
then whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your life it might be flying in a small plane it might be walking to the bank you will be
do you understand what im saying
i want you to acknowledge that you do understand so that were clear and there wont be any mistakes
after a beat whiting nods
beirut rules mr
whiting loves the game
bob looks tired maybe a little sad
ive made decisions that resulted in deaths but i never lost a nights sleep
i killed people but i always had about pages of u
law behind me law that i believed in and that was good enough
you still do mr
you still do
bob stares at him
i want my passports back
tight on bennett as he runs through a downtrodden neighborhood
sweat dripping breathing heavily he runs faster and faster
people on stoops watch him go
hes oblivious to the unmarked car following him
finally the car races up beside him
the window rolls down and donald parish iiis face appears
take a ride with me
bennett keeps jogging
bennett i know you know about the crime fraud exception to attorney client privilege
i do don
then you also know your client is into some shady stuff and its starting to look like you could be involved in hiding the true nature of the transactions
farishs car stops
bennett is panting
thats quite a statement don
bennett rides with farish
a long beat
finally one word
defrauded the government of kazakhstan of funds to which it was entitled defrauded the people of kazakhstan of the right to the honest services of their elected and appointed officials
seven years does three maybe two point seven on your recommendation
out the window the bad neighborhood is giving way back to the developing neighborhood where bennett lives
and let me guess this was a solo act without the knowledge of connex or killeen oil of mr
lee janus or jimmy pope
daltons a bit of a rogue its true
and hell have a nice little trust fund waiting when he gets out
not so little i imagine
don we can spend the next five years in court to get back to this very place we are right now
they will fight tough
they will fight dirty
they will pressure your boss
they will pressure the people who appointed your boss
they will pressure the wives of the people who appointed your boss
you wont ever hit em any harder than this
and you know it
after a beat farish shakes his head
im sorry bennett
i dont think daltons enough
bennett uses the claw end of a hammer to pry the front off a large wooden crate
his father sits across the room reading the paper
the side of the box comes down
bennett stares bennett sr
stares then lights a cigarette
re the cigarette what are you doing
the question is what are you doing
well ill tell you what im not doing im not running a shelter
you going back to work
what happened at your job anyway
another white asshole
you think you get where ive gotten and there are less of them
you think i dont want a fucking drink
you have no idea what im doing what is actually going on with me
the only way you can change this shit all this shit is from the inside
im trying to get inside
which a fucking loser like you will never understand
puts down his paper stubs out his cigarette and starts for the door
the door shuts behind his dad yelling after him i love this country
its a great country if youre not a quitter
slowly bennett calms
he turns looks at the kudu
he thinks and the sound of a grill sizzling begins to rise ribs on a fancy bbq grill
a wide expanse of lawn
no other houses in sight
teenagers splash in a pool
daltons not enough
so they will sit on him until he explains the how and why and the who and they will be forced to unravel this merger
jimmy turns from the grill
id be real careful
you dig a three foot hole youll find one body but you dig a six foot hole and you might find twenty
daltons not enough
we use one quarter of the oil in the world bennett
your house is light and warm and my house is light and warm but what if it was that way half the week or none of the week
hell chinas economy aint growing as fast as it could because they cant get all the oil they need
im damn proud of that fact
bennett gives him nothing
what if it involved someone at your firm
someone way the hell above you
wed have to have an understanding
if hes as big as you say then when he goes down the merger will be approved
despite himself jimmy is impressed just like that
were looking for the illusion of due diligence
two criminal acts successfully prosecuted gives us that illusion
jimmy hands bennett a plate of ribs and smiles
call me jimmy
on television grainy video of a suicide bombers videotaped will
the bomber stands in a field of dry rubble and flowers is both nervous and confident a backpack anything but innocuous at his feet
i wish for everyone who hears this to fear god and to follow god and his prophets
when i die i want the people who inherit my possessions to do the following a group of twenty or thirty boys including wasim and farooq watch the video in
a makeshift shed
one the people who prepare my body should be good muslims so this will remind me of god and his forgiveness
two i dont want anyone to rip their clothes or slap their faces because this is an ignorant thing to do
mohammed sheik agiza watches the boys watch the video
his influence on those left behind grows
there is no sense of loss since he continues to live and inspire his fame spreading
wasim impassively stares at the video
three i dont want a pregnant woman to come and say good bye to me because i dont approve it
golden honey flares in sunlight dripping off a comb into a collection jug
wasim replaces the comb into a hive
in a line of square wooden hives farooq removes a comb and begins draining the honey
wasim pulls out another comb
wasim looks down
a bee is on his arm
he brushes it off
wasim and farooq look at the bee on the ground as it dragsitself around in a circle
if i truly lack faith then i am not the right person
he looks to farooq who seems very young at this moment
the questioning means that you have faith and makes it stronger thats a lot of shit i think
farooq looks around to see if anyone is listening
well get to intervene in the affairs of family members
well be able to help them with whatever they need
youll be able to get your mother here
wasim looks at his friend then looks away
on the ground the worker bee stops struggling and dies
pan across the desert to find nasir staring into space
twenty seven tribes in my country and we all hate each other
my father arrested the malcontents
he crushed the religious zealots
try reasoning with people who have one foot in the afterlife he said as he leveled village after village
another angle and bryan is approaching
behind him is the desert house made mainly of tents and sails
dignitaries wait on the deck and watch nasir
you know what place my children love most on earth
my children love colorado
i could easily live in colorado while my brother presides over a civil war
i could be very comfortable
bryan watches nasir
i dont see you moving to colorado
the tent is crowded with tribal and military leaders
worried and suspicious they
sit on rugs and recline against pillows
nasir enters and takes his seat
for centuries islam has been ruled by people with no respect for law monopolies handed out for the things that people want commerce stifled young people unable to find jobs
critics jailed or put to death women are second class he is interrupted by a bedouin leader
tomorrow is the coronation
your brother has the support of the united states
and of their troops are stationed in our country
this is true
my father is ill and weak and unwilling to fight the americans
but others are willing
and when a country has five percent of the worlds population but does fifty percent of its military spending then the persuasive powers of that country are on the decline
the crowd is unmoved
rallying the men will not be easy
bob rides up an escalator changing planes in the early morning
he sees his wife watching him
bob and margaret sit in uncomfortable connected chairs
if i told you i knew of something that was going to happen to someone and that i felt i had to try and stop it even though it will
probably cost me my job what would you say
she really looks at him
you cant tell me any more
no of course not
she looks away
outside the window a huge plane is pulling away from the gate
i want you to do what you think is right
and maybe for you to want the same for me
after a beat she reaches over and takes his hand
a wide shot of bob and margaret holding hands in the lounge the plane lifting off behind them tight on medals on a military uniform
hands reach down to pin another row
prince meshal al subaai is looking into a mirror as he buckles his ceremonial sword
if i liberalize the generals would overthrow me
if i relax my authority the mob would tear me limb from limb
but of course im aware that democracy and human rights are good ideas
he stares long into his own royal reflection
prince meshal and advisors walk toward brightly lit double doors
the sound of a large crowd cheering comes toward him as he disappears into silhouette
its a holiday as an am radio blares prince meshals coronation celebration
saleem and other workers play cricket on a makeshift pitch just outside the gate
i wanted to be on a bobsled in the olympics
i wanted to drive
that was my dream
the men have no idea what hes talking about
he sees wasim walking toward him
to the men wasim knows what a bobsled is
can i borrow bus fare papa
wasim tell them about the bobsled
its a little car that goes down a track of ice and snow
saleem pulls some change from his pocket and hands it to his son
oh how snow sparkles the crunch of it under your feet the quiet and calm it brings wasim suddenly hugs his father who is surprised but hugs him back
then wasim walks away
wasim glances back
and wasim waves back
then saleem turns back to the cricket
on the edge of the city bob sits in a traffic jam in the glaring sun heat waves flickering
his pov of a white bus full of migrant workers in blue jumpsuits
fred franks stares at the window of a vending machine trying to decide between doritos or fritos
he presses e and doritos drop
im going in
he snatches the doritos
this room is now crowded filled with audio visual surveillance equipment
palpable excitement in the air
franks returns with his coffee and chips
willy a technician buzz cut recent th year senior at hamilton college fills him in
just heard from tampa the j stars are tracking and we should have an image from the predator in a few seconds
he eats some chips offers some to another guy
is it night there still
the tribal leaders have bargained through the night
outside the tents everyone else is waiting including bryan whose ear piece dangles to his blackberry
we have a contract to establish a new petroleum exchange
no firm our size has pulled off anything like this
bryan crosses to the chinese oil executives
hes a visionary like faisal or attaturk and the people love him
by monday hell be running the country
the chinese seem unconvinced
finally the tent opens and the leaders file out
prince nasir addresses the crowd
the middle east and the arab people have seen empires come and go in six millennia
the pax romana the pax ottomanica the pax brittanica were nothing more than invasions and occupations that ended
the pax americana will end too
his wife and daughters proudly watch
we have endless patience for history but a man starving to death while sitting on a chair made of gold can no longer afford to be patient
the time for democratic arab self determination has arrived
the crowd cheers
and as prince nasir his family and supporters move toward the vehicles find nasirs bodyguard whispering into a cell phone silver hummer as nasir and bryan enter a silver hummer
the liquefied natural gas facility has changed hands
the china gas and electric signage is now connex killeen signage
the chinese engineers are now american engineers
native musicians entertain a small crowd of hard hats local officials and visiting dignitaries
someone breaks a bottle across a huge colored pipe
the chief engineer signals
he throws a huge lever a powerful whisper builds hurtling through the pipes toward them and past them to the lng carrier a thousand foot long tanker docked alongside
the doors open
sydneyand bennettenter wearing tuxedos
sydney insertsa plasticcard allowing accessto the upper floors
his wifell be there
butter wouldnt melt in her mouth
the elevator tones on every floor
this is good
you done good
the watch the floors light up
the door opens and pat janus s nancy reagan suit and coif opens the door
she takes in the men smiling sydney how are you
and you must be mr
she shakes his hand
gives sydney both cheeks
they cross the large suite one wall of which is floor to ceiling windows giving a dazzling view of mid town manhattan
in a sitting area leland lee janus s a vigorous pit bull in tux shirt and bow tie turns from the tv syd
howre we doing
janus is standing with his hand out those number crunchers can get a little over zealous cant they but christ when we write the gaap rules like some kind of
stare at that liability hard enough and before long itll turn into an asset
a small black and white image of a room full of generals and support staff moving silently around
pulling back to reveal theyre on a small monitor titled us central command tampa florida
the division chief franks other group chiefs huddle over another blank monitor
angle on the blank monitor suddenly an image pops on desert seen from seven miles up
a wide shot of sand and more sand
the room lets out soft yeahs as the image shifts finding a distant highway cutting through it
image from predator
seven miles up
lets go in
god i love the uavs
unmanned aerial vehicles
i love em
and its quiet right
baby cruises at eighty knots about as audible as the clouds
bryan watches the desert fly outside the window
nasir stares ahead
the hummer slows
bryan sees a vast flock of sheep moving diagonally across the desert in front of them blocking the road
in the middle of thousands of sheep shepherds on camels and sprinkler trucks misting water over the flock moving with ancient slowness across the road
janus in the comfy chair
bennett perches on the edge of the couch
sydney is next to him
the lawyers are saying hey if you cant trust a big five accounting firm
and the accountants are saying hey were not lawyers
legal didnt understand
accounting didnt understand
nobody understood anything
the regulatory bodies had to scratch their heads for a minute that nobody at connex or killeen was at fault but this merger is so balance positive for american consumers
that ultimately justice wants it the federal court wants it
everybody wants it
our real client is us the american people and were building our presence in kazakhstan so we had to give them a little something meaningful and they got out of
janus glances at the tv where a pro golfer sinks a long undulating putt
he looks back at bennett just a glance but its clear he recognizes in bennett someone who understands the way the world works and the pressures that he mr
janus is under
something besides dalton
and the best option seemed to be a secret deal for excess iranian pipeline capacity that i uncovered during the diligence a side deal benefiting the lead lawyer involved in
the connex killeen merger approval process
a slow dawning on sydneys face what do you think youre doing
of course its illegal for an american to control these rights stop
bennett and mr
janus look at sydney
is there something you want to tell me syd
on a monitor the image of the distant desert slowly swings around
what are we looking at folks
well get there
they find a lone car traveling like an ant in the road
i gotta do some traveling
ive never even gotten out of the usa
before grad school i am definitely getting down to mexico
the image tightens
its an suv seen from heaven
bob is driving fast now
the modern city is behind him
lift up to see the mitsubishi heading into the desert an eight lane highway heading to nowhere
the needle disengages from a container with a swoosh
the latest vacuum seal protection and workers trained in the taiwan and the united states of america
men in blue jumpsuits watch the needle lift in the sky
a functionary talks into the microphone
people pass this way and that sipping champagne
the view down the length of the boat past the containment bubbles is striking
each container holds over million u
dollars of fuel thats million in total quite a haul
a wide of the beautiful harbor
fire boats spray water
and far away a flotilla of native fishing boats dhows and sambuks and boums makes its way out to sea
fisher folk perform tasks theyve been performing since time began
a fisherman looks up following his view to another dhow as wasim and then farooq drift into view
music swells across the water from the terminal
more of the flotilla of fishing boats is revealed
and behind them the shoreline is dotted with oil storage tanks still painted with images of the old emir
sydney on his feet standing aggressively over bennett
in our line of work the guy with the documents is usually the guy who stole the documents
but dont own
you arent going to hurt me bennett
youll wash out of the private sector
fact youre already gone
youll end up working public defender cases
youll make th the money
you could have been on the boards of fortune five hundred companies
you could have been an advisor to presidents
you could have helped us win like romans instead of sitting on the sidelines hoping we dont turn into visigoths
you jumped that turnstile sir but dont worry well get you off at trial sydney takes the documents out of bennetts hands
we expect you kids to try and kill the father
we encourage it
just maybe not so soon
sydney senses something and sees donald farish iii and fbi agents have entered the room
sydney turns back to bennett a flash of true venom you ungrateful pissant nobody
fbi restrains sydney
pat looks up from her needlepoint
a piece of advice syd one attorney to another
bennett leans close get rid of that watch
it makes you look like a nigger
angle on sydneys wrist is the mickey mouse watch
and then a handcuff is slipped over it and clicked tight
sydney now appears completely relaxed again
he looks at donald farish iii and nods don
not the perp walk don farish nods as if to acknowledge theyre barely out of round one
and they begin leading sydney out
across the room silhouetted by the windows mrs
janus helps mr
janus slip on his tux jacket
they see bennett standing awkwardly in the middle of the room
pat extends her hand for him to join them
the three are silhouetted against the skyline
janus looks out at the valleys of manhattan
im a straight shooter bennett
i think it was trollope who said the best capitalist is someone whos greedy and honest
we cant forget that second part
it was trollope honey
were creating a lot of jobs this quarter bennett a lot of jobs
were building a business and thats what americas all about
on the monitor the convoy is in the smudge of sheep
silver hummer silver hummer where are you silver hummer
on the monitor the image tightens zooming in on the silver roof of nasirs hummer
it locks relief on the faces of bureau chiefs and technicians
theres a phrase
you know what i mean
whats the phrase
target target acquisition
on the monitor the silver roof unmoving in the desert
thats what we got here
nasirs children are laughing as sheep pass
the parents are laughing too
pan and find bryan watching them
nasirs wife smiles kindly
bryan opens the door for her
you guys should ride together
nasir and bryan exchange a glance then nasir helps his wife into the vehicle
bryan hands the baby up to them
bryan looks out and sees a shepherd showing his son how to use the staff tapping the sheep guiding them
the convoy moves out sheep like parted waters on either side of the highway sheep closing behind as they pass
bob speeds toward the sheep who are again blocking the road
he pulls up to them and honks
shepherds on camels stare
he inches the car forward
bobs suv is steadily engulfed by sheep
then he cant go any further
he forces the door open and gets out
cacophonous sheep bells and sheep sounds hooves in sand
the sun is brutal
bob climbs onto the hood
his pov ahead in the desert beyond the sheep of prince nasirs convoy is rapidly disappearing
and the highway curving to the right
bob slams the car into reverse and begins backing out of the sheep
its slow going
sheep getting bumped baaing loudly as bob reverses
a metal plane like a giant grey insect drifts silently above the earth
the horizon is bright and curved
the predator has no pilots
the controls adjust on their own with robotic smoothness
bob gets free of the sheep
he turns off the highway and drives out into the desert going around the giant flock so that he can cut the convoy off at an angle
a wizened shepherd on a camel watches the suv go
the watering trucks continue swish swish swishing
the bay where two hellfire missiles wait
the hatch begins opening
the desert floor appears far below just a blank canvas the details out of reach of human eyes
the baby is screaming and a child cant get its juice box to fit in the hummer cup holder
the square corner hits the circular opening
nasirs wife readies a bottle
the child slams the juice box
nasir reaches and fits the juice box in the holder
the baby keeps screaming
laughter fills the room at a sumptuous awards dinner
sir david has white hair and a black bow tie
i would like to say in making our selection of the recipient of this award john brown cant win every year
it would be like formula one with schumacher and ferrari winning over and over
and i dont need to tell you whose fuel theyre using
faces in the crowd eating and laughing this is not to crown a career
youre a young man and unlike me have many years of toil ahead of you
this years oilman of the year mr
leland janus of connex killeen
the crowd gives leland lee janus a standing ovation as he walks to the podium
all the big oil companies have tables
bennett holiday is next to dean whiting
janus shakes hands with sir david and accepts an engraved crystal oil derrick
thank you sir david
its not a secret vote so we can see who is voting for themselves
its all right to vote for yourself
i did not vote for myself
the rapt faces of oil men listening to an oil man
i voted this year as i do every year for ali naimi the saudi oil minister who has done more for shareholder value than all of us combined
laughter as a smiling saudi accepts a round of applause
and that is certainly not a criticism of any of us in this room
my father told me when i was young never criticize a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes
this is something ive tried to live by because if you do criticize youre already a mile away and youve got his shoes
laughter people glancing
who knew he was so funny
a missile shifts rolling sideways a slow mechanical movement of impersonal machinery
and then one of the hellfire missiles silently drops and falls rapidly away from the plane
bob races across the white desert
ahead through the windshield the convoy angles along the highway
fire boats shoot water in the distance
as wasim makes his way to the prow of the boat slowly
the huge lng tanker slides into frame filling the sky
the name the condoleeza rice appears
wasim pushes fishing nets aside revealing a stinger missile fashioned into a shaped charge and fitted to the prow of the boat
scratched into the surface of the stinger the same missile bob intended to explode in the beginning
bob is closing on the front of the convoy maybe a hundred yards off
he can see prince nasir
he pulls a white shirt from the backseat and starts waving it out the window
people stare at the monitors tense and restless
the toy like convoy snakes across the desert
somebody tell me what the hell is going on
the plane is just really high
and theres delay on the video how long
i dont know
i can find out
i think from yemen to here was like four or five seconds
bryan stares ahead
his pov up the length of the convoy
the hum of the highway
he turns and sees out the window the mitsubishi suv cutting toward them
the toy like convoy snakes across the desert
another car enters the frame angling toward the convoy
whats that other car
the screaming baby takes the bottle and quiets
prince nasir makes eye contact with his wife and smiles
a bodyguard in the front hears something over the radio and points out to the desert nasir turns and looks at bobs car fast approaching bob angles the car in
tighter waving the white flag
nasirs bodyguards point their weapons
prince nasir sees him
they make eye contact a bodyguard begins shouting into a walkie talkie
other vehicles race forward and surround bobs car forcing it to stop
soldiers with their weapons on bob
he steps from his car holding the white shirt in front of him
approaches prince nasirs vehicle
they stare at one another
nasir lowers his window
i remember you
youre the canadian
tight on bob
he starts to speak a tiny poof of white smoke
and vehicles scatter in crazy directions
then a rush of black smoke
the crowd of chiefs and technicians erupts into celebration handshakes and high fives
the tendril of black smoke is spreading into a black cloud
the vehicles are stopped
the room is silent
janus stares into the crowd
i accept this award on behalf of the employees of connex killeen our people the finest in the world
guys could i get you to stand up for a moment
at the connex table tommy and jimmy and the others get to their feet
the crowd applauds
bennett applauds jimmy who sees him clapping and applauds him right back the prince nasir convoy is scattered like toys
people broken with shock and awe
debris is still falling
find bryan moving forward through smoke and overturned vehicles the only sound the buzzing ringing in his ears
bryans pov of a burning crater in the road
nasirs car and family are completely incinerated
and nearby bobs car is a massive ball of flame
janusholds out his hands to still applause
i want to thank our strategic friends from around the globe who are here tonight
emir meshal al subaai gives a little wave to both sides of the room
i hope im not giving away trade secrets when i say liquefied natural gas truly is the fuel of the future
janus raises his crystal derrick in a toast
and to everyone else who helps make this the most exciting and important and profitable industry on earth
the crowd again begins clapping for itself
light catches the crystal oil derrick and refracts bryan staggers away
were on his back as he slogs then bryans face is tight in half the frame while behind him the wreckage and people and smoke trail away
bryan wipes at a tear and another
then suddenly hes weeping losing it completely
he stumbles blindly on
bryan wanders through the desert a hazy form merging with the heat shimmering horizon
tight on farooqs eyes
farooq is terrified
he stares at wasim who is watching the tanker where workers and touring dignitaries pay no attention
on another boat a father and son fishermen going about their business
the father smiles briefly at wasim
wasim sees that farooq is frozen
wasim shouts at him in urdu
farooq hesitates a moment longer then his hand pushes the throttle forward
the dhow accelerates breaking free of the flotilla heading straight for the condoleeza rice lng carrier
at the bowsprit wasim has the wind and sunlight and spray in his face
wasims pov of the containment bubbles which have a covering of frozen sparkling condensate and look exactly like snow covered mountains
on wasims face a slow almost beatific smile begins to spread
he seems completely at peace as he passes into the shadow of the tanker
on the condoleeza rice sailors become alarmed running in different directions but its too late the little boat speeds for the side of the tanker and just as it makes
impact sprinklers water a green field in the middle of a desert
wasim appears against a plain background
he looks very young
he addresses the camera
during the funeral i want everyone to be quiet
and i should be lying on my right side
riley plays with a thomas train set
julie reads in a comfortable chair
packing boxes are still unopened
you should throw dust on my body three times while saying from the dust we created you and to dust you will return
riley sees his mother looking past him
he turns sees his father and runs toward him
bryan gathers his son up in his arms
from the dust a new person will be created
bryan looks through the rooms at his wife who has taken a few steps toward him
she hesitates a man cleans out bobs office putting files into boxes
another man puts photos into a box
bob with a friend smiling
another photo of bob with coworkers is placed on top
tighter on this picture of bob everyone should mention that i died pure of heart and that the next world is the true life
bennett gets out of a cab
his father is slumped over on the front stoop
the next world is the true life
bennett walks up the steps and pauses beside his father
come on man
leave the beer
his father rouses
bennett helps him inside and the door shuts behind them
