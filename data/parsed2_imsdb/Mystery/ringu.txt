closeup on a television set
theres a baseball game on but the sound is turned completely down
camera pans to show two cute high school girls masami and tomoko
masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee table textbook in front of her
tomoko is at her desk
there are snacks all over the room and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going on
masami is currently in mid story speaking excitedly
they say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in izu
the kid wanted to go out and play with everybody right but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in tokyo so he records
it on the vcr in their room
but of course the stations in izu are different from the ones in tokyo
in izu it was just an empty channel so he shouldve recorded nothing but static
but when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says masami points so suddenly and
dramatically at her friend that tomoko actually jumps in her seat
masami contd one week from now you will die
short silence as masami pauses relishing the moment
masami contd of course the kids completely freaked and he stops the video
just then the phone rings and when he picks it up a voice says her voice drops voice almost to a whisper
masami contd you watched it didnt you
that same time exactly one week later
masami laughs loudly thoroughly enjoying her own performance
tomoko however is completely silent
she begins looking more and more distressed until finally masami notices
what is it tomoko
tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her friend
her words are quick earnest
who did you hear that story from
its just a rumor
everybody knows it
youko told you
no it wasnt youko
tomoko looks away worried
masami slaps her on the knee laughing
whats up with you
tomoko speaks slowly still looking away
the other day i
i watched this strange video
with youko and them
excited so thats what ive been hearing about you doing some double date sleepover thing
so you and that guy iwata huh
no its not like that
their eyes meet and tomoko half blushes looks away again
her expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation
he found this weird video
everyone was like whats that
so he put it on and we all watched it
what kind of video was it
weird i cant really explain it
anyway right after we finished watching it the phone rang
whoever it was didnt say anything but still
masami curls up on herself thoroughly spooked
its cuz you know wed all heard the rumors
tomoko looks seriously over at her friend
tomoko contd that was one week ago today
there is a long heavy silence as neither of them says anything
waaait a minute
are you faking me out
tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile
they both crack up laughing
i cant believe you
masami reaches out slaps her friend on the knee
masami contd youre terrible
thinking but hang on
you really stayed the night with youko and iwata right
tomoko nods uh huh
masami dives forward pinching her friends cheeks and grinning wildly
so how far did you and he get
i cant remember
you cant remember huh
masami laughs then slaps tomoko on the knee again as she remembers the trick her friend played on her
man you had me freaked me out
just at that moment the phone rings
they are both suddenly instantly serious
tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she begins shaking her head no
masami looks over her shoulder following her friends gaze
tomoko is looking at the clock which currently reads
the phone continues to ring
tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her friend looking panicked
softly was it true
tomoko nods her head still holding on tightly
masami has to forcibly disengage herself in order to stand
the phone is downstairs so masami opens the bedroom door and races down the stairs
tomoko calls out to her from behind
tomoko and masami run down the staircase through the hallway towards the kitchen
tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen
masami has come to a halt before a phone mounted on the wall
she pauses looking slowly at her friend then back to the phone
she takes it tentatively from its cradle answers it wordlessly
the tension continues to mount as nothing is said
masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin
ill put her on
still grinning she hands the phone to tomoko
tomoko snatches it quickly
she is silent for a moment then smiling widely
she is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she sinks to the kitchen floor
masami equally relieved slides down the wall and sits down next to her
on the phone yeah ive got a friend over now
tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle and then squats back down onto the kitchen floor
the games gone into overtime so theyre gonna be a little late
they burst out laughing with relief again and are soon both clutching their stomachs
jeeezus my parents
oh man im tellin everybody about this tomorrow
tomoko shakes her head dont you dare
im gonna use your bathroom
dont go anywhere
masami walks out of the kitchen
alone now tomoko stands and walks toward the sink where she takes a glass from the dish rack
she then goes to the fridge and sticks her face in looking for something to drink
suddenly there is the sound of people clapping and cheering
tomoko startled peers her head over the refrigerator door to check for the source of the sound
she begins walking slowly following the sound to the dining room adjacent the kitchen
the lights are off and there is no one in the room
tomoko pauses a moment bathed in the garish light from the tv which has been switched on
playing is the same baseball game they had on the tv upstairs the same game that tomokos parents are currently at
the volume is up quite high
a puzzled look on her face tomoko takes the remote from the coffee table and flicks the tv off
she walks back to the kitchen
a bottle of soda that tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on the kitchen table
she picks the bottle up pours herself a drink
before she can take a sip however the air around her becomes suddenly charged heavy
her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight comes a popping crackling sound underscored by a kind of groaning
trembling now tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt lurking behind her
she draws in her breath to scream
the screen goes white and fades into the screen is filled with the visage of a nervous looking young girl
she is being interviewed by asakawa a female reporter seated offscreen
there seems to be a popular rumor going around about a cursed videotape
have you heard what kind of video it might be
the girl looks directly at the camera her mouth dropping into an o as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright
she continues staring silently at the camera
komiya the cameraman has lowered his camera
we can now see that the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two friends a short haired girl girl and a long haired girl girl
they are all dressed in the uniforms of junior high school students
opposite them sits komiya and asakawa a pretty woman in her mid twenties
a boom mike guy stands to the left
uh dont look right at the camera sorry
lets do it again
asakawa glances over her shoulder makes sure that komiya is ready
have you heard what kind of video it might be
what i heard was all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says in one week you will die
i heard that if youre watching tv late at night itll come on and then your phonell ring
watching tv late at night
do you know what station
i heard some local station around izu
and do you know if anyones really died from watching it
the girl flashes a look at her two friends
well no one that we know right
girl nods her head
girl nods slowly opens and closes her mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not
the reporter notices
what is it
i heard this from a friend of mine in high school
she said that there was this one girl who watched the video and then died a week later
she was out on a drive with her boyfriend
they were in a wreck
no their car was parked but they were both dead inside
her boyfriend died because hed watched the video too
thats what my friend said
girl grows suddenly defensive
girl contd its true
it was in the paper two or three days ago
do you know the name of the high school this girl went to
i heard this from my friend and it didnt happen at her school
she heard it from a friend at a different school she said
asakawa is seated at her desk
the station is filled with people scrabbling to meet deadlines
komiya walks up to asakawas desk and holds out a manila folder
here you are
taking the folder thanks
komiya has a seat
this same kind of thing happened about ten years ago too didnt it
some popular young singer committed suicide and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show
but i wonder what this rumors all about
everyone you ask always mentions izu
maybe thats where it all started
hey where was that kuchi sake onna story from again
literally ripped mouth lady a kind of ghastly spectre from japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth which has been ripped or cut open from ear
she wanders the countryside at night asking men do you think im beautiful
then lowering her veil to reveal her true features
gifu but there was some big accident out there and that ended up being what started the rumor
a big accident
something terrible like that is going to stay in peoples minds
sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one
thats what they say at least
dyou think something like that happened out at izu
well anyway im off
see you tomorrow
asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit
she takes only a few steps before noticing a rack of recent daily she takes one from the rack sets it on a nearby table
she begins flipping the pages and suddenly spies this story the bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their passenger car at around a
the location was a vacant lot parallel to yokohama prefectural road
local authorities identified the deceased as a year old preparatory school student of tokyo and a year old yokohama resident a student of a private all girls high school
because there were no external injuries police are investigating the possibility of drug induced suicide
just then two men walk by a guy in a business suit and a youngish intern named okazaki
okazaki is carrying an armload of videotapes
ok okazaki im counting on you
the guy in the suit pats okazaki on the shoulder and walks off
okazaki turns to walk away spots asakawa bent over the small table and peering intently at the newspaper article
i thought you were going home early today
asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly
okazaki can i ask you a favor
asakawa points to the newspaper
could you check out this article for me
get me some more info
call me as soon as you know more ok
asakawa walks off
okazaki still carrying the videotapes leans forward to take a look at the article
asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly
she gets out runs up the staircase to the third floor
she stops in front of a door sticks her key in the lock and opens it
a boy of about is sitting in an armchair facing the veranda
we can see only the back of his head
hearing his name the boy puts down the book he was reading and stands up facing the door
he is wearing a white dress shirt with a brown sweater type vest over it
he sees asakawa his mother run in the door
she is panting lightly
sorry im late
oh youve already changed
he points over to his mothers right
yoichi contd i got your clothes out for you
asakawa turns to see a dark suit hanging from one of the living room shelves
she reaches out takes it
aargh weve gotta hurry
she runs into the next room to change
asakawa has changed into all black funeral attire
her hair is up and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl necklace
yoichi is still in the living room
did grandpa call
yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother
why did tomo chan die
chan is a suffix in japanese that denotes closeness or affection
it is most often used for young girls though it can also be used for boys
it looks like she was really really sick
she takes a seat on the bed
will you do me up
yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up
you can die even if youre young
if its something serious
asakawa turns to face her son puts an arm around him
as hard as it is for us what your auntie and uncle are going through right now is even harder so lets not talk about this over there ok
remembering you and her used to play a lot together didnt you
yoichi says nothing
red paper lanterns mark this place as the site of a wake
several girls in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in groups
asakawa and yoichi walking hand in hand enter the house
there are many people milling about speaking softly
a man seated at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering their information into a ledger
asakawa and yoichi continue walking down a hallway
mother and son halt before the open door to the main wake room where guests may show their respects to the departed
the room is laid in traditional japanese style tatami a kind of woven straw mat that serves as a carpet
two guests their shoes off are kneeling upon zabuton cushions
kneeling opposite the guests is kouichi asakawas father
the two guests are bowing deeply and kouichi bows in response
kouichi turns to see her
how is sis holding up
shes resting inside right now
shes shaken up pretty badly you know
its best she just take things easy for a while
ill go check on auntie and them then
why dont you sit here for a little while
he grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests
as the guests resume their conversation with asakawas father yoichis eyes wander to the altar at the front of the room set up to honor the deceased
it is made of wood and surrounded by candles flowers and small paper lanterns
at the center is a picture of the deceased a teenage girl
a small wooden plaque reads her name tomoko ouishi
it is the same tomoko from the first scene
yoichi continues to stare at tomokos picture
he makes a peculiar gesture as he does so rubbing his index finger in small circles just between his eyes
asakawa walks down the hallway looking for her aunt
she walks until finding the open doorway to the kitchen
there are a few people in there preparing busily
asakawa sees her aunt who rushes into the hallway to meet her holds her fast by the arm
the aunt speaks in a fierce quick whisper
have you heard anything more about tomo chans death
but the police have already finished their autopsy
well they said there was no sign of foul play
shaking her head that was no normal death
they havent once opened the casket to let us see the body
dont you think thats strange
asakawa looks away thinking
yoichi has wandered off by himself
he stops at the foot of the steps looking up and catches a glimpse of a pair of bare feet running up to the second floor
a guarded expression on his face yoichi walks slowly up the stairs
yoichi has wandered into tomokos bedroom
the lights are all off and there is an eerie feel to it
yoichis eyes wander about the room finally coming to rest on the television set
suddenly he hears his mothers voice from behind him
yoichi turns to face her as she approaches puts an arm around him
what are you doing up here
you shouldnt just walk into other peoples rooms
without replying yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television set
asakawa holds him by the shoulders turning him to meet her
you go on downstairs ok
he turns to leave and asakawa follows
just as yoichi and asakawa are about to descend the steps asakawas cell phone rings
she opens the clasp to her purse
to yoichi you go on ahead
he walks down the steps
asakawa brings out her cell phone answers it
this is okazaki
ive got some more info on that article for you
the girl was a student of the uh seikei school for women in yokahama city
asakawa blinks at this looks disturbed
she hangs up the phone
asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house
dazedly she walks toward a large hand painted placard
the placard reads that the wake is being held for a student of the seikei school for women
asakawa stares at that placard making the mental connections
she turns abruptly walks towards a nearby trio of high school excuse me
this is um kind of a strange question but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well
the three girls turn their faces to the ground
if you know anything
they all died the same day
even iwata he was in a motorcycle accident
because they watched the video
thats what youko said
they all watched some weird video and after that their phone rang
tomoko chan watched it too
girl left shakes her head
she just said they all stayed somewhere
there was a girl with tomoko when she died
shes had to be hospitalized for shock
they say she wont go anywhere near a television
asakawa and yoshino another news reporter are watching scenes from the yokohama car death
in the footage there are lots of policemen milling about one of them trying to pick the door to the passenger side
yoshino is giving asakawa the blow by blow
the bodies of those found were tsuji youko age a student of the seikei school for women and nomi takehiko age preparatory school student
both their doors were securely locked
onscreen the policeman has finally picked the lock
the door opens and a girls body halffalls out head facing upwards
yoshino flicks a button on the control panel scans the footage frame by frame
he stops when he gets a good close up of the victim
her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear mouth open eyes wide and glassy
yoshino and asakawa lean back in their seats
this is the first time ive ever seen something like this
cause of death
couldnt say aside from sudden heart failure
the autopsy came up negative
yoshino takes the video off pause
onscreen a policeman has caught the young girls body from completely falling out and is pushing it back into the car
as the body moves into an upright position we can see that the girls panties are mid way around her left thigh
these two about to go at it suddenly up and die for no apparent reason
yoshino contd do you get it
asakawas car is already halted before a modest sized two story house with a small covered parkway for a garage
she gets out of her car closes the door
she stares at the house unmoving
asakawa stands before her sister ryomi who is seated at the kitchen table
ryomi is staring blankly away making no sign of acknowledging her sister
the silence continues unabated and asakawa pensive wanders idly into the adjoining dining room
she takes a long look at the television the same television that had puzzled tomoko by suddenly switching itself on sitting darkly in one corner
her reflection in the screen looks stretched distorted
they tell me that yoichi came to the funeral too
asakawa steps back into the kitchen
she addresses her sister who continues to stare out at nothing
they used to play a lot together didnt they
ryomi lapses back into a silence
asakawa waits for her to say more but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming she quietly gives up and exits the kitchen
asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor
she makes her way down the hall
as if intruding asakawa walks slowly cautiously into tomokos room
the window to the room is open and a single piece of folded white paper on tomokos desk flutters in the breeze
asakawa walks towards it picks it up
it is a receipt from a photo shop
the developed photos have yet to be claimed
asakawa senses something spins to look over her shoulder
her sister has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall and stands now in the doorway to tomokos room
she appears not to notice what asakawa has in her hands as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door
she regards it almost druggedly
this is where tomoko died
ryomis hands fling aside the closet door
within she finds the pale blue carcass of her daughter curled up into an unnatural fetal position
tomokos mouth yawns gaping her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back of her head
her hands are caught in her hair as if trying to pull it out by the roots
it is a horrific scene one that says tomoko died as if from some unspeakable fear
ryomi sinks to her knees hitting the wooden floor hard
she puts her face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly
asakawa says nothing
asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching tomokos unclaimed photos
she walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them
we see tomoko standing arm in arm with iwata her secret boyfriend
tomoko and her friends eating lunch
the camera had its date and time function enabled and the photos are marked
the next shot is of tomoko iwata and another young couple posing in front of a sign for a bed and breakfast
the sign reads izu
asakawa continues looking through the photos various shots of the four friends clowning around in their room
suddenly she comes to a shot taken the next day at check out
the friends are lined up arms linked and all four of their faces are blurred distorted as if someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them
out of existence
asakawa wears an apron and is frying something up on the stove
yoichi stands watching
look im probably going to be late coming home tonight so just stick your dinner in the microwave when youre ready to eat ok
tomo chan watched some cursed video
asakawa leaves the food on the stove runs over to yoichi and grabs him by the shoulders
she shakes him roughly
what did you say
you are not to speak of this at school do you hear me
utterly unfazed i wont
im going to school now
yoichi walks off
asakawa goes back to the stove but stops after only a few stirs staring off and thinking
caption september th
asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road leaves blowing up in her wake
asakawa mutters to herself deep in thought
theres no way
asakawas car drives past a sign reading asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is less a bed and breakfast and more like a
series of cabin style rental she wanders about for a while trying to get her bearings
she pauses now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her purse
she withdraws the picture from the photomat the one that showed tomoko and her friends with their faces all blurred
the four are posing in front of their cottage marked in the photograph as b
asakawa lowers the photo to regard the cottage before her
she walks to the door turns the handle experimentally
asakawa walks in
asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage
it looks very modern all wood paneling and spacious comfort
her eyes rest on the tv vcr setup at the front of the room
crouching before the vcr now she presses the eject button
she fingers the inside of the deck finds it empty then reaches behind to the rear of the vcr searching
again there is nothing
asakawa presses the power button on the television picks up the remote and takes a seat on the sofa
she runs through a few channels but theyre all talk shows no clues whatsoever
she flicks the tv off and leans back in the sofa sighing
just then she spies a ledger on the coffee table
these things are sometimes left in hotels in japan so that guests can write a few comments about their stay for others to read
asakawa picks the ledger up begins thumbing through it
she stops at a strange picture obviously drawn by a child that shows three rotund almost entirely round personages
she reads the handwritten message
my dad is fat
my mom is fat
thats why im fat too
she smiles in spite of herself
asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger but theres nothing else of any import
she tosses it back onto the coffee table and sighing again leans into the sofa and closes her eyes
asakawa eats silently alone
asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast
as she walks in the door the counter clerk rises out of his chair to greet her
room for one
um actually im here on business
she passes the clerk a picture of tomoko and her three other friends
he stares at it for a moment
they would have stayed here on august th all four of them
if theres any information you might have
uh hang on just a minute
the clerk turns his back to her begins leafing through a guest log
to himself august th
while she waits asakawas eyes start to wander around the room
behind the desk is a sign reading rental video and a large wooden bookshelf filled with videotapes
they are all in their original boxes and she lets her eyes glance over the titles
raiders of the lost ark hours and then suddenly she spies a videotape in a plain unmarked sleeve tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf
she feels the hairs on the back of her neck rise
the clerk looks up
asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf
what tape is that
the clerk reaches out for it grabs it
the clerk pulls the tape out of its sleeve and checks for a label
maybe one of the guests left it behind
asakawa flips on the tv
its on channel and there is nothing but static
she kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a moment framed in the vaguely spectral light from the television screen
steeling her nerves she puts the tape into the machine picks up the remote and presses play
note this next scene is entirely visual
if you are reading this translation before watching the movie do yourself a favor stop reading this now and watch the scene for itself
afterwards you can come back here to check the meaning of the japanese characters displayed
at first it looks like nothing has happened then asakawa realizes that she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static
she watches waiting but the static continues unbroken
asakawa looks down at the remote is about to press fast forward when suddenly the picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking at the
its not the moon at all she realizes
the shape is round like a full moon but it seems to be made up of thin ribbons of cloud streaking against a night sky
and theres a face she sees a face hidden in shadows looking down from above
what is this
the scene changes now and asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of grainy quality one sees in rd or th generation copies
the scene is of a woman brushing her long hair before an oval shaped mirror
the nerve wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the background but the lady doesnt seem to notice
the mirror the lady is using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of the wall before which she stands to the right
almost instantly the mirror returns to its original position but in that one moment in its changed location we see a small figure in a white gown
the woman turns towards where that figure stood and smiles
the screen next becomes a twitching undulating impenetrable sea of the kanji characters used in the japanese language
asakawa can pick out only two things recognizable local volcanic eruption now the screen is awash in people crawling scrabbling shambling masses some of them moving in reverse
a sound like moaning accompanies them
a figure stands upon a shore its face shrouded
it points accusingly not towards the screen but at something unseen off to one side
the insect like screeching sounds louder
close up on inhuman alien looking eye
inside that eye a single character is reflected in reverse sada meaning chastity
the eye blinks once twice
the symbol remains
a long shot of an outdoor uncovered well
sudden loud blinding static as the tape ends
asakawa turns the tv off looking physically drained
she sighs shakily and slumps forward resting on her knees
just then she glances at the television screen
she sees reflected a small figure in a white gown standing at the rear of the room
shocked asakawa draws in breath spins around
the room is empty
asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket and the ringing of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks
zombie like she walks towards the telephone picks it up wordlessly
from the other end comes the same metallic insectoid squeaking heard on the video
asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the clock
its about seven minutes after p
to herself one week
asakawa grabs her coat pops the tape out of the deck and runs out the door
it is dark and raining heavily
yoichi asakawas son is walking to school umbrella firmly in hand
the sidewalk is quite narrow and yoichi comes to a halt when a second person comes from the opposite direction blocking his way
yoichi slowly raises his umbrella peers up to look at this other pedestrian
it is a man a bag slung over one shoulder
he has a beard unusual for japan where clean shaven is the norm
the two continue looking directly at each other neither moving nor speaking
yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his way
the man resumes walking as well
caption september th
the bearded man whose name is ryuji reaches out to press the doorbell but the door has already opened from within
asakawa leans out holding the door open for him
neither of them speaks
wordlessly ryuji enters the apartment
ryuji puts his bag down looks around the apartment
the interior is dark ominous somehow
he takes his jacket off and wanders into the living room
asakawa is in the kitchen behind him preparing tea
ryuji spies the collection of framed photographs in living room
yoichis in elementary school already is he
his first year
what about you ryuji
how have you been recently
same as always
she takes a seat next to him serves the tea
on the coffee table before them is a videotape in a plain unmarked case
and money is
im teaching at university
ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops grimacing before it is to his lips
he rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache
ryuji shakes it off and quickly regains his composure
you said that the phone rang
so if i watch it too that phone over there he gestures with his mug ryuji contd should ring
ryuji four people have already died
on the same day
flippant well why dont you try calling an exorcist
he takes a sip of his tea
asakawa reaches quickly grabs something from the bookshelf behind her a polaroid camera
she shoves it into ryujis hands then turns to look down at the floor
take my picture
ryuji raises the camera to his eye
turn this way
unmoving hurry up and take it
ryuji snaps off a shot
it comes out the other end and he takes it waits impatiently for an image to appear
when it does all he can do is pass it wordlessly over to asakawa
her face is twisted misshapen
just like the picture of tomoko and her friends
asakawa stares at it horrified
by the time she finally looks up ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the vcr
again the screen is filled with static only to be replaced with what looks like the moon
asakawa slams the polaroid on the coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda
asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain
there is a knock on the glass door behind her
a moment later ryuji slides the door open
asakawa re enters her apartment
well it looks like your phones not ringing
ryuji pops the tape from the deck hands it to asakawa
make me a copy of this will you
id like to do a little research of my own
theres no reason to write us off as dead just yet
he dramatically takes a seat
ryuji contd if theres a video that means that somebody had to make it
theres the guest list from the cottage to look into
and the possibility of someone hacking into the local stations broadcast signals
asakawa pulls a notepad from her purse and begins busily scribbling away
okazaki putters around
caption september th
asakawa sits by herself reviewing the videotape
she is replaying the very last scene an outdoor shot of a well
she stares at it carefully and notices
the tape ends filling the screen with static
a split second afterwards there is a knock on the door and okazaki enters holding a file
asakawa momentarily forgets about the video
handing her the file heres that guest list you wanted
what are you gonna do with this
sorry im working on something personal
some quick shots of a fountain gushing water pigeons flapping away looking agitated
cut to ryuji sitting on a bench
hes deep in thought writing in a notepad
there are multitudes of people about him and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going
a pair of legs attached to a woman in white dress hose and pumps appears heading directly for ryuji
her pace is slow rhythmical and as that pace progresses all other sounds fade into the background so that all we can hear is the clomp clomp as those legs
walk to stand just before ryuji
the pumps are scuffed dirtied with grime
a gust of wind rips by
ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his ears rings the same hollowed multi voiced babbling heard on the videotape
the sound grows stronger
so it was you
you did it
the babbling fades disappears as slowly the worlds normal background sounds return
ryuji looks up but the woman in white is nowhere to be seen
ryuji rides up on a bicycle
he turns the corner towards his apartment and finds asakawa seated on the steps waiting for him
asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong
what happened to you
he enters the building carrying his bicycle
the two walk down the hallway towards the front door to ryujis apartment
he unlocks the door and they enter
ryuji and asakawa enter the living room
so whatd you come up with
i dont think any of the guests on the list brought the tape with them
i couldnt confirm it face to face of course but even over the phone i got the feeling they were all being upfront with me
how about the other angle
pirate signals or
asakawa shakes her head
therere no traces of any illegal television signals being broadcast around izu
she reaches into her purse pulls out a large white envelope
heres that copy of the videotape you wanted
ryuji tears the package open
he squats down on the tatami in frontof his tv and slides the tape in
asakawa sits on the tatami as well but positions herself away from the tv and keeps her eyes averted
ryuji glares over his shoulder at her
she reluctantly scoots closer looks up at the screen
ryuji fast forwards the tape a bit stopping at the scene where the woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror
he puts the video on frame by frame
have you ever seen this woman
asakawa regards the screen intently
the tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes positions
when it does we can again see the small figure in the white gown a figure with long black hair
when ryuji sees this his body stiffens becomes tense
asakawa notices but says nothing
she also notices something else
excitedly theres something strange about this shot
she takes the remote from ryuji rewinds it a ways
onscreen the woman begins coming her long hair again
from this angle the mirror should be reflecting whoevers filming
so what does that mean
asakawa lets out a short sigh
well if the person who made this is a pro thered be a way around that i guess but still
the screen changes showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters again
reading volcanic eruption
he pauses the screen trying to make sense of what is written
this is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular tv screen dont you think
they are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes the sound of someone opening the front door
ryuji turns off the tv ejects the tape from the deck
come on in
asakawa flashes a look at ryuji and then turns her head back towards the front door to see who has entered
a cute nervous looking young girl with short hair approaches slowly
she is carrying a plastic bag filled with groceries
asakawa meet my student takano mai
he turns addresses mai
ryuji contd this is asakawa my ex wife
ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away
nice to meet you
as you may already be aware japanese name order is the opposite of englishs and even close friends may continue to address one another by their last names
incidentally asakawas first name is reiko
in this scene mai deferentially refers to ryuji as sensei meaning teacher
mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after ryuji
he is putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave
sensei the people from the publishing company called about the deadline on your thesis again
brusquely whatre they talkin to you about it for
because they can never get a hold of you
ryuji picks up his keys video firmly in hand
ask them to wait another week
sensei ask them yourself please
ryuji is already headed for the door
his back is to her as he responds
asakawa walks after him
mai pouts unhappily a bit and then breaks into a smile as an idea crosses her mind
she walks across the room to where ryuji has set up a large blackboard filled with mathematical equations
grinning mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a new value
asakawa and ryuji stride purposefully
they stop before a door to the right which asakawa unlocks
they both walk in
asakawa and ryuji sit in a completely darkened room their eyes glued to the television monitor
they are again watching the scene with the fragmented kanji characters but despite their efforts have been able to identify only one additional word bringing the total to three volcanic
eruption local residents this is impossible
ryuji fast forwards stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected inside an alien looking eye
he reads the kanji aloud
ryuji moves to make a note of this notices the time
is yoichi gonna be all right
sadly hes used to it
ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen
whoever made this had to have left some kind of clue behind
theyre probably waiting for us to find it
asakawa turns a dial to bring up the volume which up until now has been on mute
the room is filled with an eerie metallic grating and asakawa spins the dial again shutting it off
just as she does ryujis eyes widen
wait a minute
he turns the dial again punches a few buttons as if searching for something
he listens carefully and when he hears that strange something again he stops looks at the screen
it is paused at the scene with the figure pointing a cloth draped over its head
the figure now looks oddly like a messenger
ryuji and asakawa exchange glances
this could be it
ryuji flips some more switches setting the sound for super slow mo
what follows is a strange labored sort of speech a hidden message framed in the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion
shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou
boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu
repeating shoumon bakkari boukon ga kuru zo
did you hear that too
ryuji is already writing it down excitedly
what does that mean
ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad folds it and tucks it into his shirt pocket
im gonna check it out
yoichi is walking to school
he looks back over his shoulder just once then resumes walking
all the lights are turned off and she is sitting on the living room couch watching the footage of her cafe interview with the junior high school girls
caption september th
just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call asakawas own phone rings startling her
she runs to answer it
ive got it
its a dialect just like i thought
shoumon means playing in the water and boukon means monster
translated from standard japanese the phrase from the videotape would initially have sounded like if only shoumon then the boukon will come
these two capitalized words later identified to be dialectical were at the time completely incomprehensible to ryuji and asakawa
dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in japan to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to understand one another
the phrase on the tape can now be rendered if you keep playing in the water the monster will come for you
but dialect from where
and the site of our eruption is mt
ryuji and asakawa are seated at cubicles looking through bound archives of old newspaper articles
asakawa sneaks a look at ryuji stands up and walks off a little ways
she has already pulled out her cell phone
whispering on phone yoichi
im gonna be a little late tonight honey
ryuji looks over his shoulder at her scowls
you can do it yourself right
she hangs up returns to her seat at the cubicle
she resumes her scanning of the newspaper articles and ryuji shoots her another scowl
asakawa turns a page and then stops frowning
she has spied an article that looks like
nervously asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together forming the shape of a rectangle
or a screen
she places the rectangle over the article she has just discovered its headlines reading mount mihara erupts local residents urged to take precautions ryuji notices her leans forward excitedly
ive got it
this old article
the two scan the remainder of the page and find a smaller related article
did local girl predict eruption
a young lady from sashikiji prefecture
the two read over both articles absorbing the details
ryuji stands suddenly gathering his things
what are you doing
has your newspaper got someone out there at oshima
i think so
there should be a correspondent out there
i need you to find out and let me know how to get hold of him
he begins walking briskly away
asakawa chases after him
what do you think youre
angrily youve only got four days left asakawa
your newspaper contact and i can handle this from here on out
you just stay with yoichi
ryuji strides off
asakawa stands motionless
a car speeds along
cut to a gravel driveway leading up to a wooden traditional style house
kouichi asakawas father is standing before the entrance and puttering around in his garden
the car from the previous shot drives up comes to a halt
the passenger door opens and yoichi hops out running towards the old man
asakawa walks leisurely after her son
so you made it huh
caption september th
yoichi says hes looking forward to doing some fishing with you
is that so
yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm
cmon grandpa lets go
well get our things together and then we can go
asakawa stands on a riverbank while her father and yoichi gumboots on are ankle deep in a shallow river
yoichi holds a small net and asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly
there he is
cmon there he is dont let him go
yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out
guess he got away huh
that was your fault grandpa
asakawas father laughs
well whaddya say we try again
he begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream yoichi in tow
well get im this time
asakawa looks away pensive
yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats
a television looms inone corner of the living room but it is switched off
the sliding doors to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see futons set out ready for bed
asakawa enters the living room and seeing yoichi scoops him up in her arms and carries him over to the guest room
sleepily how was work mommy
asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off
asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase telephone receiver in hand
the phone rests on a small stand by the staircase
your oshima contact came through
it looks like the woman who predicted the mihara eruption is the same woman from the video
ryuji is crouched in front of the tv remote in hand
the screen is paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair
her name is yamamura shizuko
she committed suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into mt
have you got anything else
im gonna have to check it for myself
ill be leaving for oshima tomorrow morning
ive only got three days left
and ive got four
ill be in touch
ryuji hangs up
asakawa deep in thought slowly places the phone back in its cradle
she turns around to walk back down the hallway only to find her father standing there face full of concern
asakawa shakes her head
i just had some things left over from work
she walks past her father who glances worriedly after her over his shoulder
the lights are all off and asakawa is asleep in her futon
her eyes suddenly fly open as a voice sounding eerily like her deceased niece tomoko calls out to her
asakawa looks around the room gets her bearings
her eyes fall on the futon next to hers
there is a body in that futon but it is full grown dressed all in black
it is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned away
suddenly the image from the video of the figure with its face shrouded springs to asakawas mind
just an instant its pointing visage materializes and then disappears
it reappears a moment later pointing more insistently now and disappears again
asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is empty
yoichi is nowhere to be seen
just then she hears that high pitched metallic squeaking from the video
eyes wide with horror she flings the sliding doors apart and there seated before the television is yoichi
he is watching the video
it is already at the very last scene the shot of the outdoor well
closeup on the screen now and for just an instant we can see that something is trying to claw its way out of the well
the video cuts off and the screen fills with static
shrieking asakawa races over to yoichi covers his eyes though it is already too late
she scoots over to the vcr ejects the tape and stares at it uncomprehendingly
she is then at yoichis side again shaking him roughly
you brought this with you didnt you
asakawa freezes her eyes wide
tomo chan told me to watch it
waves are being kicked up by a large passenger ship as it speeds on its way
cut to asakawa and ryuji standing on deck looking out over the waves
i shouldve been more careful
when i was at your place that day i could feel something there
i thought it was just because of the video
you mean that tomoko thats not tomoko
he can see them too cant he
ryuji nods his head lowers it sadly
its all my fault
first tomoko died then those three others
it should have stopped there but it didnt
because of me
asakawa turns to ryuji suddenly
how did the rumors about the video even start in the first place
this kind of thing
it doesnt start by one person telling a story
its more like everyones fear just takes on a life of its own
or maybe its not fear at all
maybe its what we were secretly hoping for all along
the ship has docked its gangplank extended
ryuji and asakawa walk the length of the gangplank towards the shore
a man named mr
hayatsu is already waiting for them
he holds up a white signboard in both hands
you must be tired after your long trip
please this way
hayatsu leads asakawa and ryuji to an awaiting minivan
caption september th
ryuji and asakawa sit in the back
hayatsu is behind the wheel chattering away
back in the old days the yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in sashikiji though they dont much anymore
you know one of shizukos cousins is still alive
hes just an old man now
his son and his daughter in law run an old fashioned inn
i went ahead and booked reservations for yall hope thats alright
asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply after which the minivan lapses into silence
asakawa looks dreamily out at the mountain studded landscape then suddenly snaps to
to ryuji why did yamamura shizuko commit suicide
she was taking a real beating in the press being called a fraud and all sorts of names
after a while she just lost it
cut to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road
shizuko was getting a lot of attention around the island after predicting the eruption of mt
seems that for some time shed had a rather unique ability precognition
it was around then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may have heard of ikuma heihachiro
he was driven out of the university wasnt he
this professor ikuma convinces shizuko to go to tokyo with him where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant to prove the existence of esp
at first shes the darling of the press but the next thing you know theyre knocking her down calling her a fraud
forty years later the media still hasnt changed that much
asakawa continues ignoring ryujis barb
ive heard this story
im sure i remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations
a strange look crosses ryujis face
he looks away ignores her for a moment
after getting kicked out of university ikuma just vanished and no ones been able to get hold of him since
hes probably not even alive anymore
but why even try looking for him
because hes supposed to have had a child with shizuko
in her mind she sees a small figure dressed in white its face hidden by long black hair
it is the figure from the video
hayatsu leads asakawa and ryuji to the entrance
the inkeeper a middle aged lady named kazue wearing a traditional kimono comes shuffling up
she addresses mr
she turns to asakawa and ryuji
kazue contd welcome
well ill be off then
he gives a little bow and is off
kazue meanwhile has produced two pairs of slippers which she offers to ryuji and asakawa
ryuji and asakawa begin removing their shoes
kazue leads ryuji and asakawa up a shadowed wooden staircase
and for your rooms how shall we
kazue gives a little bow
kazue turns to the right
almost immediately after reaching the top of the steps however a strange look crosses ryujis face
he heads down the opposite end of the corridor asakawa close behind
ryuji flings open the sliding door to one of the older rooms
there hanging from one of the walls is the oval shaped mirror from the video the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair
ryuji stares at the mirror almost wincing
he turns around as if to look at asakawa but continues turning looks past her
asakawa follows his gaze as does kazue
standing at the end of the corridor is an old man mr
yamamura regards them silently balefully
breaking the silence kazue gestures for asakawa and ryuji to follow
softly please this way
asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man
he keeps his back turned towards her
if you could just answer a few questions about shizuko
i got nuthin to say
its about shizukos daughter
the old man says nothing
she did have a daughter didnt she
yamamura regards her for a moment then turns to walk away
youre wasting your time
the table is laid out with an elaborate looking dinner
asakawa sits alone knees curled up to her chin eyes wide and frightened
she is whimpering softly to herself
just then the door slides open and ryuji walks in
he sits at the table and picks up a pair of chopsticks
arent you gonna eat
youll stay with me wont you
when its time for me to die
oh stop it
asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table grabs ryuji fiercely by the arm
youll stay wont you
if you stayed maybe youd learn something that could help yoichi i said stop it
have you forgotten there was a girl with tomoko when she died
that girls now in a mental institution
who knows what could happen
but you could stay with me ryuji
youd be ok
angrily why because im already not right in the head
asakawa releases her hold on ryujis arm lowers her head
ryuji slams his chopsticks down angrily
if thats the case why not just let things run its course get rid of father and son
yoichi was a mistake anyway
when ryuji speaks up again his voice is soft reassuring
we still have two days left
just then the voice of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from the other side of the sliding door
kazue slides the door open
she stands hesitantly in the doorway something tucked under one arm
its about miss shizuko
ryuji shoots a glance at asakawa and stands up from the table walks towards the innkeeper
this is all that there is
kazue produces an old black and white photograph
the photo shows a woman seated dressed in a kimono
a man in a western style suit stands beside her
is this professor ikuma
hearing this asakawa leaps up walks over to examine the picture for herself
this picture is from before id entered the household
she pauses a moment
kazue contd i should go now
the innkeeper scuttles off leaving asakawa and ryuji alone with the photograph
unbidden the voice from the video enters their thoughts
boukon ga kuru zo
asakawa watches ryuji stride down the shore
caption september th
ryuji strolls up to find old man yamamura sitting alone staring out at the sea
yamamura glances up to see ryuji approaching
ryuji takes a seat next to the old man but its yamamura who speaks first
the deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his accent
yalld do best to be off soon
seas probably gonna be rough tonight
what kind of a child was shizuko
shed come out here by herself everday an just stare out at the ocean
the fishermen all took a dislikin to her
oceans an unlucky place for us ysee every year it swallows up more of our own
you keep starin out at somethin ike that
shoumon bakkari shiteru to boukon ga kuru zo
if you keep playing in the water the monster will come for you
yamamura looks at ryuji surprised
shizuko could see inside people couldnt she
down to the places theyd most like to keep hidden
it must have been difficult for her
yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet features twisted angrily
ryuji stands takes hold of yamamuras arm
ive got a little of that ability myself
it was you who spread the word about shizuko wasnt it
and you who first contacted professor ikuma
you thought youd be able to make some money off her
you even got some from one of the newspapers
leave me the hell alone
yamamura strides angrily off
both ryuji and asakawa take pursuit ryuji calling out from behind yamamuras back
tell us about shizukos daughter
who was she
i dont know
she was there with shizuko
she had to be
yamamuras pace which has become increasingly erratic finally causes him to stumble and fall
ryuji comes up behind him grasping him firmly
at their touch ryujis power awakens and as he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding the setting is a large meeting hall
a number of people are seated in folding chairs before a stage on which are a four men in business suits and a woman in a kimono
a banner hangs above the stage which reads public demonstration on the existence of clairvoyance
ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing shizukos demonstration before the press
he also realizes to yamamura you were there
yamamura shizuko the woman in the kimono is sitting at a table onstage
her face is calm and expressionless
standing off to one side and peering from behind the curtains is a young mr
you stood there and watched the demonstration
cut back to the beach
asakawa comes running up toward ryuji and the prone mr
suddenly there is another asakawa her eyes wide finds herself inside the scene reliving it as if she had actually been there
she watches as shizuko receives a sealed clay pot in both hands
shizuko regards the pot a moment and then places it gently on the table before her
she takes a calligraphy stylus from the table begins writing on a thin rectangular sheet of rice paper
the members of the press talk excitedly craning their necks for a better look
onstage a judge holds up the phrase written by shizuko and the folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot
the phrase on both sheets is identical
cameras begin flashing excitedly
shizukos features melt into a soft smile
the experiment is performed again and again the phrase written by shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper
again and again shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see the unseen
finally a bearded reporter explodes from his chair begins striding angrily towards the stage
this is nothing but trickery and the lowest form of trickery at that
the reporter stops at the foot of the stage points his finger accusingly at shizuko
what are you trying to pull woman
a second reporter sitting in the front row also rises to his feet
professor ikuma youre being fooled
by now most of the press has risen from their chairs pointing and shouting angrily
onstage shizuko backs away eyes wide and frightened
she covers both ears trying to block out the increasing din
professor ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders
the first reporter is still shouting angrily his voice rising above the others
suddenly a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to the floor
the crowd and asakawa as well see that the reporters face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear
to shizuko witch
professor ikuma begins leading shizuko offstage
they stop as someone unseen steps up blocking their passage
shizukos eyes widen her head shaking in disbelief
was it you
cut to ryuji on the beach
he looks up excitedly
he recalls the image from the video the alien eye with the single character sada reflected in reverse
the majority of girls names in japanese end in either mi beauty or ko child
thus sadako means chaste child
sadako is of course the mysterious daughter of shizuko and professor ikuma
sadako killed him
she can kill just with a thought
a devil spawn
cut back to the demonstration hall
sadako her face completely hidden by her long hair runs offstage
and heads directly for asakawa
asakawa instinctively raises her arm and sadako grasps it fiercely
all the nails on sadako hand are stripped away her fingers are raw bloody stumps
cut back to the beach
asakawa still caught in the throes of the vision has begun to swoon
finally her legs give out and she crumples to the beach
ryuji grabs hold of her supportively
he glances down at her wrist sees an ugly purple bruise already beginning to form
the bruise is in the shape of five long spindly fingers
yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position and together the three watch the approach of ominous dark storm clouds
asakawa is on the phone her voice almost frantic
after yamamura shizuko committed suicide professor ikuma took the daughter and ran
no no one knows where they went
thats why i need you to find out where they are
even if the professors dead sadako should still be in her forties
ill explain it all later but right now just hurry
asakawa slams the phone down
pan to show ryuji slumped in one corner of the room his back to the wall
sadakos probably already dead
she could kill people with just a thought remember
her mother wasnt even close to that
flustered well what about that video
if sadakos dead then who made it
nobody made it
it wasnt made at all
is the pure physical manifestation of sadakos hatred
ryuji turns to regard asakawa his eyes blank
weve been cursed
there is a moment of silence before mr
hayatsu slides the door open almost falling into the room
he is out of breath and speaks rapidly
its no good
with the typhoon coming in all ships are temporarily staying docked
what about the fishing boats
tell their captains ill pay
sir without knowing whether this typhoon is going to hit us or not i think itd be better to wait and see how things turn ryuji interrupts him slamming both
palms on the table
glasses rattle wildly
ill try searching myself
ryuji stands and races past mr
hayatsu out into the rain
hayatsu takes pursuit calling after him
asakawa left alone stares down at the tatami mats
white capped waves roll angrily in a black sea
asakawa sits at a table alone her hands clasped as if in prayer
her eyes are wide and glassy
the phone rings suddenly and asakawa dives for it wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time
i tried but i couldnt come up with any leads at all
a look of abject fear crosses asakawas face
she begins retreating into herself
softly thank you
asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle
almost immediately her face begins to crumple
she falls to her knees sobbing into the floor
she cries a while longer but suddenly stops
her face eyes streaked with tears shoots suddenly up stares directly at the telephone
asakawa stands looking down on the wharf scanning
several fishing boats are docked
the wind whips her hair crazily around
she continues scanning and suddenly she spies calling ryuji
asakawa runs down onto the wharf heading towards ryuji
he is in mid conversation with mr
the phone in my apartment never rang
it only ever rang at the rental cottage
professor ikuma mustve
and weve got no way of going back
its too dangerous
the thought of anybody going out in this weather
the three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their situation
suddenly a deep voice booms from behind them
ill take you out
the three spin around to see mr
yamamura his robes flapping in the gusty night air
he begins walking towards them
sadako is callin yall reckon
mayhap to drag you down under the water
ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at asakawa turns back to face mr
take us out
a tiny fishing boat is tossed about on the waves
yamamura stands at the wheel his face expressionless
ryuji and asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin
asakawas expression is dreamy faraway
im not afraid at all
ryuji leans over rubs her hand comfortingly
suddenly he switches back into analytical mode
sadako probably died back out there at izu before the rental cottages were ever built
so sadako was professor ikumas daughter
nodding ikuma smuggled her out in secret
his relationship with shizuko was already a scandal and one of the reasons he got drummed out of the university
weve gotta find sadakos body
excitedly is that going to break the curse
will yoichi be all right
its all weve got left to try
just one more day
ryuji puts his arm around asakawa
ryuji stands on deck looking out over the water
he heads down below toward the captains area
yamamura is at the wheel
we made it
maybe sadako doesnt have it out for us after all
long pause as mr
yamamura says nothing
she used to speak to the ocean just ramble away
one time i hid listenin to one of her conversations
yamamura pauses again
yamamura contd and it werent in no human language
asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise
caption september th
ryuji races out of the store loaded down with supplies
he holds a pair of buckets in one hand and a crowbar and shovel in the other
a length of rope is coiled over his left shoulder
he runs towards a rental car passing by asakawa who stands at a payphone receiver in hand
i just called to say ill be coming home tomorrow
ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder
im tired of it here mom
i wanna go back to school
smiling yoichi its rude to your grandpa to talk like that
you wanna talk to him
asakawa pauses her voice hitching
she seems about to lose her composure
im sorry yoichi
ill see you tomorrow
asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears
mommys got something she has to do
say hello to grandpa for me ok
ryuji stands by the car scowling over at asakawa
he shuts the door just short of a slam
cut to asakawa hanging up the phone
she half runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side staring blankly into space
ryuji slides into the drivers seat buckles his what time was it when you first watched the video
asakawa glances at her watch
seven or eight minutes past seven
no more than ten minutes past
if the rumors are true that time is gonna be our deadline
asakawa buckles up as ryuji steps on the gas
asakawa sits in the passenger side
her face is almost angelic with the faintest hint of a smile
ryuji shoots a questioning look at her
the white rental car tears past the sign reading izu pacific land
the car continues into the lot screeching around corners before coming to an abrupt halt
asakawa her face still oddly expressionless gets out of the passenger side
ryuji exits as well the hint of a shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins
cut to asakawa and ryuji walking up the gravel path towards the rental cabins
ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and asakawa stop before cabin b
the cabin is on stilts its underbelly fenced off by wooden laticework
ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground but keeps hold of the pick
he raises the pick over one shoulder and begins smashing away at the latticework
when he has cleared enough space for passage he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within
when finished he holds a hand out for asakawa
the two enter the earthen basement
ryuji pulls a flashlight out flicks it on
the beam arcs outwards illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern rental cottage
the beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old stone well
the well is badly chipped on one side and sealed off with a solid looking stone lid
ryuji rushes quickly towards it
i knew it
he squats down beside the well setting the flashlight on the lid
asakawa sinks slowly down beside him
ryuji reaches out and takes asakawas hand
he sets their enclasped hands onto the lid and together they begin lightly tracing the surface of the lid with their free hands
asakawa closes her eyes in concentration
and suddenly as with the incident on the beach asakawa finds herself drawn into ryujis psychometric vision
the picture is black and white grainy like old film
a young girl in a white gown walks slowly towards an open well
she places her hand on the lip of the well peers curiously down
asakawa looks up her eyes wide open
there is now a second person in the vision an elderly man in an old fashioned tweed suit standing behind the young girl
he suddenly produces some bladed object and strikes the girl savagely across the back of the head
the girl falls forward
the man drops to the ground grabbing the girl behind the knees and hoisting her limp body over the lip and into the well
the body falls into its depths
panting heavily the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well with both hands looking down
he flashes a guilty look in either direction checking that his crime has gone unnoticed and as he does so asakawa realizes that she knows this face
the image from the videotape like a face in the moon it had been sadako inside the well looking up to see this man staring back down at her
this man whose name is professor ikuma heihachiro
her own father
the energy seems to drain out of asakawa in a rush and her body crumbles
ryuji catches hold of her
it was ikuma who put this lid on
and sadakos still inside
ryuji stands quickly takes hold of the crowbar
he inserts it under the lid and begins trying to pry it off face scrunched with effort
asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well
slowly the lid begins to move
ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two lean the combined weight of their bodies into it
the lid slides off dropping to the earth with a dull thud
ryuji sits to one side winded with effort as asakawa takes hold of the flashlight
she shines it down into the well but it only seems to intensify the gloom
what water she can see looks fetid and brackish
ryuji sees her expression and begins removing his jacket
he walks off leaving asakawa alone
cut to an overhead shot of the well
a rope is fastened to one side and ryuji has already begun lowering himself down
his eyes wander overthe grime smeared walls and with a shudder he begins to pick out human fingernails
torn loose and spattered with blood countless fingernails line the sides of the well
sadako was alive
shed tried to climb her way out
ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing sadakosterrible agony
he waits a moment longer before edging his way down the rope again finally splashing to rest at the bottom of the well
he holds his flashlight above the brackish water calls up to asakawa
lower the buckets
asakawa nods and lowers two plastic buckets fastened to a rope
ryuji grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water tugging on the rope when finished
take it up
asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well
she walks a small distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground
she happens to glance through the wooden lattice to the outside and with a start realizes that the sun has already started to set
a nervous glance at her watch later and she is back at the well lowering the empty bucket to find another full one already awaiting her
take it up
in the well ryuji glances at his watch
he looks at it for a long moment the expression on his face saying were not going to make it
time passes as asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload her strength beginning to fade
she half stumbles glances up
and is shocked to realize that night has fallen
cut to asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket her strength almost gone
she looks at her watch and sees that it is now past
she calls frantically down to ryuji
its already six
explosively i know
hurry up and take it up
the bucket slowly jerks into motion
asakawa pulls it up to the rim of the well holds it unsteadily
she takes one faltering step and falls spilling the buckets contents onto the ground
cut to ryuji in the well standing ready with another bucketful
take it up
the bucket begins moving even slower than before
cut to asakawa her body trembling with effort
by now its all she can do to simply keep her body moving
she glances behind her sees through the wooden lattice that it is now pitch black
a look of resignation crosses her face and she releases her hold on the bucket her body crumpling and falling in on itself
cut to the bucket splashing back into the well narrowly missing ryuji
fuming what the hell are you doing
trying to get me killed
cut back to asakawa her face dead
ryuji calls out from the well
asakawa falls backward onto the ground arms splayed
cut to the rim of the well
ryuji pulls himself up over the rim catches sight of asakawa
she lifts her head up but says nothing as ryuji walks over to her
youre in no condition to keep this up
asakawa suddenly springs into life
her voice is frantic fearful
who do you expect to pull up these buckets then
but we dont even know if its doing any good
ryuji strides forward and slaps asakawa painfully across the cheek
he begins shaking her roughly for good measure
and what about yoichi huh
is his mother not coming to pick him up after all
he releases his hold on her
the two stare at each other a long time saying nothing
cut to an overhead shot of asakawa being lowered into the well
cut now to asakawa inside the well her face and clothes covered with grime body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright
unable to resist the impulse asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder and down into the well
the dankness the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic
dont look down
she returns her gaze cranes her neck upward
cut to ryuji leaning over the rim of the well peering down at her
for an instant everything becomes monochrome
its not ryuji looking down at her at all its professor ikuma checking to see if shes still alive or if the blow to the back of her head has
finished her off
cut to asakawa her eyes wide with fright
asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well
a flashlight hangs from another rope but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness
asakawa crouches forward hands moving searchingly through the water
she calls out pleadingly
where are you
please come out
asakawa straightens unties herself from the rope
a full bucket already awaits
she tugs on the rope and ryuji pulls it up
she scoops up a second bucket but something stops her from sending it up
instead she begins running her arms through the water again her voice close to tears
where are you
asakawa continues her blind fumbling which sends up little splashes of stagnant water
with a start she realizes that her fingers have caught something
asakawa draws her hands close for a better look
and sees that is hair
a thick clump of long black hair
suddenly a pale thin arm shoots out from beneath the water catching asakawa just below the wrist
asakawas ears are filled with a sound like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber
it is a girl her face completely hidden by long black hair
cut to a shot of asakawas face
far from being frightened her features are oddly placid
she regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look
asakawa reaches out lightly strokes that long hair
she strokes the hair again and abruptly it peels right off the head with a loud squelch
revealed is not a face at all but a skull
its sockets are at first menacingly empty but then begin to ooze the green sludge it has pulled up from the bottom of the well
like a mother comforting a frightened child asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast strokes the bony head comfortingly
her eyes begin to glaze
cut to ryuji racing up to the rim of the well leaning down intently
its already minutes past seven
we did it
down in the well asakawa continues staring blankly ahead
her body suddenly falls forward limp
three police cars are parked outside the rental cottages crimson headlights flashing
a few cops walk by two of them carrying something off in white plastic bags
cut to ryuji and asakawa sitting on the curb
asakawa is staring off at something a blanket draped over her shoulder
why would ikuma have killed her
his own daughter
maybe she wasnt his daughter at all
maybe her father
wasnt even human
the two exchange glances
ryujis gaze falls to asakawas wrist which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face
the ugly bruise where sadako had grabbed her has disappeared
he shakes his head clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal
ill take you home
ryuji stands pulls asakawa to her feet
ryujis white car pulls up into the parking lot
he and asakawa get out regard each other from opposite sides of the car
there is a long moment where neither of them says anything
get some rest
he flashes her the slightest of grins
ryuji contd i still have a thesis to finish
cut to a shot of ryuji and asakawa the car creating an almost metaphoric distance between them
ryuji nods silently by way of reply
he gets into his car and drives off
asakawa watches him go and then walks towards the entrance of her apartment
asakawa walks into her room sits on the edge of her bed
it is now morning and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up
ryuji sits busily scribbling into a notebook
he stops writing a moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of coffee
he glances over at his blackboard for confirmation when a small scowl crosses his brow
its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly to himself
ryuji stands walks over to the blackboard
he fixes mais little prank with a single chalk stroke
asakawa emerges taking in the dawn
at first her face is calm and tranquil
but her features change as the sun almost noticeably darkens and a wind begins to kick up her hair
she now looks very anxious

note this next scene is entirely visual
if you are reading this translation before watching the movie do yourself a favor stop reading this now and watch the scene for itself
ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again
his hand suddenly ceases eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint
breath rattling fearfully in his throat ryuji spins around to face the television set
he gets out of his seat for a better look falling to his knees on the tatami
the image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape the shot of the well
the sound from before comes louder now more insistent a metallic screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer
ryuji crawls on all fours towards the screen stares at its unchanging image with terrible foreboding
there is a flash of motion as something shoots out of the well
first one and then another as sadako still in her grimy white dress face hidden beneath long oily strands of hair begins slowly pulling herself out
the television screen jumps unsteadily fills with static as if barely able to contain her image
cut back and forth between ryuji who is beginning to visibly panic and the television which shows sadako lurching ever closer
almost frantic why
the telephone rings and ryuji spins round towards it breath catching in his throat
he looks at the phone over his shoulder at the television back to the phone
ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone
he takes the receiver but is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn inexorably back to the television
sadakos shrouded face has filled the entire screen
and then television popping and crackling she jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of ryujis apartment
ryuji backs away screaming in terror
sadako lies prone collapsed hair splayed out like a drowned corpse
only her fingers are active crawling feeling
the tips of her fingers are little more than bloodied stumps not a single fingernail on them
she uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself forward coming jerkily to her feet
the joints of her body twist unnaturally more insect like than human
ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment as if looking for cover
the strength has already begun to fade from his body however and his movements are clumsy exaggerated
he falls to the floor panting heavily
sadako turns to regard him and for just an instant we can see beneath her impenetrable shroud of hair a single eye burns with manic unbridled hatred
its gaze meets ryujis and his face twists into a grimace as he screams loudly
yoichi sits on the lawn doodling into a large sketchpad
he suddenly stops eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers death
asakawa clutches the receiver to her ear
she can still hear the sounds of metallic screeching coming from the video though they are now becoming softer
asakawa comes running down a side street turning the corner and making for the entrance to ryujis apartment building
there is a single guard posted at the entrance
he reaches out catches asakawa lightly by the arm
are you a resident here maam
im takayama ryujis wife
the guard drops his hand and asakawa makes for the entrance
im sorry maam but theyve already taken the body away
asakawas spins around eyes wide
mai is there slumped against one wall
asakawa comes running up dropping to her knees and grasping mai by the shoulders
mai shakes her head dreamily
when i got here he was just lying there
did he say anything to you
about a videotape
mai shakes her head again shakes it harder until the breath catches in her throat
mai falls into silence curls up on herself
asakawa leaves her and crosses toward the door to ryujis apartment
the front door opens wildly noisily forward
asakawa comes rushing in eyes darting about the apartment
she thinks frantically to herself
does this mean that yoichi will die too
is the curse not broken yet
her gaze falls to the television set
she dives forward presses the eject button on the vcr
sure enough the tape is still in the deck
she takes the tape and leaves
asakawa walks slowly dreamily forward
she drops the videotape loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a chair
her eyes fall to the framed photographs of yoichi on one of the shelves
this snaps asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering intently to herself thinking
i was the only one to break sadakos curse
something i did that you didnt
something i did that you didnt
asakawa gives up lowers her face into her hands
when she looks up again she happens to glance at the television screen and its glare reveals that there is someone else in the room with her
it is the figure from the videotape the silent accuser with the cloth draped over its face
with a start asakawa realizes that the figure is wearing ryujis clothes
she spins around but the room is empty
asakawas mind races
the figure had been pointing towards her bag
she stands rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape
she takes ryujis copy in her other hand her eyes darting between the two tapes
something i did that you didnt
it suddenly clicks home as asakawa looks full on at ryujis version of the tape plainly marked copy
what broke the curse was that i copied the tape and showed it to someone else
cut to asakawa slowly pulling her vcr from the television stand
a look of almost frightening resolve etches her face
arial shot of asakawas car
we hear her voice on the cell phone
im on my way over
look dad ive got something to ask
its for yoichi
closeup on the vcr in the passenger side
cut to asakawa at the wheel as time spirals forward the decisions of the present already become rumor of the future
they say theres a way you can stay alive after you watch the video
youve gotta make a copy of it and show it to somebody else inside a week
but what about the person you show it to
well then they make a copy and show it to somebody else
again inside a week
laughing then theres no end to it
thats just it
there is no end
but if it meant not dying
youd do it wouldnt you
asakawas eyes begin to well
her car speeds along the highway to the direction of menacing looking storm clouds
