mission impossible shooting draft by robert towne by robert towne revised
is being carried by a world weary middle european wearing a black armband
vladimir nekhorvich exits a gleaming building pausing for a moment under a motto clearly visible above his head where the future is now he checks the time
set in countdown mode
its at hours forty seven minutes and sixteen seconds and dropping
children are singing ring a ring a rosy a pocketful of posy a tissue a tissue we all fall down
nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent natural history museum
they are moving in and around an odd freeform sculpture
a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children almost like mirrors in a fun house
wipes his eyes a horn honks
he looks toward the sound
on the belt that takes it thru x ray
on the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles personal items books a battleship gray digital camera and in a small plastic container
a small square shiny object hi tech and at odds with the other items
she pulls out an urn shaped vessel
whats this then
handing her documents the ashes of a colleague im taking them to his family
if you wish to open it please be careful
on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight point of departure in sydney continuously updating distance direction and time to its ultimate destination atlanta georgia
folks were a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in atlanta but if you look out your windows on either side of the aircraft well soon be
crossing the southern section of the rocky mountains a range which includes more than peaks rising above feet
the chains loftiest point mount elbert at feet should be coming into view as we pass over central colorado shortly
seems intent on the map its changing times and distance
he checks his watch the countdown has gone from to three hours and minutes as nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending seconds whipping by
ethan hunt sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat beside nekhorvich
you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it doctor
i suppose i am a bit anxious
theyre ready and waiting
youll soon be with old friends
meaning ethan im with an old friend now dmitri
sorry it couldnt be under happier circumstances
yes im sorry too
youre sorry and im sorry
bemused laughter then looks at ethan you do know gradski thought the world of you
nekhorvich is overcome
ethan puts a comforting hand on his shoulder he was quite a man
did he know before the end you two had succeeded
yes he knew
not in time to save him
after youve lived with chimera for twenty hours nothing can save you
nekhorvich pats the satchel
you carry them together
with an almost impish grin and a wink yes and youll get us to a safe place with them thank god
left to my own devices im an old fart too inept to read a railroad timetable
good natured laughter
cut off by a flight steward who passes by giving a sidelong silence in ethan and nekhorvichs direction
oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling
passengers are puzzled and alarmed
you captain again
weve experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure
a passenger struggling with his mask
as nekhorvich fumbles with the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows their altitude is below feet and dropping
he checks the countdown time on his watch again
nekhorvich looks around him
the flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out
the flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks
into radio pan pan pan denver center
this is trans pac flight two two zero seven heavy
we are not reading you
were unable to maintain cabin pressurization
we have initiated a descent to one six thousand
the co pilot is working on the planes altitude when his hands slip off the controls
his eyes flutter then captain i dont
he passes out
the captain hugh stamp turns to verify that the relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls
he then removes his oxygen mask sets the auto pilot inputting numbers to slow the plane and descend
as the craft titles downward
the flight attendants are pulling on jump suits
stamp emerges from the cockpit
nekhorvich beckons to him
grinning around nekhorvich conspiratorially it seems we have a problem dmitri
in the same tone you keep calling me dmitri
you really shouldnt
nekhorvichs eyes narrow
youre not dmitri
with a lightning swift move ethan breaks nekhorvichs neck
he grabs the satchel
ethan contd to wallis wallis hold onto it
wallis slashes the satchel handle open takes the satchel for ambrose
he peels off the latex mask revealing sean ambrose
ethan contd ulrich pull the he tears off the vocal oscillator at his adams apple clears his throat now as ambrose pull the no tank and dump it its potential
the captain into shot all done chief
what else right kidding dont go too far ahead of me now not possible
ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane
stamp pulls back the panel hops into the compartment below which is four walls of electronic equipment
stamp kneels and slides back the floor hatch
the wind howls puffs of cloud zip by beneath them
as they descend into the belly checkpoint charlie plus altitude minus two zero thousand
airspeed one seven niner knots
its that time
they don goggles and with ambrose in the lead the team leaps one after another from the hatch sailing off into the sky
an automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone terrain terrain
pull up pull up
the co pilot stirs
he blearily rouses himself just in time to see a mountain rushing toward him
as mountain meets airplane the frame is filled with fire but when camera pulls back from the fireball it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame
which ignited lights a fuse
the mi theme music kicks in the main credits roll to for a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when ethan
hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down revealing more of where hes come from than where hes going
aside from the fact that hes in the midst of free climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet theres the sunny picture postcard
view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below
ethan climbs out of shot
revealing the summit a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside fluffy clouds overhead
ethan into shot
despite the spectacularly precarious handholds hes using to hang onto the mountain and his life he appears relaxed engaged for him in the equivalent of busmans holiday
its leisurely danger for ethan one might almost expect to hear julie andrews trilling climb every mountain on the soundtrack
then a rock hes been grasping crumbles and ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again
as he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesnt seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter
its materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead casting its shadow downward over ethan
instinctively ethan flattens himself against the rock surface as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him
but when its rotors whir it into the distance ethan relaxes and resumes his climb
near the summit ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below
hes clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling
when he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical he dislodges a lizard and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion
he pockets the lizard climbs the overhang
with ethans hand then ethan coming into view and making the summit
he reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude
to lizard youre welcome
the lizard scampers off then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention
he turns to see the source of the beeping a small package in day glo colors with a day glo streamer
ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back
ethan lifts the day glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter
with a distinct lack of enthusiasm
the helicopter once again turns banks and disappears
ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses
first a retinal scan
good morning mr
swanbecks face flashes onscreen
over his introduction of nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot
your mission should you choose to accept it requires you to recover a stolen item designated chimera
essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian a miss nyah nordoff hall
she is a highly capable professional thief currently active in spain
a series of nyahs accomplishments i
warrants complaints interpol summaries of her various criminal activities as well as glimpses of the elusive nyah circulating about seville
swanbecks voice contd her dossiers available on i com
you have hours to recruit ms
nordoff hall and meet me in seville to receive further details
should you or any member of your im force be caught or killed the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions
swanbecks face reappears on screen swanbecks voice contd and mr
hunt the next time you go on vacation please be good enough to let us know where youre going
this message will self destruct in five seconds
ethan removes the glasses then tosses them into space
if i let you know where im going the glasses explode in a puff of smoke
ethan contd wont be on holiday
ethan with a fair amount of disgust gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain in what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit
then somewhere hundreds of feet below camera theres a little puff of color as the tulip shaped chute pops out of his back pack
begin the sound of a castanets and the animal like cries of flamenco dancers
bustling in the activity of a large private party with arriving guests and attentive valets as a young woman her face unseen exits her car and enters the villa
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets
the dancers perform on a raised platform and nyah nordoff halls face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels looking thru not at them
looking back in a similar way to nyah surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party
nyah continues to look at ethan over the shoulder over her wanna be escort a very attentive gentleman
nyah offers up her empty glass and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill leaving nyah and ethan looking at one another
ethan approaches her
do you know me
you just looked as if you did
just as if id like to
i think that can be arranged
sorry theres not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad
this stops her
nyah moves closer to him until theyre nose to nose
whispered but breezy look its either you or the rent and i dont mind telling you its not an easy choice
what if i pay the rent
glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink then go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet ill pay your rent
kissing him sweetly now bugger off
and purposeful creature that she is she takes her frustrated desire upstairs timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of the dancers steps to cover her own
once upstairs a security guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her down the hall both moving past a pair of windows visible to ethan
in a few moments nyah can be seen past the windows in the opposite direction without the guard following
in another moment or two a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window looking up and down the hall clearly having lost sight of nyah
ethan smiles moves out of shot
nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom
a decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting mirrored walls
the tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice
nyah cant resist
she spoons a dollop of the caviar and downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to its back
there she pulls out her compact and removes the puff revealing an electronic density meter
she turns it on and holds it at the rear of the tub
its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red
her fondest hopes confirmed mmmm
she now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the tiles just above the sop dish
her knee eyes search for any cracks in the grout and she spots one
using a tweezers she pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles revealing something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles
she slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish
theres the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble casing out from the rear of the tub
nyah breathes a sigh of relief and anticipation kneeling in the tub she finds herself looking down at an open safe revealing some half dozen locked compartments
as she studies them decisions decisions
nyah looks up to see ethans reflection in the bathroom mirrors looking down at her kneeling in the tub
what are you doing here
think youre the only one who can pick a lock
not altogether pleased i see
youre not just another pretty face
before ethan can answer a voice can be heard coming from the bedroom warbling granada in spanish and with considerable gusto
nyah contd oh god
a bloody baritone
nyah catches a reflection behind ethans in the bathroom mirror
she reaches up and grabs ethan by the lapel yanking him into the tub pulling him down on top of her
once again theyre nose to nose
i take it you prefer tenors
she glances up at the mirror
in it is the reflection of senor augusto de larena a big amiable castilian in his fifties whos changing a white dinner jacket thats had wine split on it
he breaks into a heavily accented version of now or never and disappears from the dressing room mirror
would you mind if im on top
oh either way works for me
with a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of ethan and begins working on one of the safe compartments using a tiny torque wrench from a tube of lipstick
and a carbide pick from a mascara brush
she glances down and is rather disconcerted
continues working with the pick and wrench
youre never gonna find it there
she jumps dropping the torque wrench damn it
his ex wifes bulgari necklace that goes up for auction tuesday
looking down to ethan a touch of indignation more or less hands locked behind his neck as he rests against the raked back of the tub his eyes and nose
inches from nyahs lower pelvic region as she straddles him
not exactly in the mood to move she stiffens he knows too damn much
where is it
she immediately switches her efforts from top left to the bottom right compartment
shes utterly nonplussed wheres the bloody plucking it off his chest offering it up like a mechanic under the chassis torque wrench
this is very disconerting
hey you put me here
i just do what im told
she unstraddles him and with a few deft moves with the torque wrench and carbide pick and its open
she withdraws a velvet pouch and opens the pouch
out spills the spectacular necklace
nyah contd lovely
starting to close the safe who are you and whats it going to cost me
having sat up i wouldnt do that
the alarm goes off
the bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards gun drawn senor de larena looking highly upset pops in
oh senor keyes thank god it is you
in spanish to security guards annoyed its senor keyes the security engineer
well senor de larena the goods news is that the heat sensors were activated
but miss nordoff hall my associate senor de larena kisses nyahs hand
mucho gusto senorita
did feel that she had rather too long to work on the safe before they triggered the alarm isnt that right miss hall
much too long i should yes
nyahs initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary intensified curiosity about ethan
under the circumstances i think we would recommend re setting the senors to respond to a lighter load
how do you feel about forty kilos miss hall
well senor de larena theres no reason to disrupt your party any longer
we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards which youll receive in our written report by fax in the morning hard copy to follow
he offers nyah his arm
they start out
ethan immediately stops
ethan contd miss hall
havent you forgotten something
nyah looking genuinely puzzled
nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering string of diamonds and rubies from her bust
a great kidder what are you trying to do senorita
they all laugh and ethans got her out the door
the stars dimming the sky a gun metal blue
ethan and nyah emerge from the villa walking slowly
nyahs clearly preoccupied
im missing something here aside from a pound necklace
even after i botched the job i couldve walked out of there with the bloody thing
at least you walked
if you werent going to let me get away with it why did you let me go thru with it
wanted to see how good you were
im hoping we might work together
may i say something no offence
you look like a gigolo you sound like a thief you act like a cop what the bloody hell do you have in mind
working under adverse conditions
highly adverse conditions
muchacho mi carro por favor
now be serious
you couldnt possibly want me off tonights performance
you didnt do that badly
her car arrives
as she moves to her car youre apologizing for me
quite the gentleman
opening the car door not really
i triggered the alarm
one foot on the floorboard she freezes back to ethan
hey the bulgari job last week was flawless
and ive always been partial to pale yellows
she slides behind the wheel
as he leads on the car i dont do laundry or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine
she takes off spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake
ethan smiles and shakes his head
around curves hair flying shes free
her car phone rings
perplexed she lets it ring once or twice picks it up tentatively hola
would you mind slowing down
where did you get this number
i dont even have it
would you like it
she hits the end button and disconnects
the phone immediately rings again
she refuses to pick up
ethan pulls alongside hers
she looks at him
they speak through the open cars
pull over and listen to me will you
listen to what
i need your help and i thin you can use mine
what are you talking about
scotland yard interpol every dutch authority
i can make them go away
oh bloody hell
youre a spy
she floors it and shoots ahead of ethan nicking his car as she takes off
to himself i deserved that
ethan rings her again
and keeps ringing
her face becomes grim her flight progressively more desperate and with ethans pursuit progressively more determined
they are reaching the limits of adhesion around blind curves
the skys battleship gray ethan pursues nyah around hairpin turns high above the costa del sol they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road obscuring it
both are appalled by the others willingness to escalate risk in this game of flight and pursuit until ethan tears thru a fogbank and sees on his gps what nyah
cant see thru the fog less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she cant possibly negotiate and if she cant shell plunge off the road hundreds of feet to rock and sea below
ringing her number again half to himself slow down slow down
she turns up a mound and loses control
she spins out and heads toward the edge of the cliff
realizing shes in trouble uh oh
ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a degree spin
her car stops just at the cliffs edge
furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out
suddenly theres no nyah
ethan leaps over to nyahs car and sees nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below holding the door handle
taking a firm grip on her wrist
dont look down
look at me
he pulls nyah up to the car across the seat and half into his arms
for a long moment it looks like shes in shock
then whats you name
well ethan hunt what is it you want to talk to me about
thru the veil of morning fog nyah looks at ethan
her dark eyes suggest wit and willingness and longing
more than i thought
they scarcely to move to bring their lips together awfully short notice
care to wait a decent interval
who wants to be decent
his eyes open slowly
he comes to full consciousness his head still on the pillow
something approaching serious anxiety informs his features
he lifts his head and looks at his left angle widening
nyah lies on her side facing him sleeping serenely
anxiety on the order of oh god this isnt approved recruiting technique confirmed
he lets his head flop back on the pillow
then he turns so he and nyah are profile to profile
as he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades replaced by curiosity and even wonder
he lifts his hand and just brushes her cheek
her eyes open
she knows where she is
so whatve you got against spooks
when theyve got your recruiting technique
not a thing
this isnt exactly by the book
theyve got a book for this
theyve got a book for everything
the only other spook i knew was a liar
charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth
hed lie about his favorite color
but then i reckon its an occupational hazard
all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies
not revealing information doesnt necessarily make someone a liar
thats not the point
in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you dont
that theyre lying
nyah contd once they know that they can get very very
nyah shoulder and moves into ethan
so where did i got right
youre not a liar
or youre an awfully good one
then this thing these blokes pinched
i dont know that they pinched it
dont even know that theyre blokes
nyah stops to think about this
well then what i am i doing here
i assume im meant to be some sort of thief to catch a thief
so do i
nyah looks at ethan a little worried
spoken like a spook
you ever afraid
ask a question you get an answer
damn youre beautiful
thats because im on my back
quick as a cat ethan flips nyah over so shes looking down at him
i dont think so
she sinks into his arms
ethans step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the crema portion of the fallas de valencia
on this night great papier mache effigies some serious some comic are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires
outside the bar ethans looking for theres a street vendor hawking fallas mementos and flowers
he starts past the vendor and it hits him hes going to buy some flowers
he chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals
ethan pays the vendor starts into the bar and thinks better of walking into swanbeck with the bouquet
turns back to the vendor
are you gonna be here a while
ill pickem up on my way out okay
ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where he passes security at a pair of double doors
swanbeck stands looking out the window
noisy crowds from the festival provides a constant walla and during the sequence the first effigies are lit and smoke and flame provide a vivid background thru briefing rooms window
fetivals a pain in the ass
honoring saint by settingem on fire
turning to ethan sit down sit down
swanbeck contd lets you know what they think of saints doesnt it
damn near set me on fire on my way over here
as if i havent been burned enough today
a moment where its impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two
then civilly swanbeck contd sorry i barged in on your vacation
sorry i didnt let you know where i was
wouldnt be on vacation if you did
youre sorry and im sorry
why did you phrase it like that
youre sorry and im sorry
you gotta be kidding
swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a dvd and projected onto a computer screen staring back at ethan is with exaggerate brio well dmitri
how are you
nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply
im fine and youre fine
with ethan simultaneously whispering im fine too
im fine and youre fine do you remember dear fried how you got sergei and i to repeat those lines from dr
strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly soviet premier because we didnt know your name
in those days you not only saved our lives you saved our sanity
now then dmitri we have this little problem every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires a villain
therefore in a search for our hero bellerophon we created a monster chimera
i beg you dmitri come to sydney and accompany me to atlanta immediately
however we travel i must arrive at me destination within hours of departure
forgive this fanciful explanation but for now prudence dictates that i communicate nothing but the gravest urgency
i fear i can entrust this to no one but you dmitri
as we say im sorry and youre sorry
swanbeck stops the dvd
let me ask you something
you have any idea what the hell hes talking about
an idea yeah
like its a good idea to pick him up in a hurry
and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier
so lets get on with it
hes still in sydney
vladimir nekhorvich is dead
so is his colleague gradski but that happened earlier
we had nekhorvich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies
ethan sits back heavily
swanbeck contd hunt are you listening
slowly looking up if he didnt want to go anywhere without me how did you get him on the flight
you were there
swanbeck clears his throat
he turns back to the computer and punches in file open to computer scans of ambrose sean and hunt ethan the computer scanning and comparing their features millimeter by millimeter
stat by stat as the computer then imposes with the help of the physiognomy scan ethans face on ambrose hence mission double image
slowly looks up at swanbeck
when i couldnt find you i had to replace you
sean ambrose was the obvious choice
he double you what
two three times
what did you think of him
you know we had reservations about each other
isnt it a little late in the day to be asking me that
swanbeck shows ethan a photo of airline captain
airline record list captain harold macintosh as the pilot for flt
as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned captain macintosh died on the flight but in fact he missed it
he did however make the next flight in cargo stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size
another photo of an open suitcase the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers
swanbeck contd someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident
someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but they dont always get your luggage on the plane even when you fly first class
so theres one thing we know ambrose doesnt
then you do think it was ambrose
ethan barely nods
swanbeck contd and youre not surprised
ethan gives swanbeck a look
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers
sean feels he hasnt done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground
the question is why
what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying
ethan rises and moves to the window
right now only ambrose knows that
in any case youve got to recover chimera and bring it to us
in order to do that ive got to figure out how he plans to make money with it
in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts
well you know nekhorvichs history
youre the one who got him out of the soviet union was it still in bio weapon business
if thats what youre thinking ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane
locating him in time to stop something like that is where miss hall comes in
blindsided excuse me
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously
she walked away and hes wanting her back ever since
we believe shes our surest and quickest way of location him
acidly and then what
then makes sure she continues to see him
gets him confide in her and report to you
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief
well then i mislead you
or you made the wrong assumption
either way were asking her to resume a prior relationship not do anything she hasnt already done
shes got no training for this kind of thing
go to bed with a man and lie to him
shes a woman
shes got all the training she needs
ethans anger flashes but does his best to contain it
i dont think i can get her to do it
you mean itll be difficult
well its not mission difficult hunt
its mission impossible
difficult should be a walk in the park for you
if you can think of a quicker way to get to ambrose youre welcome to try
oh by the way you might want to take a look at these
if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job
he pulls out a little minolta digital camera identical to the one in nekhorvichs bag at airport security
swanbeck sets it on the table
ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye
a grim ethan starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever more lively crowd
as he does senor senor
the vendor holds up the spring bouquet
ethan seems genuinely surprised by them
theyre very nice
and hes lost in the crowd leaving a very puzzled vendor holding the bouquet
one after the other flashing by
they are more evocative than specific in their suggestion of an abrupt fiery ending where the lives of hundred are literally and figuratively torn apart and strewn over a desolate
carefully places the little minolta on a glass topped coffee table
shes beautifully pulled together the safehouse has the lights low flamenco music playing and when she walks out onto the balcony ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of
theres a light breeze the fire from the burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city
whats the population of seville any idea
five six hundred thousand
theres nearly million in london
and six billion in the world
thats lot of people out there
how many of them i wonder are capable of something like that
sean ambrose for one
a long shocked moment
the pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room nyahs back to ethan grimly amused not that it matter much but
i seem to recall you staying something like i was hoping we could work together
this wasnt what i had in mind nyah
but it is what youd like me to do
so tell me to do it
she approaches ethan
theyre inches apart
nyah contd come on out with it
tell me to go and insinuate myself back into seans life
go and insinuate yourself back into seans life
id like a little more conviction
so would i
but its not mine to give
archness there youve either got it or you dont
let your conscience be your guide
something like that
with a smile and a wink
but i dont have a conscience
im a bloody thief
you can be a thief and have a conscience
you can be a thief and have a conscience not me
why did you have to tell me about this
pouring herself a drink what do i have to do to get away from this guy
when youre with him he messes about with your head every waking moment
even now ill be at some out of the way place a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table with two glass god knows
how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does
and it looks like hes done it again
you know his definition of a true paranoid
someone in possession of all the facts
she turns away pauses are you telling me i have to do this
generally i dont favor coercing someone
not when theres a chance my life could end up in their hands
and thats the only reason
can you think of a better one
i was just hoping you might
somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical
look would it make you feel better if i didnt want you to do this
then feel better
long moment while she looks at him
ethan contd well
that made all the difference in the world didnt it
ethan walks out onto the balcony
she looks at his back
sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of yoo hoo im not nad message
not after the way we broke up
what wouldnt make him suspicious
probably that i needed him in some urgent way
destitute in serious trouble
the kind i couldnt possible sort out myself
ethans been smiling slightly
serious trouble nyah is something i can always arrange
standing for front and side mug shot
sound of teletype continues
superimpose ethan holding up something the size of a dime this little chip sends a coded signal that can be picked up only by our computer
on the screen of the gps computer a little yellow blip appears pulsating on the screen
when its in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world
he types a small interpol bulletin stating that nyah nordoff hall apprehended march in seville is awaiting extradition while the authorities in london paris and amsterdam squabble over where shes
going to be tried first for the various thefts and burglaries shes committed in the three cities
ambrose picking up on a version of the interpol bulletin ethans put out
he leans over the screen for a moment then moves to the window and stares out thoughtful at the bay almost as if he were watching
from a beautiful blue sky pan down to the courtyard of the jail where nyah is allowed out for an airing seemingly alone but being watched by his attention fixed
on the screen ethan stares at satellite shot of nyah in the jail courtyard
being allowed a phone call a prison guard visible b
cross cut with ethan
look i cant run your arrest in cnn but i guarantee hes monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world for what they might be saying about him if nothing
else hes got the ability and we assume the desire to get you out of there
this doesnt seem to be accomplishing much
well i mean its not a total loss
it is keeping a very capable thief off the street
maybe he has heard and doesnt want to know
maybe hes lost interest
her guard b
is handed a note
to nyah your lawyer to see you
well here we go
sector australia moving into new south wales and then to sydney
here ethan pulls up names photos and profiles of potential candidates
they scroll past one face morphing into another
ethan punches in on william a
expertise qualified in virtually every mode of transport land sea air
ordinances small arms and automatic weapons authority edged and impact weapons
explosives precision detonation diffusion
ethan punches request immediate availability
nyah emerges from the entrance to the jail
stop and look for something in you purse
theyre effectively blocked from the street
ethan hands her a key chain with what appear to be a car key
ambrose will have counter surveillance second to no ones
when and if he contacts you push this button before you actually end up under his roof itll scramble your transmission to us
she takes the key chain
her hands are shaking
when will you be there
before you are
how can you possibly
ive got to get right on the plane
im leaving now
you dont trust me
oh i do
but as we know im a very poor judge of character
hes got you on qantas flight
its going to be delayed
youll be fine
im going to lose you
ethan you take care of yourself ill take care of myself because if push comes to shove im gonna bail and without giving two week notice
well forewarned is forearmed
and while were at it be especially sensitive to any sudden change in ambroses plans especially any involving you
a quick squeeze of her hand and hes gone
a look of something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after him then starts across the street toward the limo and driver
mi music theme kicks in and continues over over the harbor bridge sails dotting the bay like confetti
pans of sheep are bleating and looking for sort of cover in response to the sound of a helicopter touching down
billy and luther emerge luther with computer looking acutely uncomfortable in a wrinkled suit
welcome to australia mate
they look up to a smiling ethan who points to the ground beneath luthers feet
luther looks down to see that he is standing in a pile of sheep shit
both men laugh and all three move to luther and billy with ethan setting up their operation
theres a blip on one of the screens
its the transponder
put in the coordinates and lets get a visual
the visuals arent coming up
the satellite doesnt work as fast as i do
yeah ive heard about you luther and i just want to tell you its an honor and a pleasure to be working with you blokes whoaa
thats some transponder
as billy speaks the visual come on line and nyah has become visible
a jaundiced eye to ethan it certainly is
how did we get so lucky
ethan pointedly ignore the question
rounding the tip of the bays crescent revealing the beach and dock at ambroses palm lined residence
the speedboats engines are cut
nyah looks momentarily stricken
a lone slender figure silhouetted at the end of the dock still as the piling besides which it stands
but the features remain obscured by the sun at his back
leans forward as the slender figure grows larger to ethan is it him then
the tide is too low for the boat to dock making it necessary for he boat to approach the shore
the slender figure moves off the end of the dock and onto the beach
idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the sand the boatman grumbles he cant get any closer
the slender figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light changes ambrose is waiting
nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant slips over the side into thigh high water without taking her eyes off ambrose
ambrose strides right on into the bay
as they are just an arms length apart takes a deep breath presses the button to scramble the transponder
the picture abruptly goes dead
just when it was about to get interesting
she scrambled the transmission
luther continue feeding the gps her position
luther punches in
the signal and the global coordinates are given
the satellite positions itself
cant we speed this up
luther shoots him a disgusted look
this is the only computer thatll do this
start to bounce back growing larger and larger on the screen until nyah can be seen water up to her thighs lingering in ambroses arms with each blow up and
now theres a bloke who knows how to deliver a proper welcome
dont get me wrong mate
you were quite hospitable
is it him then
ethans look suggests hes worried about lapse in recruiting judgment
it is billy
then we gotem
we dont know what weve got because we dont know what hes got where hes got it or what hes doing in sydney with it
ethan strides away from the screen the edge in his voice and the move not altogether lost on either luther or billy
perfectly poised still loosely in his arms nyah returns ambroses penetrating gaze with a pleasant clear eyed one
not much luggage
i left in a bit of a hurry
im terribly grateful sean
well that depends
how hard you had to work to get me out of there
how in the world did you ever find me
stopping how i usually find you nyah
how do you that
looking down the length of the dock
ambrose his arm around nyah and carrying her suitcase moves up the dock toward the house and camera
stamp steps into the annex and looks over to wallis who watches nyah on the monitors
no flies on her
checking her on a scanner screen no bugs either
drily all cats are
ethan watches the nekhorvich video on the computer screen
therefore in a search for our hero bellerophon we created a monster chimera
ethan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer depicting the myth of bellerophon attacking chimera
billy moves up behind him
what you got there mate
just a myth
shouldnt you be checking out their countersurveillance
well you know his blokesll place the oscor in his annex where else if youre pinpointing transmitters video signals covert chip cameras anything radiating oscillating
or hard wired
please or hard wired right
first line of perimeter defencell run from the back of the dock to the front of the house
whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet
basically impenetrable id say
ethan heres nekhorvich and heres his boss luther scans an entry from the imf database with newspaper clippings sidebars of still of mccloy and nekhorvich
luther contd mccloy jon chaddick ceo biocyte pharmaceuticals
september manchester england
a little lost well do you disagree with that
not at all
but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site
oh well if thats how you feel about it
in acquired biocyte in hostile takeover
as luther transfer info to ethans computer luther contd ethan have a look at this
on ethans screen appears the biocyte website where among he various icons one offer mccloys proud detailing of biocytes philanthropic efforts we at out state of the art solar powered
biocyte building recognized that eternal vigilance is the price of health
whether its funding the teaching center at the royal prince edward hospital removing aerosol products from the marker or braving the influenza quarantine at bruny island late last month
at biocyte your life
is our lifes work
quietly biocyte workers at bruny island
theyve reached the head of the stairs
ambrose opens a door
its a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the tent annex and the beach and a very large bed
and my room
a long moment
ambrose walks to a mirrored wall
the mirrors are sliding doors
with a sweeping gesture he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes
thought you could use a little something to wear
nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe
ambrose pulls out a slinky armani and drapes it on the bed
ambrose contd try it on
ambrose contd go ahead
im dying to see if i remembered your size
nyah picks it up
no changing room
ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits
her blouse belt skirt fall on the bed
as her slender arm reaches down to pick up the armani grips her wrist the flimsy armani dangling in the air
meeting ambroses look
youre not interested in seeing how it looks
oh i am
the armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor
standing off to one side listening to nekhorvichs voice
therefore in a search for our hero bellerophon we created a monster chimera
whys nekhorvich going on about an old greek myth
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules
in the myth bellerophon killed chimera a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world
i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon
that simple huh
lying back on a pillow looking and off into space to right off camera
she hears ambroses voice with ethans voice damn youre beautiful
nyah reacts as if shed been rapped on the nose her eyes moist
she turns abruptly to camera
did you say something
leaning on an elbow looking down
i said youre beautiful nyah
chalk it up looking him dead in the eye to spring fever
ambrose amused lights a cigarette and inhaling wont do love
its not spring
its nearly autumn
youre in oz
everythings upside down and backwards here
more direct maybe thats it then
everythings upside down and backwards
get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month including photos of the victims
i guess there arent many flu epidemics in the middle of summer
luther resumes working on his computer and sees ethan is locked on ambroses compound on his computer screen thinking of nyah
luther contd she did it ethan
nyahs in the compound
ive just rolled up a snowball and tosses it into hell
a brooding ethan exits the sheep farm safehouse under a setting sun
now well see what chance it has
ethan stops looking out over the broken plain
his voice is heard overlapping into the next scene
ethans voice contd softly damn youre beautiful
lying in bed obviously hearing ethans voice again and feeling very much alone
she stares out into the night a gaze that in its bemused intensity is an exact match to ethans
its front page except for the headlines and date covered with stacks of paper money banded bundled dollars piled high as a cord of wood
the amount millions is written in ink over the money
twenty four mil
ambroses hands shift to another photo of another newspaper the london times this one piled high with english pounds and the written amount million pounds
thirty seven million pounds
thats a promising bid
the third photo is of the afternoon aruban with million packaged on it
ambrose wearing a robe and seated at a glass topped table sets this last photo on the table on top the others
he picks up nekhorvichs digital camera removes the film disk and snaps it into its plastic case
he places the case into an envelope note the same envelope seen at the track and hands it to stamp
well need this at the track
stamp is seated near him
glances toward ambroses bedroom and nyah asleep in ambroses bed
pointedly not everything
why do you think shes really here
from her point of view or mine
wasnt exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago
the question is do you trust her
as he speaks ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his robe
takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the cigar the razor sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar like a guillotine
one considers her timing of course getting nicked within a week of the plane going down
suggestive even borderline suspicious but hardly conclusive
well youve thorough about it at any rate
ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of tobacco trapped by the cut
tell me hugh
you dont exactly hang on nyahs every word and gesture do you
fairly ratty nail that
sean touches the nail of stamps left pinkie finger
stamp reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand
with his left hand ambrose grabs stamps left wrist
youre not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair splitting nuance are you
sean pulls stamps hand closer
suppose she is some sort of trojan horse sent in by imf to spy in us why should i deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two
or dont you think i can learn more from her than she can from me
ambrose twists stamps wrist so that stamp drops to one knee trying to alleviate the pain
in pain i do
ambrose leans in close to stamps face as he places the cutter around stamps pinkie
now hugh you must realize that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with
and my dear chap
i may or may not know why she thinks shes here but im willing to take the risk because hugh i am gaging for it
ambrose closes the cutter on stamps finger and cuts the nail just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood
stamp cries out
ambrose tosses stamp a napkin light his cigar and exhale
ambrose contd dont ever question my judgment again
with no sound the back stretch an unrecognizable blur until horses at high speed burst into the frame bringing with them the sight and sound of their great nostrils snorting
and gasping for jostling and going to the whip the sound of the crowd overwhelming all but the announcers voice carrying everyone around the far turn and into the home stretch with a ringing controlled frenzy
nyah and ambrose rising as the horses cross the finish
surprised you won
looking at her ticket i suppose i did
what made you pick that nag
shed never won a bloody thing
thief in the night
say no more
im off to grab a drink
still favor bellinis
she smiles a little shakily
its billy passing behind her
in the fourth
check her out
billy hands her a chest sheet and moves on
she opens it to the fourth race
taped onto naturally vain is a small plastic piece with the note
she regards the note places the plastic piece in her ear
you can speak as if im right by your side
picking up binoculars where are you
at the mounting enclosure just off the tracks at two oclock
thru the crowd onto the track over to the pre post paddock where an animated gaggle of owners heavy batters and investerace touts surround it
only ethan is stock still and looking up at nyah
a swift intake of breath as she see him
hows it going
just like old times
just like old times
she appears to be the picture of unruffled sang froid
tell me who youve run into at ambroses
moving from nyah to the champagne bar just behind where ambrose is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner table in front of the window
overlooking the track
a breath then near as i can tell theres at least a half dozen other blokes about the place
hugh stamp an old mate of seans is the only one i recognize bit of a creep and then some
stamp stands a pillar his finger bandages looking glum and looking down at nyah
we know him
hes over your left shoulder looking right at you as you go on
michael his drivers an aussie new to me
then theres the blokes in the annex at the back of the house
have you met them
annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door
looking into champagne bar ive no doubt
of ambrose sitting with someone whose face is obscured from his angle by bar patrons
is also looking
and from his point of view it can be seen that ambrose is talking with john mccloy the head biocyte
ambrose takes an envelope out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small plastic container marked s
identical to the object first seen in nekhorvichs satchel at airport security
he opens it and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter
he turns to the window and gestures
stamp enters the bar
ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar
big bloke ginger hair
theyre into something
ill be damned
its mccloy the biocyte nekhorvichs boss
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them thirty seven million on the london times
whats that about
bids from possible chimera buyers to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money is monitoring both cameras
all see ambrose give the little wafer like object to stamp who places it in a small camera hands it back to ambrose and exits waiting just outside the glass
ambrose hands the camera to mccloy who looks puzzled
looks like ambrose is showing mccloy how to use a digital camera
mccloy puts it to his eye fumbles then with ambroses direction whatever mccloys looking at hes not happy about
mccloy puts the camera down
the two men have words
mccloy shakily leave the table
ambrose opens the camera
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope put it in his inner left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket
left jacket pocket confirmed
nyah ambrose is heading back
theres an enveloped inside his left jacket pocket
passes by stamp on his way back hands him the camera
after a brief pause where do i meet you
betting table twelve off the paddock
nyah are you up to this
ill muddle through
ambrose arriving with a pair of drinks
see anything you like
naturally vain but theyre about to close the betting table and i havent a sou
while ambrose is still juggling the drinks nyah reaches into his trouser pockets and rummages around
billy make sure nyahs not followed
no worries mate
she pulls out a fifty dollar note
would you mind terribly
ambrose contd amused and turned on not at all
but youll pay for that and with interest
ive no doubt
she heads up the stairs
reaching into his pocket for money hold on
ambrose grabs her arm and she almost drops the envelope shes just lifted
note it is important not to see her actually lift it
shes holding it pinned between her right arm and side
as its slipping she notes stamp above her looking down and has to conceal what shes holding from him as well ambrose contd put down a couple of hundred for
she takes it and as she does the envelope falls but she manages to catch it with her left hand blocking the move with her body as she does
moves along the aisle
luther smallest digital you got
ready to transmit
betting table twelve
designated as new south wales deliveries anytime anywhere
luther bursts out of the van carrying the tiny camera and begins to thread his way thru cars and foot traffic
in dramatic contrast ambles at a conspicuously leisurely pace
passes stamp not seeing him standing just a row above blocked from her by one of the pillars
stamp idly regards her and then decides he follows
perspiring approaches the betting table thru the last of the parked cars
approaches the door thru which nyah had gone and starts to open it only to have the door slammed in his face and on his bandaged finger by billy in
a track ushers uniforms
very solicitous sorry about that mate that mustve really aggrhh
even as stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and billy finds himself pinned to the wall gasping for air
if hed been welded there by a band of steal hed have more room to maneuver
aggrhh aggrhh aggrhh
whatever youre about in future watch your step
never know who you might run into
stamp looks around nyahs nowhere in sight
hes lost her
sees his hands bleeding and lets billy go who nearly drops to the floor
wheres the loo then
pointing up aggrhh aggrhh aggrhh
stamp heads up the mens room
croaking it out shakes his head feeling lucky to escape with his life
nyah into shot
stands in line
she looks around
howd you do
dont turn around
nyah turns and looks ethan dead in the eye
whatre you going to do
she slips ethan the envelope
ethan himself returns the look holding it in spite of stamps out of the loo
luther arrives with the camera opening for ethan
nyah turns away
ethan pulls out the tiny memory card slips it in the camera
looking into camera this is going to take a couple of minutes
is racing back to the van
there in twenty ethan
edge toward the window
stamps a little shaky but headed your way mate
to nyah who do you like
in the race
nervous shes heard billy too what race are we talking about
a sweaty luther im booted up
hes heading down the stairs now
ethan places the digital camera on play and begins to go thru the stills
as they cliff off ethan is visibly affected
watches the stills as well
hes no less affected
he mutters some expletive under his breath then evenly i want you out of ambroses place
hes one tier from the bottom
ethan glances over to the bottom of the stairs
what are you talking about
as he lowers camera and removes the memory card
i want you out of there
what did you see
slipping card back into envelope
nyah youve done more than enough
even the best of snake charmers get bit
ethan tell me twenty nineteen
ethans been talking to someone hes been urging to walk not run to the nearest exit
now he drops all pretence i want you out of australia
more quickly i dont know how much more plainly i can put it
how do you suggest i go about it
hes touched your heart
you need to think it over
youll meet him somewhere in a month
if youre not out in hours im coming in and getting you out
give me the ear piece
she just gets it out of her hear and gives it to ethan when she reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet
she gives him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off no more bets
flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops the envelope
she quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it tucking it away and looking up to see stamp standing over her
almost exactly where ethan had stood when she looked away
tries not to register alarm while she gauges how much stamp had seen
get your bet down
stamp waits only a moment then follows
everyones on their feet the horses are in the backstretch
ambrose is watching the race through binoculars
nyah comes up behind and puts her arms around him
with her left hand she puts the envelope into his right jacket pocket
your nag is making a run for it on the outside
lowering binoculars bloody hell nyah
shes momentarily startled
then you picked another winner
well thats good isnt
of a shot from a digital camera card
segi gradski nekhorvichs colleague and lifelong friend
the photos is coded with the data in the lower left hand corner
the time in the right a
burned into the photo is hours minutes after exposure
ethan paunches in
ethans voice contd twenty hours and three minutes after exposure
sotto voce twenty hours
ethan doesnt say anything for a moment then goes on to the next photo on the card hours minutes after exposure
its gradski again
gradskis eyes are darkly circled his skull look mottled
six hours later
another photo hours minutes after exposure
gradskis bleeding from nose mouth and ears the skin eruptions are pervasive his body an open wound
ethan contd six more hours
the next photo
hours minutes after exposure
gradskis body at rest
ethan contd three hours after that gradski was dead
heres a victim from the bruny island outbreak
the victims face shows a devastation undeniably like gradskis
a long long moment as ethan luther and billy sit in silence
oh happy day
ethan looks again at the first photo of gradski
nekhorvich said however we travel i must arrive at my destination within hours hours of departure
nyah is on the balcony
ambrose enters with two glasses of champagne
its made so many convicts feel at home
heres hoping it does the same for you
sean theres something ive been meaning to talk to you about
isnt going to be easy for me to say
jocular then dont say it
i dont know what to do about you sean
im more than a bit muddled
i need time
to do what
sort it all out
and youre going to have time
theres been a change of plans
a change of plans
we wont be able to have dinner tonight
somethings come up
i hope you dont mind
oh no not at all
maybe just a bit
ulrich will be about
hell look after you
ambrose enters slips off his jacket and hangs it over a chair
he walks to a desk and brings up a computer the biocyte website and mccloy infomercial
stamp notes that ambrose is on the computer and moves to the desk
i thought you were going to dinner
pulling up something on the computer hugh take care of the nekhorvich memory card
where is it
in the envelope in my pocket
stamp leans over and pulls out the envelope
as he does he sees ambrose has pulled up and started to play mccloys informercial
ambrose contd calmly weve got an opportunity here
im not going to miss it
a microscopic view of myriads of ugly green spiky objects amid exploding red ones
chimera attacking human blood
one more shot
a lavender stained group of spiky objects amid exploding the green ones
ethan contd bellerophon attacking chimera
on an adjacent screen is a frozen frame of mccloy looking thru the digital camera at the racetrack
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane
what manic invents disease like that in the first place
why would he do it
i dont know but nekhorvich was not a manic
get me a twenty on nyah
she must still be on the property
i told her to get outta there
mccloy gets in the rear of the limo and lights up a cigar
the limo takes off
another car pulls out and tags along behind the limo
michael at the wheel
mccloy doesnt like the taste of the cigar goes to toss it out but the electronic window button doesnt work
he notices the evening paper partially open on the seat
his name leaps out
he opens the paper announce that john c
mccloy ceo of biocyte inc
one of the worlds leading pharmaceutical companies has died of a straight and terrible strain of influenza shocked mccloy drops the paper calling out george
the drover doesnt turn around
mccloy cant believe it
he bangs on chauffeur window
the driver turns on the air conditioning in the rear of the limo
mccloy clutches his throat and passes out
hes got tubes coming out of every orifice and is contained in the equivalent of a plastic bubble
drenched in perspiration and he looks around for a call button
he grips the side of the bed
shut your eyes shut your eyes
he cant resist
opens them to look up thru the plastic to see a shimmering blur coming in and out of focus
mccloy contd ill be buggered
whats this then
a visit from an old friend
whats happening here
but dead is a little extreme
on the other hand when me dear gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live
confused it was in the bloody papers on the telly
whats this about gradski
you are infected with chimera my friend
is on the phone
id like to make a reservation on the next available flight tonight
where is next available flight going
the operator answers
ill take it
she hangs up goes to the door
the house is eerily silent
a play of shadows the sound of the kitchen fridge
moves softly downstairs hesitates at bottom glancing about
she goes into the kitchen
she goes out the door
running pell mell down to the shore
looks outside the small skiff moored at the end of the dock
its dark and she decides to chance it
she moves onto the pier trying to glide by the boathouse
a figure darts out and grabs her
she tries to scream but cant
the figure whips her around and she sees easy easy easy shhh
she throws her arms around him
are you okay
i am now
get me out of here
just get me out of here
its going to be okay
he holds her
mccloys strapped down but manages to reach the call button and push it
again and again
no use my friend
the medical staff wants no part of this
doctors dont fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else
mccloy stares at nekhorvich for a long moment
how could i possibly be infected
thats exactly what gradski said hours before he died
with chimera the most minute exposure can be fatal
mccloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor
he grips the edge of the hospital bed
but then you shouldnt be feeling to ill
not for another three of four hours anyway
mccloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety
you have bellerophon
mildly do i
you took it
all of it
and what if i need it
my my my
the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with chimera needed it as well
how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours
by asking me
you still dont get it do you
you want to make an omelet you break a few eggs i needed to know just how bad the disease was in the real world not the lab
and you never know til you try
you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas
but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in chimera that the cure would be priceless
you wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure
well the thought had occurred to me
i needed chimera in order to peddle bellerophon
for hero to be appreciated you need a monster
now thats not so difficult to understand is it
look time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo
have you any idea the r d money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic thats barely effective against one strain of one bacterium
if i couldnt makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there youd help me put one out there i can make on
there it is
i john c
mccloy am in business to make money
lillys making billions feeding prozac to depressed dogs
pfizer doesnt even know where to put the money theyre making on viagra and let me tell you that shit didnt do a thing for me even at twice the
recommended dose jesus who do i have to screw to get a a break
now get me out of here get me treated and lets go back to work
you know i think its a little late for that
do give my regards to gradski if you see him
nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask and the vocal oscillator revealing an exhausted ethan
angle widens to include luther and billy in hospital greens
luther and billy nod in disgusted assent
holds tight in her embrace with ethan
ethan you know what frightens me most when im with him
the thought of never seeing you
how are we getting out of here
nyah its very important not do anything to alarm ambrose
you told me to get out of here
i thought you were here to collect me
i was so relieved
with growing urgency no time to explain
youve done well and were so close
its critical that you do whatever ambrose asks
dont worry itll be over soon
thats a promise
come on now off you go
he gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back to the house her expression troubled even suspicious
having just taken off the mask ethan stands with luther and billy
disgusted by what hes heard so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloys got chimera
there guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill
ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane but he didnt get the chimera virus
why else would he come back to australia
if he had them both he could sell them anywhere
i kill chimera at biocyte and hes sitting on a cure without a disease
youve got the voice print ill get us in
ethan enters and tears off his mask revealing ambrose filled with implacable rage
he looks up to see stamp whos been obviously waiting for him
tearing the voice oscillator
leaning with both hands on a counter surveillance monitor table he stares at the floor his face rictus of hateful intensity
you were right
hunt stung mccloy tonight
theyll be going into biocyte
ambrose looks up slowly to stamp whos been standing by
then we go where hell be dont we
well done hugh
being rapped on by the driver
wakes with a start
the windows lowered billys in livery
youre home guvner
its taking time to register
then wheres george
my regular driver
where is he
took ill guv
touch of the flu
they say its going around
mind you dont catch a chill now
still dazed mccloy manages to nod and exit the limo
billy drives off
including all specifications
luther do you have the building up and running
luther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred yards off shore connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge
ethan contd thats not exactly it
sorry that it a biocyte facility their storage structure
nyah still on the property
she hasnt left it
then okay here you go as luther speaks the building on his computer graphics one with the biocyte pharmaceuticals elevators and renderings is being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence
off the rendering specifications by luther as if the building itself were being constructed at a madly rapid pace from its foundation to its reinforced steel structure to its honeycombing of floors to its outer skin
luthers reconstitution of the building lot static but moving around and above it even as he proceeds
lets start from the inside out
all storage and production of chimera is done here in this lab on the forty second floor the heart of the building
only about eight personnel chemists in lab coats workers in bio containment suits etc
populate the lab passing through security door and air locks monitoring the virus stock pading the injection gun etc
chimera itself is kept in two places in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small airtight chamber inside three injection guns
mate you kill it in both places were laughin and we go home
now how to get in there
no garage entrance
lobbys protected by five guards on rotating patrol
ethan watches the rendition of the biocyte lobby on screen in overhead light his eyes are dark pits somehow underlying her saturnine intensity if you look at hunts operational history
he invariably favors misdirection and deception
for a start he wont go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security
not going in from the ground
show me the atrium
the height and extent of the atrium are revealed as well as its conclusion in a glass floor in the ceiling of the lab
unhappily the atrium
one of a kind
runs down the center of the building
provides hour natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells
optimal growing conditions for the virus
ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the labs ceiling
luther sees the glint growing in ethans eye
hey atrium roof closes at sundown
as the sun sets the louvers of the atrium roof begin closing
and if the louvers are open for more than thirty seconds at night the civil emergency alarms are tipped
those even i cant stop
thirty seconds total to get you in and the cable out
thirty second opening in the roof and a foot drop
im not waiting hours
when were done at biocyte if shes not out of ambroses im going in and getting her out
no hunt will prefer to engage in some sort of acrobatic insanity to enter biocyte somewhere through the atrium where security is minimal
suddenly theres the roar of helicopter rotors
is poised upside down on cable against the sydney skyline
begin to open
hurriedly working the atriums controls hitting enter repeatedly
package away in five
im not ready
ethan plummets towards the atrium
frantically working controls cmon
is so swift it appears as though hes going to hit the atrium louvers but as he reaches roof level they crack open just enough for him to dart thru
like thread thru a needle luther begins the countdown
his countdown continues running under the action and dialogue below
moves down the shaft of bluish light past the buildings walls
ethan streaks thru the beams of light toward the atrium floor
reaches the end of the cord slows himself to a stop and sees the security guard through the window
the guard starts as he catches a glimpse of ethans reflection in the control panels
luther im looking at security
utterly shocked oh
sotto voce typing swiftly alarm in cosmetics
ethan swings himself up to the ledge above the guards window putting himself out of the puzzled guards sight
gotta get that cable out
ethan unhooks the cord and flips to the atrium floor
an alarm goes off
luthers voice contd there it goes
still confused and concerned the guard doesnt immediately react to the alarm or the ringing phone
he finally answers the phone
on phone ay
whats the matter with you
cant you hear the alarms gone off in cosmetics
the first guard gives up whats confused him
then i guess ill have to trot off to see whos pinching eyeliner wont i
exits grumbling ill even check the stairwell on the way
being swiftly retracted toward the atriums opening as it closes
the cable just makes it thru the atrium as the louvers close
reaches down and presses a silent beeper
sees a little red diamond shaped light pop on his screen transponder activated
reading package and cable is clean
exhaling relieved hes on his way
staring at the buildings control panels
hugs the floor just out of sight of the befuddled security guard
hell make the attempt at the only possible time for both of us p
when the guards rotate and the buildings air filtration generators go active covering the sound of his break in
ethan the generators are about to go active
well be out of contact for eleven minutes
dark and silent
turn over and roar to life
cuts into the glass floor pops it out and drops thru the opening
none of its heard under the generators
ethan drops onto the lab floor and heads across the lab and up the ramp to the hot zone
the frequency of the generators operate to our advantage cutting radio communication from his team for the next eleven minutes
stamp flanked by several of his team in biocyte security guard uniform crosses the lobby toward a pair of actual biocyte security guards who appear more puzzled than alarmed at
this unexpected influx
whats this then
not exactly mate
his attention in drawn to a spot on the grid where nyahs transponder blip a circular yellow one in contrast to ethans is moving
i think we got a problem
nyahs on the wing
billy do you copy
exactly where is she
in the building
sounds like youre saying shes in the building
ethan does it the hard way to avoid confrontation
neutralizing security guards is simply too distasteful to him
the two guards who had greeted stamp and his arriving team lie inert on the lobby floor
ive never found that a problem
billys so surprised he momentarily gets loose with the copter and it banks off
as it and he recover right
shes not likely to be alone
the question is how many of em
i cant get thru to ethan
not til the generators go off
not for another eight and a half minutes
staring at the red and yellow blips in vertical alignment the yellow one nyah considerably below the red one ethan
the door reads
danger live virus incubation zone
ethan pulls on a protective mask from his pack and puts a miniaturized recorder up to the voice print activator john c
ethans buzzed into the hot zone
he steps into the air locks
a small bomb is placed by the dark gloves of someone unseen
a shadow falls across the dirt in front of the bumper
with a digital clock face its red led illuminating descending numbers is carefully placed inside the bumper
the magnet on it doesnt quite catch
its then placed more carefully
luther doesnt pick up on the faint metallic sound just outside
hes concentrating on the flashes on the screen showing the transponder rising in the building
increasingly desperate it looks like nyahs headed toward an elevator
working meticulously an a computer monitor
and a security guards body lying in the corridor
a pair of trousered legs step over the body and into the elevator joining nyahs legs and feet and other pairs of trousered legs
the elevator doors close
if hunt actually manages to squeak thru the atrium hes liable to make it to chimera before we will
on his computer screen the yellow dot continues its ascent the two dots growing ever closer
shes in the elevator heading toward ethan
how much longer before you can reach him
five and a half minutes
looking at his chronometer hes breached the hot zone
on the other hand we know where hunt will be and he doesnt know were coming
in front of each of three large television monitors is a vial shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two liters in size
each one is contained behind plexiglas and each one pale yellow one sunset red
behind them are monitors marked respectively working seed stock master seed stock in vitro virus
behind these is a monitor screen with a blow up of the contents of the vials the magnitude of the blow up x
these are x ray microscope blow ups i
allowing the viewer to see the motility of the virus and its metabolism not dissimilar to an mri this of chimera in its three different cultures
ethans on the computer controls racing thru to working seed stock which calls for optimal levels of
ph and degrees celsius
he drops the ph to zero and punches up the temperature to a hundred
the effect on the greenish hue in the bottle is subtle but immediate not so subtle is the effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically they immediately appear agitated their
microscopic dna innards contracting and expanding
ethan moves on to the master seed stock and the in vitro virus panels on the computer
the changes he makes are reflected on the digital monitoring panels before each viral container
vial has begun to change colors from sea green to a paler pea green
the liquid itself begins to thicken female alert
chimera working seed stock ph and temperature level outside optimal range
as the liquid grows more viscous the x ray have a progressively more difficult time penetrating the individual cells resulting in a low humming sound which grows as the liquid
at the control panels for maintaining the virus
chimera master seed stock ph and temperature level outside optimal range
chimera working seed stock ph at unacceptable level
chimera in vitro ph and temperature level outside optimal range
chimera working seed stock ph at critical level
stock life threatened
the x ray microscope shows the individual seed cells sticking together some exploding then all movement ceasing
the liquid itself is suddenly shod thru fluorescent sparks before it congeals to an opaque mush
first computer voice contd alert
chimera stock life
simultaneously with the seed stock ethans damaging both the working seed in vitro virus
ethan places a little plastique on a timer and runs up a ramp to the decontaminant air lock at the back entrance to the hot zone
howre we doin then
he shouldve have killed the virus in the incubation area
nyahs exited the elevator on the same level as the lab
what can we do mate
staring at them hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one
the read and yellow blips are now on the same plane
the yellow dot moves toward the red one as if drawn by a slow motion magnet
looking up as his entire body is hit with air like hes a wind tunnel
when the air flow ceases a green light goes on
subject is contaminate free
zero contaminate factor
subject contaminate free
heads up a ramp to the three injection guns
hands in gloves he reaches into the chamber for one of the injection guns
hes still got three injection guns in the test lab
theyre loaded with doses of chimera which hell destroy by firing into a hyper thermal chamber
he places the barrel of the gun seals the chamber and fires
theres a tiny flash of light
ethan withdraws the gun
luthers sweating it as the clock counts down
twenty seven twenty six twenty five come on ethan were almost there
i im off sensitive for this
in a spasm of anxiety luther bolts to his feet wipes his brow
luther contd eighteen seconds the generatorsll be off and ethans back on line
luther glances thru the van window only to see reflected in the van side mirror reflected in it is the face of a digital clock its red led illuminating the
clocks numbers fourteen thirteen twelve realizing what hes in for oh oh oh even as he moans hes frantically ripping out the computer and cords dangling hotfoots toward the van exit
ethan fires the second injection gun
picks up the third and last
he pauses as hes about to fire it staring intently suddenly the gun is held by who turns the barrel from the hyper thermal chamber and releases into his wrist
whose vision of of nekhorvich fades
still thinking of nekhorvich he continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire the bombs led readout shows
as it reaches a small light on the bomb suddenly stops its incessant blinking
saw horses and dirt fly
looks up just in time to see ambrose and team arrive at the far end of the lab
they immediately open fire shattering the rooms walls and the glass injection gun chamber
as the injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below one of ambroses team runs to grab it but before he can reach it he is shot by ethan
whos falling to the floor below
to ulrich get it
as ethan hits and dives for cover ulrich goes for the gun ethan shoots ulrich in the leg
ulrich hops back in pain
those were two explosions your van and your safehouse in case you didnt hear them both i believe that means youve also lost a friend
ethans crouching on the ground protected behind a series of vertical metal sheets
and you couldnt walk to tell me about it
ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the shattered glass on the floor
ambrose wallis and a couple of other ambrose team members fire kicking up broken glass
ethan backs off
yelling hold your fire dammit
the two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot zone
ambrose contd well hunt
howve you been
smiling fight a bit of a cold
and youre happy about that
beats fighting the flu im here to tell you
you know that was the hardest part of having to portray you
grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes
i wouldve thought the hardest part was exercising restraint
curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off
you were in such a hurry to knock off that you never figured out where the virus really was
i knew where it was
then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the cdc scientists in atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish
doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti virus and still have it be effective
you knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for
ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a spray of gunfire attempting to cover his
own effort to the reach the injection gun
the return fire nearly hits the injection gun kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the floor
put a sock in it
hit that bloody gun and youll spray the bloody virus all over the place
everybodys regained cover but the injection gun remains out of everybodys reach
there it is guys the last of it
youve provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer
what was the top bid
why you going to make me a better offer
than thirty seven million pounds
not amused somebodys been slipping you our mail
come on out here you bad girl
nyah walks out into view on her own
ethan sees her reflection in the mirror
enraged but trying to control it
she doesnt belong here sean
let her go
she wouldnt be here if it wasnt for you hunt
from this moment youre responsible for what happens to her and if youre looking out for her well being i suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and
bring it to me
balls in your court hunt
whatve you got to say
nyahs waiting for your answer
a pregnant pause
breaking through the static ethan nyahs in the building
do you copy
a mess amid the rubble of the construction van
dryly thank you
ethan contd sure he wont shoot you the minute hes got it
oh hunt please
one cant hold nyah responsible for her actions
in other words youre calling her a flake
you know women mate
like monkeys they are
wont let go of one branch til theyve got a grip on the next
get it nyah
ill cover you
ambrose cocks his weapon
ambrose contd im waiting
not much more than body length from ethan this isnt exactly working out the way you thought it would ethan
finger on the injection trigger she rises and turns the barrel on her arm firing
the sound of the air pressure pushing the virus into her is unmistakable as is the circle of tiny puncture wounds on her skin
nyah moves in front of ethan covering him as she turns to face ambrose
shocked by nyahs gesture but as she addresses ambrose he resets the countdown on his chronometer to twenty hours
as it drops into the nineteen frustrated in the extreme you
shes been laughing away with ethan youre not going to shoot sean
not this bitch
shes worth thirty seven million pounds
fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator
theres a bright heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water the plastique killing any airborne virus
ethan uses the diversion to grab nyah and run with her to the far side of the lab behind a stock of horizontal cylinders
ambrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on the tanks protecting ethan and nyah surrounding the two with fire and jets of released steam
behind the stack of tanks
ethan launches an explosive down a short hallway blowing a hole in the buildings exterior wall
a group of biocyte security guards enter from behind ambrose and team and catch them off guard
all hell breaks loose
outraged what did you think you were doing
i wasnt thinking
trying to keep you from getting hurt thats all
this hits ethan with the force of a blow
you who dont have a conscience
something of surprise to her i guess i lied
you cant get both of us out of here can you
then youll have to kill me before its too late
before i start killing people
im infected with chimera
you know you dont have a choice
just do it now
she puts ethans gun to her forehead
nyah contd for gods sake get it over with
he cant fire lower the hammer
weve got hours and minutes before you start killing anybody
ill get bellerophon into your system by then
just stay alive
im not gonna lose you
ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall once in the open he exchanges direct gunfire with ambroses team wounding a couple men
he reaches the wall and dives thru camera with him as he drops stories the sound of gunfire in the air all around him
less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and ethan is lost from view beneath it
of aborigine paintings eerie patterns made of man and nature phantasmagorical like the patterns that form under the eyelids shortly before sleep
the haunting notes of didgeridoo insure theyre not being overheard
reading the paintings titles dreaming of birds and flying fox bushfire dreaming wind dreaming oddly appropriate swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle weary ethan swanbeck
contd since it appears that chimera the mother of all nightmares is on the loose somewhere around here is there any way this disaster can be viewed as a qualified one
tight lipped not yet
we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage
we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority but that wont stop ambrose and beyond him we dont know who else were looking for all terrorist bank
accounts of which were aware are stable
no deposits no withdrawals
therefore no suspects
we think weve got our finger on the buyer
even assuming youre able to prevent ambrose selling chimera youve now got an additional problem
you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte
if ambrose is going to sell chimera now hell have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss halls blood to market
yes i believe thats right
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera
you mean that leaves miss hall
yes i believe thats right
now my understanding is that hours after exposure the victim becomes infectious
ethan glances at his chronometer
swanbeck sees it
you noted the time of exposure
then if you manage to get hold of ambrose and obtain what hes got youve got glancing at the chronometer hours minutes and twenty three seconds to destroy the largest
remaining source of chimera on earth
she sacrificed herself
if you can get hold of bellerophon with the time limit you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice
but in either case youve got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her
after that its out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law
however you obtain it we want you to preserve a sample of chimera
bring it back alive
ethans staring at swanbeck
arent you even curious
about why she did it
i cant afford to be curious
and neither can you hunt
as the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and intensity the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems particularly oppressive
ethans up against it and he knows it
from harbors to skyline in all its sunlight splendor
nyah sits for a moment looking steadily at ambrose
ambrose pats the cannister hes carrying
feel like pleading for your life
with an edge not as much as you feel like hearing it
ambrose slaps her
with scarcely a flicker of hesitation she slaps him back
god damn it nyah
why did you do it
why did you save that bastard
if itll make you feel any better i wont do it again
full of pain and rage he gets out of the car
if itll make you feel any better youre going to take a lot of aussies with you and make me a lot of money
what are you talking about
in just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz
a nameless guard from michaels car idling nearby gets into the back seat with nyah
ambrose shuts the car door in nyahs face gets in michaels car takes off
luther drops a tiny part into his computer board and as he tries to fish it out with the aid of a magnifying glass ethan i keep telling you theres
not a chance of locating nyah til i access the satellite and theres not a chance of doing that til i get this thing booted up and running
how much time does she have left
ninety seven minutes twenty seven seconds
before we kill her or cure her
all weve got to worry about is ambrose
nyah will take care of nyah
what are you talking about
unless we dose her with bellerophon on the next ninety seven minutes nyah will kill herself
so first things first
swanbeck said theres no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts
mccloys black limousine is in the car park
confirms what ambrose is gonna do barrels of toxic materials line the walls as an armed guard patrols the corridor leading into the main chamber where we follow mccloy into
mccloy enters and begins pacing
who hes doing it with and where hes gonna do it
speed along an isolated road in close formation before turning onto a side road revealed as leading to a bridge across a small strip of water to a small island
as the cycles and vehicles cross the bridge and approach the front gate the camera swings around the side of the island establishing the geography and the six cannon emplacements
before coming to a stop on scaling the seaward side of the island with minimal gear resting like a giant locust half hidden by a cluster of trees on the bluff overlooking bear island
billys at the controls with binoculars maintaining surveillance of the island and environs
in the back luther is at work on his gps computer
ethans out from under the bridge and on the south east face
ethan climbs the side of the cliff
ethan ambrose and his tem have over the bridge copy that
ethan reaches the clifftop and sees armed guards patrolling
you all right mate
from here it looks like very security
whats it look like like from there
hes over the top and moves swiftly to cover
ethan surprises and kills a perimeter guard then runs to a length of grating and lifts one of the panels
ethan climbs down through the grating in the roof of the tunnel
using a bar to swing down he breaks a second guards neck and drops to the floor
ambrose and team drive through the entry gate passing its biocyte pharmaceuticals sign and various no nonsense warnings of no trespassing etc
before biocyte security guards close it behind them
breached the structure at the ten oclock grating
in the tunnel moving toward the target
ethan begins heading down the tunnel
ambrose and team enter where mccloy and his chemist and accountant are waiting
as stamp stands back observing and wallis sets up a laptop ambrose walks up to a refectory like table and stands opposite mccloy
ambrose reaches into his coat and puts two cannisters on the table in front of mccloy
mccloys chemist picks up the cannisters and inserts them into two chambers connected to his microscope
its a dna match
the bloods loaded with chimera
an insert of the microscope plate shows the two samples as bellerophen destroys chimera
the chemist presses a button on the chamber and theres a heat flash
the chamber red light moves to green and theres a mechanical voice substance destroyed
chemist contd and they certainly have bellerophen
the kev cannister is out on the table
youve got both the virus and the anti virus chimera and bellerophen
which means ive thirty million for you ambrose doesnt respond
mccloy contd thats all the cash i can come up with not exactly
off biocyte figures on laptop more like two two point two million
in any case we dont want your cash
then what do you want
ambrose picks up a mobile phone and dials
stock options to be a little more precise
into the phone cut her loose
right in the center of town
the more crowded the better
punching off to mccloy how quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus
as he moves along the tunnel ethan suddenly flattens himself against a wall as he receives a transmission from luther
ethan just picked up an ambrose call nyahs been dropped off
i think shes alive
where is she
somewhere in sydney
ethan hears something and ducks into a nearby cavity in the tunnel wall
as a guard approaches ethan steps out of the cavity and knocks the guard out then throws him into the opposite wall
do you copy
somewhere in sydney
care to harden the target
until i can get the gps up on our computer
its still down
the clock is ticking
back to the matter at hand ethan completes the move on the guard and knocks him out
no time at all once ive got it
biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof
alarmed what are you talking about
an outbreak of chimera
in downtown sydney for a start
mccloy is stunned
ambrose contd you create the supply mr
mccloy weve just created the demand
three million people in sydney and million people in australia are going to need bellerophen within a matter of days
not to mention the rest of the world
stealthily approach a couple dozen jittery pigeons cooing and pecking
the intensity of their noise making increases as ethan reaches them
hearing the disruption of the pigeons one of ambroses guards leaves his post at the double doors and head the tunnel toward the birds to investigate
ambroses guard draws his gun and continues approaching the pigeons
before the guard can see him ethan runs forward and sends the pigeons into scattered flight blinding the guard
ethan jumps into a back flip and double kicks first knocking away the guards gun and then knocking him out and flat on his back
ethan continues his flip and lands right back on his feet
now heres the way its going to work
wallis the shares outstanding are
ninety three point four million
which means mr
mccloy we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options
well borrow your thirty million to buy those options
your stocks never sold above thirty one dollars a share
well agree to buy at fifty
ambrose contd when your stock goes north of two hundred and it will those options will be worth billions
we can borrow whatever we need to buy the shares fifty one percent of biocyte
i wont let you take control of my company
youll be a billionaire
better than being broke
ive got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line
balls in your court mr
ethan pulls a can of explosive material form his pack
he rolls it towards the double doors and it stops just before reaching them
then pointing his gun to the ceiling he fires into the air
hears a noise and looks to stamp who heard it as well
stamp nods to two guards to check it out
they head across the room to the double doors
waits for the right moment before raising his and firing at the can of explosives
just as it ignites the guards open the doors and are blown back by force of the explosion
reacts and turns toward the explosion
amidst the flames and debris a single white dove comes flying into the room
and beyond it ambrose can see ethan hunt in silhouette walking slowly past the doorway
run that bastard down
orders are shouted and guards along with stamp hotfoot it down the tunnel corridor in the direction of the explosion
run down the tunnel
the guards move commando style directed by stamps hand signals
ambrose loads his gun and drags the tip of the barrel along the table
were running short on time mr
weve got to conclude our business
mccloy pauses only a moment before nodding to his accountant
yes start the transfer
the accountant begins working on his laptop
to wallis follow it
let me know
pass a couple of doorways
a pigeon flies past stamps face and he stops
as he turn ethan lowers himself from a hiding place in the ceiling
stamp and ethan pull their guns on one another
theyre in a face off until they both agree to drop their guns but stamp catches his in mid air and points it back at ethan
you broke our deal
youre too trusting
raise your hands slowly
as ethan raises his hands he pulls the pin on a grenade and then kicks it between stamps legs
the handle flies off its live
when stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade ethan kicks out his gun
trying to escape the grenade stamp smashes into ethan and seems to have hit him in the jaw
both hit the ground as the grenade explodes with stamp appearing to have the upper hand
as everyone waits for the transfer to complete the grenade explodes out in the tunnel
mccloy and his accountant freeze with alarm as a sprinkling of dust settles on the room
to the accountant keep it going
sean this rats reached the end of the maze
into walkie talkie is he alive
more or less
bring him to me
luther has the gps computer starting to access the satellite
nervously were due to take off
not for seven more minutes
checking his computer screen which shows the transfer has finished successfully
stamp drags ethan in arms pinned with heavy tape
stamp ethan look grimy as sandbags after a busy day of tunneling
ambrose rises to examine his prize
apprehensive what exactly do you intend to do with him
ambrose walks behind ethan and kicks his knees out from under him
ethan falls to the floor
do you copy
luther hears nothing in response but while noise
he looks to billy and indicates theres no answer
well mate maybe this is one of those times we shouldnt follow orders
the rotor blades turn over
to ethan what have you got to say for yourself
any last words
ethan appears as if he wants to respond but cant
ambrose kicks him again
ambrose contd stop mumbling
afraid hes got no choice
i believe i broke his jaw
hugh im impressed
ambrose has picked up a pair of berettas and is proceeding to load both full seventeen round clips
anxiety mounting what do you intend to do
ambrose favors mccloy with a glance of genial exacerbation
you neednt watch
rising off the golf green and banking toward the island
ambrose standing before hunt with a pair of fully loaded berettas
the sound of the helicopter grows
we dont have a lot of time hunt
whatever youve got to say say it now
ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only manage a few guttural progressively desperate sounds which continue as ambrose contd sorry mate i cant understand a bloody
how about giving us a big smile to remember you by
hearing the helicopter no
this is whats known as getting your gun off
with that ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two berettas into ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor
mccloy nearly faints and ambrose laughs at his squeamishness until something on ethans body catches his eye the top of the little finger on the right hand is bleeding
ambrose grabs ethans face and rips off a latex mask revealing stamp eyes wide open and thoroughly lifeless
his jaw under the mask had been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape ethan has used to mount the drain pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall
ambrose contd bloody hell
he looks around but stamp is gone
so is the cannister and kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before
ethans on the motorcycle heading toward the gates which a pair of security guards are frantically trying to close
billy and luther in the copter are over the island and bank so luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of ambroses boat
the guards close the gate ethan runs the motorcycle up the hillock and jumps the gate over onto the bridge
ambrose follows in the suv crashing thru the gate
they race across the bridge and the road onto the huge greensward opposite to and similar in shape to bare island
there with the helicopter hovering ambrose manages to corner ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons hold they move into each other bare handed and engage in ferocious
no holds barred combat the helicopter hovering low enough to keep away whatevers left of ambroses henchmen the choppers downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around them
on bluffs overlooking the city
camera moves slowly to the top of the bluff
with billy flying and luther at the door machine gun in hand the copter nears the bare island gun pit and ethan
runs into the central hole area guns in both hands and wearing the kevlar vest
he runs toward the walled edge of the enclosure and jumps
as he pulls himself up the top of the wall he sees the imf helicopter approaching
a gunman appears from the tunnel entrance and opens fire the bullets exploding into the wall around ethan who jumps out of the way to avoid them
is under fire as well bullets spraying the windshield driving luther back inside and causing billy to turn the chopper around
man at your six
who rolls and returns fire at the gunman
ethan first hits the gunman in the leg and then shoots and explodes the canisters behind the gunman killing him
to billy the field of fire is too heavy
back off and pinpoint their positions
bearing down on him as he stands up
ethan just manages to dive out of its path before a second motorcycle comes up over the hill
ethan flips backwards and fires his pistol shooting the second cyclist off his bike
the motorcycle flies over ethan who runs after it and jumps on revving the throttle and taking off
deploys some of his men via walkie talkie while others scramble into their cars
into walkie talkie hunts heading for the bridge
coming in at twelve oclock high
a gold falcon with several of ambroses men inside enters the bridge from the mainland and speeds toward the island
ambroses men exit the complex and get into their cars
crests a hill aboard the cycle the imf chopper in b
clear that bridge for me
theyre tracking you on the left ethan
prepare for some fire
michaels suv and wallis sedan speed along as a gunman from the suv fires on ethan up the hill spraying bullets around him
approaches the island
luther fires his grenade launcher
it hits the falcons trunk lifting its back wheel off the ground but the falcon keeps coming its trunk ablaze
luther reloads as a gunman leans out the window firing up at ethan on the hill
lays on the cycles throttle accelerates down the hill and propels the bike into the air and off the island just as again fires his grenade launcher this time at
the front of the on the bridge
the grenade explodes at the front of the car and hurls the falcon into the air and off the bridge
is in mid air on the cycle heading down toward the bridge
just as he lands the gold falcon flies off the bridge and ethan speeds through the flames and off onto the mainland
michaels suv arrives and tears through the gate and flames followed by wallis sedan and then ambrose riding a motorcycle
races up the road to find a white falcon approaching
the imf chopper arrives and gunfires exchanged
luther takes a hit in the shoulder and drops his gun as the chopper banks away
luther grips his shoulder in pain and falls back into his seat jarring the gps computer
it responds by beeping and coming to life
nyahs yellow dot pops up on the screen
the target is located
ethan the computers up
ive got nyah
shes moved out of the city
luther say again
shes on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs
one klick away
over increasing static copy
shes only got twenty eight minutes left
track ahead and pick her up
luther bands his shoulder wound and monitors his gps laptop
we wont be able to cover you
slightly slows the bike to concentrate over the static
youre breaking up
track ahead and pick her up
youve got me on gps
bring her to me
ethan pulls out and throws away the earpiece
billy north head
ethan heads downhill as the suv approaches on an adjacent road
he pulls out in front of it immediately drawing fire
without slowing ethan drops to the side his cycle for cover
watches the gps laptop as the chopper speeds over sydney
wallis sedan appears from an adjoining road and pulls in behind ethan who climbs back aboard his cycle
cut off the suv turns onto a side road to intercept ethan
i cant get a good shot
before an intersection ethan both revs and brakes spinning the bike and creating a smoke screen
wallis car enters the smoke
ulrich contd i cant see him mate
i know what im doing
wallis breaks hard but not hard enough he stops just in the path of an oncoming wheeler
his cars demolished
ethan pulls out of the smoke as the suv bursts out of the scrub behind him striking the rear of the cycle
ethan puts his bike into a spin and pulls his gun ending up alongside the suv passenger window
he fires through the window shooting both michael and the bodyguard
the suv veers off crashing into a line of parked cars
it hits the first car and flips up and over landing upside down on several more parked cars
ethan speeds off on his smoking cycle
ambrose arrives and then takes a side road
working on his gps laptop
the range ie the distance from the moving copter to the yellow dot nyah on the edge of the screen is reduced to about two kilometers
to billy range is two kay
i hope theres a place to land
luther looks up from the screen to see the bluff of north head at the entrance to sydneys harbor
tearing down the road when suddenly from a side trail ambrose pulls out behind him and begins firing
ethan weaves to avoid ambroses fire and passes a car pulling in front of it for cover
the car skids forcing ambrose to veer around it
rapidly approaching the north head bluff
there she is
i got visual
were down to seven minutes seconds
moving up behind nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and fifty feet below
camera drops to nyahs shoulder level and moves with her to the bluffs edge
as shes just a few steps away from stepping off theres a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot before her wild eyed billy gesturing stop
ethan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck
ambrose follows as soon as the truck clears
ethan fires backward using his side view mirror to aim exploding ambroses windscreen
ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock knocking him upright
ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub
back on the main road ambrose roars off to intercept ethan
on a clifftop clearing ethan races along as ambrose moves to cut him off
they head toward one another
ethan weve got her
tracking to you now
were reading minutes seconds
ethan and ambrose round a bend and face one another
without hesitating they charge towards each other
as they near one another each leaps forward and off his bike and they collide hard in mid air
they fall to the ground fighting as their bikes skid and ethans explodes raining debris upon them
ethan and ambrose rush towards one another
ethan flips ambrose to the ground
ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster
as ethan knocks it away he loses his own gun and they both fall off a foot cliff
at top speed over sydney
nyah appears weak and shivers
to billy bearing two one zero
into microphone ethan were moments away
ethan and ambrose rise from the fall
ethan jumps up and sweeps ambrose dropping him to the ground
ethan begins strangling ambrose but gets knocked off and when they both stand ambrose gets ethan in a choke hold
ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits ethan in the midsection and the face
ethan kicks it out of his hand and connects with several punches knocking ambrose to the ground
kneeling ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts ethan across the back and face
ambrose dives on ethan and the knife is poised above ethans eye before ethan grabs the knife and clears holding it out toward ambrose
use it hunt
its not a bad way to go
a lot better than the way that bitch is going to die
ambrose swings again and misses and ethan delivers a series of kicks leaving ambrose stunned and barely standing
ethan steps back and with a running start strikes ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand
as they approach in the distance billy luther and nyah finally gain sight of ethan in hand to hand combat
ethan turns and walks away from ambrose toward the cliff edge
the copter lands and luther runs toward ethan but pulls up looking over ethans shoulder
ambrose has a gun aimed at ethans back
you should have killed me
near hunts feet is his own gun obscured from ambroses view by dust from the copter
ethan tosses the canister to luther and then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air
he catches it drops down and fires killing ambrose
ethan reaches nyah at the copter
inches apart they can only stare silently at one another
a child admires a painting
swanbeck and ethan face one another
a long long pause
for a moment it appears as if swanbeck has lost awareness of ethans presence
i dont quite know where to begin
youd like me to conduct my own debriefing
youve done just about everything else on this operation
id thank you but im not sure that was a compliment
of course it was
anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do is bound to get a little flak here and there
you try flogging the stories on cnn ive had to come up with about whats been going on around here the last few days
at any rate its been most instructive what theyll swallow or what theyll broadcast with a straight face
picking up a file miss halls blood it appears has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus
not even antibodies
yes i gathered as much
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose
and that appears to have been destroyed
it also contained the anti virus bellerophon
well bellerophon it turns out was only really effective against chimera
but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus
id be very interested to know how after youd managed its recovery intact it subsequently got destroyed
thats the best way really
so you didnt fail mission you simply changed it
ethan doesnt respond
swanbeck contd its no longer enough for you to execute and implement imf policy you now wish to go in the business of creating it
no i dont
but in this case in this case it wasnt a bad idea
in face it was a pretty damn good idea
just dont make a habit of it
and as for ms
hall in light of her efforts her criminal records will certainly be expunged
im assuming you approve
where is she now by the way
do you know
well hunt what are your plans
some sort of vacation
ill let you know where im going
oh you dont have to do that
wouldnt be a vacation if you did
ethan and swanbeck exchange one final knowing glance
this incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about mr
mccloy and biocytes financial difficulties including criminal allegations of insider trading embezzlement conspiracy to commit fraud and stock parking have understandably sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting
ethan emerges to a very crowded street
billy and luther are waiting
both look to ethan
worried so what did he say
incredulous thats it
dryly looking at billy and the checks in the mall
just remember mates
billy bairds the name
anything you need to get move or watch im your man
and billys gone
ethan and luther remain alone both reluctant to say anything both reluctant to leave
one quick bear hug then always nice hearing from you man
stay in touch
and luthers off
ethan looks after him a bit wistfully
then curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd
after a half dozen steps something catches his eyes
one quick bear hug then a tad wary do you know me
is inches from him
without batting an eye
you just looked as if you did
she wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable conviction
ethan contd just as if id like to
he kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for hers
nyah contd i think that can be arranged
looks around at the swirling crowd lets get lost
and in a moment theyve vanished from the frame and into the crowd
