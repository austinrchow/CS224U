the hanging sign says entering cherry falls ohio we see cherry falls a small town in rural northeastern ohio
this is norman rockwell land red barns on dirt roads a square in the center of town
but things are hidden here
the barns are locked the shades are drawn
dissolve to a romantic turn off used exclusively for parking
a river gushes by
the trees blow in the autumn wind
a single car sits on the lonely road
the muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts through the streamed up windows
a teenage boys hand is under a teenage girls shirt gently massaging her breast
he pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her bare knee
as he starts to slide his hand up her leg she grabs his hand and gently pulls it away
she places it back on her breast sliding it under her shirt
we pull back
stacy and rod two healthy sixteen year olds are passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big american car
rod smiles seductively kisses stacy and places his hand back on her knee
once again she stops him this time just squeezing his hand tightly
he doesnt give up easy
he playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it under her skirt
she grabs his hand again
i said no
but you dont really mean it
he struggles to free his hand
yes i do
keep it in your pants rod
he gives up aggravated
maybe it wont stay in
maybe you better just drive me home
he starts the car glares at her for a second then turns it off
let me just ask you a serious question first
arent you worried you could die a virgin
im extremely worried about that
its right up there with global warming
on our way home a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield
terminate us instantly
wed never experience what it means to make love
if sheep dont count
that wasnt me
im kidding you
well im trying to be real here and youre mocking me
softening im sorry but youre not going to die a virgin rod
there is another car around the bend hidden from sight
its an old beat up imperial from the late sixties
someone is watching them
its probably a psychopath
rod leans in and starts kissing stacy again
i dont wanna take that chance
i want my first time to be with you
she kisses him back
he slides his hand under her skirt again
exasperated youre being unfair
unfair to me
he begins to overpower her
this is quickly turning into date rape
she starts to fight back but he doesnt stop
finally she scratches him savagely across the face
this catches his attention
he jumps back cut slightly surprised
she opens the car door and quickly escapes
she runs away from the car down the road very upset
rod catches himself
he looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror and realizes what hes done
he starts up the car
stacy runs down the road alone still very upset
rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window
she pays no attention to him
please get back in the car stacy
she turns and heads down a path into the dark woods purposely going where he cant follow
rod frustrated hits the steering wheel and floors it
as rods car tears off down the road the other car that was parked at lovers lane drives up and pulls over lights still off
stacy heads deeper into the woods
when she finally stops to catch her breath and wipe away her tears she hears someone approaching her
suddenly the footsteps stop
stacy senses that someone is watching her
is that you rod
still no answer
a little frightened she starts to walk again
again she hears the footsteps following her
she stops again
whoever is out there stops too
she looks around in every direction
come out rod
this scream bull shit aint gonna work with me
even the birds have stopped chirping
youre freaking me out
come out and well fuck
she hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around
she sees the silhouette of someone standing a few feet away
the wind picks up
stacy realizes it isnt rod
all she can see is that whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very long jagged steel nail in the other
in full panic stacy starts to run
the killer starts after her
rod is sitting in his car in front of stacys house at the edge of the woods waiting for her to appear
he checks his watch
stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isnt quite fast enough to elude her pursuer
the killer catches stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against a tree cracking a branch
stacy falls to the ground dazed
rod sits up in his seat thinking hes heard something stacy half conscious bleeding from the head is dragged back deeper into the woods
rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark woods
rods pov the woods are pitch black
struggling in the distance the killer kicks stacy in the side instantly shutting her up
he gags her and ties her to a tree trunk
she struggles but shes no match for the killer
rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment
rods flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods
rod charges through the woods desperately looking for any sign of stacy
stacys right hand is raised above her head and placed palm out against a tree trunk
rod searches for stacy his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness
the huge nail extremely sharp and jagged is placed in the center of stacys outstretched palm
the hammer is pulled back aimed at the head of the nail
rod stops and frantically looks around knowing hes fighting a losing battle
the hammer descends on the nail
stacy screams out in pain even through the gag as he hand is nailed to the tree
rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound
stacys left hand is now placed up against a different tree
another nail is readied
stacy tries to free her nailed hand but its useless
she goes into shock
rods flashlight continues to cut through the night
his feet trample fallen branches
suddenly he stops
hes found her
stacy is stretched out between two trees gagged one hand nailed to each tree
she almost looks crucified
rod starts toward her not sure what to do
he looks into stacys terrified eyes
shes looking behind him
rod quickly turns around but hes too late
a knife comes plunging down toward rods chest
stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping her palms on the nails
rod falls to his knees blood streaming from his chest and mouth
stacy cant even react anymore shes so horrified
the killers hand rips open stacys shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach
stacy looks down terrified of what the killer has planned
a small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is placed up against stacys bare stomach
the killers hand grips it like its an ordinary pencil
stacys eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts
shes never experienced such pain
blood drips to the ground
dissolve to the full moon looks down on the town
another romantic turn off
a view from the top of a hill overlooking the sleepy town
a lonely car sits there the sound of a teenage couple making out drifting through its steamed up windows
its almost a repeat of the first scene
the boy pulls his hand from under the girls shirt and unsnaps her jeans
she pushes his hand away but he puts it right back wriggling a finger down into her pants
jody marken a pretty all american sixteen year old girl strong willed but still innocent stops kissing her boyfriend kenny trying to hold him off
kenny is also sixteen
hes thin and a bit shaggy but very cute nonetheless
his hair is shoulder length his stare intense
he takes himself seriously all rebel
cut it out
i was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago
youre already late
a few more minutes wont matter
he slides a second finger into her pants
she closes her legs making his probing much more difficult
i got to get home
fuck your curfew
most sixth graders can stay out later than you
he starts kissing her again
she pulls his hand out of her pants
he stares at her for a second completely exasperated
he sits up and starts the car
the car squeals away
jody and kenny drive home not talking
he pulls up in front of her house
you know maybe we ought to start seeing other people
jody weve been going out for over a year
i love you but im all out of patience
jody doesnt know what to say
she didnt expect this
jody gets out of the car very upset
kenny takes off not even waiting to see if she gets inside safely leaving her all alone on the dark street
a car backfires in the distance
a nearby noise startles her
somethings behind the garbage cans
she heads quickly up the driveway disappearing behind the house
all is quiet in the house
the back door opens
jody tiptoes up back staircase
jody appears on the second floor
its a family house politely decorated and immaculately clean
she quietly creeps down the hallway toward her room
as she passes her parents room she looks down
shes relieved that no light is coming from under their door
jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door
shes made it
she sits on the bed to catch her breath
something moves in the corner of her room
jody jumps scared
someone is sitting in her rocking chair
its almost ten oclock
daddy you scared me
youre grounded friday night
i was at sandys i just brent marken gets up and heads to the door
hes a big man years old well built
hes dressed in a tree shirt and jeans
your curfew is and you know it little miss
it wont happen again
you said that two weeks ago
most of my friends can stay out until on school nights and on weekends
theyre not all the sheriffs daughter
jody is furious
she lies down on the bed to stew
she might at well have stayed out
the phone in the hallway rings
she leaps up
jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before picking it up
she crosses her fingers praying its kenny
beat one second
to her dad hey adolph its the station
brent comes out and picks up the phone as jody heads back to her room disappointed
jody flops on the bed
brent it shocked
marge marken jodys mother comes out of the bedroom sensing something terrible has happened
marge is a couple of years older than brent
shes a bit lifeless a pretty woman whos whole life is her daughter and a bottle of peachtree schnapps
im on my way
jody sits up on her bed also sensing something big has happened
brent buttons up his shirt
two kids were found mutilated in the woods
lock the door after me
brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs
she and her mom share a concerned glance
brent pulls up
a lot of official cars are already there
a trail of flares eerily light up the woods leading to the crime scene
the murder sit
police cameras flash
stacy is still nailed to the tree
rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood
brent walks up immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight
his deputy jack webber sidles up next to him
her parents reported her missing about an hour ago
a flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene
brent pulls out his flashlight to better survey the carnage
he starts on rod throat slit chest gutted
he then moves to stacy looking at one nailed hand then the other
what kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves think ill nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today
the same type that decides to carve into her stomach
brent finally shines the flashlight beam on stacys stomach
carved into her flesh is the word virgin
high school kids are getting ready for school
body parts are being covered
pants and stocking are pulled up over bare teenage legs
shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests
zippers are pulled tight
buttons are buttoned
the school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars on bikes walking
its a typical small town american high school somewhat repressed but alive
the news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd splits into its various tribes punk rockers jocks potheads cheerleaders nerds
the killing is on everyones mind
jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks it in the bike rack
jodys pov kenny is leaning against a tree talking with a busty girl jody is upset to see kenny flirting with someone else
as she starts toward the front door of the school a few other classmates run up to her
she keeps glancing over at kenny but he doesnt notice her
was stacy raped
my dad never came home last night
jodys pov kenny takes sharons hand for a second
i bet she was
i heard someone stuffed a tent spike up her ass
gives new meaning to the idea of getting nailed
jody doesnt respond
she stares at kenny
jodys pov kenny walks into school with sharon
jody enters her homeroom still upset
her teacher leonard marliston is lecturing the class
leonard is twenty five and quite hip looking for a teacher
he has long somewhat stringy brown hair
he is a bit thin and is dressed casually almost in hippy attire
he wears wire rim glasses and lace up boots
no one understands what leads people to do irrational things
we only know that unpunished violence festers then explodes
jody sits down in the back
witness the l
years of police brutality in forty eight hours
your dads in the principals office
he wants to see you
brent is talking to tom sisler the principal
tom is a wiry hard featured man in his mid forties
they have known each other for a long time but are not really friends
brent knows tom too well
toms a cynical bastard
tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene
you arent planning to tell these kids that virgin was tattooed into both stacy and rod are you
but i am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends
fine just dont mention the carving this is going to be a tough enough day as it is
theres a knock at the door
i just wanted to check that you were okay
ive just never had someone my age die before
its so weird
how well did you know stacy and rod
ive been in the same class with stacy for years but we werent tight or anything
had either of them broken up with someone recently
those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and thats over what god a year now
i want you to head right home after school
is that all
could you tell mr
marliston wed like to see him
whyd you send for lenny marliston
the kids adore him
they confide in him
his patchouli reeking rear might know if stacy and rod were really virgins
why didnt you ask jody that
shes my daughter tom
so you just dont point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex
you worried you might find out how much she actually knows
brent gives tom a keep your cynical shit off my daughter look

he shakes his hand firmly

my daughter speaks highly of you
leonard examines brents face carefully
brent is a little taken aback by his intensity
we have the same color eyes
i guess we do
mark shale a seventeen year old rail thin pothead is sitting at a table in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch
the place is a zoo
cindy a cute mini skirted brunette and ben a frizzy haired tattooed pierced punk rocker are sitting with him
jody is standing at the door with her best friend sandy looking for a place to sit
sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age
she is wearing very little make up a baggy shirt and baggy jeans
although she looks much more tomboyish than jody and a year or two younger she is still quite cute and curvy just lacking a bit in self confidence when it
comes to boys
sandy is staring at mark
go sit next to him
dont you want to talk to him
you watch him eat everyday
i dont watch him eat everyday
you stare at him non stop like every lunch
like most people stare at car accidents
jody imitates sandy
the seat behind him is open
come on i can eavesdrop too
you eventually have to talk to him
all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and theyve been married for twenty years
cindy sees jody approaching and motions her over
jody starts toward her table
thats his table
youre going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now
the other three kids look up as jody sits don
sandy has no choice but to sit down next to mark
she immediately freezes up
did your dad question you this morning
just a little
did he ask you if stacy and rod has ever exchanged bodily fluids
he asked marliston
if they had ever gone all the way
chris berringer was parked i wonder why its so important to know if they fucked
sandy is completely frozen
jody realizes it
mark is paying no attention to her
what i dont understand is why they asked marliston if rod was a virgin
they could have asked you cindy
i never fucked rod
then he must be a virgin
jody nudges sandy under the table trying to prompt her to say something
sandy can only stare at mark as he eats
if im so all used up ben why do you try to hook me up non stop
as fucking if
across the cafeteria a sophomore annette storms in very upset
she confronts dylan her junior boyfriend
youre a shitsucking liar
taunting better than being a cocksucking liar
shut your face
annette leaps on dylan and starts violently scratching him
marliston runs over and pulls her off
he drags annette away
hes been telling people
you can tell me all about it in my office
were all on edge today
he guides her out
sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with mark
whats up with that
mark opens a twinkie and starts to eat it
dylans been telling people that annette gave him a blow job
and she didnt
ben and mark laugh
theres a better chance that he got head from all five spice girls
cindy laughs at sandy
sandy doesnt appreciate being laughed at
i think its funny
im going to start telling people that i saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector
the first meeting hasnt gone well for sandy
jody feels for her and jumps to her rescue
i would if dylan paid me
the bell rings
its the end of the day
all the kids charge out
jody walks out with sandy
flustered what am i supposed to say
nice sweater mark

teasing a bit you could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars
youre so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff
you are sp fucking wrong
you get to be a little chelsea clinton
everyone wants to meet you
party with you

but you cant do any of it

jody stops noticing something
jodys pov kenny is walking to his car with sharon
sandy sees how upset jody is
hes just trying to mess with your head
does she fuck
trying to comfort i doubt it
whod want to fuck her
she probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties
jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to sandy
jenkins called on me in class today
it was so embarrassing
i was seriously spaced
id been thinking about kenny for over twenty minutes
when i snapped out of it i looked pathetic
i was teared up
everyone was staring at me
what did you say
that i was sorry
id drifted off
that id been thinking about stacy and rod
oh nice save
i was desperate
it was gross
kennyll come running back
this is just his way of pressuring you
he says he loves me
personally i think he has a deep almost pathological desire to corrupt you
but i suppose thats a type of love
i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me
musing maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out
youre the one always saying just do it
that was before he pulled this dick me or i dump you shit
i say fuck his best friend
i dont know what im so scared of
want to come in for awhile

sandy hip hops up her driveway and into her house
jody jumps on her bike and pedals off down the street
dissolve to night has set again on the town
an owl hoots
the streets are quiet
the killers car the black imperial lurks in the shadows of a suburban street
the killer is staking out a specific house
annette the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front door
her mother and father are going out
they kiss annette goodbye get in their car and drive away
annette heads back inside and double locks the door
annettes parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside
the killers imperial pulls up across the street
the killers car drives away
a gloved finger pushes in the back doorbell
annette opens the back door
its chain locked
she peeks through the chain someone is standing there in the shadows
its a womans voice
annette has never seen this woman before
we still dont see the killers face
im lisa sherman
he asked me to come talk to you
he feels terrible about those things he said to you in school
really angry he should
four guys hit on me today and not because they find me intellectually stimulating
i think i know how to restore your reputation
excited you do
can i come in
ill need to use the phone
annette isnt sure what to do but this is too important to pass up
annette unlocks the chain
the killer heads inside
the door ominously closes behind them
wine is being poured into already half filled glasses
annettes parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy much looser than when we saw them earlier
they are laughing rubbing each other getting physical
the other husband leans in and kisses annettes mother on the nose
annettes father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing the other wife on the ear
they all laugh
its getting fancy for cherry falls
annette comes charging down the hallway groggy bleeding profusely from the side of her head terrified
more wine is poured
the two couples eye each other giggling
annette charges into her bedroom and slams the door behind her locking it
she quickly pulls her dresser in front of the door
the door handle moves
the killer is on the other side
annette picks up the telephone
the killer kicks the door a couple of times
annette backs away from the door all the way to the window
she grabs a sharp pen holding it like its a knife
the kicking stops all is momentarily quiet
suddenly the killers shadow appears in the window behind annette
the window smashes an d annettes neck is pulled towards the shards of glass that remain in the broken window
annette struggles but shes not strong enough
under the table the other man puts his hand on annettes moms knee
annettes mom smiles at the man drunk and interested
the killer lowers annettes throat closer to the shard of glass
annettes mom pushes the mans hand under her dress
annettes throat touches the glass
shes all but lost
annettes mom lets out a huge laugh knocking over her red win soaking the white tablecloth in red
annettes eyes roll up into her head
annette half alive is dragged out the window
out come the hammer and nails
annettes parents pull into the driveway they are still giggling
its been a great night
they are sauced
annettes parents come inside
she notices a red spot on the carpet and leans over to inspect it
annettes mom starts down the hallway noticing the trail of blood leading to annettes door realizing something is wrong
she tugs at annettes door
the door is still barricaded
her mother frantically tugs at the door
her dad appears
her dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door
it begins to splinter
they break through
annettes dad pushes the dresser out of the way and they barge in
the room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and bloods splattered around it
she notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping oddly caught on something
she walks over frightened gathers her nerve then pulls the shade up
annette has been nailed to the outside of the house her dead eyes looking in
virgin is carved deeply in her forehead
her mother screams
cop cars are everywhere
brent is staring at the word virgin carved into annettes forehead
hes really worried hes figured out that his town is under siege
annettes parents are downstairs shocked
they hug each other having nowhere else to turn
brent enters his own house
marge is waiting for him
is jody still awake
she just turned off her light
brent darts up the stairs
jody is in bed
theres a soft knock on the door
she rolls over
brent walks in and seats himself on the edge of the bed
i have a question to ask you
a personal question
jody sits up pulling the covers up over her breasts
uncomfortable how personal
brent takes a deep breath
hes really uncomfortable
i need to know how far you and kenny went
jody is really uncomfortable with this question
what do you mean
gently probing well i assume you let him kiss you
im not criticizing
very uncomfortable did you two get any further
how much further
i dont think this is i wouldnt ask if i didnt have to
not much further
you never went uh all the way
brent nods worried
hes obviously upset
very worried ok
confused daddy are you upset that im still a virgin
you are upset
upset i thought youd be pleased
im so very proud of you
go back to sleep
he kisses her on the forehead and heads out
she is very confused
brent comes down the stairs
shes still a virgin
did you warn her
let her get at least one more peacefully nights sleep
its a new day
as the kids arrive at school rumors are flying
everyone is a little more on edge
the same tribes exist but kids are starting to glance and listen to kids from other tribes
the social structure is starting to fray
brent is upset confused
if id gone public with this yesterday annette michaels might be alive today
oh god brent is there anything you dont feel guilty about
is there anything you do
focus on the present
you always want to change the past
lets figure out what you are going to tell the parents today not what you should told them yesterday
im going to tell them everything i know
im calling a town meeting for eight p
you tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and were going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands
better than a pile of dead teenagers
the town bell rings in the steeple
its eight oclock
the shops close down
all the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall
the parents arrive
they are all concerned
theyve all heard rumors by now
they hurry into the school whispering to one another
the parents are seated whispering buzzing
brent walks up to the podium
hes very nervous as he looks out at the crowd realizing hes going to really really upset them
he takes a deep breath
i think you all know why i called this town meeting
in the last two days three of our children have been murdered and it appears that we have now established a common link between the killings
the crowd grows still
everyone is interested in this information
well what is it
all three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been
there is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium
very concerned youre almost positive thats who this monster is targeting
we found the word virgin written at both crime scenes
why didnt you tell us this yesterday
we didnt think this was a serial killer
we thought it was an isolated incident
this is all very upsetting to everyone
are you close to an arrest
i cant say we are
what are we supposed to do
what do you mean
what are we supposed to tell our kids
to go out and get laid if they wanna feel safe
i think thats up to each and everyone of you
i cant lock my daughter in the basement
i wouldnt worry about it victor
a few other parents laugh
whats that supposed to mean
what are you saying about my daughter
father starts towards father
tempers are short
getting worried calm down
i was joking
father pushes father
hell of a time to be joking about a thing like that you sick bastard
father swings at him
a fight ensues
other parents start to jump in
tempers are short
brent leaps down to break it up
a match lights a long fuse
fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and roman candles
the firecrackers explode as balls of fire shoot into the night sky
jody is talking on the phone to sandy
sandys room is typical teenage room identical in feel to jodys
really worried what are we going to do
jody is lying on her bed
sandy you have to chill out at least two thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins
he cant butcher all of us
there will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night
the killers imperial pulls up across the street from jodys
not that many
theres going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow
maybe ill finally talk to mark shale
theres a sound on the phone
sandys brother andy has picked it up
im on the phone
andy sandys thirteen year old brother is on the line
i just wanted to offer my services to jody
im willing to help save her life
jody if you want to come over right now
we could slip up into the attic for a few minutes
theres an old mattress up there
andy hangs up laughing
jody chuckles but all of a sudden the line goes dead
jody tries to call back but the phone isnt working
this spooks her
the doorbell rings downstairs
now jody is more than spooked
she goes to the window to see who it is
someone is standing in the shadows below
all jody can make out is that its a woman
jody dressed only in her nightshirt cautiously heads downstairs to the back door
jody looks through the back door window
theres someone in the shadows
jody opens the door a crack
are you jody
once again a womans voice
im kennys aunt lisa
he asked me to come over and talk to you
jody senses something is off
on what side of the family
his mothers side
his mothers an only child
jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is too fast sliding a hand and foot in pushing her way into the house
jody fights to push the door shut but she cant
the killer is stronger
the killers hand gropes for the lock latch
jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric screwdriver sitting in the back pantry
she grabs for the screwdriver with one hand as the killer pushes harder
jody drills the killers elbow
the killer screams and lets go
jody slams the door shut double locking it
jody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door
jody picks up a phone but its dead downstairs too
she looks around
she notices a shadow move across the back window
the killer hasnt left
the killer seems to be following her
jody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet
the killers shadow appears outside
jody runs into the kitchen grabs a knife
the window above her breaks
the killer is right outside
jody runs into the dining room not sure where to go
suddenly the window breaks there
the killer is stalking her from the outside
the house is under siege and jody is trapped in it
she runs from room to room turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes
suddenly there is a silence
jody stops running
she realizes that the killer must be climbing in somewhere
jody isnt sure what to do
she hears something in the family room
she sees the killers shadow cross the window
she runs out
jody creeps through the dark house unsure where to go
jody creeps back into the den
the killer doesnt seem to be there either
the window is broken
the curtains flap in the breeze
she moves toward it wondering whether its safe to climb out
she looks in the mirror
in the mirror jody can see the killers shoes peeking out from under the drapes
the killers in the room
the drapes start to move
jody turns around and swings the bat hitting the killer squarely in the head sending her to the ground pulling the drapes down
jody tears for the front door
jodys too nervous to unlock the front door
she hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs
jody scampers up the staircase but shes not fast enough
the killer grabs her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the staircase breaking the wooden slats
jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the killers hand freeing herself
jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom
jody closes the bathroom door and locks it
the killer starts kicking it in
jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof
the door starts to splinter
jody tries to wriggle her way out but its tight
behind her she hears the door splintering open
jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney using it to pull herself out
the killers hand grabs jodys leg just as jodys pulling herself free
the killer closes the window on jodys leg trapping it inside
out comes the razor
jody fights for her freedom tugging at the chimney kicking and screaming all of a sudden she feels a surge of pain
she screams and kicks with all her might freeing herself her momentum sending her rolling down the roof
she rolls off the roof barely grabbing hold of the gutter hanging from it
the gutter starts to break
above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof
the killers silhouette hovers above ready to grab her
jody knows she has no choice
jody lets go of the gutter
jody falls twenty feet to the ground below
jody smashes to the ground
a neighbor hears the clatter and comes running out to see whats going on
jody lies still on the ground
the killer still in silhouette looks down from the roof
jodys neighbor runs over to help her
jody rolls over still groggy
jody looks up to the roof
jody looks back down at her bloody leg
there is a v carved into it
later that night
police cars are lined up outside the house
police are scouring the house
jody is trying to sup some hot chocolate but her hands are still shaking
it was a she
are you sure
she said she was kennys aunt lisa
her mom comes in with a bottle of cognac ready to pour a little into jodys cup
what are you doing
this will relax her
brent motions towards the cops his co workers who are scurrying around the house
mom gives brent a dirty look and pours just a spot into jodys glass
she sees jody and runs to her
oh my god
are you ok
jody breaks into tears
someone tried to kill me
the phone just went dead
i called the police and ran right over as fast as i could
sandy is really terrified too
dissolve to another morning in cherry falls
the town may look peaceful but it isnt
sandy is getting dressed in her usual manner but he hand is shaking
shes still terrified
she looks at herself in the mirror and decides to make a change
lipstick goes on
mascara and eyeliner follow
sandy examines herself in the mirror
shes all made up
she usually wears a tenth as much
sandy slides into a slightly provocative dress
she looks much hotter than she did when we first met her
sandy starts down the stairs
she stops to check out where her mother is
sandys mother is making breakfast
sandy hurries downstairs grabs her coat and heads out the door hoping her mom wont notice how shes dressed
her mom hears her and catches a glimpse of her new outfit
youre wearing a skirt
sandy doesnt want to get into it
she charges right out the door
sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her
no way is sandy turning around
the kids arrive at school
everyone is freaked
the word spreads fast about jodys attack
many of the kids like sandy have worn a little extra make up or a little tighter jeans
theres a sexual electricity everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear
the normal tribes are disbanding
what are forming in their place are sexual tribes
today at the high school sexual history bands kids together
not aesthetics popularity or wealth
punkers chat with nerds cheerleaders with potheads
in the parking lot we see that aunt lisas imperial is parked
the killer is close by
sandy arrives at school
she looks around
she spots mark talking with cindy and ben
she gathers her confidence up unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has and starts towards them
cindy is laughing at ben
im not fucking you
not for all your cds
you want me to die
i thought you and i were tight
would that impress you
is that what it takes to impress the empress
your mind is just twisted enough
i believe youd do all this just to get a dip or two
sandy walks up
hi mark cindy ben
they all stare at her for a second noticing the change in her appearance
did you want something
she doesnt known what to say
almost frozen yes
beat i was just curious mark if you brought a twinkie today
ben and cindy crack up
that was a really lame stupid question
sarcastically you wonder about that everyday sandy
shut up ben
to sandy actually my mom always packs two
you got a great mom
im lucky to get a zucchini stick
did you want one
trying to cover yeah i was talking about twinkies the other day and i realized i hadnt had one in years
then i remembered seeing you with one
he gets out the twinkie and gives it to her
she unwraps it and takes a bite
ben and cindy watch amazed and entertained
sandy gets a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue a little embarrassed
the sight of her tongue turns mark on
you can have both if you want
no you keep one
the pairing up has started
jody is sitting in the police station working with a sketch artist
a little larger nose
the artist makes a change
jody re examines the picture
the artist picks up the phone and dials
brent we got a sketch
brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch for the first time we see a picture of the killer
she looks about eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave
she looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties
brents face goes white when he sees who it is
jody notices this
you know her
it cant be
who is she daddy
never mind darling
you go back to school
i dont want you missing anymore classes today
he picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office
jody watches through his window sensing hes very very upset
brent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number
jody has never seen her dad like this
she quietly picks up the phone and listens in
her dad is talking to the principal tom sisler
its lisa sherman
but she still looks like were eighteen
on phone thats impossible
growing frantic i swear to god
she told jody she was kennys aunt lisa
im getting this sickly feeling
calm down brent
brent looks out and sees that jody is on the phone eavesdropping
ill call you right back
jody busted hangs up
brent comes storming out
her father is livid
shes never seen him so you were eavesdropping
a little scared no i wasnt
what did you hear
i just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you
you didnt say goodbye
now get back to school
she nods and heads out freaked
her fathers never treated her this harshly before
as jody approaches the high school shes still on the edge given the attack of the night before as well as he dads reaction to the picture
she hears a moan coming from behind some bushes
she stops and notices a girls shoe sticking out from under the bush
worried it might be someone badly hurt she cautiously starts toward it
suddenly a couple of more feet pop out
jody jumps back frightened but then realizes that its just a couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes
jody heads toward the main school entrance
she starts noticing a lot of kids are outside a few more hidden from sight having sex
jody opens her locker
sandy comes running up to her very excited
noticing sandys attire fine
its flattened the whole school
whispering mark invited me to the party
havent you heard
sandy notices that a teacher is nearby
sandy pulls jody into a stairwell
jody is now really intrigued
whispering you cant tell your parents
especially not your dad
whispering its like a pop your cherry party
everyones saying its fuck or die time
youre thinking of sleeping with mark tonight
unless he makes a move during seventh period
didnt you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time
very excited i kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together on the same night
itll be a lot less scary
you have to go
kennyll want to go with you
cindys holding a q and a session at the bleachers
i cant right now
jody you have to go to the party
for your own safety
sandy takes off
cindy is setting with a group of girls the center of attention
you all are such hypocrites
all year long you sit on your judgmental little butts and call me the slut from hell
now you run to me quaking in fear begging for advice
what were we supposed to call you cindy
the slut from heaven
just answer our questions please
sandy runs up
loving the role what do you want to know
what to do
you have to do everything boys are totally clueless when it comes to sex
this answer terrifies the audience
cindy contd it starts with them trying to unhook our bras fumbling around and never changes
wait until they try to put their dicks in you
please dont say they need our help with that
unless you want them to just poke around endlessly
the girls had no idea
three stoners are smoking a bowl in their car
they are not nearly as collaborative or supportive of one another as the girls were
romeo here asked me if chicks has two holes or three
i did not
you did so
i was kidding
were not dude
i know its a total bummer that three kids are dead but im sorry this is kind of great
im way into this
this may be the best of all possible worlds
the killer could be offing chicks who havent given head
they all laugh again and nod slapping hands beavis and butt head style
then id only have to worry about one
they all laugh again
two homely girls one rail thin the other slightly overweight walk back towards the school
well meet someone at the party
you dont know that
if we dont we sit back and watch everyone else camel
thats got to be better than hanging at your house
im not going
they notice a group of kids huddled around a car
they walk up
virgin has been written in blood on one of the windshields
a mutilated boy looks out of the drivers window of the car
the girls faces go white
its another body
more and more kids gather around the murder site
the kids are all freaked giving each other the eye
no one wants to be next
all of a sudden the body moves screaming to the heavens freaking all the kids out
the dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids and teachers run over
everyone heard the scream
homely girl whispers to her friend
pick me up at seven
chaos has taken over the school
hardly anyone is still going to classes
kenny is standing in the hallway looking for jody
he knows her class schedule and that shell be passing by
jody appears from her classroom
she starts toward kenny at first not noticing him
jody looks up and she sees him
she knows what hes there to talk to her about
he runs over to her
very concerned are you o
i heard you got attacked
i was worried about you
did you hear about the bash
i think its really sick
three of our classmates are dead
thats not really the occasion for a party
nobody wants to be the fourth
please go with me
did sharon say no
you know i want to go with you
im so flattered but i cant
theres a killer on the loose
no im really grounded
when i got in late the other night my father was waiting up for me
he grabs her passionately
if you dont want to go with me just say so
say kenny i dont want to make love to you but dont use your dad as an excuse
im so sick of it
im not using him as an excuse
yes you are

i feel like i need you dads permission just to kiss you
jody its time to assert yourself to be a big girl
im going to this party tonight

well go together
i have to go home after school
i have something really important i have to ask my mom
theyre not picking me up until six
ill think about it
he kisses her full throttle
shes into it
she smiles at him as he darts off
shes happy but scared
shes got her guy back at least for the moment
the clock strikes three
the bell rings
kids charge out ready for a memorable evening
jodys mother is in the kitchen preparing dinner watching tv
on tv a series of savage killings has turned this small community of cherry falls ohio inside out
in the last two days three teenagers have been killed a fourth attacked
the killer seems to be targeting high school virgins
heres our wwjb reporter mike stanton outside the local high school with an up to the minute report
mike stanton turns around toward the high school to report on the days events but before he can get a word out a young girl who has recognized him walks
up to him
her girlfriends giggle behind her
hi im mike stanton
she grabs him and kisses him
she runs off giggling with her friends
a boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip humping gesture at the tv camera
jodys mom cant believe what shes seeing on the news
jody walks in the back door
her mom flips off the tv as jody enters the kitchen
i need to ask you something
you can ask me anything
have you ever heard of someone named lisa sherman
moms cutting hand starts to shake
she pretends that she doesnt know who lisa sherman is but she obviously does
who is she
i dont know
where did you hear that name
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone
i he thinks shes the killer
thats what he said
did he say anything else about her
no but he got really weird
like ive never seen him act
really angry and super uptight
lying ive never heard of her
maybe something else was on his mind
i think she lived her a long time ago
like twenty eight years ago
when dad was eighteen
not that i know of
jody is suspicious
jody thinks for a moment then picks her coat back up
where are you going
ill be fine
jody heads out the door
her mother goes to the window very concerned and watches her ride away
she picks up the phone
brent is on the phone
his deputy is with him
whats the address
he hangs up the phone
you found her
theres a lisa shermer living just sixty miles west of here
over the indiana border
we need you here
i can bring her in
ill handle this
brent and the deputy head into the main station area
brent grabs his gun
the desk sergeant is on the phone
sir were getting calls from other towns
boys throughout the country have heard about whats going on here and theyre heading our way apparently looking for girls
put a squad car at every entrance to town
the desk sergeant picks up another call
your wifes on line three
i cant talk to her now
theres a problem with jody
tell her she has to handle it
he heads outside
the deputy walks brent to his car
as bizarre as it may sound seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight
should we close down any eruption
are you sure
were seeing all the signs in town
i like the idea of all the kids in one place
if it happens just keep a man outside until you hear from me
ill be back in a couple of hours
he jumps in his car and speeds away
the gray old ivy covered town library
jody rides up and heads inside
jody enters the vast library
a seventy year old lady miss dunlop is behind the desk robotically stamping the back flaps of books
what can i do for you
hi miss dunlop
where do you keep the old town papers
theyre all on microfiche
what year are you looking for
twenty eight years ago
they head up the stairs and into the microfilm room
this place is empty
everyones getting ready for the party
you heard about that
no one ever shuts up in the libary
kids were whispering about it all day
dont you think its sick
not at all
in fact i thought about going
you miss dunlop
she hands jody the microfiche
unfortunately i qualify
think im too old
i really wish someone had thrown a party like that when i was your age
my life might have been very different
cut to the newspaper headlines from pass by
jody is watching them flash by
she slows down then goes back
shes found what shes looking for
a picture of lisa sherman
its her yearbook picture
she looks eerily identical to the picture that jody drew
the headline reads high school senior attacked in park
jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs
she looks up
the footsteps stop
the old library is still
she senses that someone is watching her
a little scared is that you miss dunlop
she hears a bit of rustling from behind one of the shelves of books directly behind her
a book accidentally drops to the ground
she realizes that someone is right there watching her
she sees a pair of shoes behind the book shelf but she cant see the face
the shoes start around the book shelf toward her
jody leaps to her feet ready to run
her mom appears
you were spying on me
mom looks at the monitor at the picture of lisa shermans face
i want you to come home with me right now jody
who is she
shes nobody you should be concerned with
whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of lisa sherman clothes and all
i think that concerns me
dont make me order you
jody sits back down
you going to drag me out and me in my room until i go to college
marge sits down next to jody and takes her hand
if i have to
please let me protect you
jody is at a crossroads
jody doesnt know what to do
her mother hugs her puts her arm around her and almost lifts her out of her seat
she leads her down the stairs away from the old newspaper
jodys mom leads her across the vast hallway
they come to the door leading out of the library
jody stops and looks back
she sees the old spinster miss dunlop stacking the books
asserting herself im not leaving
i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out
three of my classmates are dead
mom doesnt like this at all
a beautiful garden on the edge of the library
the autumn wind is blowing
the leaves are at the height of foliage
jody and her mom are seated on a carved stone bench
years ago something horrible happened in this town
when i was still in high school
a girl named elizabeth sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors
she was raped
at least thats what she claimed
you didnt believe her
confessing no i believed her
she was in pretty bad shape
inside and out
but the boys were never formally charged
they were children of our leading citizens stars of the football team
and she was a loner
an angry girl that no one really liked
shed called them queers
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them queers
they were proving to her they werent
they were very drunk
things were different back then
you think kids are sexually bottled up today
and the police did nothing
how could you
i dont know
we just did
i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain
against the whole town
the word is mob
ive regretted it ever since
never run with the herd just because theyre the herd
who were they
she didnt want to be asked that
do any of them still live around here
two men left town right after it happened
youre not telling me something
marge takes a deep breath unsure what to say
sisler was one of them
shocked the principal
who was the fourth
marge is stricken
she looks down
its like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground
jody gets it
her mother cant deny it any longer
horrified thats why he called mr
he was one of them
not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened
we both have
jody gets up
he dedicated his life to law enforcement after
jody runs off very upset
jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off
marge sits down and stares straight ahead crushed
the rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads lisa sherman brents police car turns into the driveway
brent pulls up to the house
he sits and stares for a moment
its a dilapidated old house uncared for overgrown a for sale sign stands crookedly in the front yard
brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door stepping over rusty tools and old auto parts
brent lifts his hand and is about to knock
he walks around in a circle composing himself preparing himself to face lisa sherman after all these years
he draws the gun from his holster and knocks
no one answers
he knocks again
no one answers again
a woman the caretaker appears from the side of the house
im looking for lisa sherman
shes not here
you know where i can find her
she works at a church
she resides there
she died a year and a half ago
brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to lisa sherman but also terribly relieved that hell never have to face her
its been a long time since hes confronted his hidden past
he puts his gun away
a bullet to the right cerebellum
she was murdered
she ate a pistol for lunch one day
brent cant help but feel responsible
can you describe her
how old was she
i never met the woman
im just taking care of the place until they sell it
can you get inside
i knew lisa sherman long ago
its extremely important that i get inside and try to verify that its the same woman who lived here
i dont give a fuck what your reasons are
you pay me ten dollars you can go inside otherwise get a warrant
he pulls out his wallet
cut to jody rides up to kennys house
kenny sees her from his bedroom window
kenny comes tearing downstairs
kenny opens the front door very excited
he kisses her yes
jody wipes a tear from her eye
kenny notices how upset she is
whats the matter
jody bursts into tears
she hugs him
he hugs her back and leads her inside
an old rundown house
the clutter smells
whoever lived here had little to no self respect
garbage is piled up in every corner order is nowhere
brent is repulsed by what he sees
he wasnt expecting such chaos
he knows he helped create this mess
is there a picture of her somewhere
was she a crazy woman when you knew her
feeling very guilty no
couldnt tell she going to off herself huh
no you couldnt
ive been in a lot of peoples houses and this ones the creepiest
you should check downstairs
people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements
all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement
the woman flips on the basement light
there are several locks on the door
brent is very scared of what hes going to find down there
brent steps down into the basement
it is a combination prison bedroom
it looks like it hasnt been cleaned in years
water drips for the ceiling
rat traps are everywhere
old broken childs toys are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which are bolted into the wall above a cot
the cot is small the mattress rotted
old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall
huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner
brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it
he pulls out a pair of grown mans trousers
he examines them
they look like theyd fit you
brent things for a moment then throws the pants down
he darts back up the stairs
the caretaker laughs
jody and kenny are in kennys bedroom sitting on his bed
all our parents are weirdoes
i think my dad is into hookers
i know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid
all wound up my dad acts like hes johnny fucking perfect and hes really johnny fucking rapist
compassionately i think this is a big part of growing up
its losing your spiritual virginity
its when you finally discover that your parents arent anything they told you they were
theyre even bigger hypocrites than your friends
i cant believe i listened to one word of his shit
but if hed been sent to jail there would be no jody
so i should feel happy that he got away with it
i dont know
i kind of am
jody still crying stares at kenny for a second then leans in and kisses him with everything shes got ready for action
are you coming to the party
lets just start a party right here right fucking now
jody quickly takes her own shirt off rips off his and pounces on him
hes taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness
he has no idea how to respond to it
brent comes storming out of the hall of records
brent is on the phone
the phone rings
the answering machine picks up
leaving a message tom
lisa sherman is dead
but youll never believe what i found out
meet me at the roadhouse on route nine in a half hour
we need to talk in private
as brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principals desk first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the killers hand holding the
the killer has been listening to the message
tom the principal is sitting in the corner in a large puddle of his own blood tied to the radiator
hes barely alive
his tongue has been cut out his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth
one eye is missing the other one has been left in only so that tom can look into the killers face as hes tortured
the razor blade is lifted off the table
tom braces himself gripping his hands preparing for more pain
the camera moves back to the phone as we hear tom gag and then the killer walking out of the room
jody is all over kenny
hes really weirded out by her aggressiveness
she reaches for his crotch and finds that hes soft
she rolls over embarrassed
worried whats wrong
am i doing something wrong
just making me feel like a piece of meat
im making you feel like meat
jody rolls over a bit pissed off and very confused
you break up with me because i wont fuck you
thats not why we broke up
you flaunt some slut in my face
sharons far from a slut
and when i finally agree to spread my legs you accuse me of treating you like meat
jody youre only doing this to get back at your dad
it doesnt have that much to do with me
she gets up angry and starts putting her clothes back on
that was the wrong note to play
the truth hurts
please dont go
stay well just talk
then go to the party
this party is sick
she heads to the door
three kids are dead
i want to go to this party
then go to the party
run with the herd kenny
just dont spew out all that be an individual assert yourself crap anymore
she heads out very upset
insert a condom slides across the counter
the register rings it up
a teenage boy is standing there buying the condom
the camera pulls back to reveal another teenage boy behind him also holding a condom and then another and another
all told the store is completely jam packed with over a hundred boys all standing in line all buying condoms
sandy is getting ready to go to the party making herself look as hot as possible and she looks hot
theres a knock on the door
shes scared to answer it considering how shes dressed
her dad comes in and sits on the bed
sandy turns away from and buttons her top shirt button up
i know where youre going
concerned you do
your brother told us
im not going to tell you not to go
i couldnt do that
i have something for you
he places something on her dresser smiles at her and leaves
she looks at what hes left
its a condom
carloads of kids head toward cherry falls howling out the windows guzzling beer
police cars screech to a stop barricading the entrances to town preparing for the onslaught
brent is driving out of the indiana town when he sees something out the window
brent pulls over
lisa shermans headstone
its a modern one
her picture is on it
its the same woman as the sketch artist drew
brent stares at the headstone alone in the cemetery feeling ashamed
lisa im so sorry
sandy appears at the top of the stairs decked out ready for the party
her mom bursts into tears
sandy heads toward the front door
her father walks up to her and hugs her
her brother andy smirks in the b
mom cries harder
just think of it like shes having a flu shot
cut to a kid raided his parents liquor cabinet pouring five different types of liquor into a pickle jar
another kid raids his parents weed stash grabbing a handful of buds
a third kid raided his parents medicine cabinet
lots of barbiturates in this house
kids are climbing out their windows climbing down trees and sheet ropes trying to get out sometimes being chased and caught by their parents
one kid is locked in his room another driven far from town
everyones grounded but everyones going to the party any way
kids from other towns park cars at the edge of town and try to sneak into cherry falls through the woods
police try and cut them off
jody pedals quickly down the street
shes going nowhere
she starts to cry
brent pulls into the roadhouse to look for tom sisler
as he walks inside we notice the killers imperial is parked there as well
brents in trouble
marks car pulls up in front of the party house
sandy squeezes his arm excited
music blares from the house
they all hop out and head up to the bash
all sorts of kids make their way across the front lawn
they are carrying pillows sheets blankets anything and everything that will make the wood floors more comfortable
one couple runs towards the front door howling
another boy pulls his obviously frightened girlfriend into the house reassuring her that everything will be fine
lots of kids are milling around outside because two big football players and their dates are guarding the front door
theres a big sign that says couples only
lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn
two computer nerds are hidden behind a tree watching the other kids arrive
they spot the two homely girls we saw earlier
theres jan and heather
lets grab them quick before someone else does
hide your laptop here
you cant bring it
im not leaving it here
nerd heads toward the girls taking his laptop
nerd follows pissed off
they walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact
after several uncomfortable moments someone shouts for an upper window
find someone fast
floor space is almost gone
this only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside
one of the homely girls looks at the laptop
ever play quake
a computer game
the four just gravitate toward each other now coupled
they enter the house next to each other all four terrified none even acknowledging yet that theyre all in danger
ben and cindy arrive
finalizing i get all your cds
not my imports
ok not your imports
all your other cds and your k snowboard
thats an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting
dont flatter yourself
youll be lucky to last ten seconds with me ben
she kisses him passionately and gets out of the car
he follows her smitten like a puppy dog
kids file through the house creating floor space moving furniture piling it high
a keg of beer flows in the corner
rock n roll blares from all directions
jody rides down the street just pedaling fast as fast as she can
shes in her own world very upset
a car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesnt slow down knowing the light is about to change
a boy in a passing car whistles at jody waking her out of her stupor
jody looks up just as the light turns red
she hits her brakes and skids into the tail of the oncoming car
she glances off it and goes sliding off the road into a few garbage cans
the car nicks another car and pulls over
across the street we see that the killers imperial is stopped at the red light
jody gets up shaken
he knees and elbows are badly scratched
the owner of the car comes running over to jody
are you o
are you sure
you dont look ok
jody turns around
her teacher leonard marliston is there
the killers imperial is parked behind him
jody wipes away the tears
starting to cry i am
my house is just a couple of blocks away
why dont you come on over and clean those cuts up
should i put my bike in the back of your car
can you just follow me
the back is full
kids are still arriving from all over but theres no more room in the house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard
one couple spreads out on the roof
a cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on the house
kids are starting to gather and hook up in the town square
as the police try to break up one gathering another one starts
leonard drives down the road
he smiles into his rear view mirror
in leonards rear view mirror we see jody pedaling behind him
a couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite jody to the go to the party
sirens scream out in the distance
leonard pulls into his driveway
jody pulls in behind
she leans the bike on the front porch and they head into the house
you arent going to the party
you know about that too
leonard opens the door to his house
jody walks in behind him
youre not scared
of course im scared
then you should go
you think i should go to the party mr
i really do
for your own safety
jody doesnt know what to make of this
its not what she expected to hear from her teacher
leonard goes into the kitchen
jody sits on the couch and looks around
shes immediately sensing that something is off about the place
its certainly not the way she imagined a teachers house to look
it has all sorts of city plans maps and drawings on the walls
years of cherry falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles
he reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water
he hands her a beer
i just feel so manipulated
my dad my boyfriend and now some psychopath i dont even know
she takes the beer surprised hes giving her alcohol
he kneels down in front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg
were all manipulated
from the moment were born
the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born
we have no real freedom
you of all people should understand that
this may sting
jody is beginning to feel strange
theres something off kilter about this whole encounter
because of your father
the way what his sins shaped you
he starts putting a disinfectant on her wound
what do you know about my father
hes a rapist
the disinfectant hurts
a little scared your father raped someone
lisa sherman was my mother
do you know who that is
i was born nine months after she was raped
one of the four men who raped her is my father
i have no idea which one
youre the killed
yes thats the whole point
this is what i was put on this earth to do
rape the town that raped my mother
steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers
ive planned this since i was a very little boy
you have no real freedom either
your father has cast a shadow that youve never eluded
jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly
hes not letting her get away
jody bolts for the door but she doesnt have time to open it
leonard grabs her and throws her across the room
jody smashes into a table
he bends down to pick her up but she pulls a book case over on him narrowly escaping
she runs for the back door
jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when leonard runs up to her pulls her away from the door and slugs her in the face sending her sprawling
to the ground
he picks her up and punches her a second time breaking her nose knocking her half out
he picks her up by the waist and carries her to the basement stairs
leonard throws jody down into the dark basement
she tumbles down the stairs hitting her head on the cold stone floor
he comes charging down after her closing the door behind them
the cd is now skipping
kids are in every corner bed and closet making out
every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts into higher gear
its a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies under them
giggles and moans are heard every second
sandy and mark are gently kissing in the closet still standing up
mark studies sandys face for a second then slowly lifts her dress sliding his hand on to her thighs
youre so beautiful
so are you
now dont be nervous
youre the one whos hand is shaking
mark smiles embarrassed
theyre falling in love
ecu electronic beeps come off a computer screen as a warrior armed with a huge plasma gun fights his way into a dark cave shooting plasma everywhere
the nerds and the homely girls are in the corner playing the computer game all scared to make a move
people around them are shushing them as they blow up monster
one guy finally has had it
h gets up grabs the laptop and tosses it out the window
nerd is pissed off

homely girl starts to laugh

theres nothing left to do but laugh
and that they do
cindy and ben are naked under a blanket in the corner

sharon turns up the heat on kenny running her hands across his bare chest
kenny breaks off the kiss not really into it
just thinking about something

she kisses him again
he stops her again buttons his shirt

kenny looks around
jody was right this party is sick
kenny buttons his shirt and heads out
sharon is pissed
as jody comes to she finds herself gagged tied to a chair in the dark basement
she cant see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping and a rat scurrying around
she tips her chair over and falls onto the cold floor
she tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the ground
leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back
a body is hidden under a blanket
leonard picks it up
its too heavy
jody cant undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser
she turns herself around to grab for it
she squeezes her hand under the dresser reaching for the shard
the door at the top of the stairs opens
leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket
he throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on
the basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his mothers house
a cot in the same spot
the dresser as well
the lisa sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks
leonard sits jody back up
a little blood drips from jodys closed hands
she has the shard
leonard ties the other body to a chair facing jody
he starts singing sly singing its a family affair its a family affair
he undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of jodys dad
brents bleeding from the forehead nose and mouth
hes badly beaten up
jody gags on her gag
her dad looks her in the eye
well we may be family one in four chance
leonard picks up his razor and starts towards jody
sheriff brent you will be the second of the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die
but first you will watch as i slice up your little girl
brent starts frantically shaking no trying to escape as leonard kneels in front of jody and runs his hands up under her dress exposing her shaved nubile leg
the v is still fresh in her calf
leonard starts to cut an i next to it
jodys face grimaces in pain
blood drips to the ground
her leg starts to shake
youre shaking too much
if you dont stop shaking jody ill have to kill before i carve
we wouldnt want that
jody concentrates on trying to show no pain not to flinch
her father watches horrified
cut to kenny runs down the street heading toward jodys house
he stops to catch his breath for a second
he notices something
jodys bicycle is still leaning against leonards porch
kenny crosses the street to leonards house and inspects the bicycle
leonard continues to work on jodys bare leg starting the r
jody and her father stare at each other helplessly
my mother said after you and your three droogs raped her brent that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms
is that true
did people really call her a slut and tell her you cant shit here
she used to snarl that at me
thats all she really did at least in my direction was snarl
when she looked at me she saw only you
jody gags in pain
brent looks away
open your eyes brent
or will i cause her much more pain
brent opens his eyes
more blood drips
jody starts to lose consciousness barely able to stand it anymore
the doorbell rings
leonard looks up concerned
kenny rings it again
no one answers
he walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the curtains
kennys pov jodys coat and purse are still on the couch
kenny senses that something is really off
he rings again but no one answers
worried he pops the screen
its breaking and entering time
kenny climbs into the living room and looks around
leonard hears kenny
he cant ignore him any longer
who the fuck is breaking into my house
leonard checks jodys and brents ropes are tight then heads up the stairs
as soon as he disappears jody wriggles toward her father and starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass
leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room
leonard sees kenny opening jodys purse checking it out
leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back
my wallets on the mantle when youve finished your rifling kenny
kenny looks up startled
nervously oh hey mr
w whats jodys bike doing on your front porch
that all depends kenny
depends on why the fuck youve broken into your history teachers house
alright marliston i know shes here
what are you talking about
no one here but us chickens
jody cuts through her dads ropes
her dad immediately takes jodys gag off
kenny heads out the door
kenny hears the cry and turns around
that was jody
leonard says nothing
he just stares at kenny
kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate
brent starts kicking on the other side of the locked door
leonard moves towards kenny with the razor
kenny turns just in time
he grabs leonards arm as leonard tries to slit his throat
the door lock starts to shake as brent continues to kick the door open from the other side
leonard picks up a lamp with his free hand and smashes kenny across the head
kenny falls to the ground
the door pops open
brent charges out
leonard turns to him and slashes him across the chest as brent sprays red paint in leonards eyes
leonard screams and lunges at brent
brent grabs leonard
using every ounce of energy he has he throws leonard down the basement stairs
leonard grabs brent as he tumbles down the stairs
the two roll to the bottom smashing their heads along the way
as they come to a stop brent smashes his head hard on the floor
leonard ends up on top of him
he raises the razor and slits brent across the face
jody crawls up the stairs dragging her bad leg
instinctually brent hangs on to leonard as leonard tries to get to jody
leonard slashes brent across the face again
jody crawls to the top of the stairs
leonard does everything he can to get away from brent but brent hangs on
jody watches horrified at the top of the stair
kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls jody away from the gruesome sight as leonard continues to slash brents body open
brent rolls over a bloody mess
kenny slams the door shut as leonard charges up the stairs
kenny holds the door shut with all his might
my dads down there
weve got to get the fuck out of here
kenny pushes a dresser in front of it trapping leonard
i cant walk
i think he cut right through a tendon
leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe
kenny helps jody out the front door
jody and kenny limp out of the house
kenny grabs jodys bike
leonard breaks through the door
leonard runs into the kitchen and looks out the window
kenny and jody are peddling away down the driveway
leonard bursts out of the house and jumps into his car
leonard starts the car
the car squeals out of the driveway rims sparking wildly
kenny frantically pedals the bike up the pristine suburban street
jody hangs on for dear life
go to the police station
deputy webbers at the party
its only three blocks away
leonards car squeals around the corner behind them
leonard steps on the gas
kenny peddles as fast as he can going up onto the sidewalk but that doesnt stop leonard
he comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind kenny ready to run him over
kenny tears up onto a lawn leonard follows him grass spewing up everywhere
kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street
he heads onto the other sidewalk
leonard remains in pursuit knocking into several cars flattening several fences and mutilating a cat along the way
leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street destroying it
leonard pulls up right behind them
he hits the gas
kenny has to turn hard to avoid getting hit
kenny cant hold the bike upright and it slides out from under them
kenny and jody tumble up someones driveway smashing into their fence
leonard cant hold the car straight and it s across several lawns
finally stopping smashing into a parked car
kenny helps jody to her feet
the german shepard that lives in the house comes charging out of the dog door towards them barking and snarling
kenny helps jody over the fence then leaps up on it just as the german shepard snaps at him
he jumps down on the other side safe
the german shepard smells something else and tears away
leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the german shepard comes charging out the open fence
the dog pounces on him starts humping his leg
leonard rolls his eyes
the dog thrusts away
close on the razor
leonard raises the razor contemplates then rolls his eyes
he pushes the dog off of him
it lets out a panted growl almost like its saying going so soon lover boy
leonard hops back in his car speeds off down the street
the dog barks wildly up at the night sky
talk about being left with a hard on
the house is dark
the lights are all out
the deputy checks his watch
a policeman comes running up
we just found another body
he was murdered at school
two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth
killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder
any word from brent
the switchboard is lightning up downtown
kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school
its turning into woodstock except theres no concert
call brent on the horn

what he wants us to do

the deputy jumps into his car

the policeman looks up at the house

jody and kenny climb over a fence into another backyard
jody is limping badly
kenny is helping her along
thanks for coming back for me

she kisses him
he kisses her back
leonard has pulled over down the street from the party
kenny and jody appear from a backyard across the street from the party
the officer sits in his car trying to call brent
no answer come in brent
theres a knock at the car window
the officer looks up startled
leonard is looking in the window
the officer rolls down the window
jesus christ had balls in his soup marliston whatd you do eat out a pizza or something

leonard slashes the officers throat open in one savage swoop
he slumps over the steering wheel throat cut beyond repair blood squirting everywhere
humming family affair
oh yes its a family affair
jody and kenny limp up to the party
there are no police outside
where are the police
jody looks down the road lets out a blood curdling scream
leonard is slowly limping towards the house gore dripping razor in hands
oh god its him
in the house
he wont look for us in there
kenny and jody limp toward the front door
kenny and jody limp through the front door
couples are everywhere
theres no room to even walk
the party has reached its climax
we see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity
they run the gamut of emotions
some are terrified some are ecstatic
some are concentrating as hard as theyve ever concentrated some are closing their eyes trying to fade out
we see sandy mark cindy and ben all having a blast
sharon has managed to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls
kenny and jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of bodies looking for a place to hide
kenny grabs a sheet off the ground and carries jody up the stairs
kenny carries jody into the huge bedroom
a couple of kids look up as the door opens
there must be over a teenagers in the room adjoining bathroom and closets
the room is just a sea of kids humping two deep under blankets
theres no room in here
get lost were packed
kenny pays no attention to them
he shoves his way into a corner pissing off everyone on the way stepping on a few hands and other appendages
he puts jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt
whispering what are you doing
pretend were just another couple
he pulls her under the sheet
leonard comes in the front door his razor in hand the policemans blood still dripping from it
he looks around wondering if theyre here
no one seems to notice leonard as he hunts for jody and kenny walking through the sea of bodies dripping blood on the backs of a couple of kids
a serial killer at a fuckfest
leonard smiles at the sight of all the teenagers copulating
kenny and jody curl up next to each other
kenny kisses her
she kisses him back
theyre into each other
they cant keep their hands off each other
they start to really make out
leonard moves into one of the bedrooms
he switches the lights on
the kids look up pissed off
theres not an inch of floor space
turn that off
he steps over a thrusting hairy ass surveys the room
freaked what are you doing here
the girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence
leonard flips the lights off and heads out of the room
through out the entire proceedings everyone was fucking like no one entered the room
homeostasis remains stable
leonard heads up the stairs still looking for kenny and jody
a couple of kids on the staircase notice him
he almost trips on one
they start whispering to each other freaked out that a teacher is there
more and more kids start looking up the party has definitely been disturbed
jody hears the disturbance
she stops kenny and listens
leonard checks another bedroom
he flips the lights on
no jody no kenny
more and more kids notice him
jody and kenny know hes close
leonard appears in the doorway
whispering its him
leonard accidentally steps on a boys hand as he enters the room
the boy jimmy is pissed off
he looks up and realizes who it is

touche leonard winds back slashes at jimmy lopping off his dick
blood flies up splatters across jimmys face
leonard slashes open his neck
blood splatters everywhere on kids backs faces butts
his girlfriend screams as jimmy falls to the ground dying
leonard begins to panic
so do the kids
leonard sees jody across the room and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and stampede the fuck out of dodge like a
herd of frightened elephants
kids in other rooms hear the commotion and break their embraces
and hes horny
panic sweeps through the whole party
everyone wants out
leonard cant get to jody because too many kids are trying to get out the bedroom door pushing toward it sweeping him up in their flow
it has turned quickly into chaos with a teenage logjam at the door
leonard keeps his eyes pinned on jody across the room through the bodies
he cant make headway so he raises the razor to slash way to her
jody sees him raise the razor
leonard starts slashing his way toward jody
he slashes a girl across the stomach a boy across the face a girl across the breasts
its a bloodbath everyones screaming
kids bodies fall to the ground tripping people creating even more chaos
leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede over him
jody and kenny try to make it to the door
leonard tries to get up but he cant
he starts crawling toward jody slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way sending them to the ground
one kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table exploding it sending a shard of glass out his throat
blood sprays across the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler
through the sea of legs leonard sees jodys leg the vir still freshly carved
he slashes his way towards jody
half naked kids come streaming out of the house its a bizarre sight
some of them stop and scream noticing the deputy his body has been hung upside down from a telephone pole and disemboweled
the house is almost bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back
too many kids are trying to get out at one
the staircase and all the hallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward
somethings got to give
leonard keeps crawling toward jody getting closer and closer
he scrunches over jimmys severed penis staining his khakis with gore
these are eighty dollar independent khakis
god damn it
the pushing continues
theres nowhere to go
a boy gets pushed over the balcony falling to the ground below
leonard is just a few feet from jodys leg
jody and kenny push closer to the door
leonard reaches for jodys leg
he cant quite grab it
kenny and jody reach the door
theyre almost out
leonard lungs and grabs jodys leg
jody screams out in pain falls into the crowd
kenny tries to grab for her but he cant reach her
the force of the mob pushes him out the door through the vortex
kids jam the staircase
theres too many trying to get down at once
everyones still pushing
the kids on the staircase cant keep their position and start falling forward pushing harder
leonard keeps hold of jodys leg and pulls her toward him
kenny tries to get back to jody but theres no way he can make headway back into that room
the staircase is now jammed with people starts to buckle
the banister breaks
kids start falling off the balcony and staircase onto kids below cracking skulls breaking bones
lamps smash to the ground
tables are trampled
basically the entire inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out of fucking jumanji to shame
leonard gets hold of jodys waist and pulls her towards him razor ready
everyone gives one final push out
kenny is swept on to the staircase
it cant take the pressure and finally cracks
kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the staircase splinters
hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed over the edge
its a disaster
broken boned teenagers litter the floor like it were a battlefield
kenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him
the whole house begins to buckle
the room empties as the kids push out
leonard pulls jody up next to him and puts the razor to her neck
he draws the first spot of blood
you wouldnt kill your sister would you
you think youre my sister
kenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor
jody turns to look at leonard as kenny appears in the doorway
we have the same color eyes
he looks into her eyes
leonard stares at jody for a moment relaxing his grip giving kenny just the break he needs to dive for leonards arm surprising him knocking him over
they struggle for the razor but leonard overpowers him and grabs it cutting his own hand
he turns and slices kenny down the side cutting him deep
kenny fights off the pain and leaps on leonards back grabbing his arm around the neck
leonard stands up and twirls around trying to knock kenny off his back smashing him into walls
kenny screams in pain but doesnt let go pulling at leonards face and throat
leonard spins faster
jody struggles to her feet holding her neck still losing a little blood
kennys grips start to slip as leonard reaches back to slice him across the face and neck
leonard backs up towards the window slips over a dildo
he screams loses his grip on kenny goes crashing out the second story window
leonard crashes to the ground below landing on his back on the front steps
jody looks out after him
he looks up to her
their eyes meet
kids start circling leonard
leonard gets to his knees still holding the razor
they start taunting him
its the freak
the kids inch closer to leonard
hes still got the blade
one kid kicks him
leonard slashes at the kid but misses
another boy kicks the knife out of his hands
a third picks it up
its fuck him up time
one boy kicks leonard in the face
another kicks him in the ribs another in the balls
leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all descend on him taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out of him
its a feeding frenzy
he disappears under the angry mob of teenagers
jody helps kenny to his feet
lets get out of here
police cars screech to a stop out front
the kids are all disappearing off down the street
jody and kenny emerge out the front door look down at leonard barely alive lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps
p please help me
leonard spits up blood
kenny covers her eyes
close on the balcony overhead
the railing breaks off and the balcony comes crashing down falling on leonard killing him
jody embraces kenny tightly
its all over now
dissolve to cemetery brents coffin is in a grave
people are leaving the funeral
jody is with her mom
they are the last ones there
they watch as the workers start to throw dirt on the coffin
jody takes her moms hand in her own
theyre close again
dissolve to its night
jody is asleep
someone is in the shadows outside climbing up to her bedroom window
intruders pov through the window jody is sound asleep in her bed vulnerable
the window opens
someone steps in and moves quietly over to the edge of the bed
she wakes startled
she looks up
smiling im all out of patience
he climbs in her bed and takes her
she lets him
shes into it
a pair of eyes peer through the slates of jodys closet door
someone is hidden in her closet
killers pov jody and kenny are now in the middle of making love for the first time
its getting hot
oh god this is the way it should be
the closet door opens
the real lisa sherman is there
maybe she wasnt dead after all
she starts toward jody raising a huge butcher knife over her head
jody sees her and screams
the knife comes down toward the center of kennys back
his face contorts as the knife enters his body
jody screams as he coughs up blood all over her breasts
he looks helplessly at jody dying as the knife comes down again
but now its her father whos doing the stabbing
jody wakes up from her dream startled and shaken
she looks next to herself in bed
kenny is lying there asleep smiling probably dreaming of her
the window is open
he must have climbed in
there is a little red spot on the sheet next to her
she cuddles up next to him as the sun starts to rise outside
dissolve to the entrance to the town
the hanging sign reads entering cherry falls ohio
the beautiful town is now peaceful again
the crickets are chirping the robins begin cooing
suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign begins to sway back and forth almost on its own
