scream early draft nd draft revised a big dramatic crescendo as we friday night traffic as usual
things appear to be backed up all the way to the valley
a cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly a new explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock
behind the wheel is hot teen heartthrob and hollywood everybody ben damon
ben is handsome studly in his early s
however aside from being just another pretty face in the city of angels hes also a cocky arrogant prick
bens in the middle of a heated argument on his cell with his agent cathy
into cell god dammit cathy i have no time for this crap
im supposed to be at the premiere of stab right now arm and arm with my girlfriend cause shes got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit
and im just going to humor her

i bet they are
look my batterys dying
but of course we notice bens battery is fine hes just trying to cut the conversation short
alright hon talk to you when the lights go down
ben hangs up
he reclines back in his seat
camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him
hes not going anywhere
ben opens the glove compartment
papers scatter out
ben reaches for a card
a small white business card wet cock ben smiles begins to dial out when suddenly ring ring
the cell comes to life in his hand
answers call hello
who is this
who is this
at this point we know who the caller is
its the nightmarish deep voice weve all come to know and hate from the first two films
its never sounded so evil
well what number are you trying to reach
i dont know
i think you got the wrong number buddy
peeved uh huh
look bro my battery is running out
really wish i could chat but i cant so later

you almost sound like that guy from theres something about carrie
smiling profusely well ya got me
im ben damon
youre such a talented actor
loves the praise thanks
now lets see you act your way out of this one
the voice seems to have changed tones
it now sounds a lot harsher angrier if you will
what do you mean
i mean im standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater
your girlfriend christine is in there
shes all alone
everyones in the auditorium waiting for the film to start
laughs coldly ive got my knife
note at this point we intercut shots of the empty lobby and halls of the plaza theater
a pov shot standing outside the ladies room door
turning pale listen you sick fuck is this your idea of a joke
more of a game really
what kind of a game
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies
heres how we play
i ask you a question
you get it right your girlfriend lives
you answer wrong she dies
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her ill fucking kill you
maybe so but right now we play the game
first question your girlfriends counting on you name your girlfriends character in stab
he bangs his head against the steering wheel if only hed have paid attention to christine he might have known this
dont you know
hesitating its cici
cicis the name of the character she plays in the movie
now we play round
but i did everything you said to do
and you beat round
now were taking the game to a whole new level
meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes
ill have your girlfriend
well be waiting
good bye ben
the killer hangs up
ben flips open the phone dials
ringing and then
off phone due to the high volume of calls this evening dispatch is temporarily shut down
if this is not a real emergency please call another dep ben hangs up dials christines number
ringing then youre not playing by the rules ben
dont you want her to live
i swear to god if you lay one hand on her
you listen to me if youre not where i want you in fifteen minutes ill hollow her out
do you understand
in the b
we hear christines horrific screaming
the killer hangs up
ben looks ahead traffic is picking up
he puts the suv into gear peels out the nearest opening narrowly avoiding collision
his car screeches down the off ramp
ben comes screeching around the corner in his ford explorer
the hollywood sign stands like an impending pall in the awaiting b
the suv comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly narrow road
ben jumps out of his car cell phone in hand
he looks up at the towering sign standing ahead of him contemplates
does he really wanna go up there
he looks into his suv gets an idea
ben reaches in looking for a weapon
an old beach chair
not gonna do the trick
a pair of old shoes
then he finds it a louisville slugger with actors at bat for brain cancer written across it
to himself thank god i decided to do some community service
ben takes the bat closes up the back of the suv
he begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly ben answers the call
into phone yeah
you follow directions well
now for the final part of the game
put down the bat and approach the sign slowly
ben makes a disgusted face tosses the bat into the bushes
he approaches the sign keeping his eyes trained in all directions
into phone where are you
closer than you think
into phone alright im here
what the fuck do you want from me
to see your reaction
reaction to what
ben passes under the huge pallid h in the sign
what seems at first like a gentle raindrop beads down bens forehead
he rolls back his head his legs turning to jelly his eyes widening in horror
has been gutted from neck to groin
she has been fastened to the cross bar in the h with heavy rope
her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the southern california wind
utterly horrified ben staggers into the shadows not seeing the ghost as he rises from the void knife in hand
in one quick brutal stab the knife is driven into bens spine
ben screams as hes turned around face to face with his attacker
screaming you just lost the role ben
consider this your parting gift
and with that the ghost drives the bloodstained knife into bens heart causing a vicious eruption of crimson
gale weathers the flashy thirty something news anchor and author of the woodsboro murders
she sits behind a desk on the really ditzy loud set for total entertainment an et style program with a live studio audience
good morning hollywood
and today officially starts the summer movie season
opening the box office this week is jeff bridges and tim robins in arlington street eugene levy and jason biggs in american pastry and tori spelling and david schwimmer in
stab based off my best selling book the windsor murders
camera pans across the audience
many of them are dressed as the ghost
a sea of white screaming faces
very eerie and unsettling
well i see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion
today we have director of the upcoming stab return to woodsboro roman bridger
why dont we give mr
bridger a nice welcome to the set of total entertainment
the crowd goes wild with applause and faux knife slashes as roman bridger ravishingly handsome tall and stocky enters stage dressed in a flashy white suit
he sits down on a chair beside gales desk places a stab coffee mug beside gales hand
good morning gale
pleasure to be here
its a pleasure to finally meet you roman
addressing audience well its a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre
and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy have no fear roman is here
aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe were going to pull off one of the best stabs yet
roman from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way
a beat honestly though smiles tell us whats your favorite scary movie
a long pause honestly my life
a eclectic hush falls over the crowd
roman appears somewhat sinister in this light
gale gazes deeply into romans eyes
well if you were in my shoes dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis youd watch how quick your life goes from
a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick
the true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause
gale somewhat distracted other what not caring what this second rate director has to say gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set watching from a
half open exit door
now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming
a loud buzzing o
gale is startled out of her skin
she looks up at a sign hanging over the stage
the word commercial break is illuminated in flashing red light
gale sighs looks back to the exit
the ghost is gone
she turns to roman
would you excuse me for a moment
gale bolts for gale races around the corner of the set smashing right into detective mark kincaid l
handsome with piercing eyes
he grabs gale by her shoulders shepherding her aside
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me
im sorry miss weathers
allow me to introduce myself mark kincaid l
flashes badge are you familiar with the actor ben damon or the actress christine perkins
well i interviewed damon once for the show
he was a real obnoxious fuck
any way the second one christine perkins she had a part in stab didnt she
she was playing cici
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign
autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films
so is that why youre here
is that why youre holding me from my show to tell me about some brutal homicide im not even involved in
i wish that was all miss weathers but theres more
the killer left a note
detective kincaid reaches into his back pocket pulls up a newspaper clipping in a ziplock evidence bag
he holds the bag up for gale to see
extremely close on the article
maureen prescott mother and wife found brutally raped and murdered in bedroom
a b w photo of sidneys mother maureen stands hauntingly before the camera
thats sidney prescotts mother
kincaid flips the article over
someone has scrawled in black marker across the back sidney
ive tried to get in touch with sidney prescott but shes keeping herself very well hidden
youre my one and only hope in finding her
her life may be in grave danger
id love to help really i wouldnt mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath but i honestly dont know where sidney is
after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth
the only other person that might know is gale hesitates not going to talk
and who would that be
a red bmw convertible speeds through the back lot
behind the wheel is dewey rielly
former police officer turned technical advisor on the red hot set of all around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film
dewey parks his car outside a soundstage exits
a huge replication of woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane hanger
in one corner weve got the macher and prescott homes
in another corner stands the infamous becker house where the nightmare all began
in other regions are sights like the town square and market an exterior for the woodsboro police station a top story news van etc
dewey enters set bumping into his movie alter ego tom prinze a hollywood poster boy
not so debonair
a shoddy copy of dewey at best
however the conversation between the two is friendly and they exchange greetings
hey dew did you hear
somebody iced ben damon and his girlfriend
thats hollywood tom
one day youre making movies in the hills the next day youre posing for the coroner downtown on a slab
deweys obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film
he walks past a clique of stab s main cast theres sarah darling playing a year old bimbo
extremely nadve looking
she won her part in stab playing sidney through a phone in radio contest
shes timid with short dark hair
out of the entire cast she is the closet to sidney they got
and also the loveable tyson jackson late s african american all attitude
the three flip through pages of the stab script conversing freely about the production
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re writes
its like every five minutes theres a new script
god and you just know this all because of stab s script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting
and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend
beat out american pasty and arlington street
i think jeff bridges is getting tired
nah i think its doing so damn well because one of its players got iced
i just hope none of us end up dead
oh thats right
those poor poor people
god ben damon was such a hottie
sighs and that cici chick wasnt that bad either but im really concerned about my safety now
what are you talking about
the murders were a completely isolated incident
reading from script what are you talking about ricky the murders were a completely isolated incident
would you give that script a rest
its like a friggen umbilical cord to you
im just saying though
what if theres someone out there stalking actors
theres always someone out there stalking actors
look at that woman from the commish
no the other one
the one who played his wife
i know who youre talking about
yeah i think
anyway point is she had a stalker
sonny bono had a stalker
david letterman had one too
so did heather langenkamp brooke sheilds jody foster listen miss ingenue your cheering me up to much give it a break
tom walks into frame sits down next to angelina subtly putting his arm around her
she shoves him away
whatd i do
relax your crack sweetheart i didnt rip those two fucks up last night
lights up a smoke so what are you doing tonight
totally repulsed angelina gets up races off set
talk about moody
tom leans back seductively his crotch in full view staring at sarah with bedroom eyes
and how about you good looking
got any plans for later
eww yeah finding a guy to have sex with that doesnt look like you
sarah following suit laid by angelina scampers off set
tom looks up at tyson smoke blowing out his nostrils
i aint into that shit
tyson races off set
tom laughs covers his face
they walk through the set
kincaid is all business
dejr vu do
the pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the macher residence
everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t
even a foam dummy of tatum rielly dangles from the doggy door head squashed a bloody mess
gale stares at the swaying dummy haunted
well well someone dies and gale weathers comes running
what a shock
gale looks up
dewey stands beside her
my name is mark kincaid
im with the l
are you aware of last nights events
a real tragedy
dewey stares daggers through gale
there is a real bitter coldness between the two
dewey personal lives and pasts aside this is about sidney
we need to know where she is
what so you can just exploit her again with another book
sid doesnt need you gale
to kincaid show him
rielly this was found alongside the bodies of ben and his girlfriend
kincaid hands dewey the ziplocked clipping
dewey examines it his fear slowly growing
i promised sid id keep her in seclusion
i promised her nobody would ever find her
if you dont mind detective id like to approach her with this on my own and see what shed like to do about it
thats fine mr
rielly but if anyone else should die im going to have to get a warrant
a beat if youll excuse me detective
dewey walks off camera
kincaid puts his hand on gales shoulder
im going to have a little chat with the producers
dont wander off
i may need you
gale nods as kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set
a shrill voice gale weathers
oh my god
jennifer jolie an ambitious young starlet playing gale in the latest stab rushes towards her with arms wide open
shes decked out in the flashy neon green ensemble gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on her right eye
gale is obviously pissed
she knows this actress and doesnt really want to be in her company very long
jennifer listen i know weve never met and i dont mind you never returning my calls but i have to tell you that after two films i feel like i
am in your mind
gale well that would explain my constant headaches
jennifer defensively you know im sorry that things didnt work out on minutes ii but total entertainment thats a pretty good fall back
gale thank you
im sorry that things didnt work out with brad pitt but being single thats a pretty good fall back
jennifer gives me more time for my work
after all gale weathers youre such a complex character
gale and to be played by an actress with such depth and range
dewey steps back into the picture cell phone in hand
dewey no answer at sids
whered the detective go
excitedly gale stares at the couple just processing things in her head
jennifer fondles deweys butt gale i think youll really appreciate my character work in this one someones helped me understand the real you
jennifer the ruthless ambition your private self loathing and that lost and lonely little girl inside
gale lost and lonely what
jennifer you heard me
takes deweys cellular thanks dewey

gale lost and lonely what
dewey little girl inside
gale i thought you were supposed to be in woodsboro
dewey well im surprised you thought about me at all
listen i gotta get back to trying to get hold of sid
besides shes more important than you ever were
dewey we can work on this together
as a team
like in the past
dewey no really gale thats a sweet offer but this time id like to catch the killer before the body count gets any higher
a beat toodles
dewey walks away leaving gale alone
kincaid enters frame talking to two producers
the elder sixty five year old buddy shayne a towering hefty man with gray hair
the second bigwig horror producer john milton a creepy fifty something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor
the two talk ignoring gale the entire time
shes almost eavesdropping on their conversation
i can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high
again the deaths are sheer tragedy
well id hate to see the production shut down
laughs i myself am a big stab fan
smiles have you ever thought about acting
youve got just the right face
i am kind of dedicated to my job
although i do enjoy taking acting classes on my weekends
i grew up around these studios anyway
i know my way around
my uncle was a screenwriter for paramount
really what was his name
before kincaid can finish gale buts in
excuse me detective i think we have some business to attend to
flabbergasted gale weathers
what are you doing here
no press on the set
to security no press no press on set
get that woman out of here
approaching yes mr
milton miss weathers is with me
milton nods his head flags down the guard
he walks away
well then i guess ill be leaving then
oh come on
why the hostility
listen lois lane i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because im a
sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls
it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superiors attentions
shit eating smile on her face theyre the ones who approved it
milton storms off camera buddy following close behind
gale looks up at kincaid
alright kincaid no where to
i go to the police station and do my job and you go back to being gale weathers
i thought you wanted me to stick around
look miss weathers if theres a problem give me a call
heres my card
im always there
kincaid hands gale his card begins to walk out of the building
can i even get a ride home
sidney prescott the stoic survivor
now she lies peacefully in bed her black lab pete curled up in a ball at her feet
a noise startles the animal awake
it sets off the bed barking hysterically at awakens
she squints her eyes to try and make out what her dog is going into conniptions over
then she sees and her face loses any trace of color
maureen prescotts ghostly wraith is pressed up against the window
shes wearing a tattered blood soaked night shift
her voice is muted but her lips are moving as if trying torelay a message to sidney
sids hysterical crying
she slidesoff her bed makes her way towards the window when suddenly maureen slides down the glass as if being pulled by somethingbeneath the window sill
something we dont see
left behind in her wake are five bloody streaks running downthe glass
the streaks begin to bleed as if each wounds themselves
they bleed right through the glass
sidneyreaches out to touch them when suddenly the ghost springs up behind the window shatters the glass panewith his fist
sidney screams her dogs barking wildly
the window is fine
sid crawls out of bed disappearing out of the room
sids washing up at the sink
she wipes the tears from her eyes
she shuts off the running water looks up into the mirror
her demeanor definitely shows the ware and tear of all thats happened to her in her past
close on sidneys wrists
two ugly scars run up sids wrists
battle scars of a war waged between her own personal demons if you wish
former suicide attempts former engraved on time
sids house is deep within the napa valley
secluded amongst verdant vineyards and orchards that are now covered by thedarkness of night
a full moon hangs ominously in the sky above
a light burns from within the two story farmhouse
a phone dialing out rises in pre lap as we sid sits in a cluttered office
on the wall hangs a poster forthe fall of troy her play from scream and a poster proclaiming womens rights with california womens crisis center written beneath that
a three ring binder with a cover boasting california womens crisis center is thrown open
sid puts on a headset dials a number
into headset this is laura in monterey reporting in for work
alright laura ill patch you right in to a call
a womans voice comes on the other line
it sounds very familiar

d prominent actor ben damon was slated for a role in the upcoming stab return to woodsboro sidney shuts off the tv as a familiar voice cuts through the din

and ive got my eyes set on a technical advisor named dewey rielly
the killer laughs coldly
crying if you lay a hand on him ill fucking kill you
a spirited one
ill be seeing you real soon sidney
the killer hangs up
sids left trembling
she rips the headset out of the phone reaches into her desk for a loaded
she stands up and peers out her office window
sarah darling drives through the main gates in her porshe rounds a corner
sarah parks outside the production offices gets out of her car
v watching from the rooftop sarah approaching the dimly lit offices
sarah steps into the office
all over the place are promotional items standees posters banners for stabs
sarah passes a big cardboard ghost
oh god ive gotta get myself a better agent
sarah walks down a hallway
calling out anybody home
sarah passes roman bridgers office
its half open
door slams shut o
sarah continues further down the hall when suddenly tyson comes reeling out of a doorway a huge knife jutting out his back blood trickling down his mouth
sarah lets out a bloodcurdling scream while tyson breaks into hysterics
my man does great work
stan a bearded middle aged make up effects guy steps out behind tyson slaps him a high five
thank you very much
fuck you very much
tyson go to hell
what the hell are you doing here
roman and everybody else went home for the night
im here for a make up test
you need it
a beat hey roman isnt here
he called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight
jokingly yeah i bet
stan pantomimes the blow job gesture
tyson laughs slaps him another high five
sarah makes a disgusted face as the two men leave the offices
sarah sighs ducks into romans office
romans office is a clutter of old movie memorabilia
sarah plops down behind romans desk admires his old transformer toys and two brass music video awards
sarah examines the award
reading inscription for the honorary field of directing and cinematography in music videos
how to the point
the phone rings scaring the shit out of sarah
she drops the award causing it to smash against the edge of the desk snapping the head clean off
sarah hesitates answers the call putting it on speaker phone
into phone hello
sarah its roman im sorry im running late im still on the im about minutes away
oh its no problem im just
looking at your music video awards
sarah tries fixing the award with some scotch tape
all right since i got you on the phone lets talk about your character

i dont understand why i have to start the scene in the shower

im hanging up right now
roman thats not the line
it is in my script
has there been another goddamn rewrite
how the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when theres a new script every minutes
its not just a new script its a new movie
a pause then a familiar dark natured noise enters our ears the killers sinister voice
its called sarah gets sliced like a fucking pig
still in character sarah
sarah tosses down the phone bolts out of the office
sarah stops in her tracks
through the smoked glass of the front door she sees a shape approaching
she screams spins around runs for the prop room
sarah locks the door backs up right into at least thirty ghost costumes dangle from hooks on costume racks
sarah catches her breath dives into one of the racks
she pulls up her cell phone starts to dial
a security guard opens the front door pokes his head into the offices
the guard nods backs out of the offices locking them with sarah and the killer inside
sarahs waiting on eggs as a digitized pre programmed commissarymenu for sunrise studios drags out
sarah momentarily glances behind her just noticing a pair of black work boots stepping off the costume rack
before sarah has a chance to scream the ghost jumps down and shoves the rack hard sending a screaming sarah into the next room
she goes flying out slamming into a metal table covered with prop weapons
stomps into the second prop room knife raised
sarah leaps up starts to chuck the prop knives at her attacker screaming furiously
the prop knives hit the ghost and bend as they bounce off his body and onto the floor
the killer shakes his head angrily stalks towards his prey
the ghost drives his knife into sarahs chest once twice and delivers a final killing blow to her adams apple
she staggers forward
her killer grabs her by her long buxom hair and hucks her into a glass door
the door explodes sarahs body falling through shards of glass tearing out her back
the killer stands in the shattered doorway bloody knife in hand
an alarm resonates in the b
the killer wipes his knife clean races off screen
a nice psycho esque close up of the dead sarahs eye as blood swirls into the pupil
the highway is desolate
sidney speeds into frame in her honda sidneys tapping her thumbs nervously against the steering wheel as an eerie song filters off the radio
the only light comes from the unsettling neon green digital clock radio read out
sidney increases speed
sid passes up a road sign indicating los angeles miles the lot is crawling with police vehicles
kincaid and gale stare at sarah darlings corpse as its zippered up into a black rubber body bag and carried off by forensic technicians
thats stab miss weathers
it looks like were going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway
a beat i interviewed her too
god its happening again isnt it detective
yes well we have a suspect so dont get that worried
gales eyes light up
she grabs kincaids shoulders
im not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers
youre no longer working with the l
i dont even know why youre standing in here right now
by all means i should have you thrown out
but you wont
youre a good man detective
we think alike
i know you need my help
and i know you know i need your help
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective ive never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers
please call me gale
deal but im still detective kincaid ok
detective tom wallace kincaids cohort and partner
hes in his late thirties
wallaceenters frame with a folder in his hands
mark bridgers in custody
we traced his phone records
hes the last person to speak to sarah darling before she died
or at least call her home

why dont you go investigate the bad meat at the a
this is police work not pulitzer material
hey fuck off
no cool it wallace
shes working with me
cocky well then
looks like ill go dust for finger prints with barbara walters
wallace arrogantly walks off camera
gale looks at kincaid
so what now
a frazzled roman is seated at a long conference table while wallace and kincaid grill him with questions
bridger you didnt tell us you spoke with sarah darling before she died
thats because i didnt
the guard said she was there for a meeting with you
we talked to her roommate too
says you called sarah and told her to come down to the studio
roommate answered the phone says it was you
wait a minute
i never called her
i never told her to go anywhere
roommate says she knows your voice mr
well she wasnt speaking with me
look i did not call sarah darling
sarah darling said you did
someone is trying to ruin my movie
someone wants to kill my movie
hey look at it this way if anything thisll be something interesting to put on the directors commentary for when the film hits dvd
dry laugh ha
too late studios shutting down production
called my film a risk
do you believe this shit
theyre actually shelving my film because theres been one ensie little murder
god three people died during the filming of the exorcist
well i doubt they were stabbed to death and i strongly doubt the killer of them left messages on the scene for the police to find
camera pans through a two way mirror into
gale and dewey stand gazing through the two way mirror
roman cant see them
they watch nervously
they found another note
another news clipping
another one about sids mom
dewey whether we like it or not it looks like were going to have to go back into our past
you mean our past as in me and sid
this has nothing to do with you gale
this has everything to do with me dewey
i was the one who brought the nations attention to this shit anyway
ill be damned if im gonna sit around and pass on the buck again
do you really mean it this time gale

you said youd never leave woodsboro the only place thats real
but now youre here
not with me
dewey i took care of you
i waited until you were well
i couldnt stay there i mean its like dog years one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else
so its off to london for a week
new york for a month
it was fucking minutes ii
i couldnt say no
i couldve been the next diane sawyer
whats wrong with just being gale weathers
i liked her
it didnt work dewey
we tried were different
you used to say that was our strength
dewey youre not just here because of that second rate k mart straight to video version of me are you
brace yourself gale all of this is actually not about you
all of what dewey
you do know something dont you
off the record
two months ago the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with stab
she wanted to see the file on sid for research
the boys said no
she wouldnt give her name
a month later the station gets broken into the file room ransacked
someone stole sids file
i already removed it
i think someone on the film was trying to find sid and thats the only reason i came here
to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything
whips out cellular im sorry this is too good
what part of off the record dont you understand
a beat do you think he did it
his beeper goes off ive got my suspicions but still nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person
and who is that
but dewey doesnt answer
again hes staring daggers through gale
years and years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing
jennifer needs me
wait where are you going off to
im on duty
dewey races out the room
gale pauses stares at the interrogation
wallace has reduced roman to tears
gale bolts after dewey
the wind rushes past the camera
a huge panoramic view of l
full moon hangs in the sky
a coyote howls in the near distance
a nice low ranch tucked away in the valley
dewey rolls up jennifers driveway in his truck
gale follows behind in her vw jetta
noticing gale stop following me
i happen to work for the police god dammit
youre not a detective
neither are you magnum p
gale your engines still running
dewey shakes his head in disgust disappears into the house
gale runs back to shut off her car
from out of the bushes lunges tom prinze loaded off his ass still holding a half filled bottle of johnny walker black label scotch in his hand
what a surprise
tom prinze tanked as usual
thats a shocker
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month
the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs and how i faked the tire blow out just so my insurance wouldnt sky rocket
heh well thats tv journalism for ya
stage the news to boost ratings
really cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanskis latest picture
huh what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger
well not exactly the roman i wanted
get my point
stab is bullshit
fuck because of your big mouth im here drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself
a beat subtle hey i just got an idea
maybe i should have a look at your break line
that your car over there
gale pushes toms chest
i think we should go inside
i have to have a talk with the cast
all of you
laughs you mean whats left of us
tosses empty bottle aside yeah im running on empty anyways
tom and gale walk into the house
something stirs in the bushes
gale and tom enter
jennifer is crying hysterically in deweys arms
she sees gale looks up with anger written all over her gaudy over rouged face her make up running in a comical almost homage to mimi on the drew carey
how can i ever get any fame playing you
dewey what the hell is she rambling about now
whats wrong jen see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting
god damn you gale weathers
dont you see
the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script
ben damons character was the first one to get offed
so was his girlfriend but she wasnt cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed then sarah darlings candy and now me
wait a second whoa
number one there were five different versions of the script given out
ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role
it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script
and what i die in stab
everyone is silent
dewey nods his head
gale rips the script from jennifers hands
reading script this is complete bullshit
who wrote this piece of crap
i know right
it was kinda weak
thats cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it
the script was written by some new guy
he wrote arlington street
still that was a much better movie i saw it at the premiere last week
god what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for
weve gotta get down to business
a teary eyed angelina tyler rises up from the couch approaches the group
crying what are you talking about
because of this shit ill probably never act in a hollywood film again
tom throws his arm around angelina squeezes her tightly
hey good looking if you play your cards right i may be able to sit you down on my casting couch and try you out for a few films my
production company is working on
a beat how do you feel about a deep throat remake
angelina squeals in disgust elbows tom racing out of the house
tom groans follows after her
ill be right back
tom walks out into the darkness looks around
angelinas nowherein sight
calling out angelina
where the hell are you
i was only playing
hey look i can really get you a bit part
just come on out
pauses damn it
there goes my chances of getting some head from her
tom whips out a joint pops it in his mouth
he lights it walks around the side of the house
a noise catches his attention
a low muffled squealing
tom turns to a guest house
the door is half open darkness spilling out
tom smirks steps inside
the entire small interior of the guest house deweys living quarters is blackened by the night
tom cockily waltzes about not noticing one of the black shadows peeling off the wall
tom stops in his tracks
he looks down
lying in a pool of blood at his feet is angelina tyler
tom screams staggers backwards right into the arms of you fucker
the ghost slashes open toms arm
tom screams backs up into the kitchen
the ghost grabs him by the throat begins choking him mid air
he slowly begins to lift him off his feet angling the knife readying to make the kill blow
he cant even scream the killers crushing his voice box causing a trickle of blood down his lips
the ghost brings the knife down piercing toms heart pinning him to the closet
tom kicks around for a moment before finally going limp
the ghost steps back admiring his work
jennifer gale and dewey are pacing around nervously
where the hell are tom and angelina
i dont know
look whats important is that we stick together
no matter what
if anyone is next its you or me jen
what about sidney
what about her
suddenly a knock at the door
the three are startled
dewey looks at the front door
maybe its tom or angelina
ill get it
what if its the killer
oh use your brain drama queen
do the killers ever knock on the fucking door
ever see jason do that before burying an axe in some big titted blondes head
or maybe michael or chucky
jennifer sticks her tongue out at gale
dewey reaches into a holster tucked away under his jacket drawing up his mm
im prepared for anything
amen boy scout now answer the fucking door
dewey nods his head slowly makes his way towards the door
gale and jennifer huddle together follow close behind
do you smell something
smirking its gale
she farts when she gets nervous
gale makes an angry face slaps dewey upside the back of his headplay fully
dewey steps up to the front door
its not locked
he reaches for the knob turns it when suddenly alright dont panic
just a fuse
dewey throws open the door
angelinas corpse drops into the doorway
everyone out the back way
dewey gale and jennifer race for the french doors in the living room leading outside to the pool and backyard
a phone rings somewhere in the house
oh shit its my cell
jennifer answers her cellular
into phone hello
wanna play a little game
its the killer
gale rips the phone out of jennifers hands
into phone listen you sick bastard what the fuck do you want
whats your favorite scary movie gale
i dunno but i can tell you that yours will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass
now come out and fight like a real man you pussy
i just might
the ghost comes running out of closet knife swinging wildly
jennifer screams races for the patio door
the ghost lunges for gale
dewey draws up his gun fires
the ghost takes six slugs in the chest
he goes smashing through a coffee table motionless
dewey backs into gales arms smoke rising fromthe muzzle of the gun
god damn it you two
hes not dead
hes still breathing
gale hes dead
lets get out of here
dewey turns gale towards the patio door
a noise o
dewey pauses turns around dewey looks to the patio door
screaming the ghost barrels out from under the couch knife raised
dewey winds back kicks a chair out in the ghosts path
the ghost trips goes crashing through the chair coming smashing down onto the floor knife burying into the hardwood
dewey and gale run for the patio when suddenly jennifer comes dodging out of the kitchen wielding a butcher knife
screaming jennifer slips on something goes backflipping to the ground
gale grabs her
helps her up
the ghost comes to life grabbing a lighter off an end table
he lights a trail of gasoline running from the floor to the kitchen i
the smell jennifer mentioned earlier and what she slipped on seconds ago
a huge flame trail lunges towards the two women
jennifer gale and dewey take off out the patio doors when suddenly ka boom
a huge conflagration
the three dive into the swimming pool as debris rains down onto the earth
detective kincaid paces around his room
a battered and bruised dewey and gale sit beside his desk in police uniforms since their old clothes has obviously been drenched
whoever it is now is taking credit for maureen prescotts murder
but we know who killed maureen prescott billy loomis and stu macher
i mean they even told sidney how they did it
yeah but if im not mistaken you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before
she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother and he was sent away for it
maybe there is a third killer
sidney might know something kincaids eyes appear as if questioning dewey
i told you i dont know where sidney is
and even if there was a third killer sidney doesnt know about it
that is for me to decide
i need to talk to her mr
riley she is a key element in this case
i have a press conference in an hour and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities
there are five
thats four last time i learned how to count
what about angelina tyler
she was there too
police are still searching through the debris
could be days before we find her
that is if shes even there
kincaid seems to be getting a morbid charge out of all of this
he smirks ever so nefariously at dewey
we all know that this has something to do with stab
what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott
actually there was more this time
this time we found a picture too
kincaid holds up a second ziplocked evidence bag
within is a blurry x of maureen prescott exiting a motel room with cotton weary
kincaid turns it over
also written on its back is i killed her before you jump to conclusions the man in the picture cotton weary is out of the country on business
his alibi checks out
seems hes got a tv show in australia cotton
its supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious but thats besides the point
what does this have to do with sid
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter
well sids dad couldnt help you and he was married to maureen
chiming in whats your problem
last night you were almost charcoal
you gonna help us or what
do you wanna have this conversation with a polygraph
is that a threat detective
when its a threat youll know it
a beat is that a threat
boys boys why dont we compare our gun calibers later
the issue is maureen prescott
wrong this issue is sidney prescott
and either mr
riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her
so where is she
dewey is on his cell phone
off phone hi youve reached the machine
leave a message talk as long as youd like
sid its me this is the sixth time ive called
sid turns the corner is ushered down the hall by a cop please pick up i wanna make sure youre okay
dewey notices sidney approaching him sid
the two run into each others arms embrace tightly
what are you doing here
i told you to stay hidden
its not safe for you up here
well its not safe for me up there either
the killer found me dewey
he called me last night
i figured id be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about
a beat now wheres this kincaid guy the news is talking about
i found this place from a fox tv news report
dewey walks sid into kincaids office
theres someone here who wants to help
oh my god
sidney you ran fast or what
im glad youre all right
for a change instead of an exchange of fists the two share a warm hug
sid this is detective kincaid
nice to finally meet you sidney
the killer called her
whatd he say
oh you know the usual small talk whats new how ya been how do you want to die
sidney do you have any idea how he couldve gotten your number
he couldve monitored the calls on a scanner
did you call her from the set
do you have her number stored in your memory
dewey thinks phone memory
yeah i guess i do
has anyone else every used your phone
to kincaid and you
hey im the cop here
youre in my office riley
sidney notices the clippings and the photograph of maureen
the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder sidney
recently hes also left a photo of your mother
why didnt you tell me
this is my mother dewey
why didnt you say something
i was afraid they were bait something to ya know trick you out of hiding
listen detective i wanna see this studio where all this shits going down
are you sure
kincaid and deweys cars drive through the lot
they drive over towards a row of trailers park
kincaid disappears to do something else while gale dewey and sidney get out of deweys truck
alright sid over there is the stab production offices
thats where sarah darling was murdered last night
mm what a waste of silicone
a beat what does my mother have to do with this all dewey
were a long way from woodsboro
a figure lunges out of nowhere startling all three of them
its a young scrawny goth girl in heavy make up
this is karen colcheck
she holds something in her hand a video tape marked scary movies
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me
what are you doing here
she was randys only girlfriend
smiling thats me
first and last
sidney hugs karen
so does dewey
its been a while
you still working at bradleys
they opened up a hollywood video down the street
it pays better
anyway im here because i heard on the news about the murders and well i found this while rooting through randys things
karen holds up the video
randy meeks dearly departed video geek from scream and told you id make a movie someday huh
sidney gale karen and dewey are gathered around the inside of the small cramped trailer watching the tape
oh my god
well if youre watching this tape it means as i feared i did not survive these killings here at windsor college
anyway the reason i am here is to help you so that my death will not be in vain
that my lifes work will help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated
if this killer does come back and hes for real there are a few things that you gotta remember
is this simply another sequel
well if it is same rules apply
but heres the critical thing
if you find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory and a preponderance of exposition then the sequel rules do not apply
because you are not dealing with a sequel you are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy
its a rarity in the horror field but it does exist and its a force to be reckoned with because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning
and discovering something that wasnt true from the get go
godfather jedi all revealed something that we thought was true that wasnt true
so if it is a trilogy you are dealing with here are some super trilogy rules
one you got a killer whos gonna be super human
stabbing him wont work shooting him wont work basically in the third one you gotta cryogenically freeze his head decapitate him or blow him up
number two anyone including the main character can die
this means you sid
im sorry its the final chapter
it can be fuckin reservoir dogs by the time this thing is through
number three the past will come back to bite you in the ass
whatever you think you know about the past forget it
the past is not at rest any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you
number four never ever under any circumstances go running off by yourself cause if friday the th has taught us anything its that the next time were gonna see you
youre gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back
so in closing let me say good luck god speed and for some of you ill see you soon cause the rules say some of you aint gonna make it
i didnt not if youre watching this tape
sidney and karen are hugging
you be careful
dont worry sid
i got tickets to see family feud
i did have a somewhat ulterior motive for driving all the way down here
she hugs sidney one more time scampers away
ive got an idea ill hook up with you guys later
do you want us to come with you
i work better alone
why dont you do some snooping around the set
gale runs off
i can see nothings changed
gales banging on the door trying to gain access
gale notices the card lock and the sign reading authorized personal only
since when has this ever stopped her before
she reaches into her pocket book pulling out a couple of credit cards a video store card etc
she tries them in the lock
a hand reaches down grabs gale from behind
she lets outa blood curdling scream
its only jennifer
what the hell are you doing
being gale weathers
what the hell are you doing
i am gale weathers
heres how i see it
ive got no house no movie no gun and im being stalked
because someone wants to kill me
no because someone wants to kill you
so now starting now i go where you go
that way if someone wants to kill me ill be with you and since they really want to kill you they wont kill me theyll kill you
you know in the movies i play you as being much smarter
and as a sane person
for you that must be quite a stretch
maybe i should join snl
need to get in that building
sarcastically no really
there a story in that building
flashing a sunrise studios key card gale weathers would find a way
she swipes and opens the door jennifer opens the door steps in first
gale follows door closing ominously behind them with a loud clack
gale leads the way down the dark hall
basements creep me out
really you know youd make a fascinating interview
lifestyles of the rich and psychotic
look whos talking moneybags
you got more homes than i do
smiling oh i wish i got that one on tape
itd put a smile on my face everytime im down
the two turn the corner stepping into bianca bernadette an aging former actress in her late forties early fifties sits behind a desk doing paperwork
sensing someone elses presence she stops what she is doing and looks up at gale and jennifer
can i help you
im gale weathers author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders and anchorwoman for total entertainment
maybe youve heard of me
bianca shakes her head no
i dont watch tv and i hate books
whatta you need
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you
groans well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you
gale reaches into her pocket slams down the picture of sids mom on biancas desk
bianca looks up totally unenthused
listen im busy
nobody has access to those files except studio execs
can you please go away now
well if you wont work for me will you work for the president
gale slaps a twenty dollar bill on the desk
bianca looks up a bit insulted slides the money back
of the studio
who are you nancy drew
jennifer turns to bianca slides off her ring
she slams the ring onto the desk
its absolutely stunning
its worth three grand easy
to gale my gale weathers will stop at nothing to get the story
how can bianca resist
she smiles takes the ring slips it on her finger
gale reaches for her twenty
bianca slaps her hand takes it folding it up sliding it between her cleavage
staring at picture flipping through file cabinet i know every face in here respect for the unknown actor i suppose myself included
if youre looking for maureen prescott interrupting it may be maureen reynolds well youll find neither
rina reynolds however you will
smiling rina reynolds
what a stage name
you should talk judy jurgenstein
gale takes the folder from bianca opens it up
inside are x headshots of maureen prescott when she was younger
behind the pictures is a xeroxed listing of the films shes starred in
what are these movies
amazombies space psychos creatures from thesan andreas fault
b movies from miltons heyday
you know john milton the horror producer
those were some of his early flicks
sidney stands beside dewey and detective wallace
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom
do you want me to come with you sid
i mean remember what randy said
no ill be ok
ive got my mace
smiles raises up her fists these two lethal weapons
sure you dont need a police escort
thats what were here for
no really ill be fine
dewey and wallace nod
sid begins to walk towards the soundstage
ill be right back
sidney stands at the sink washing her face
she shuts off the water reaches for a paper towel when suddenly something catches her ear
almost as if a mans whisperedher name siiiiiddney
sid turns around stares at the empty bathroom
sid reaches into her pocket book draws out a gravity knife
she flips open the blade crouches down on her knees scanning the row of stalls for feet
what a relief
sid smiles dismisses what she thought she heard when she sees sidney goes back to drying her face when suddenly whisper sidney
this time its apparent
theres somebody else in the bathroom
sid begins to make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly wham
a stall door flies open
the ghost charging out at full force
sid hits the deck sliding across the floor deflecting the blow from the knife as the killer buries it into the sink counter
sid races for the door killer hot on her trail
the storage closet door flies open and a second ghost comes charging out knife gleaming
he dives for sid
sid takes up her knife buries it in her attackers shoulder
the ghost goes reeling back into the closet
sidney slams the door closed on him
she dives for the door knob when suddenly the first ghost comes running back at her
she ducks as he swings his knife burying it into the bathroom door
sid bolts across the bathroom towards a tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling
using the trash as a booster she leaps up slides open the window and dives out just as the deadly pair of attackers come back for more
sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building
she looks up realizing shes just ran herself into a dead end
an exit door flies open
the ghost comes charging out
sidney screams runs for a wooden fence
she begins to scale it dropping over on the other side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife
sid takes off running for wallace and dewey
hearing the screams spin around drawing out their guns
wallace looks at dewey
re gun dont worry ive got a permit for it
hysterical jesus christ dewey help me
they tried to kill me in the bathroom
wait a second
theres two of them now
wallace whips out his cellular dials a number
sidney falls into deweys arms collapsing like a house of cards crying hysterically
into phone yeah this is wallace
we got a problem down here on the sunrise studios lot
no not another one
at least not yet
yeah weve had an attack
to sid do you need medical assistance
sid nods her head no no
alright see you in a minute
wallace closes up his phone
well i got some good news in a way
roman bridger didnt make those calls to sarah darling
police let him go
heres the bad news the cellular was cloned its untraceable
we now have no suspects
dewey and sidney turn around to see an excited jennifer and gale race into frame
sidney what happened
nevermind whatd you two find
we did some researching in the archives
sid something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mothers murder
for two years of her life up until she basically disappeared off the face of the earth
what are you talking about
weve found out where she went
she was an actress sidney
minor b movies
but now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web
the head of the studio
it makes sense doesnt it
its his big grandiose swan song from the genre
what a better way to end than with a bloodbath
sidney what happened
i was attacked in the bathroom
wallace shouldnt you be investigating the bathroom
looks at building im waiting for back up
i dont carry bullets in my gun unless i know im gonna use em
dewey nods suspiciously
kincaid comes rushing into frame
jesus christ sidney what happened
i got a call on my cell from home
they told me that someone was attacked
and what made you think it was sidney
glaring sid get in my car
youre coming back to the station with me where its safe
dewey jennifer i think we should pay john milton a little visit
miltons on the phone with roman
into phone roman i know youre upset
but there will be other movies
ah variety called you a pariah
well fuck them
i got a great script on my desk
its called tragic menage trios and it was written by john sayles
im thinking you for director
knock at the door come in
into phone no not to you roman
look ill talk to you later
milton hangs up as gale jennifer and dewey barge intohis office
so you knew sidney prescotts mother
just what the hell do you people think youre doing barging in here like this
ive got important calls to make
i run this studio
answer the question
you knew sidneys mom
do you know how many actors have worked for me
nobody said she was an actor
whats your point
no point im just gonna give detective kincaid a call
i remember her
she was a bit player in a couple of my movies
so what does it matter
oh come on
you have made millions off the story of her murder
youre obsessed with her and youre obsessed with her daughter
settle down beavis
to milton why dont you tell us the truth
what the hell are you guys getting at
i make horror films thats what i do
the studio came to me with stab
they came to me check it out
but you know who she was
when we did the first stab i realized id known maureen prescott before i mean as rina
i couldnt tell anyone
can you imagine the press
i mean murders on your set and still you say nothing
get real that would make me a suspect
just because you knew her
i dont think so
just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood
now you listen to me lois lane let it go
its dead and buried
daddy took ol yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv
why dont you start talking
it was in the s everything was different
i was well known for my parties rina knew what they were
it was for girls like her to meet men men who could get them parts if they made the right impression
nothing happened to her that she didnt invite in one way or another no matter what she said afterwards
are you saying she was im saying things got out of hand
maybe they did take advantage of her
maybe the sad truth is this is not the city for innocence
no charges were brought
and the bottom line is rina reynolds wouldnt play by the rules
you wanna get ahead in hollywood you gotta play the game or go home
kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together
sidneys seated beside him staring at a stack of books on script writing and what do you know about trilogies
you mean like movie trilogies
you seem to like movies detective
call me mark would you
cause im gonna keep calling you sidney
ill call you mark when you catch the killer detective
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one all bets are off
noticing a huge file on her did you request this case
no they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business
i grew up here and i know my way around the studios
must be exciting beautiful place beautiful people
to me hollywood is about death
im a homicide detective remember
when you see what i see day in and day out the violence that people do to each other you get haunted
i think you know about that
what do you mean
i know what its like to see ghosts that dont go away
to be watching a scary movie in your head whether you want to or not watching it alone
ghosts are tough you cant shoot ghosts
cant arrest ghosts
but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people
youre here youre not hiding youve done the right thing miss prescott
what did you know about your mother
i used to think i had the perfect mom perfect family
till i found out i was wrong
she had a secret life and i tried to understand that and soon as i thought i had more secrets
i dont know who my mom was
a beat sometimes i feel like im just learning about my mother for the first time
you know with tv and those movies and what not
god sometimes i feel like im just learning about myself for the first time
like im watching my life instead of living in it
a long beat heres the deal im off to search the soundstage
thats good news
how is that good news
because that means that were dealing with an ordinary flesh and blood killer
and i know how to handle guys like that
oh yeah how
catch him or kill him
kincaid readies himself to leave
he snags up his holstered gun his car keys jacket etc
whats your favorite scary movie
detective kincaid pauses he leans over sidneys chair his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers
sotto my life
kincaid exits door slamming shut behind him
a beat then mine too
milton steps out of his office into his reception area
secretarys gone for the night
milton starts out of the office disappears
the door creaks open
gale jennifer and dewey emerge from the darkness
jennifer is gagging
oh god gale dewey was right
stop getting so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag
together jennifers quiet
i think miltons the killer
i think he just went out to kill another cast member
miltons not a killer
hes a pervert
he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack off parties he has with his two best friends
rob reiner and quentin tarentino
smacks her forehead out of frustration do you get any of my witty humor
i mean you did play me for three movies
a beat his two hands dingus
dewey leans into miltons office door slowly opens it
darkness spills out
the three disappear inside it
miltons walking down the hallway
camera tracks along the paisley velvet carpet as a phone rings o
its miltons cell
he answers it pushes the elevator up button anxiously
into phone john milton
wanna play a game
who is this
you tell me
you bankrolled three movies about me
the saboteur whose been fucking up my movie
a beat i swear to god if you dont stop ill find you and have you killed
i shut down production on that piece of shit stab
we had a no talent director and the lousiest sidney prescott on the planet but that was besides the point
you still killed my movie
a john milton film
and if you ever try and cross me again youll be sorry
my next movie is gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit
its a film written and directed by john sayles
miltons going rapid fire
oh poor john
theres not gonna be another film
well at least not for you
the elevator door opens with a ping
a flash of silver and in an instant johns throat is slashed open spilling blood
his corpse thuds to the ground
a pair of gloved hands drag him into the elevator
a moments pause and then the ghost storms out disappearing down the hall
gales trying to get a locked drawer on miltons desk open
it wont budge
dewey steps into frame flashlight in hand
he shines the light down on the lock
hold on gale im a pro at this
dewey leans in bumping his head with gales
oh dewey im sorry
the two look at each other and smile
dewey laughs sweetly
gale reaches up rubs his head
let me jennifer chimes in
excuse me gale
what the hell do you think youre doing
gale and dewey cant help gazing into each others eyes
in an instant it almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life
shaking it off lets get this drawer open
if its locked there must be something inside hes trying to hide
dewey takes the butt of the flashlight brings it down hard on the locked drawer
the locks smashed off
thats gonna leave a mark
gale slides open the drawer reaches in
she pulls up a manilla folder
dewey shines the light on the folder as gale opens it up and reads whats inside
whatd you find
gales eyes widen
paternity test results
christ dewey youre never going to believe who miltons kid is
who is it
i got a bad feeling
angrily together guys theres someone else in the fucking room
dewey and gale look up and scream as the ghost rushes out of the shadows
jennifer bolts for the door
the ghost jams his knife in her back
she lets out a blood curdling death scream drops to the floor motionless
gale and dewey share a terrified scream
the killer wipes his blade clean lunges for them
frantic gale run
dewey jumps in the killers path
the killer winds back cracks the base of the knife across deweys skull
dewey drops to the floor unmoving
the killers blade glistens in the moonlight
he charges for gale
gale screams races out of the office door slamming it closed on the killer sending him flying onto his back
gale races down the hallway frantically trying every door she passes
all of them locked
she reaches the elevator hits the down button
the door opens with a ping
gale unleashes a horrendous scream has been strung up from the ceiling ventilation duct gutted from knob to gullet
his entrails lie in steaming heaps at his feet
gale staggers away from the elevator speechless
she screams again
her ghostly attacker is coming straight for her
gale fakes out the killer dives into the elevator
he runs ahead briefly giving gale enough time to trip him sending him landing flat on his face
gale races out of the elevator doubles back down the hallway towards a door marked stairs
she bolts through the door
gale races down the stairs nearly tripping and falling
she races out onto the ground floor
gale races out of the office building
a car horn blares
kincaid jams on his breaks gets out his car
he draws up his gun
jesus gale what happened
frantic he killed milton
the killers inside there
deweys in there too
he needs medical help
alright calm down
im going to radio in for backup right now

kincaid spins around
the ghost comes charging out of nowhere slashes open kincaids throat stabs him in the chest
kincaid drops onto the hood of his car dead
shes screaming hysterically
the killer raises the knife menacingly
i wouldnt run if i were you gale
its only gonna end up with you getting skewered like a fucking pig
i need you
nervously awfully late time to be doing an interview
i need you as bait
gale closes her eyes cries as the killer stalks towards her
sidney sits in kincaids office flipping through the folder marked sidney prescott its loaded with newspaper articles and police reports and is basically a scrapbook of obsession
kincaid has drawn little magic marker hearts around a picture of her
shes awakened from her daydream
the phone rings
sid answers it

sids face floods with fear
she rushes towards the office door when suddenly the voice draws her back angrily and cautioning

sidney breaks down crying
wallaces keys rest on his desk
sid ponders takes them
she stands up when something inside her makes her open wallaces drawer and dig around
she pulls up a fully loaded handgun
thats the ticket
she closes the drawer slinks out the side exit
sid speeds through rain slicked streets
her cellular rings
into phone yeah

ill call you when you get there
the killer hangs up
sid parks wallaces car alongside the studio gates
she gets out stands on the hood of the car begins to scale the wrought iron fence
sidney creeps through the darkened abandon lot
again her cellular rings
again she answers it
into phone alright im here

cant you figure it out
i wanna finish this where it all began
i thought you wanted me here
click the killer hangs up
sid pockets her phone
she looks up and is startled out of fright
posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for stab with a life size ghost wielding a big knife
sid knows shes in the right place
the door leading inside is half open
sid taps the holstered gun slowly steps into the darkness
as a million things rush through her mind
to her this is like the ultimate return
everything appears as she last remembers
sid steps through the dark sets
her phone rings
she answers it
into phone alright im here now show your face so we can finish this
its good to see you again sidney
i was growing real impatient
ill catch up with you later
the killer hangs up
sid pockets the phone
she walks past the macher garage set
instead of a foam tatum body dangling from the doggy door its kincaids corpse
sidney flinches covers her eyes
she walks on
sid steps through the living room of the becker set
it mirrors the house perfectly
everything from the shattered patio door to the burnt jiffy pop is there
sids phone rings
she answers it
off phone help me sid
the killers got me
where are you
sid i can see you
where are you dewey
im out back
the killers looking for you
quick untie me
sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set
seated before a heated in ground pool tied to a patio chair beaten and gagged is dewey rielly
hes unconscious and almost appears at first glance like steven orth from scream
sids jaw drops
this cant be possible
she looks down at the phone
good work sid
sid screams dropping the phone out of fright
she turns around coming face to face with he stands in the patio doorway
a monstrous version of the voice changing box in hand
he raises up the box clicks a button and speaks
sids voice you play a good game sidney
now its time to get down to business
who are you
click now hes maureens voice your other half
the ghost rushes sid
she screams takes off running
she bolts across the darkened set running straight up the front porch of a mock up of her own childhood home
she swings open the front door slams it closed
sid locks and bolts the front door
she backs away from it as the killer begins to pounce against it struggling to get inside
sid hears something upstairs
like muffled cries
she races up to investigate
sid enters the set of her bedroom slowly drawing out the gun she stole from kincaids office
lying on the bed bound and gagged is sid races over removes the gag from gales mouth
christ sidney hurry up
that fucking lunatic is coming
sid fumbles with the bindings manages to untie gale
gale sits up
gale hes got dewey
he killed kincaid
lets get out of here
screaming ker smash
the ghost launches himself through the upstairs window
gale and sidney bolt for the bedroom door killer hot on their tails
dewey comes around
he lets his head loll for a moment before finally beginning to pull and tug on his bindings
extremely close on dewey freeing one of his hands from the heavy duct tape
gale and sidney run into the master bedroom set slamming the door shut and locking it
sid looks around her head already swimming from the chaos outside
however whats inside utterly horrifies her
the walls the furniture and the bed are splattered with blood
on the bed lies a corpse in a black rubber body bag supposedly maureens body
the door buckles under the killers blows
gale and sidney scream
they cant hold out much longer
jesus christ sidney get out of here
he cant get us both
a knife splinters through the door inches from gales face
sid backs away hysterical
she raises up the gun fires into the door
gale ducks out of the way
the door ceases to move
and then the body bag unzips and the second ghost emerges knife in hand
the girls utter horrified screams
sid raises up the gun goes to fire when suddenly the bedroom doors kicked down and the other killer enters grabbing sid by her shoulders batting the gun from her
sid screams punches her attacker in the chest
the second ghost grabs gale holds the knife to her throat stopping her in her tracks
sid makes a beeline for the window leaps through the glass
sid comes flying out onto the patio awning
she rolls over onto the astro turf grass momentarily motionless
and then she comes to
her eyes flickering open blurrily staring up at the ghost leering out the shattered window frame
sid stands up takes off running towards sid races into the foyer slams the door closed behind her
again locking and bolting it
she looks around everything is once again the same as it was in woodsboro
this is where the climax of the original battle between good and evil wasfought
its dejr vu all over again
sidney turns around dewey staggers through the living room doorway gun in hand
eyes lighting up dewey
sidney embraces dewey
theyve got her
sid i want you to stay here
ill be right back
im not gonna let them get gale
dewey unlocks the front door swings it open
standing across the set is the ghost knife raised
tightening grip on gun hold it right there you fucker
dewey goes to fire
out of bullets
nervously oh shit
the ghost winds back launches the knife
it swirls through space before embedding into deweys arm launching him back through the doorway
deweys unconscious again
the ghost races for the open door
sid screams kicks it closed
locking and bolting it again
a crash o
sid turns around a body rolls down the staircase covered in blood
it comes to a halt at sidneys feet an unmoving rumpled figure
shes been brutally stabbed
crying oh god
but angelinas eyes open
a sick rictus smile forming on her lips
she pulls out a gun aims it at sidneys face
time to sort things out
whatta you say
angelina walks sidney into the living room at gunpoint
gales been handcuffed and tossed onto the couch
home video footage of maureen prescott plays
all of this is because of you
not all of it
sid someone really wants to meet you
sid tries to run angelina trains the gun on her
causing her to stop in her tracks
uh un sid
youre not gonna run off
youre not going anywhere sidney
its time you came to terms with me and with mother
maybe you never knew her at all sid
maybe you cant get past the surface of things
the ghost enters frame ripping open his costume to reveal a kevlar bullet proof vest
who the hell are you

i tried to find her my whole life
and four years ago i actually tracked her down knocked on her door thinking shed welcome me back with open arms but she had a new life and a new

the ghost rips off his mask
sidneys deathly quiet

and it struck me what a good idea
so i watched her made a little home movie a little family film
seems maureen mom really got around
i mean cotton weary was one thing everybody knew about that but billys father that was the key
your boyfriend didnt like seeing his daddy in my movies

he screams goes stagger back into angelinas arms

roman continues stabbing himself

roman lunges at sidney
sid screams takes off through the kitchen
gale rolls herself off the couch
angela runs over and kicks her in the ribs
coughing hey bitch dont ever use prop cuffs to restrain gale weathers
gale pops off the handcuffs
leaping up i know all the tricks
gale barrels into angelina tackling her into the coffee table before she has a chance to move
angelina struggles to raise her knife
chases sid into the foyer
she races past the spot where dewey fell earlier
roman jumps at her
sid disappears into another room
the chase continues
continue the fight
gales slamming angelinas head against the hardwood floor
angelina swipes slashing gale along the side deeply
gale screams begins to crawl away
she kicks angelina in the face
angelina drops the knife
gale stands up begins to back away
comes rounding into the foyer again
romans right behind her
the laundry room door swings open and the ghost emerges knife in hand
he buries the knife deep into romans chest sending him flying backwards
the ghost stops in his tracks pulling off his mask its only dewey
he can barely stand up
hes bleeding profusely from his wounds
dewey and sid embrace
dewey my god i thought you were dead
dont worry sid id never leave you like that
sidney and dewey race into gales got angelina in a headlock right beneath the tv unit
screaming gale releases leaps up she pushes the tv set down onto angelinas head
angelina screams her body trembling from the electric shocks and high voltage
sid and dewey stand in the doorway breathless
gale approaches them
she and dewey embrace tightly
angelinas twitching corpse goes limp
sidney spots a gun on the mantle
she grabs it cocks it
the three survivors step into the foyer
sid looks down at romans corpse
watch out sid
randy said the killers always superhuman
he wasnt superhuman dewey
he wasnt superhuman at all
then a horrifying scream rips through the air
angelina comes racing out of the living room face a blackened kentucky fried mess
everyone screams one epic last scream
sid raises up the gun fires hitting angelina dead center between the eyes sending a splash of blood and brain matter onto the wall behind her
sid turns to romans lifeless body
pissed this shit is really getting repetitive you know
sid scrunches up her face in anger pulls the trigger
a clean perfect sid drops the gun walks off set
the police fire and ems are all on the scene of the crime
deweys wheeled out of the studio on a stretcher loaded into an ambulance
gales right beside him on a stretcher
she leans over takes his hand
gale i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again
the whole relationship thing
smiles sure why not
you did save my life mr
the two kiss feverishly
wallace exiting his car
he surveys the damage
sid passes him
jesus christ what happened
i leave for two seconds to take my kid to the doctor i come back and its the fucking wild bunch
it was just something thats been itching to be completed for the past four years
i guess so
take care detective
give my regards to the wife and kids
wallace nods his thanks as sidney walks off through the studio gates the sun rising overhead as calm and as casually as if nothings happened
slowly we crane up to an aerial looking down upon hollywood
another day is beginning
