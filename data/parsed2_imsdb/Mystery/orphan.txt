written by david leslie johnson february shes a simple beauty and very pregnant propped up in a bed wearing a hospital gown
a heart rate monitor beeps
she touches her swollen belly flush with excitement her eyes full of wonder
okayp just relax
thisll be over caitti before you know it
kate looks up
her smile falters as we reveal harsh lights overhead
thunder rumbles outside
kates on a
delivery table legs already in the stirrups
a sheet hangs across her belly so we cant see whats going on below her waist
a doctor and nurse snap pn gloves prepare instruments sharp blades and curettes needles and forceps
kate is stricken
she tries to sit up
wait ive changed my mind
i dont want to do this anymore
the doctor gives the nurse an exasperated look
the nurse takes rates hand eases her back onto the table
your baby is dead
else we can do
kate reels her world turned upside dowp
emotional free fall
no this isnt whats supposed to happen
my babys alive
were so sorry
a terrible loss were so sorry
but its still alive
feel it you can feel it
kate tries to put the nurses hand on her
belly but the nurse pulls away and hands the doctor a pair of gleaming
blunt tipped surgical scissors
the doctor leans between rates spread legs disappearing behind the curtain
i want to be asleep
too late for anesthesia
the babys coming
going to experience some pressure now
kate winces and bites her lip as the doctor goes about his unseen work
a good looking man in surgical scrubs stands behind him
bizarrely hes videotaping the whole thing
hes kates husband john late s
he smiles at her from behind the camera
its okay honeys youre doing great
the doctor hands the scissors now slick with gore to the nurse
h e takes a suction
catheter and disappears behind the curtain again
the nurse presses a button on a vacuum pump and the machine begins to hum
kate tightly closes her eyes
this isnt happening
wake up wake up wake up
suddenly the thin wail of a baby crying
rates eyes go wide w ith horror as the smiling nurse approaches with a wriggling bundle wrapped in a blanket
blood seeps through the pink fabric
w e cant see whats inside but its moving
and its crying
its a girl
the nurse offers her the bloody blanketed bundle
kate screams then snaps awake
shes been having a nightmare
john lies n ext to her in bed
be stirs but doesnt wake
kate slips out of bed and quickly pads to the bathroom kate closes the door
we now see that shes not pregnant in reality only in her nightmare
she slides to the cold floor in t he dark a hand on her flat belly as she starts to cry
water trickles in a little zen fountain
kate sits across from dr
browning a mousy haired woman in her s
a lot of women experience difficulties around the anniversary of the miscarriage or the babys expected due date
its perfectly normal
i was thinking of going back to work
i really thought was doing better
think about where you were just four months ago
off kates look are you still sober
browning gives her a penetrating look
i drove by the wine shop on my
bome the other day
did you stop
i really wanted to
the thought went through m head you know
it wasnt for me it just might be nice to have a bottle handy in case we had guests
but you didnt go in
thats all that matters
lets try to stay focused on the
grief is different for everyone
you have to take it at your own pace
keep writing in your journal
youre doing fine
rate smiles weakly
rate hangs curtains over a beautiful picture window
she steps back to admire her work then sighs
now that she s done the house suddenly seems quiet and lonely and too big
kate sits in a rocking chair gazing out a distinctive arched window
we realize that shes in a fully furnished and decorated nursery
crib changing table baby swing
its a big dramatic home in an affluent neighborhood
kate crosses the backyard into the nearby woods
after a short walk kate sits by a peaceful brook lost in her thoughts
she pulls a journal filled
with handwritten entries from her coat pocket
after a beat she begins to write
class has just let out parents arriving to pick up their kids
but the playground is mostly silent these children an deaf communicating to one another and their teachers by sign language
kate pulls up in a luxury minivan
her five year old daughter max runs over togreet her
shes almost ridiculously cute
note max doesnt speak
her dialogue is signed and subtitled
she wears a rearing aid to help her read lips
when people speak to her they must face her and or sign
kate kisses maxshead and helps her into the van buckling her car seat
max shows her an art project shes bringing home
wow did you make this
she stops at an intersection
a pregnant woman crosses the street in front of them and stops at the corner
kate watches her for a long beat as if transfixed
in the backseat max claps her hands to get kates attention
kate turns and sees max pointing to the traffic light
a car horn honks
kate snaps out of it and drives off
kate sits at a baby grand piano trying to compose a piece of
she plays a few notes frowns tries again takes a pencil and erases what shes written down
she pauses to look over at a beautiful orchid in an ornate plants by the window
for a moment she just stares at it
then shes startled by something outside bouncing off the side of the house
she closes her eyes frustrated
bangi eang bang
she tries to ignore it but cant
max is playing basketball in the driveway but the balls too big for her and the hoops too
every time she tries to shoot the ball falls short and bangs against the house
kate opens the door angrily signing as she speaks stop banging that against the house
im trying to work
max gives an abashed look
she knows she was too harsh with her
no im sorry
take a break for a little while okay
a car pulls into the drive
its john and eleven year old daniel rate and johns other child
daniels blonde brash and cocky the all american kid
a little league uniform
daniel runs toward max
he steals her ball and dribbles it around her in circles
max watches glumly
he offers her the ball but when she reaches for it he snatches it away and shoots a lay up
boo yahl he shoots
nice one champ
daniel pumps his arm and runs inside
john walks up the drive carrying a bouquet of flowers
he hands max the ball and lifts her up to the basket
max happily puts the ball throughthe hoop
she smiles and gives him a high five as he carries her inside
kate has just sat back down at the piano when she hears daniel tear into the house and run upstairs
she slumps her shoulders and closes her notebook
no more work today
look theyre curtains not drapes
and haw exciting is my life that i now know the difference
he offers her the flowers
thats this for
just love you
he kisses her as she takes them
some of her gloomy mood melts
kate tucks max into bed
happily and picks up a book from her nightstand
kate groans inwardly when she sees what it is
we were going to have a baby
but we had an angel instead
you want to hear about the baby again
kate hesitates then gives max a sad smile
kate sits on maxs bed reading and showing her the pictures people send us flowers and cards but we still miss our baby
if this just happened to you im sorry you got an angel instead of ababy
think a baby would have been more fun
the last picture is a family with a baby angel watching over them
yes she is
shes with us every day
kate gives max a gentle kiss on the forehead
kate opens a medicine chest and shakes a pill from a prescription bottle
she swallows the pill with a dixie cup of water
john watches tv in bed
kate enters from the bathroom in a nightshirt and sits on the bed
rubs lotion on her feet
john watches her then reaches out runs his fingers uup and down her back
he cant see the nervous look that crosses her face
he moves closer pushes her hair aside kissing hex
kate responds stiffly trying to get
in the mood
he slides a hand around her waist moves it up to her breast
she moves away tears suddenly in
he gives a concerned look lets her have her space
im so sick of feeling like this
christ the kids must thing im crazy
will you stop worrying about what everybody else thinks
how can i
i saw a pregnant woman today on the way home and i almost lost it
just burst into tears with max sitting right there
daniel barely talks to me
you and i havent had sex in over a year now
what if i
never get better
i dont want to lose you
youre never going to lose us
i promise you
i just wish
off her look have you thought any more about adopting
i cant even be a mother to the children we already have
thats not true
the kids understand
they just know youre not happy
but i should be
do you want another child
you snow i do
more than anything
even if it can t bebiologically ours
then what are we talking about this for
lets do it
you dont just adopt a child because youre lonely and depressed
thats not why wed be doing
we wanted a child a year ago and we still want one now
we cant replace our baby
no we cant
but we can take the place we made for her in our hearts and our home and give it to a child who needs a family
kate we love being parents
were good at it andit makes
what better reason do you want
kate looks at him for a beat then smiles and lets her tears fall
kate and john are being interviewed by a female lawyer
are you both employed
im an architect at a firm in the city
the lawyer turns to kate
i used to teach music at yale
i havent worked for about a year
a beat considering youre sure you want an older child
with your background you could have a newborn in as little as a year
wevealread y waited a
wed lake a child as quickly as possible
well getting an older child as definitely quicker not to mention cheaper but theres a reason for that
a lbt of these kids have serious behavioral problems
weve already signed up for special needs adoption classes
trust me were ready for anything
you must have a lot of love to give
are you looking for a boy or a girl
wed like a little girl
camera finds johns car winding its way along a tree lined road
john is driving
kate is studying pages and pages of photocopied records in a manila folder
john gives her an amused look
youre not worried about being prepared
theres not gonna be a pop quiz
she closes the folder and looks at a polaroid of a happy seven year old puerto rican girl stapled to the cover
the name next to the photo is yolanda
its a pillared mansion with a large porch
two nuns supervise a group of young girls on a playground
a sign out front reads st
cabrinis home for girls
johns car pulls into the parking lot
from l shaky handheld pov looking out a second floor window we see kate and john get out of thecar
someone in watching them
kate senses movement and looks up
but theres no one there
yolanda the girl from the polaroid is playing with a dollhouse
the door opens
kate and john are led inside by sister abigail an african american nun in her s
yolanda look whos here to see you
yolanda smiles at kate and john
she runs over to greet them but stands just out of their reach
kate kneels in front of her
dont you look pretty
ister abigail put ribbons in my hair
wow that was nice of her
look we brought you something for the trip tomorrow
she hands her a bag of activity books and a travel turtle a kid sized lap desk for coloring in the car yolandas face lights up
what do you
kate reaches out to her but yolanda pulls away focusing all her attention on her presents
rate gives her a sad smile
yolanda is drawing a picture travel turtle on her lap
kate and abigail sit nearby watching
kate seems worried
she speaks in a low voice so yolanda wont hear nervous
and scared shitless
it s funny
all the same feelings i had when i was pregnant with our others
thats what really worries you isnt it
something bad happened the last time you felt this way
off kates look yolandas doing something similar
shes afraid of getting hurt again
bit i have a good feelingabout you two
you can help
each other heal
and youre lucky
you have a wonderful husband who can be there for you both
a flicker crosses rates eyes at the mention of het wonderful husband
doesnt see it
i h t
home for girls corridor day john emerges frcaitthe hens room
the walls of the hallway are lined with childrens artwork
he glances at it as he walks by
suddenly he stops short
amidst the crude watercolors and macaroni mosaics are several beautiful ain s s surprisingly sophisticated more like the works of henri r usseahan the o crayon and stick figure scribbles
then he hears something a little girls voice softly hun g a tune
we know the words
when i was juuust a lii
i asked my mother what will i be
john follows the humming to a stark white room
light slants in from a big window shining on a little girl in a lacy white dress
back is to us so
we cant see her face just curls of platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders
she sits at an easel all alone painting another extraordinary picture
john watches curious
suddenly she senses his presence
she stops humming the paintbrush freezes mid stroke
she looks about eight years old with pale skin and bright doe like eyes her delicate features framed by shirley temple curls
its the face of a porcelain angel a perfect little laving doll friendly and inviting
she wears a thick black velvet ribbon around her neck and one around each wrist
hername is esther
she speaks with a strange accent
sounds eastern european
are these paintings all yours
do you like them
h t ank you
my name is esther
its nice to meet you
she smiles and demurely offers her hand giggling as he takes it
she blushes then turns back to her painting
its a half finished jungle scene with a smiling lion crouched beneath a tree
so whats this one going to bo
my paintings are stories that come from my imagination
this one s about asad mother lion who cant find her cube
shes dreaming about her babies
its the only thing that makes her happy
well i hope she finds them
as she speaks esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs curled up in front of their sleeping mother they were lostin the jungle and they were so scared
because they didnthave a mother or father
but just when they thought theyd be alone forever they found their mother sleeping under this tree
and they felt so safe that they fell asleep too
now when the mother lion wakes up her dream will have come true
she has her family again
where did you learn how to do this
yve just had lots of time to practice i guess
its so boring here
you dont play outside with the other girls
sounds like theyre having fun
i like staying inside
that way i dont get my clothes dirty
amused well thats very responsible of you but ill bet the sisters could find something else for you
dont like my dress
dont you think its pretty
your dress is
im just saying
you could probably go outside if you really wanted to
a beat hesitant i dont like laying with the other girls
im different from everyone
theres nothing wrong with different
yes there is
everybody says theres not but it isnt true
i dont care
if im sad or lonely i just come in here a nd paint a story with a happy endingg and when people say they like
my paintings it makes me feel better
off his look i think
peo le should always try to take the bad things that happen to them and turn them into something good
john is taken aback
who j t m s dc
before he can respond there you are
rate and sister abigail stand in the doorway
john waves for kate to enter and esther sits up eagerly when she does
abigails expression darkens when she sees who john has been talking to
hey id like you to meet someone
esther this is my wife kate
kate smiles and offers her hand but instead of shaking it esther lovingly presses it to her cheek
kateand john exchange a beumsed look
she painted these all by herself
wow youre quite the little artist
you smell nice
sister abigail shifts uncomfortably
would you like me to paint you a picture
you can watch me if you want
im normally a little shy but esther im sorry they dont have time for you to paint them a picture
off esthers look they have to come with me now
yolandas going home with them tomorrow
isnt that wonderful
she releases rates hand and musters a weak smile
im sure shell be very happy
it was nice meeting you
the pleasure was mine
to sister abigail youve got a real talent on your hands here
yes were very lucky to have her
but theres something strange in abigails voice she definitely doesnt un lucky
esther watches them go
sister abigail walks kate and john to the front door
the notary will be here at
ten for you to sign the placement agreement
thank you so much for all your help
kate gives her a warm hug
but mid embrace she notices something esther is at the end of the hallway peering at them from around a corner
abigail and john see her too
what did she say to me
it sounded like
it means mother
johns car night john whistles whatever will be will be to himself as he drives
kate gives him an amused look then jokingly sings along when you were juuust a liuittle sorry ive got that stuck in my head now
made quite an impression on
i wish you couldve heard the things
she was saying before you c me in
i jatow adults who arent that mature
i wonder why they didnt show us her case file
she probably wasnt there when we were first looking
it just blows may mind a kid could go through as much as she must have and still turn out like that
you sound like youre sorry were not adopting her instead of yolanda
no of course not
i just hope she
gets the right break
off her look i wouldnt trade our little girl for the world
you maw that
rate gives him an adoring look and squeezes his hand
the sun is just rising
warming the sky with an idyllic light
the girls are busily getting dressed and making their beds
the housemother inspects each of them in turn
one bed remains unmade its occupant missing
the housemother turns to the room ready to give a scolding but cant find who shes looking for wheres yolanda
the older girls are brushing their teeth and washing up
the housemother enters and looks around
have any of you seen yolanda
sister abigail leads the nuns and lay assistants in a search of the home looking for yolanda
the playroom art room chapel classrooms laundry room rest rooms
theyre all empty
a young nun sister judith walks downstairs into a dark storage area
lots of hiding places
are you hiding down here
then she notices a closet behind her
she reaches out opens it
and nearly gags at what she sees inside
a childs bare feet dangle in mi a
the travel turtle is on the floor beneath them
a chair lies on its side nearby
kate dries her hair in the bathroom
the phone rings o
she pauses suddenly concerned for some reason
she opens the door
as john reaches for the phone camera moves in on kate
she watches from the doorway her face already registering dread
even before he answers the phone somehow she knows
the sky has turned gray
kate stares out at the hotel parking lot smoking a cigarette
her eyes are red but shes long since cried herself out
john stands by the open sliding glass door
the birth family is claiming her body
theyre planning a private service
he looks to kate for a reaction but she has none
he continues sister abigail thinks she might have been playing something called the choking game
its a kind of schoolyard dare
you try to get a rush by having someone choke you until you almost pass out
there have been cases where kids have tried it alone and accidentally hanged themselves
kates voice is distant as so thats it
she just vanishes from our lives
we can have our awn service
i think its important that we ive been in grief counseling for almost a year and a half
if you say the word closure
im going to claw your eyes out
shes not angry just matter of fact
be wants to say something but holds his tongue
silence hangs heavy between them
maybe were not supposed
to do this
dont say that
we try to
have a baby and i have a third trimester miscarriage that leaves
we try to adopt and she dies the night before we bring her home
that doesnt sound like somebodys trying to tell us
yolanda didn t the to
teach us a lesson
we didnt make this happen
it doesnt make
i cant go through this again
so lets not
this brings kate back to reality
she eyes him coolly
her bodys barely cold and youre already thinking about replacing her
we cant replace yolanda any more than we can replace jessie
but we cant help her anymore either
esther is alive and needs a family
we have to at least wait until
i dont want to waste a nother year of our lives wishing for something that we
i want us to feel like a family again
kate regards him for a beat conflicted
then lets see what sister abigail thinks
sister abigail hands rate and john a folder with a polaroid of esther stapled to it
her case file
for the most part shes anideal child
shes originally from russia but her english is flawless smart as a
tvhip and very mature afor her age
i dont think ive ever had to tell her anything twice and ive never had to clean up after her
shes a bit of a nqat freak
i think we can handle that
shes also fiercely independent
whatever the other children want to do she wants to
dc the opposite
she told me they make fun of her
im sure they do but she doesnt make things any easier on herself
she just doesnt seem interested in friends
she doesnt even play like a normal child
she just reads and paints
most of the time she barely speaks
why doyou think that is
well like most of the girls here theres been no shortage of hardship in her life
shes been orphaned twice her birthmother died of aids then the american family who adopted her was killed in
a house fire
and i strongly suspect that shes been sexually abused as well
i dont know
theres nothing in her history but that doesnt necessarily mean anything
russian adoption records
are notoriously unreliable
then what are you basing this on
sister abigail hesitates
deciding how much to say
i wish i knew
theres just something missing with her
a spark you see in a childs eyes that isnt there
ive only seen that before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized
it might also explain some of her idiosyncratic behaviors
she refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls
she wont even allow the housemother in the bathroom with her
s also very concerned with her physical appearance for her age
shes like a teenager getting ready for a date every morning
she insists on wearing dresses every day
the ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night
the only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off
she kicked two of sister francis teeth out
kate and tohn are taken
im not trying to discourage you
if youre serious ill do everything i can to expedite the process given the circumstances
my one reservation is
when an adoption fails its usually because the parents didnt know what to expect
andin this case i cant tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the matter is that i dont knaw
esther is happily helping a nun clean the sanctuary
kate and john sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel
she really did open up with us didnt she
right onto you
were probably the best chance she has at a
esther looks up from her work and waves at them
they wave back
a normal life
that sounds really good doesnt it
and takes john
caxera follows esthers feet saddle shoes clicking on the walk
kate walks beside her holding her hand
in esthers free hand she clutches a dog eared bible held together with a rubber band
activity on the playground stops as the girls watch esther leave
none of them look sorry to see her go
she ignores them
esthers things a small suitcase and her paintings in the trunk of the car
sister abigail sees them off
if you ever need anything please dont hesitate to call
can respond esther tugs on her arm
lets go kate laughingly lets esther drag her away
to abigail we wills sister abigail happily watches them go
rate and esther smile and wave goodbye
but once the car pulls out her smile fades
she seemsvaguely troubled as they drive away
headed for home
kate is showing esther some sign language
esther makes the sign for each letter as she says it aloud put your thumb here
she makes the sign for t
sees her mistake corrects it
t h e r
e s t h e r
esther smiles and practices it a few times
outside the leaves have turned color
esther gazes out in wonder
its so beautiful motta
sweetie here we say mont or
kate and john exchange a warm look
johns car turns at a gate and drives down the road leading to their private community
the secluded road winds through the forest and crosses the little brook we saw earlier
the colemans neighborhood
s surrounded by forest an upscale community of big houses and manicured lawns
a postman delivers the mail
a hispanic nanny pushes a baby in a stroller
gardeners tend someones flowers
esther soaks it all in
they pull into the driveway and get out
esthers mouth practically hangs open at the sight of their beautiful house
the front door opens and max runs out to meet them
daniel appears in the doorway with doris coleman arid s their grandmother
daniel stands aghast at the sight of the strange pale girl with the goldilocks curls and frilly white dress
runs straight into kates arms and gets a big hug
oh we missed you so muchll kate gives max a kiss then turns to esther max hangs back a little shy
esther signs to max without speaking max gives kate an excited smile
shes been practicing the whole way
kate takes the girls hands and they all walk upto the house
esther notices mans hearing aid
thats a hearing aid
it helps her hear
a little so she can read lips
john gives doris a use on the cheek
thanks for watching them
to esther esther this is grandma doris
a pleasure to meet you
esther surprises everyone by giving her a perfect ltttle rtse daniel fails to suppress a laugh
kate silences him with a look
its a pleasure to meet you too
to esther and this is our son daniel
esther smiles and puts out her hand
daniel grudgingly takes it
esther walks from room to room in awe of her luxurious new home
kate and the rest of the family follow her
everythings so bigi as esther moves on to the next room daniel hangs back and whispers to john too loud why is she dressed like that
dont be rude
esther overhears them but pretends she didnt
kate sees this and tries to distract her
would you like to see your room
esther smiles and nods eagerly
but on the way up the stairs she eyes daniel furtively sizing him up
kate pushes the door open and esther enters
we recognize the room by the arched windows this used to be the nursery
its been completely made over as a little girls room complete with a lacy white canopy bed covered with a mountain of stuffed animals
esther turns to kate and john with a toothpaste commercial smile
esther is in bed wearing a nightgown
kate and john tuck her in
you motta i mean monmiy
i love you too sweetie
she kisses esther on the forehead
john leans in for a kiss and esther hugs him tight
then he and kate turn out the light and close the door
esther watches them go
kate and john walk to their room arms lovingly around each other
they close their door leaving the hallway empty and dark
then camera slowly moves back down the hall toward
the closed door of esthers room pushing inon the doorknob lingering there fora long beat
then we hear the lock click shut
kids running and riding bicycles
saturday in the suburbs
esther and max eat breakfast at the table while rate pours their juice
daniel tears through wearing a soccer iuniform
good luck ii i love you ii
love you tools john follows daniel kissing kate on his way out
remember its only a game
im a fan
ill call to let you know who won
kate and esther are decorating
esther pins up some of her paintings
kate spreads out a selection of wallpaper borders
okay which one do you like
these are for ayounger child
did you pick them out for yolanda
kate is taken aback
she stammers for a beat
ill take them back and pick some just for you
its all right
i rather like this one
esther points out her
favorite and goes back to pinning up her paintings
as she rolls up the samples she notices the same gothic mansion in several of esthers older paintings
s that a real place
i just made it up
its a haunted castle where a beautiful princess was locked away
she waited so long and was so sad that she filled the moat with her tears but then a handsome prince swam across it and rescued her
i like happy endings
sliding doors open
rate and the girls enter
esther looks around dazzled by three stories of glass ceilinged extravagance
its totally alien to her
kate and the girls look through racks
of childrens clothes
kate pulls a pairof jeans with
flowers embroidered on the pockets
these are cute
jeans are ugly
but sweetie you have to have something you can play outside in
that doesnt mean i have to look like a boy
kate leads the girls through the mall carrying bags of purchases
something catches esthers eye
she hangs back distracted
its a pet store
in the display is an aguarium filled with tropical
fish their vibrant colors illuminated by a black light in the tank
esther gazes in nose practically against the glass
you like fish
i like all beautiful things
kate taps maxs shoulder and signs to her
you should show her hodgepodge when we get home
max nods eagerly
them a curious look
hodgepodge is a hamster
esther kneels in front of his cage for a closer look
kate stands behind her
max beams proudly
takes care of him all bir herself
its her big girl responsibility
aaaww can i pet him
but you have to promise not to let him out of his
unless hcumey or daddy is here to hold him
because hes very delicate and you could hurt him
flodgepodge up and kneels between the girls
esther and max share a smile as they stroke his fur
a banner reading
welcome home estherii has been hung
john sprays lighter rluid on a charcoal grill and starts the fire
daniel watches attentively at his fathers side
kate and doris prepare hamburgers and hot dogs for the barbecue
they can see esther and max laughing and playing horseshoes in the backyard wearing new matching sundresses
adorable they grow up fast dont they
so what are your plans now
well well get esther settled then ill probably go back to work
oh so you think
theyll take you back
kates eyes flicker with irritation
im not talking about yale
im going to teach piano lessons from home
that was such a good position you had at yale
i didnt quit because i wanted to
i quit because
i couldnt work anymore
im o glad youre doing better now
bows maxine feeling
kates pointedly not making eye contact with doris now
well its a shame that it took something like that for you to get help but im glad you did
the plate of food and leaves without looking at her
daniel has changed into swim trunks and splashes around in the pool
everyone else is gathered around esther whos opening a few small presents
she unwraps a book of sign language and gasps excitedly
this is perfect
eiow do i say thank you
kate shows her
esther turns and makes the sign to max
behind them daniel climbs out of the pool and runs out to the end of the diving board poised to jump back in
but john is focused on esther
shes opening a big present la aled fromi daddy
daniel cant get his attention
john distractedly glances over his shoulder at him and daniel does a huge cannonball into the pool
suddenly esther squeals with glee
shes unwrapped an iirt easel and new painting supplies
by the time daniel s smiling face pops out of the water hes disappointed to find that esther has drawn johns attention again barraging him with hugs and kisses
she looks at daniel over johns shoulder and hticks her tongue out at him
john walks behind esther his hands over her eyes
kate leads her into the darkened roam by the hand
are you ready
esther nods excitedly
john uncovers her eyes
esther stops short in awe
its the fish tan c from the shopping mall
esther kneels before it entranced
she turns the black light on and off marveling at how it makes her dzess glow and the colors in her paintings light up
she gives kate and john a
rate and john get dressed for church
john pulls on a tie
kate searches through a jewelry box
shes missing something
nave you seen my pearls
sunday morning in america
kate and john sit with doris and the kids
priest reads from the scripture and a sign language ii
esther follows along in her own bible and kate notices aphoto poking from between its pages
all she can see is the face of a rugged looking man in his s
she eyes it curiously
kate is cleaning picking maxs clothes up from off the
she sees something that gives her pause one of maxs stuffed animals has a string of pearls hung around its neck
esther and max are playing a board game
kate enters with the pearls and shows them to max
did you take this out of my jewelry box
max shakes her head confused
then how did it get in your room
somebody put this around t
who was it if it wasnt
she looks nervous
go take a time out and think about it
but were playing she can finish your game later
to max come on
max pouts and follows kate upstairs
esther watches them go
esther stands in front of a class full of kids
their teacher mrs
grosse is introducing her
esthers wearing a pretty little dressand shirley temple curls but her usually unflappable smile seems wary uncertain in the face of these staring third graders
this is our new student
her name is esther coleman and i want you all to make her feel very welcome today
one of the kids brenda whispers
a wisecrack to a friend
esther shifts uncomfortably
esther sits at the end of the table where brenda and her friends are eating
they eye her derisively
esther ignores them and prays over her lunch
the other girls exchange amused looks
brenda folds her hands and makes an earnest mocking face dear jesus please help me to not dress like such a freak tomorrow
the girls laugh
esther pays no attention
daniel and his friends austin and trevor run down a short path through the woods behind
the colemans house to a tall tree
camera reveals an enclosed treehouse about ten feet up this is no little rascals job this thing was professionally built
they climb up to it
inside daniel throws back a rug and pries up a loose plank
under it is a small stash of weed
boys open their video ina ine s c b o books and an old a playboy
wi h cindy crawford the c cindy crawford
this magazines older than we axe shes probably got like wrinkly old grandma boobs howl they laugh
daniel sparks up a joint
suddenly do you want to play
the boys quickly waving the wke away
esther and max are lo king up lat them get out of here

esther smiles then leads max away
the boys watch them go

trevor and austin laugh
daniel flushes angry and embarrassed
kate finishes drawing a bath for esther
i think we should try this with the door unlocked tonight

what if someone comes in and sees me
nobodysgoing to come in
ill stand right outside the door
i could sing for you
at the home i used to sing so the sisters would know i was all right
esthers eyes are desperate pleading
kate closes the door
the lock clicks shut
a moment later esther starts bumming
kate listens fbr a beat troubled
esther and max are huddled in bed and kate reads them a story
john watches from the doorway
kate sees him and smiles
kates in bed writingin her journal by the light of d bedside lamp
outside rain patters on the window and lightning fl shbs
john kisses her good night
she smiles and surprises him by pulling him close and kissing him more deeply
she places his hand on her breast and he starts to undress her
a knock at the door
john and kate cringe at the interruption
the door opens
its esther and max
were scared of the lightning
kate and john exchange a resigned look
okay come on
but just for tonight
esther and max excitedly clamber into the bed and snuggle between them
kate and john share amused looks
the kids are eating breakfast
esther reads her sign language book at the table
max signs to daniel
he turns to kate with a frustrated sigh
mom whats she saying
she wants you to pass the milk
kate gives daniel an admonishing look
if you studied more you wouldnt have to ask all the time
daniel glares fit esther but she doesnt see it
john enters ready for work
he grabs his travel mug gives kate a kiss

esther puts dut her arms for a hug
he leans in to kiss her but she clings to him and wont let go
i want you to take us to school
she looks up at him with big sad eye
he cant resist
i guess i can be late today
to kate i can take them to school and you can pick them up

she jumps up from the breakfast table and runs off to get ready
the kids are leaving for school with john
kate sees them off
kate gives him and max a kiss but esther runs right by without pausing hurrying after john
takes john a hand holding it on the way to the car
kate watches them a little hurt
rate sits with esther watching her open a gift wrapped box
inside is a journal like the one weve seen kate writing in
i have a journal just like this that i write in every day
what kinds of things do you write about
what i did that day how i feel
anything i dont want to forget
i thought you and i could spend some time together today and start a life book
its like an adoption storybook
and its all about you
i did a couple pages to gat you started
she opens the journal
the first page is a photo
from a daddy get rmarrieed ng esthermarvelskat katesgwedding dress
kate turns the page to a picture of
khte and john with daniel as a baby
then kate john and six year old daniel with baby max
this is daniel when he was born and theres max and theres you
she turns next to a photo of the whole family taken at esther s welcome home party
the caption reads esther joins the family
if you want we can put your other pictures in here too
what other pictures
the ones i saw in
esther gives her a dismayed look
they slipped out at church
if theyre private we dont have
to its okay
i want you to see them
she smiles but it looks forced
kate and esther sit on the floor
removes the rubber band from around her bible and takes out a few battered photographs
theyre all of esther with a rural family the man
kate saw in the photo at church his wife
and three boys aged and
in one theyre all posed together in front of a farmhouse
these are the wallaces
thats james and hannah
and thats micah luke and isaiah
this is the american family that adopted you from russia
theyre candid family snapshots full of
laughter and hugs
s adopted father is in all of them
the last one is of him and
esther the same photo kate

they must have loved youvery much
ksther nods but kate sees that shes holding back tears
i hid these because ididnt want you to know how much i miss them i was afraid youd think i didnt love you
its okay sweetie
beat considers you know i lost someone who was very special to me once too
esther wipes her eyes and looks up interest piqued
kate shows esther the orchid in its ornate planter
we dont have any pictures of jessica because she died while she was still in my tunny
but we spread her ashes in here and as long as
this flower grows part of her will be alive inside it
its okay to be sad
about the people weve lost
s okay to iniss them too
theysmile at one another through their tears
between classes crowded with kids
esther clutches her books to her chest
daniel and trovor are walking the other way and as they pass daniel dumps esthers books
esther glares atdaniel and kneels to pick up her books bitt the kids walking by purposefully kick them laughing faces leering down at her
she gathers her books but one of them is missing
she looks around
esthers bible lies on the floor at someones feet
hand reaches down
and picks it up
is this a bibl
give it back to me
she reaches for it but brenda laughs and raises it over her head
jesus freak brought a bible to school
esther angrily swipes at it again but one of brendas friends grabs it first
esther takes a deep breath trying to calm down
may i pleas
have my bible
the girl hesitates shrugs and offers sather the bible
but snatches it away again at the last second
sther reaches for it but the girls keep passing it between them
esther and brenda grab it at the same time
theres a brief tug of war then the rubber band snaps and the bible flies apart pages and hp otos scattering everywhere
esther gasps in horror and dives to the floor desperately scooping up the loose pages
a crowd gathers watching and snickering daniel and trevor among them
esther looks to daniel for help but he just stands there watching uncomfortably
brenda laughs at esther crawling around on all fours
look at the cute little doggied is this your collar little doggie
brenda reaches out and grabs the ribbon around rsthdrls neck
the second brenda touches the ribbon esther flies into panic
she screams an s brendae hand away aching h ex e and k coking feet ster s riekincr at the toy dg her
brenda leaps back wide eyed and freaked out
the kids fall into stunned silence
esthers screams echo in the hallway
a teacher comes running
trevor puts a hand over his mouth so the teacher wont see him laughing
dude your sisters a
total spazl shes not my sister
the drive home from school
is silent and tense
esther stares out the window
kate eyes her in the rearview mirror concerned
the minivan isparked in the drive and the kids are climbing out
as daniel and max head to the house kate takes esther aside
grosse told me what happened today
do you want to talk
daniel hangs back to see if esther is going to tell on him
she sees him standing there then turns to rate with a smile
theres nothing to talk about
we were just playing a game thats all
she walks away passing daniel without a look
max enters throws down her hello kitty bookbag and stops short
max stands frozen for a beat then starts looking for him
esther appears in the doorway
whats the matter
max turns and tries to block the cage but esther sees that its empty
where is he
were you playing with him
max frantically shakes her head
esther quickly shuts the door
you left his cage open
sure enough the door of the cage is wide open
max shakes her head frightened tears in her eyes
then how did he get out
you have to think
mommys not going to believe your
believe you about the necklace and shes not going to believe you about this
max is devastated
shes sobbing now
esther tries to calm her
it a okay
look at me
she takes max by the shoulders
max looks up breath hitching
ill tell monmy it was my fault
you wont get in any trouble
ill tell her i took him out of the cage without your permission and he ran away okay
max gives a grateful nod
esther smiles and strokes maxs hair
itll be our little secret
max nods again and gives her a hug
she doesnt see the calculating look in esthers eyes
a glassed in terrace off of kate and johns bedroom filled with plants
kate is wearing only a long t shirt watering the plants before bed
john enters in his pajama bottoms snuggles into her from behind
kate smiles and
leans into him
the lights are off
kate and john are in bed making lave
slow passionate intense
when theyre finished breathless and trembling she cradles his face in her hands gazing lovingly up at
then something catches her eye in the moonlight ethel jg
wat them fr m the open b edr door hgr hen frozen j tth dooxknob
oh my god
they hurriedly pull the sheets up and kate turns on the bedside lamp
esther stares at them blankly
what is it
are you okay
esther just glowers ather then turns and walks away
sits at her easel painting
kate enters and sits down on the bed
esther doesnt look at her
shes painting a sophisticated stylized portrait of kate
other portraits of the family arealready pinned to the wall
kate shifts uncomfortably
we need to talk about last night
there are certain things that
grown ups do
that kids arent supposed to see
and that was one of them
esther keeps painting
she still hasnt looked at her
esther i need you to listen to me
she deliberately sets her paintbrush down and turns to kate
an awkward beat
see when two grown ups love each other very very much they like to
show that love to each other iknow
kate is dumbfounded
esther regards her with a bored aloof look
john is troubled by what kate has told him
she could nave picked it up anywhere
bell she probably heard it at school
this wasnt something she overheard
she knew what it meant
and the way she saidit
i dont even think she expected to get in trouble over it
well talk to her about it tonight
you think thats enough
what do you suggest
i could take her to doctor browning
it was one dirty word
i dont think we need to call in the shrink just yet
it just reminded the of what sister abigail said
we really dont know that much about her
the last family she was with could have been like pass the fucking potatoes at the dinner table for all we know
iget it i just don t want to make a bigger deal out of it than it is
if shes saying fuck to my face whats she doing when were not around
we have to be thinking about what kind of influence shes having on daniel and max
i wouldnt worry about it
youre right we dont know how she was raised but we do know shes a good kid
if danny and max want to start acting
like her thats fine with me
esther and max pick wildflowers along the edge of the forest
lets pick flowers for daddy
then esther notices something that makes her stop short
a girl approaching on a bicycle
she pretends to not see bather just rides right by
esther watches her face strangely slack
then starts to follow her
max gives esther a confused look but tags along
esther finds brendas bike parked at a neighborhood playground swings carousel jun le gym and a tall corkscrew slide made tor look like a rocket ship
there are kids playing
a boneless guy with a shopping cart full of stuffed garbage bags asleep by a tree
esther ignores them all
brenda is climbing on the jungle gym with some other kids
esther walks over with max in tow and just watches brenda play
brenda sees her and makes a face
esther just stands there
what are you looking at
max tug on esthers arm but shes rooted in place staring blankly at brenda
finally brenda cant take it
she climbs off the jungle gym and walks away
esther watches her go
brenda gets on a swing but just as she starts to get some height ester right there
star n p a her again
max happily grabs a swing for herself but esther is fixated on brenda
stop staring at
mel stop ital
but esther is unwavering
cant take her eyes off of her
brenda gets off the swing and runs away
esther calmly walks after her
stop following me freak
max sees esther following brenda and grudgingly gets off the swing hurrying to catch up
brenda gives them an angry look
why dont you two go home and change each others diapers
esther and max follow brenda across the park max still uncertain about whats going on
brenda heads for
the tall corkscrew slide
steep stairs lead to the enclosed top the tip of the rocket ship
brenda starts up the stairs then pauses
she turns to esther
you go first
esther doesnt move but max gladly takes her turn
after a beat esther follows max up the stairs
brenda stays behind watching
max goes down the spiraling slide but esther just stands at the top looking down at brenda
esther continues to stare down at her for a beat then turns and disappears from eight
then does brenda climb up
max runs to the stairs for another turn
brenda reaches the top and looks around
she sees max
but wheres esther
suddenly es er is right in ail of her
she didnt go down the slide she was just crouched out of sight
brenda gasps then este spits jn her face acrd ush hex dawn the airs
brenda screams as she falls limbs flailing out of control
she lands hard in the dirt and just lies there crying clutching her arm and bleeding from a gash in her forehead
brendas scream draws alarmed looks
the homeless guy startles awake
one of the playground mothers comes running to help
but max stands frozen gaping at esther in total shock
esther stares blankly down
at brenda from atop the slide
brendas father arrives on the scene
brenda says something
to him and points at esther and max who watch from a distance
are you going to tell on me
i didnt mean to hurt her
i just wanted her to stop picking on me
off maxs look dont you hate it when someone is mean to you for no reason
wouldnt you do almost anything to make them stop
esther offers her hand and max takes it
esther and max sit at the table
kate and john eye them sternly
brenda says you pushed her
thats not true
we were just playing and she tripped
to max did you see what happened
esther eyes max expectantly
then kate sighs not entirely convinced
kate carefully tends the memorial orchid spraying it with a fine mist of water
kates watering the plants when she feels something onher hand
theres an ant on it
she flicks it off
then she seed another this one crawling up her arm
she makes a face and looks down
thg g are ante arwl ng loon a arou her feet
she quickly steps back brushing at her arms and legs
she looks under one of the plant tables tosee whats attracted them its hodgepodge
hes been dead for several days his body swarming with ants and maggots
coleman residence i garden night a hole has been dug in the backyard flower garden
kate john esther and max stand around it
max places a shoebox with hodgepodge written on it in the hole and lays a flower on top of it
john starts shoveling dirt into the bole
esther and max exchange a knowing look
esther and max are giggling and playing dress up
clothes are strewn everywhere
theyre both trying to look grown up
theyre even wearing makeup heavy mascara and pink painted cheeks
daniel walks by and sees max putting on lipstick
he takes it away from her
hey youre not allowed to wear makeup
does mom know you have this
give it back
give it backor ill tell daddy that you hit her and then youll be in trouble
daniel scowls at esther then gives max the lipstick
max gives esther a hug
best friends forever
f l it
supermarket day kate waits in line at the check out
esther and max are with her
kate pushes her cart up to the counter she looks over and sees the nearby wine spirits aisle
deal just a passing glance a flash of idle distraction
her eyes unreadable
then what kind of sex do men crave most
kate looks back shocked
esther has picked up a cosmopolitan from the newsstand and isreading the cover aloud to max
put that away
dont look at those
kate puts the magazine back
there are several others just like it at kids eye level
thrill every inch of him j katesighs and starts putting groceries on the conveyer
how to hit your g spot every time
esther has picked up the same magazine
kate angrily snatches it and pulls esther toward her
stand where i can see yowl the cashier and a couple customers turn to look at her
kate ignores them
esther cant suppress a little smile
the family is eating dinner
esther makes a face and pushes her plate away half finished
may i be excused
at least eat your chicken
im not going to eat something that i dont like just to make you feel better
esther stop it
eat the chicken and then you can be excused
esther starts eating
kate gives john an exasperatedlook
the doo rbel

shes carrying hello sister abigail
esther leads sister abigail upstairs
kate and john follow to need updated charts i ta also going t from her

esther leads kate john and sister abigail into her room
isnt it lovely

ive done a portrait for everyone in the family
she shows sister abigail the portraits pinned to her wall
theres also a painting of everyone together
thats one good looking family youve got
arent they perfect
sister abigail gives kate and john an amused look kate john and sister abigail talk over coffee
i swear we didnt bribe her to say that
no explanation necessary
i dont think there eanything that girl could say that would surprise me
she dropped the t bomb on me a few weeks ago
sister abigail raises her eyebrows in comic exaggerated surprise
im glad to hear shes finally come out of her shell
shes just testing us
its been nowhere near as bad as we expected
what kinds of things is she doing
talking back to me
she took max to the park without ppesrmission the other day
that was the biggie
a girl they were playing with got hurt
sister abigail is suddenly apprehensive tries to cover
is the girl all right
she broke her arm and had to have something like eleven stitches i think
she was lucky
sound very lucky
shes lucky she didnt break her neck
sister abigail seems troubled by this
sister abigail walks out to her car concerned
she doesnt see esther spying down from her bedroom
window just staring at her with that strange blank look
kate gives a piano lesson to a
college s tudent listening as he runs
through a finger exercise
wrists following fingers
john leads esther and max on a bike ride around the neighborhood
esther speeds up leaving max behind so she can ride next to john
im daddys little girl arent i
you both are
as they head home they see joyce patterson late s jogging toward them
a blonde with dark roots and an overdone boob job
wearing a skimpy sports bra and mini shorts
she waves to tem
look at these three cutiesl howre you doing
hanging in there
a chair x want moved upstairs
you think you could come over and give me a hand
john glances toward home
kates at the door waving goodbye to the college student
she sees john talking to joyce and gives them an unreadable look before going back inside
maybe kate and i could help you out
okay ill call you
john and max start off again butesther doesnt move
shes openly looking joyce over from head to toe
you have a l ovely body
come on esther
esther reluctantly follows
joyce eyes her dubiously
john acid the girls enter
kate has juice boxes for the girls
look passes between john and rate
how was the
did you have fun
max nodsand heads off but esther hangs back eavesdropping didnt waste arty time turning that divorce settlement into a tit job did she
i didnt notice
shes teasing but theres something biting underneath it
esther walks away sipping on her juice box
sister abigail is at her desk
she opens a file and reads
we see a polaroid of esther stapled to the cover
midway rides and boardwalk games have been set up in the parking lot of daniel and esthers school
a banner reads edgar elementary annual halloween hoot
the place is packed with excited children in halloween costumes
the school is at thetop of a steep hill
kate and john walk up it with the kids
daniels dressed as a ninja max is a finding nemo fish and esthers an angel complete with a shiny halo
john gives daniel some money to hang out with austin and trevor
on the boardwalk playing games winning prizes
esther shoots bbs at balloons with a toy rifle
shes pretty good at it
on the midway esther and max are whirled around on the scrambler screaming and laughing
kate and john watch and take pictures
a cheap fun house attraction
the girls ran up to john and kate
we want to go in by ourselves
okay just make sure you hold her hand
john smiles but kate watches anxiously
esther leads max through the dark winding fun house corridors
max starts to look cared
she nearly leaps
out of her skin when a rubber masted ghoul jumps out at them
but esther just laughs at it
max sees that shes not afraid and soon theyre both giggling at the cheesy spooks that try to scare them
the girls emerge frtn themaze clutching each other and laughing
lets play hide and seek
you go first
max excitedly runs off
esther watches her vanish into the crowd
moments later kate and john appear
rate nervously looks around
i dont know
i was trying to hold her hand but she pushed me and ran away
did you see where she went
this way i think
she points the wrong way
kate takes her hand and they quickly move through the crowd looking for max
john stands on a bench for a better vantage kate grabs passersby have you seen a little girl in a fish costume
she has short brown hair
nobodys seen her
kate grows frantic
esther watches with a nonchalant smile enjoying the drama
she tugs on kates arm
i mommy i want scene cotton candy
not now esther ia kate please
take it easy
shes gotta be around here then kate spots daniel approaching holding maxs hand
kate breathes a sigh of
relief and rushes to give max a fierce hug
are you all right
dont you ever run off like that what were you thinking
they were playing hide and seek
i saw esther let her run off
esther gives him a sharp look
john turns on her
did you lie to us
what did i tell you aboutholding her hand
im sorry sir
she looks like shes going to cry
john sighs then turns to kate and max
esther gives daniel a hateful look through her tears
the kids pile into the minivan for school
as daniel climbs in esther drops something behind him and pretends to find it
she shows kate a little plastic baggie of weed
daniel blanches when he sees it
kate and john confront daniel
i wasnt taking it to school then what was it doing in your backpack
i dont knowl she just put it there to
get me in troubles
where wouldesther have gotten pot
a beat reluctant she saw me wcth it in the treehouse
is that what
youre doing out
there with austin and trevor
john screws a hasp to the treehouse door with a power drill and slaps a padlock on it
daniel stands below watching
john climbs down shows daniel the padlock key and pockets it
off limits until further notice
be heads to the house esther is playing in the backyard
she takes johns hand and walks inside with him
daniel watches them
kate pulls out of the driveway with esther in the back seat
as they leave the neighborhood joyce patterson jogs by in her skimpy workout clothes
kate gives a polite nod
why does she have todress like that
she just likes the attention
well i think its immodest
i dont know why daddy likes her so much
a beat apprehensive what do you mean
hes always smiling at her and talking to her
she wants him to come over to her house
did you know that
off kates look please dont tell aaddy i told
i dont want him to be mad at me
kate doesnt respond clearly disturbed
kate gets out of the minivan but esther stays put in her seat
rate sighs frazzled and distracted
esther come on
x told you i dont like the de ntist
theres nothing to be afraid of
because im not going esther get out of the cart righ t now
for a moment they just glare at each other
mexican stand off
then esther sticks her nose in the air and does as shes told
the dentist lowers esther back in the chair pulls on rubber gloves
the hygienist clips a dental bib around esthers neck
she hasnt had a check up in about two years so shes a little nervous
she doesnt look to me
now lets have a look at those co ppers
esther just looks at the ceiling with her mouth tightly shut
come on darling open wide
esther eyes him anxiously then reluctantly opens
just a bit
that a girl little wider
she opens more
he leans in to take a look
suddenly she shdmps dawnn his jinx s hard pnou h to draw blo mss fr and locks i n like rottweilei the hygienist is frozen in shock
help me with her
the hygienist holds her down while the dentist tries to pry her mouth open
finally he yanks his fingers free cradling them
esther hisses at ldm like a cat lips flecked with blood
the dentist and hygienist exchange a startled
kate bits waiting
the hygienist enters
kate gives her a confused look
then she notices esther htanding behind the hygienist with a smug grin onher face
kate stews on her last frayed nerve
esther gazes out the window seemingly oblivious singing a little nonsense song under her breath la la la la la la la
la la la
kate stops at a traffic light
shes stopped next to a liquor
kate quickly looks
away her temptation real enough to startle her
the light turns green and she drives off without looking back
esther keeps singing
a few blocks later they pass a bar
then a bus shelter with a big absolute vodka ad
kate probably drives by them every day but now theyre popping out at her sly old enemies that never really left re emerging from the shadowy recesses of her mind
she tries to focus on the road esthers voice grating in her head
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
kate and esther enter
esther skips upstairs
kate sighs angry and frustrated
she plays a message on the answering machine
hello this is sister abigail calling for john and kate
please call me as soon as you get this message
something that we need to discuss in person
esther stands at the top of the stairs listening to the message shes heard everything
and shes scared
scared and pissed
kate and john get ready for bed
hes been our dentist for ten years
why would he lie to us
i didnt say hes lying
i just think ws blowing it out of proportion i saw the bite marks
were lucky hes not suing us
fine but i dont believe for a second that she just did it for no reason
thats because shes always on her best behavior with you
ive had to deal with her at her worst
what you think is her worst is what shes like with me all the time
shes completely different with me than she is with you
so youve seen her haul offand bite someone like an animal
no but she threw that fit at school yeah because the other kids were harassing her
its the same thing here
off her reaction shes from a completely different culture kate
she has to be taught that this
behavior isnt appropriate but theres nothing malicious about it
ifshe says she bit him because she was scared and he was hurting her i dont see any reason not to believe her
kate looks at him
shes stewing hbaut something
believe her when she says youve been hitting on joyce patterson
taken aback did she say that
is it true
of course not
did she invite you over
she wanted me to help her move a chair
oh come on
all right she was obviously coming to me
but i shut her down
then why didnt you tell me
because i knew how youd reactl really
you sure it wasnt because you were coming on to her so obviously that an eight year old picked upon it
a long beat
john sighs resigned
how long are you going to keep this hanging over me
it was ten years ago
you keep saying that
but its only been about two years since you told me
a tense beat having another child was supposed to bring us together
im sorry i didnt tell you about it x just feel like ive earned a little trust here
i dont know what you expect from me
i might never completely trust you again
not like before
i gave you a second chance
kate stops short
iiis words are like a phybical blow
thats not fair
so you can keep bringing up my
mistakes over and over but were not even allowed to discuss yours
i was sick
you were just an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else
you were a danger to our children
if i didnt want to
make this work i could have left months ago and nobody would have blamed me
is that what your mother told you
angry tears well in her eyes
he realizes be went too far
kate goes into the bathroom and slams the door
esther and max sit on the bed in their nightgowns
only the bedside light is on
theyre signing to one anothe r
the man lady ys comm tomorrow
max anxiously nods her head
the room is dark
the girls sneak in still in their nightgowns and close the door
esther turns on a reading lamp
look for the key to the treehouse
max nods and they start searching the room
esther rifles through john s desk
she looks in a closet
a dark plastic case with two padlocks on it catches her eye
max opens a
keepsake chest and finds several keys on a ring
she excitedly shows them to esther
esther smiles and takes them
as theyre about to leave
she looks back at the closed closet
then looks at the keys
max eyes her curiously
esther slides a chair over to
the closet and opens it
she stands on the chair pulls down the case with the padlocks on it and sets it on the floor
she tries a couple of
theres a gun inside
a shiny revolver and a box of ammunition
esthers face lights up
carefully picks up the gun turns it over looks at it
maxs eyes nearly pop out
esther gives her a sly look then loads a single bullet spins
and points the cmn at ax
aht between the bye do you want to play
max shakes her head
esther smiles fingers the trigger
after a long awful pants wetting eternity she lowers the gun
wed better not
sister abigail sits across from kate and john with a grave look
when you first asked about adopting esther i expressed some misgivings
but i wasnt completely straightforward with you
you see i love children
ive worked with them my entire life
and the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement
but the truth is that i knew there was something wrong with esther from the moment i laid eyes on her
kate sits up concerned
you said you suspected some kind of abuse
yes but there was something else
it was hard to say chat it was at first
just a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl
beat s eemed then i notaced that she always k to
be around whenever ther wwasa get kind of trouble
two girls iii a fight
and there shed be
someone would get caught stealing
and ell shed myself it was but i never really
beat l who after you told me about the gir broke her arm e started wondering again
i called the achool esther went to while she was with the wallaces and asked if thered been any serious accidents while she
one incident was still fresh in everyones minds
a boy in one of her classes was stabbed in the throat with a pair of scissors
all the kids who saw it happen said it was an accident that he was running with the scissors and fell
but once again esther was there
is eavesdropping from around the corner
she slips away
but none of these things were her fault
thats g i was reluc
tant to t anything bef ore
nowi think th at may a have been a mistake
off their looks children like esther whove spent their entire lives in institutions have never had a chance to form normal lasting bonds
the longterm effects of this can be devastating
in the very worst cases children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference betweenright and wrong
they can lie cheat steal or worse and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions
they view other human beings as objects pawns for their amusement
and they can be potentially very dangerous
white s gloves like shes esther pulls on a pair of
dinty hurch services dressing for morninga
doesht sound like esther at all
a severely character disturbed child can appear to be completely normal even exceptional
its like they have two faces one they show the outside world in orderto get what they want and the other their true face lying just beneath the surface
max sits on her bed wearing a jacket and clutching her bello
anxious and waiting
what about the orphanage in russia where she was raised
wouldnt they have been able to tell
ive put in a call to the director there but she could have easily slipped through the
so the bottom line here is that you dont have proof of any of this
thats true i dont
but i believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step
which is what
get esther out ofthe house
kate and john are stunned
you want to disrupt the adoption over this
if im wrong she can come back home
but you need to get her to a therapist who can tell you what youre dealing shes just a kids shes also the sole survivor of a house fire that
killed her last family
off their looks it was arson
i did some checking
someone deliberately set that fire
they never caught who did it
wait a minute youre not suggesting pyromania is one of the warning signs of a character disturbed child
rate blanches realizing do you think she had something to do withwhat happened to yolanda
a long beat
sister abigail hesitates reluctant to answer
the thought that a child could cougnit such a monstrous crime flies in the face of everything i hold dear
but in my opinion ata a possibility that you need to take very seriously
esther slides the door open on screeching rails and steps inside
walks over to johns workbench
looks at the tool rack above it
kate and john are stunned by what sister abigail has told them
we can take her to doctor browning
kate suggested doing that weeks ago
but i dont want to send her away
not without at least some kind of proof
kate turns to him
but what if the doctor says shes dangerous
he considers uncertain and emotional
then i guess we
bave any choice
daniel sits near
the brook sullenly throwing rocks in the water
he hears something behind him and turns
esther and max are running off through
the woods leaves crashing under their feet
neither of them ree him
he eyes them curiously
sister abigail ie leaving
rate and john stand by the front door troubled watching her go
esther and max run towardthe bridge where
the road into the neighborhood crosses the brook
they climb an embankment and crouch
by the bridge abutment out of breath
esther looks both ways
theres no traffic
she and max hide behind the abutment
sister abigail drives away
she takes a pack of cigarettes from the glove compartment and lights one
the girlb wait by the abutment
the only sound is the rippling brook
max looks nervous
esther gives her a reassuring smile
its going to be fine
just wave your arms and make sure she stops
then esther hears a car coming
she peers outfrom behind the abutment
its sister abigails car
esther quickly ducks out of sight
wait until she gets close
max nervously peers out from behind the abutment
esther stands behind her
the car starts across the bridge
suddenly sthe pusbes max it into the load
stumbles and falls ri ht m
on of the speedi car
sister abigail gasps and slams on the brakes tires squealing stopping the car mere feet from where max lies in the road
jumps out of the car and kneels next to max
are you okay honey
max looks up at her stunned but unhurt
sister abigai is taken aback
she recognizes her
a shadow falls on abigail from behind
she turns and looks up
over her a claw hammer raised above her head
efor is a abigail va e a esther angrily hits her in tie l head as hard as she can with the hammer
max startles eyes wide with shock
sister abigail falls and lies twitching on the pavement
eyes staring blankly one pupil wide from the head trauma
blood trickles from under her headdress
as max stares at
the body paralyzed with fear esther scurries into sister abigails car and finds her purse
she flips through her wallet
cash credit cards
takes it all
finds her rosary beads
grabs them too
then she hurries back to the body
help me get her off the road
max looks up blankly then staggers
to her feet
they each take a hand and start dragging sister abigails body but shes heavy and theyre little
its all they can do to slowly move her
then esther hears something
theres another car coming
its still out of sight through the trees but closing
esther and max hurriedly drag the body struggling it to the side of the road just as the car rounds the bend
esther gives the body a kick sending it rolling down the embankment
the car is almost on them
esther and max quickly hide under the bridge
esther grabs maxs backpack and pulls u wig cm
the car reaches the bridge
esther listens to it cross tense gun
but it passes abigails car and continues without stopping
esther breathes a sigh of relief
suddenly theres a croaring noise from behind them
its sister abigail
shes still alive
shes trying to speak but all that comes out is an awfulmoan
esther scowls and grabs the hammer
sister abigail looks up at her moaning louder
then esther brings the hammer down
the moans stop
esther hits her again and again
ma x pr cataton ipes her se p rettysdr sand white glove harernow splaa ered ith blood
e s t t did you get any on you
max shakes her head pale and shivering
lets get her covered up
esther starts scooping leaves and debris onto sister abigails corpse
max just watches fora long beat
then shuffles over like a zombie and helps her
esther is wearing a clean dress
she stuffs maxs hello kitty backpack under the looue floorboard where daniel
used to keep his weed
max is huddled in a corner still dazed
as the y talk esther laces the bloody from sister ibigails car i a lastic grocery bag s ade ties kit
if you tell on me youll get in trouble too
that doesnt matter
theyll send you to jail just for helping me bury her
max starts to cry
esther moves closer comforting
she wanted to take me away from you
now we eau be together forever
daniel heads home on the path through the forest
be hears a noise up ahead and sees esther and max emerge from the treeh ouse
he quickly hides
esther locks the treehouse and looks around see him
she and down and walk home hol d din in g pe ers out at them
daniel the usual suspects are here
the homeless guy with
his shopping cart rooting through a trash can
a vendor selling a spongebob popsicle from a cart
camera follows the spongebob pop as
the vendor hands it to a little girl
she smiles at the
vendor and walks away
she spots the homeless guy across the park and casually heads toward him
as she approaches we see that shes carrying the plastic yrocery bag with the bloody hammer and sister abigails things in t
she carefully looks around to snake sure nobody is watching then nonchalantly tosses the incriminating bag into the homeless guys shopping cart and keeps walking sucking on her spongebob pop
rate hangs up the phone and turns to john
shes canceling some appointments so we can get her in tomorrow
they hear esther humming upstairs and exchange a disgiuieted look
esther hums o
her black velvet ribbons have been removed and laid out in a row on the counter
camera moves to the bathtub where esther is taking a bath
the water is faintly red
shes scrubbing under her fingernails
humming pleasantly to herself
and now we see what the ribbons have been covering the has t ick knotte t h e wa x u ht
r neck and wrists
john sits on his
desk eyeing daniel wearily
esther and max
you saw them
the treehouse is still locked
esther had the keys
you mean these keys here
he goes over tothe keepsake chest and opens it
the key ring is there
he holds it up
youre not lying to get them in trouble
no i swear
sighs exasperated i dont know whats got into you lately
just go to your room
daniel leaves dejected
and trudges upstairs
fe doesnt see esthe emi eras from j a sh dows behin hii she glares angrily after him
alone now john looks at the
key ring considering
be goes to the closet looks at thegun case
takes it down
is right where it belongs
he sighs and closes the case
daniel is in bed sound asleep the doorknob turns the door creaks open
someone sneaks into his room approachinbglh ss bbed
turns on the bedside light daniel stirs squinting its esther
daniel looks up at her confused
ruaaenlv shs fistful gf i hair and slam bis hea hmk
aqg inst the before he can cal ou he w o a pai of scissors an plunges them tows d his face daniel gasps but the gleaming point of the
scissors stops short hovering less than an inch from his wide staring eye
esther leans in her face wild and terrifying
daniel lies there breathless paralyzed with fear
scissors drift from his eye his between his legs
holds fast by his ha ir
ervoiceis ane h il ssibant bhiss you te
anybody what you saw and i will cut your hairless little prick off before you even figure out what it s for
do you understand me
she rapidly cuts the air with the scissors snip snipi daniel frantically nods his head
she twists his hair again
i wont tells i wont tell t xomisel p she holds him for a beat savoring his fear
a dabx stain seeps through the bedspread
esther sees it and grins
you pissed yourself
daniel is crying humiliated belplesa
too terrified to dare make a sound
finally she releases him and turns off the light
as ick ad it bwgan it shes go
up in a b all and his faa in his pillow stifl e his bobs a secretary sits behind a desk
kate flips through a magazine
m john glances at his watch
rate gives him a moment later dr browning emerges from r office u with esther
it was nice talking to you alice
i i hope we can be friends
id like that
kate and john you can come on in dr
brownings manner is serious
kate and john sit anxious
o well lets start with what youca me here for
you dont have anything be worried about with bsther
john breathes a sigh of relief
kate gives a dubious smile
shes not dangerous
no of course not
not all good news
you do have a serious problem in
but the real issue is with you rate kate reacts stunned
she turns to the secretary may i go to the restroom
kate cant believe what shes hearing i was able to coax her into admitting that theres been some tension between the two of you
shes really tr
ing very hard to please you
the problem is that youre blocking her attempts to attach with you
thats why whenever something bad happens you blame her whether its really her fault or not
but thats not whats
i doubt youre even aware that youre doing it
but subconsciously you t aunt her to be bad because demonizing her is your way of covering your own feelings of inadequacy as a mother
i dont feel inadequate
but you do have doubts
you worry that you could relapse
what does that have to do withesther
your guilt over what happened with max is preventing you from bonding with esther
kate turns to john aghast but hes taking this very seriously
its made you doubt your fitness as a mother
and that terrifies you
so youre having trouble with esther alonv comes sister abigail with these stories about her being some kind of monster and you believe them because
it f s easier than with yojw fear that theres something hwrong th you
what the hell did she tell you
lets not m ke this about herana m a d dne real progress with her today tell you with complete certainty that esther is not to blame here
in a c amera moves in on one o sthex is in a ba muttering t herself her eyes glassy and star she didnt see
she doesnt know
she doesnt knout ahitl she starts pounding the walls of stall th her fists
we cut between her a dr
b rowning talking to ltate shes an extremely bright thoughtful sensitive little girl going through a very challenging time
esther clutches her head rocking back and forth
goddamn coaksucking bitch
thinks she knows well doesnt know shit
you just have to learn to be more patient
youre really very lucky to have her
esthers fit has passed
she neatly composes herself and emerges from the stall
and sees that theres a woman at the sink
she eyes esther warily
probably heard everything
esther hesitates then walks right by with
her nose in the air
john pulls the car in out of the rain
they get out and esther
when kate is sure shes out of earshot thanks for the support back there
hey im not a psychiatrist
and a lot of what shes saying makes sense
before she can respond nates cell phone rings
she turns away from john andanswers it
he sighs and goes inside
is this mrs
this is sister judith from saint cabrinis
im sorry to bother you
did sister abigail make
it to her appointment with you yesterday
t txnder rolls
crime scene tape flutters in the rain
police cars are parked on the roadside lights flashing
detectives shine flashli
ghtsunder the bridge
sister abigails body has been discovered
kate and john sit across from a police detective and two uniformed patrol officers
kate and john are still in shock
well help in any way we can
we at least owe her that much
do you have any idea who could have done this
a suspect in custody based on an anonymous tip
were just trying
to place ham at the time we think the murder took place
who is it
i cant tell you that right now
but he was found with the murder weapon along with some cash and credit cards
at kind of sick monster carjacks a nun
kate glances up sees esther crouched on the stairs watching
family room day daniel sits in a big recliner sullenly playing a video game shoot em op
kate is researching on the internet
we get close shots of some of her google
results inte ctfs with daniel blasting away at alien baddies his face angry and intense character disturbed children
blame blame antisocial personality djsorder
pl f blami c ren o kfll
esther enters holding maxs handy leadin her around like a pet
max numbly follows
they walk up to danielin the recliner
we want to sit there
esther daniel was there first
daniel eyes esther
wary but defiant
she sighs and makes a cutting motion with two fingers
daniel brusquely turns off th e game and gets out of the chair
as he leaves kate calls out daniel
he ignores her and stomps upstairs
she watches him concerned
kate shows john some pages shes printed out from the internet
this is what sister abigail was telling us about
character disturbed children look at the symptoms
difficulty making and keeping frinnds
cruelty to pets
bossy and controlling
overly affectionate with strangers
extended period of bedwetting
abnormal eye contact
she doesnt have half of these
i still think doctor brow have missed something
have just told her what she wanted to hear
flips ages reading character disturbed children are adroit manipulators
they can be exceptionally charismatic oftentimes playing people off one another to get what they want
save you showed this to doctor
hesitates im not seeing her anymore
youre not going to therapy
when did you decide that
when do you think
a tense beat
i know you were
but we have to at least consider the possibility that shes right about this
no we dont
why does everybody around here get the
benefit of the doubt fro m you except me
thats not true
worried about you thats all
we can hire someone to help you with the kids if its getting to be too much
i dont need help
all i want is for a doctor who knows what theyre doing to give us a second opinion
all the lights are out except for the black light in the aquarium
bather is touching up the painting of the mother lion we saw when we first met her but we cant see what shes doing to it
the black light causes some of the paints on her palette to fluoresce
john and kates voices carry up through the heating vent
were not going to
keep taking her to doctors until you hear what you want to hear
thats not what im trying to dal i want this to work just as much as you do but there are
that we still dont havethe answers to
if sister abigail was right about esther
then people are dead because of she didnt really believe that
she didnt want to believe it
but she was worried enough to think we should put her in foster care until we found out for sure
for all her good intentions sister abigail was not a trained psychologist
shehad certain suspicions about esther and they turned out to be wrong
why is cant you accept that
a beat thin ts what if somebody else thought there was something wrong with her
like the director of the orphanage in russia
esther stops painting and listens suddenly apprehensive
if its a dead end ill drop it
but if they say the same thine then wed have to get
a second opinion
he doesnt want to be unreasonable
see what you can find out
she angrily throws her painting across the room
kate and johns bathroom morning john is shaving with his shirt off
he sees esther in the reflection slyly watching him
she smiles at him
will you take me to school today
youll have to get ready early i
kate is on the
she has pen and paper ready to take notes
hi this is kate coleman
wondering if youd heard from anyone at the sludianka orphans shelter in russia
sister abigail said that
oh you did
listens troubled what do you mean
well i dont understand
how could they not have any record of her being there
call me the moment you hear anything
she hangs up disturbed
esther rides next to him
she sniffles and he realizes that shes holding back tears
whats the matter
i dont want to go to school
i hate it
nobody likes me there
nobody ever likes me
she stares forlornly out the window
big sad eyes
you want to play hooky
off her look i can call in sick and well go to the zoo
what do you think
esther smiles through her tears
id like that very much
me tary school r morning kate drives up the steep hil in front of daniel and esthers school and stops at the end of a longline of parents dropping kids
gets out without looking at kate
daniel wait a minute
he hangs back
rate gives him and max a concerned
how are you guys getting along with esther
an apprehensive look passes between him and max
fine i guess
does she ever make you guys feel uncomfortable or do things you know shes not supposed to
has she ever hurt either of you
daniel wants to say something but the frightened look on maxs face stops him
rate realizes shes struck
you can tell me anything
i gotta gu
before kate can stop him he closes the car door and runs off
john and esther walk by the lion exhibit
she takes johns hand and presses it to her cheek
you dont know how long ive waited for a daddy just
and a monany too
she gives a sad shrug
i dont think
tommy likes me very much
john is taken aback
an awkward beat
thats not true
mc my loves you
its all right
i understand if she doesnt
it must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as your own
you are just as much a part of this family as danny
and max are
mommy doesnt loveyou any less because youre adopted
do you understand
she nods but doesnt look convinced
why dont you do something special for her
so she can see what a good girl you are
ill bet shed like that
esthers face brightens
thats a wonderful idea
i think i know just what im
going to do too
kate is loading the dishwasher
john is brig ing in dirty dishes from the dining room
esther enters all smiles
hands hidden behind her back
john gives kate an expectant smile
i have a special surprise for you mommy
kate eyes her warily
no idea what to expect
i picked this flower just for youl its kates memorial orchid
john is horrified
kate reaches for the flower
estherl put that down l esther laughs and playfully pulls it away
kate grabs her by the wrist and esther suddenly drops the flower shrieking in pain
youre hurting me
esther runs from the room cr her wri wrist e ying and startled clutching esther what the hell did you do to her
i just grabbed her arm
aohn hurries after esther
kate hangs back picks the orchid up from off the floor
on the nofa still crying
kate looks in on them
john shoots her an angry look
esther slips inside closes the door turns on a light
goes to the workbench
theres a vice bolted to it
she finds some rags and wraps them around her wrist where rate grabbed her
then she places her wrist in the vice puts the handle of a screwdriver between her teeth and bites down on it
she takes a couple of deep breaths and sta s clo in the yicg of her are
grimacing in agonyy screwdriver clan ed between her teeth against the pain she twists the vice tighter and tighter
rate sits at the table
john has calmed down but is still angry
she knew what it meant to me
she did it on purpose
it wasnt even her idea
off her look im the one who told her she should try to do something nice for you
its late the room is dark
esther plaintively calls out daddy
the door opens
blearily enters in his pajamas
what in it sweetheart
my arm huits
let me see
he turns on a bedside lamp and sits on the bed
she pulls up
hex sleeve cringing
heir wrist is mottled with horrific b i a camera flash pops
esther is in a hospital gown still wearing her black ribbons while a social worker photographs the bruises
rate and john sit across from a harried er doctor
an x ray of esthers arm is clipped to a light box
its a hairline fracture in her radius
i swear i barely touched her
youll need to talk to the social worker about that
shes going to come in here and ask you some questions
it was just an
were required by law to file
child protective services will be in touch to schedule a follow up visit at your home
kate is shocked
john shoots her a dirty look
home from the hospital
its very late
the kids are wearing coats over their pajamas
esthers arm is in a fiberglass cast
john is carrying max who has fallen asleep
as they start upstairs kate reaches out to john
he hangs back
daniel and esther go to their rooms
when theyre gone you know i would never hurt any of the
kids on purpose
its not what you do on purpose that scares me
kate watches him go
be turns away and takes max upstairs
kate site curled up on the window seat by the planter holding the wilting orchid and sobbing inconsolably old wounds re opened
john is asleep alone in the bed
the door is ajar
esther appears in the
she peers in watching him sleep
after a beat she gathers her courage and quietly enters tiptoeing toward the bed
she pulls back the covers and
climba in next to him
john doesnt stir
esther curls up beside him
rate sits in the parked van
no sound except raindrops tapping the roof
shes looking out at something
its the liquor store she drove by earlier
shes parked in front of it staring at it through the rain streaked windshield
kate puts two bottles of wine on the counter
the cashier rings them up
shes anxious guilty already hating herself
were having guests over for dinner
the cashier nods
like be gives a shit
kate lowers her eyes
the two wine bottles sit on the kitchen counter
one bottle is
open a glass already poured
but kates not drinking it
shes just standing these arms folded looking at it
the house is
shes alone here
only her demons to keep her company a long moment of
awful indecision passes kate paralyzed
then she looks up her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window
through it she can see the backyard
its the swimming pool that holds her eyes its cold surface rippling in the rain
but shes seeing something else there something awful
impossible to know what shes thinking but whatever it is it moves her to action
she abruptly grabs the glass and quickly empties it in the sink before she can change hex mind
then she grabs the
open wine bottle and pours it all down the drain
she runs the water and scrubs the sink with her fingertips removing every trace
tosses the empty bottle in the trash and ties up the garbage bag
kate hurries out in the rain and stuffs the kitchen trash in the garbage can burying it under another bag
kate re enters dripping wet
theres still the other wine bottle
the unopened one
in the walk in closet
she hides the wine bottle in a cubby in her shoe rack and turns out the light
driving the kids to school
kate looks drawn and weak
daniel and max stare off into space
esther holds a stack of her paintings in her lap obliviously prattling i cant wait for show and tell
i hope mrs
likes my paintings
i did one especially for her
kates blocking her out
esther doesnt mind
kate drives up the hill and pulls to the curb
daniel gets out butesther struggles her wrist cast making her clumsy and she awkwardly fumbles her paintings
they land in the gutter and start blowing away
she gives kate a horrible pleading look moumiy
kate eyes her accusingly
you dropped them on purpose
no i didnt
kate doesnt believe it for a second but sees a crossing guard and a few kids hurrying to grab the paintings as theyre carried off by the wind
kate shoots esther a dirty look then sets the parking brake with an exasperated sigh and gets out to help
acti but the second rate is out of the van esther springs tut like a snake thats been poised to strike
sh ci put s s then gear shit inneutral andggrabs the parki ng her an alarmed look
esther smiles at her

daniel sees esther jump out of the van just ag it starts roll ba hil frazzled kate turns to

kate frantically dashes across the street hysterical with fear and throws open the back door

kate scoops max into her arms clutching her to her chest
its okay baby

a crowd has out front horrified
watching breathlesslyguntilehe sees pull ui max lsafe y i the van
a wave of relief washes over him
then he whirls angrily looking for esther

rate sits across from john and dr
the mood fa grim i set the brake
bven if i hadntr the police said it wouldnt have
rolled unless it was put in neutral
but max says she didnt see esther do anything wrong
max is cover
ng for her
and x dont think its the first time
it also wouldnt be the first time that youve tried to blame esther for
something that was really your fault
isn t all in my head
sister abigail was right
there is something wrong with esther
and i dont care anymore if i cant prove it
iwant her out of this house
john and dr
browning exchange a dark look
so youre at a place where you would actually let somebody take her away
ill do whatever i have to do to protect my children
browning thats why shes here
something in his voice makes kate apprehensive
an uneasy beat
i have an opening held for you at a residential rehabilitation clinic about forty five miles from here
they specialize in extended treatment for women who are relapsed alcoholics
kate is stunned silent
she gapes at
with a mix of anger and fear unable to stop a flash of guilt
how much do they know
what are you talking
ill stand by you through this for as long as it takes
my moma already agreed
to help look after the kids
tell her not to bother
browning id like you to leave now
john stands and takes something from inside the sideboard
ile sets it on the coffee table between them
qtr s the wine bottl g she hid he closet
kate is stricken
she looks at it like it was a poisonous spider
the girls found it while they were playing in your
you mean esther found it
yes esther found it
does that make a difference
is she lying
kates silence is answer enough
i bought two bottles
i poured the other one down the sink
but not this onie
again no answer necessary
kate looks defeated tears welling
im not going to rehab
im not going to leave you alone with the kids again until you do
i havent had a drink in almost a year
john sighs frustrated
browning intervenes her voice infuriatingly even
relapse is very common in early sobriety
we can help you
but not until you drop the charade
its not a charade
i wanted to drink i t
you have no fucking idea how
badly i wanted to drink it
but i didnt
off johns look i know should have told you
i was just afraid of what youd do
i wanted you to come to me
thats why i didnt confront you with it last night
if max had gotten hurt this morning it
wouldve been because i trusted you tell me if there was a problem
what happened this morning had nothing to do with this
l f ow do you expect me to believe that
max and daniel are the only reason im still sober
i would never do anything that would hurt them
you dont think this behavior effects them
you know damn
well what im talking about
her voice is brittle now barely controlled
the tears sta rt to spill
when i look out at the pool and think
to john when i try to imagine what would have happened if you hadnt come home early that day
it makes me want to kill myself
i would the before i let something like that happen again
then why not throw both bottles away
becauso i need help
i thought i could handle it myself but i cant
ill go back to therapy
ill start going to a
thats not enough anymore
i told you last time what id do if thisever happened again
im trying to give you another chance
you havent heard
a word ive said
ive heard enough
if it was just the two of us that would be one thing
but i cant let you be in a position where you could hurt the kids
im not the one you need to be worried aboutt seven people close to esther have died in the past year
max was almost the eighth
now many more coincidences are you willing to ignore
kate stop it
youre talking about an eight year old girl
and right now shes making a lot more sense than you are
i know i havent given you any reason to believe me
but you have to
im begging you
maybe if youd been honest with me from the start
but not now
peer around the corner watching them argue
max is crying
you either check into rehab this week or i leave and i take the kids with me
esther leans close and whispers into maxs hearing aid ill kill her it you tell
max gives her a frightened look
just then doris
appears with a bowl of popcorn
she quickly ehoos the girls away
come on you two
lets go watch tv
max wipes her eyes
esther takes her hand and leads her away
john walks doris out to her car
he gives her a hug
you sure you dont mind
shes not going to appreciate your being around
i dont care what she appreciates
you cant leave those kids alone with her while youre at work all day
off his look youre doing the right thing
dont let her change your mind
ill see you tomorrow
doris gets in her car
john looks conflicted
esther can be heard humming through the closed bathroom door
daniel listens as he sneaks down the hall in his pajamas
maxs eyes are red from crying

esthers humming can be heard o
a tense beat

max starts crying
she signs but daniel doesnt understand
frustrated max starts hitting him
daniel grabs her arms stop it
shes going to kill us if we dont tell

daniel releases her
daniel stops short
max hesitates then gets up and shows him the pictures that she hid from him when he first came in
theyre crude crayon drawings of max and esther
in the first esther stands atop the rocket ship slide and pushes brenda down the stairs while max watches
the next one turns daniels blood cold
x s of sister abigails murder
esther stands over sister abigail with a bloody hammer wh e r e max cowers under the bridge
the last one is of esther and max in the treehouse
esther is covered in blood
what did she do in the treehouse
suddenly esthers o
daniel looks up alarmed
r shes coming
max quickly hides the
daniel scrambles to the door but pauses and signs to max as best he can
everythings going to be all right
daniel hurries back to his room and closes the door just as esther emerges from the bathroom
she pauses suspicious
kate and johns bedroom r night kate and john are in bed
they both appear to be sleeping
shes still wide awake
she looks over at john slowly push the covers back and inches out of bed so that he doesnt wake u es p
she quietly dresses
int tipstairs hallway night kate emerges from their bedroom with a small overnight bag and cree ps into the dark hallway careful not to make any noise
she stops by the
door of maxs bedroom and slowly opens it
kate slips inside closes the door and starts toward maxs bed
suddenly a desk light comes on
shes been sitting there in the dark
the light casts strange shadows on her face
going somewhere kate
kate startles and whirls to check on max
lots not wake her
what are you doing in here
i was afraid you might try to take daniel and max away
kate stands frozen frustrated andangry
go to your room
honestly were past that now arent we
t kate ium not going to let you hurt my children
m not the one who passedouutt drunk
and let i hear the first step is on
ffideannttially admitting that
you have a problem
a beat stricken who told you about that
esther holds up kates journal kate blanches
its in your journal
i found i it a few weeks ago
its very intimate
learned so much about you
your marital troubles your drinking problem
where you hide your wine bottles
you have lovely handwriting by the way
would you like to bear my favorite part
esther has a page marked
she reads eight weeks before my due date jessica died from several undiagnosed birth defects
i hadnt felt her move for days but now that i knew she was dead i started to feel her kick again
its called phantom fetal movement like the pain felt in a missing limb
i was an amputee and my baby was the lost part of me
because of other complications doctor kosgrove didnt want to induce
so i had to wait to go into labor
for sixteen days i carried jessicas body and felt her ghostnow a kicking in my belly
y womb coffin and inside me slept a corpse
to kate how perfectly hideous
no wonder you turned into a nasty smelly drunk
kate is dumbfounded trembling with impotent rage and raw emotion
you dont know how lucky you are ill never have children of my own
my father paw to that while i was still in diapers
actually dont remember a time when he wasnt fucking
off kates look i dont want your pity
he did it to make me strong
so wouldnt turn out weak and pathetic like you
imi pot weak
losing your baby could have
made you stronger
but for you its alwa s
more therapy and more pills and more booze
anything so that you don
t have to actually face the so state of your miserable existence
and why should you
youve got john to carry your dead weight around
but you know something
you dont deserve him
and sooner or later hes going to figure that out
esther stands up to leave
kate blocks her path
what are you going to do
looks really tempted
she puts out her hand for the journal
esther gives it to her with a smile
kate steps aside

kate glares after her
kate is on the phone angry trying to keep her voice low i need to know where she came from and i need to know now
sister judith talks
to rate on the phone looking harried

smoke pours from the treehouse
esther has climbed down and is watching it burn
inside daniel is surrounded by flam es choking on black smoke
he stumbles to a window and sticks his head out
the fire closes in
the place is going up like a tinderbox
he carefully climbs out the window and stands on the sill fifteen feet off the ground
he hugs the side of the treehouse panicked
the flames grow higher licking at his feet
no place to go now but up
he reaches for the edge of the roof and struggles to pull himself onto it his legs kicking out over empty space
he gets an elbow on the sloped roof and starts wriggling up onto it
suddenly he sue
he glide dawn arel grabbing the q t h e with his fin e s aj the last seco esther gasps excited like shes the front row of a great
kates still on the phone
she glances out window backyard and the woods beyond

realization and horror slam home at the same time
daniel fights desperately to hang on
bother watches eyes wide with exhilaration
for alone breathless beat i i ajustt
i gs a there dangling helplessly fingers slipping y

he lands hard and doesnt move
esther walks over and crouches next to him
she touches his neck for a pulse

esther pouts disappointed
she looks around finds a hea vy rock
she lifts it over her head ready to cave
in daniels skull
sudde l y max rus e innc ushe gsai ao knck from her hands
esther whirls on max eye s flashing i rage

kate catches esther watching her warily
kate glares at her with pure hate
firefigiiters have arrived to put out the treehouse
neighbors gather to gawk

a pointed glance between kate and john
rajan doesnt notice
theres no way of knowing for sure what hell remember until he wakes up
esther shifts nervously
not the answer she was hoping for
rate has taken john aside voices low out of earshot of the others
shes shown him two pieces of paper one isa pa inting esther did of the old gothic mansion
the other in a printout of the photo from the saarne institutes web site
she told me she just made it up but its
a real place
there has to be some other explanation
she didnt come from an insane asylum
how do we know
the orphanage we thought she came from has never even heard of her everything
about her could be a lie
we have her passport her birth certificate her school and medical
records its just paper johni from halfway around the world
this isnt last me being paranoid
saint cabrinis yourself
if you dont believe me
john looks like hes wavering
your own mother was there this time
only esther or daniel could have started that fire
i know who i think did it
i dont know what to think anymore
well im done connecting the dots for you
you can believe what you want about me
blame me for everything

esther goes too
esther watches kate and john
she cant hear whattheyre saying
she looks worried
she turns to doris
can i have a dollar for the pop machine
doris gives her a dollar
esther smiles and heads toward the vending machines
max watches her go
but as soon as esthers out of sight her cheery face turns to graiii
she puts the dollar in her pocket and sneaks away
back at home the phone rings
the answering machine picks up
a man with an estonian accent dr
varava leaves a message im
calling for katherine coleman
this is doctor v
rava from the saarne institute in tallinn
please cill me immediately
esther peers through a door
and sees daniel lying unconscious with a rigid a traction both his arms by wires heart rate monitor beeps esther approaches his bed like the angel of deaths slowly drawing
the curtain around them
the heart rate monitor is clipped to his finger
it onto her own finger
the machine continues to beep registering her heartbeat instead of his
slowly she climbs up onto the bed prowling like a cat
she carefully straddles him and takes a pillow from under his head
the movement causes him to stir
his eyelids flutter
at the last moment he sees her looming over him
then s ash s the ii down ova hin face
he al daniel struggles
but he can barely move traction wires jangling as he thrashes helplessly
his screams are muffled under the pillow
esther viciously presses down with all her strength
max sits next to doris staring at
the hallway that leads tor the vending area waiting she get s s p
walk toward iit re d aounting
i looks worried
t u and s d a maxine where are you going
max turns the corner
the vending area is empty
maxs eyes go wide with fear
daniel has stopped struggling
when esther finally lifts the pillow his eyes are them a and slid s the pillow d u is headr gently closes e nderneath h then she climbs down from
the bed and slips the heart rate monitor back on his finger
an alarm sounds
max runs up to kate and john
she urgently yanks kates arm
what is it sweetie
suddenly a call comes on the overhead speakers code ninety nine icu
code ninety nine icu
rajan runs by at top speed
kate gasps panicked
daniell she and john run after dr
doris quickly grabs max to keep her from following
lcd night kate and john follow dr
to the room where a code team races to resuscitate daniel
kate and john try to enter the room but the icu nurse stops them
you have to stay out here
they catch a glimpse of dr
rajan picking up defibrillator paddles before the door is slanhei in their terrified faces
hospital icu night timectt rate and john sit outside waiting
his face tells
rates crying before he even says a word
his injuries were more severe than we first thought
john chokes back tears
he holds kate close as she sobs
oh my baby

a terrible loss were so sorry
kate gets up and rushes into daniels room in time to see the icu nurse cover his body with a sheet
kate collapses to the floor weak with horror and grief
john tries to comfort her
then slowly kates eyes turn steely and her grief burns into rage
john away and stands up
where is she
kate storms in and looks around her face a mask of fury
john hurries after her
she spots esther
returning from ding machines innocently sipping a
e c h t e ven what did you do
doris and max are taken aback
kate looks insane
toward esther gaining momentum with every step but esther just looks up at her with a half hidden smile on her fa ce
what did you do to him you bitch
them he slaps se ther as ha as she
cmn h t e face sending her reeling to it fioot everyone is horrified
rate looks ready to hit her again but a nurse holds her back
esther touches her mouth

john scoops her into his arms kate is apoplectic
it takes two orderlies to hold her
max watches crying
she killed him
he was going to live and she killed him
she was out here the whole time
rajan rushes in readying a syringe
get away from me l i
hold her still
a small crowd has gathered watching with horror and pity as the orderlies overpower her
rajan grabs kates arm quickly hunts for a vein then jabs the needle in
pleaeet somebody listen to me
babyi she killed my baby
but her eyelids are already
john watches nearly overwhelmed with emotion
kate goes limp in the orderlies arms
kate lies in a bed barely conscious
pushes a sedative into an iv tube taped to kates arm
rate looks up groggily
and sees john talking to dr
we can keep her sedated overnight
he waits for dr
rajan and the nurse to leave then walks over and looks down at kate
shes fighting to stay awake
moms driving us home
i think its better if you stay here tonight
i dont want you around the kids like this
kate weakly grasps his hand her voice a thready whisper john
please dont let her take my family
a long emotional beat
john hesitates conflicted
then he places her hand back on the bed and turns away
she tries to call out but doesnt have the strength
she sees the girls waiting in the hallway
max has been crying
she looks scared
john leads them all away
and the last thing kate sees before blacking out again is esthers devious smile
lightning flashes in the distance
theres a storm coming
john tucks max into bed
when he leans down to kiss her we see esther watching from the doorway
max eyes her warily
whats wrong sweetheart
shes thinking about daniel
to max arent you
max reluctantly nods
john gives her a sad look
esther enters and stands next to john at maxs bedside
as she kisses max good night esther fuitively redches out and grabs maxs hearing aid from off her
l f t
esthers bedroom night esther stands at her closet looking through her pretty dresses leasantly
sung to herself
she holds one up to her chin looks at herself in the mirror
she chooses a ruffly dress and lays it out on her bed
shersands ov er it with a a pair of scissors in her h a nd e y eing it app g y
after a thoughtful beat she starts cutting its rufflesoff
esthers humming can be heard o
john trudges downstairs
exhausted and emotionally devastated
he goes into the living room slumps in a chair buries his face in his hands and cries
camera pulls back revealing the unnoticed answering machine in f
the light on it is blinking
one new message
walks down the hall i ray with her dress draped over h er army stillhum ming
goes into the bathroom and c oses doo esthers humming continues no other sound here atall
rate comes to fighting her drug induced stupor
she forces herself to sit up and gingerly pulls the iv needle out of her arm
esthers humk ng
continues still no sound
kate stands in rthede
the bed daniel was lying in is already empty and as if he was never here
rain streaks down the window
cate enters and sits down heavily next to the bed
she touches the place where her son lay dead only bourn before
she brehks down and sobs inconsolably but we cant hear it only the summing of esthers lighthearted melodic tune
back to normal sound
john sits on the sofa eyes red anti teary watching a videotape of daniel plairig soccer
theres a noise from the kitchen
be pauses the video listens
a moment later oftkusic starts vlayin q
an old crackly recording from the forties of the ink spots singing im making believe
sentimental bittersweet and a little creepy
baffled john goes to the kitchen
and stops short at what he sees
esther stands on a chair cutting slices of cheese with a large knife
shes prepared a plate of fruit cheese and crackers
shes wearing the dress we saw her choose but with some alterations
the ruffles are gone so are the sleeves
its low cut and too grown up
her hair is perfectly curled and her face is caked with makeup powder red lipstick thick mascara dark eyeliner giving her a grotesque woman child eight year old beauty queen
jonbenet ramsey by way of angelina jolie
john is stupefied
she szailes at him
outside thunder rumbles
what are you doing
making you a snack
you skipped your dinner
get down from there
that knifes too sharp for you to be playing with
esther climbs down from the chair and nonchalantly carries the cheese and cracker plate to the dining room as if he hadnt said anything
john follows her dumbfounded
there are two glasses and a bottle of sparkling water on the dining room table
dim lighting and romantic music
john is completely nonplussed
esther sets the cheese plate on the table
what is this
i wanted to do something special for you
i dont like my daddy to be unhappy
but why are you dressed like that
dont you like it
no i dont
youre not supposed to play with mommys makeup

esther is touched
she gazes up at
you really mean that dont you
why dont you go wash your face and well tuck you back into bed
but worked so hard
cant we stay up just a little longer
she gives him the big sad eyes
theyre a little disconcerting under all the makeup
well have a little snack and then off to bed
john sits down reluctantly humoring her
esther starts pouring sparkling water into the glasses
should be drinking that bottle of wine but i couldnt find it
little girls arent allowed to drink wine
im not so little
she raises a glass in toast
john gives her a sad look but goes along with it
they clink their
glasses together and drink
instead of sitting down esther continues to stand next to him
she picks up a piece of cheese and tries to feed it to him
john eyes her uneasily
be takes the cheese from her
and eats it
why dont you sit down
i like being close to you
she gazes into his eyes and
touches his face
john moves her hand away suddenly very uncomfortable
she hesitates nervous
then eans saes qn h
john grabs her arms and abruptly pushes
her away xn shock and near panic
dont ever do that again
thought you loved me

its different than how i love mommy

she reaches out to touch his face again but he grabs her hand
esther stop it

john gapes with disgust and horror
he looks like he might vomit
god ouoin a beat
esther looks heartbroken
suddenly she tries to kiss him again desperate this time throwing herself at him pushes her to the floor
she frantically crawls back to him
be hurries to the other side of the table
jesus christ lust stop talking
go upstairs and wipe that shit off your facel right nowt esther runs upstairst crying
john just gapes in utter disma and revulsion
he runs into the kitchen and throws up in the sink
esther situ at her little vanity table looking at her overly made up face in the mirror and sobs hysterically
kate is still sitting at daniels empty
bed eyes red and puffy from crying
outside its raining harder
her cell phone chimes
she eyes it wearily considers not answering
after a few rings she picks up
is this katherine coleman
doctor varava is a craggy faced an inhis s
his manner is urgent almost desperate
as he speaks on the phone

were intercuttinq now with esther at her vanity her crying building to a maniacal wail her makeup streaking
from her tears
her real name is veera klammer she escaped from here eighteen months ago and shes thirty two years old
esther screams slowly scratching her face with her fingernails
kates mind is reeling
this cant be
there has to be a mistake
does she have the scars
has stopped crying her sorrow burning into blind monstrous rage
she glares at her reflection her mascara smeared down her cheeks
wehad to keep het
in a restraint jacket when she was here to stop her from hurting our staff but she was constantly fighting against it until the collar and cuffs began deep into
she wound up p scars from it
around her wrists and neck esther black from her wrists and neck revealing althe ly r scars over sew oh my god
ow could this have happened
h shes been passing herself off as a child for most of her life
she worked as a prostitute for years catering to wealthy pedophiles
curls her upper lip looking at her top teeth
she reaches up pulls on her teeth and ra click
y come out she even had a dental
appliancemade to complete the illusion by disguising her adult teeth
re r gerfect earl white aaby beth e d rn at a f e s t of crgmp eoia ftx
vtava when she was finally arrested she continued the pretense to stay out of jail and was sent to an orphanage
youre not the first to have been fooled
shes even been adopted before
a family here in estonia took her in
and lived with her fog over six
they never suspected
eat almost afraid to ask but why was ahe at your hospital
veera is dangerously insane
she was molested by her father and sexualized at a very early age
took another lover he told veera it was because she could heverbe a real woman
veera murdered them both
just stares at herself in the mirror
with her scars revealed her face scratched her mascara streaked down to her chin and her awful yellow snaggletoothed sneer she looks like a monster
she now sees herself as trapped in the body of a
child and it disgusts her
she wants to
be what her father considered to be a real woman
she t wants o be a wife a mother a lover
she wants to grow up
suddenly she grabs her chair and smashes the mirror with it
then she whirls and swings the chair into her aquarium with a feral scream crash
water and fish flood onto the floor
when she was adopted here in estonia she tried to find love where she had found as a child
with her new lather
when he refused her she bordered the entire family in their sleep
and then she burned the house down
how did you know
off kates horrified look
john pushes the door open and looks inside
are you all right
shes not here
the light is on but the room is empty
fish are still flapping around on the floor mouths
john gives the broken aquarium an unnerved look
esther where are you
he turns off the light about to look elsewhere
with the overhead light off the room is lit only by the black light in either s broken aquar i u m t uvali ma esther s p a n
i tin ha a chap n s s painted t that they ook f een vri d er black h john takes a closer look turning the black light on and o ff
unde gal lights the painting he saw when he first met esther a mother lion and her sleeping cubs
inds black limos the cube are now dead and the mothers mouth
s dripping with blood
the paintings that looked like typical family portraits in normal light are now nightmarish visions of death and violence
in one kates eyes have been gouged out
in another daniels throat has been slashed
in the picture of the whole family john and esther look normal but kate daniel and max are all decomposed corpses
john staggers back in shock
the telephone rings startling him
the answering machine picks up
he hears kate
are you there
kate is on her cell
running to the car
john for gods sake pick up the fucking phone
john turns to leave suddenly th r bursts out mom undo her pile of stuffed animals with s ild sc sj g a n he hei sei lf at john
if rom the bed labs her scissors into his eve
john screams and throws herto the floor
be stumbles out of the room blood streaming down his face
john staggers to the stairs the handle of the scissors jutting from his eye socket
but just as he hits
the first step baer rushes out and pushes tine cmm the etz rs
john goes flying head over heels crashing into the railing hard enough to splinter it and lands hard at the foot of the stairs
be lies there in a heap too stunned
esther appears at the top of the stairs
looking down at him
has a ju p rope in her hands and starts slowly walkinq toward him softly singing when i was juuust a lifitle g
iirl i askedmy mother what

leg is broke john tries to stand but cries out in agony
big he looks up sees the table with the phone on it
as he painfully crawls toward it esther closes in on him singing and winding the jump rope around her fists like a garotte
que sera sera whatever will be will be
the futures not ours to see
john reaches for the phone actually touches it when esther straddles him from nd the iump rope around his neck and starts strangling with it
falls out of reach
john itoo dazed from the fall to fight
when i grew uuup and feeell in looove i asked my sweetheart what lies ahead will we have rainbows day after day heres what my sweetheart said
john chokes t clawing at the rope as she twists it tighter aid tighter
finally his head droops his remaining eye goes blank
esther gently lowers has body to the floor a tear running down her cheek
she kisses him
whispers in his ear qua sera sera
suddenly a gasp from upstairs
i s n ax
she stands atop the
stairs paralyzed with fear
shes seen everything
esther looks u at her with a reassuring smile on her awful mascara streaked blood splattered monster face
