minority report aug th rewrite by jon cohen aug th rewrite by jon cohen and then slowly emerging from the mists of darkness a pale beautifully proportioned face
the oval face is female a woman of indeterminate age her features as fragile as porcelain
her eyes are closed in sleep or in death
or in something in between
now two more faces emerge out of the darkness
they are male and they float into position on either side of the female
they are just as ethereally beautiful just as pale and like the female their eyes are closed
the ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch
her features which have been expressionless suddenly contort mask like into the face of a woman in fear
her eyes open
the male face on her right contorts too
his features warp into an angry snarl the mask of a man enraged
his eyes open
the male face on her left takes on the expression of a young boy a boy who is terribly frightened
his eyes open wide
as if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream a sudden and unnerving exchange begins
frightened woman mocking man johnny please
youre scaring me
childs voice considering i dont like you any more carol
imploring put the scissors down
youre scaring me please
dont grab at me
all we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us a man with scissors lunging at his wife
her anguished scream the whimpering cries of their son
and then there is silence and it is over and the three faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state
their eyes slowly close
they do not move
so that when they do move again it is startling
in abrupt unison the eyes flash open
three pairs of eyes stare straight at us accusing
three mouths open but speak in rasping tones as one
the faces linger a moment the weary eyes slowly close and the dark reaches forth and takes them
morning in america
just look at it
america in the midfifties the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into the sun drenched distance
white house upon white house
emerald lawns glistening with dew
in each driveway a big chevy or a ford muscled with chrome long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships
kids burst out of the houses and zoom down sidewalks on trikes
mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways watching
the smiling mothers wave to one another then go back into their houses
dogs bark birds sing in trees of just the right height boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes
it is a delicious world where dogs and birds and children are safe
a family room with all the trappings of the era a flagstone fireplace a console tv a mans leatherette barca lounger a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby
table boxes of childrens games neatly stacked on a wall shelf
a young mother carol her hair in a pony tail stands at a picture window in a corner of the family room staring mildly at the scene outside
a little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk
the ball gets away from her and rolls into the street
at the same moment a two toned chevy lush and huge rounds the corner
the girl sees the car coming but still goes after the ball
carol sees what is about to happen but she doesnt cry out or bang on the window or run for the front door
and smiles a little
the girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street
the driver a man in a loose fitting dark green suit white shirt thin brown tie sits behind the steering wheel of the car
disturbingly the mans hands are not on the steering wheel
not only that he is holding the morning newspaper up in front of him reading oblivious to the scene before him
through the windshield we see the little girl in the road in front of him going for her ball
carol watches her smile in place
the little girl picks up her red ball as the chevy bears down on her
an alarm suddenly chirps
the car automatically brakes to a halt
the man looks around the edge of his paper to see what is happening
the car has stopped inches from the girl
the girl giggles as the man in the car gives her a big wink
she waves then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball
the man goes back to his newspaper and the car entirely on its own starts up again
the car rounds a corner and disappears
carol turns away from the window
she startles when she sees her husband johnny is there behind her
he is in his pajamas
how long has he been there watching her
gruff whyd you let me sleep so long
its saturday johnny you always beat why are you staring at me like that
he takes a step toward her
he stands there his thick black hair tousled with sleep scratching his stubbled jaw considering her
im unhappy that you let me sleep so long
he takes another step toward her
she doesnt move a muscle
a little boy suddenly enters the room
johnny turns looks at his son looks back over his shoulder at his wife
then without a word he begins to walk out of the room
on his way out johnnys eyes flick to carols sewing basket which sits beside a sewing machine
it is not the sewing that has caught his attention but a large pair of garment scissors which lie across a fold of colored cloth
johnny stands on the front porch scratching
he walks down his front walk and bends over to pick up the newspaper
carol stands in the doorway watching him
a shadow slides over johnny cast from above
the air fills with the piercing whine of an engine
johnny looks up alarmed
in the sky above him just beyond the tips of the suburban trees is a black precrime police hovercraft
the children the mothers carol in the doorway everyone freezes in place as johnny is cast into an inexplicable drama
racing soundlessly down the street toward him are sleek technological marvels lethal and efficient looking they seem to be cars but they are so different from the fat fords and
chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to process them
helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars
more police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses
their uniforms are black seem actually to absorb light
their left hands are bare their right hands are encased in some sort of complicated glove
the glove is a weapon of some kind the elongated index finger ending in an open barrel
clearly this is not as it first seemed the past not america in the s
it is the neo past the retro world of america where the familiar of yesterday is intermeshed with hypertechnology
and all of that hypertechnology is focused on johnny as he makes a run for the house sheets of newspaper scattering behind him
he bursts up the front porch shoving carol out of the way
eight precrime police officers assemble in the yard
from a backpack one of them quickly removes an instrument with a handle grip and an ovoid screen
it is a holographic scanner
he activates it scans the officer in front of him and an identical police officer takes three dimensional form
the two real officers circle the house repeating the maneuver a dozen times
in less than a minute a decoy force of men three dimensional standing in place but shifting and turning like living beings has been created
an overwhelming police deterrent presence has been established
the precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house too
it is impossible to tell which officers are real and which are scanned holographs
the juxtaposition of the futuristic cops in a s style house is disorienting
johnny in his pajamas crouches beneath a rack full of his wifes dresses
two officers standing back to back hold their gloved hands out in front of them palm out
when the first officer points his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway his glove beeps softly
the officer looks at his palm
a red thermal image appears on a small flexible screen the heat outline of a crouching man
the first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second officer
the room is packed with police how many are real
johnny squirms his pajamas saturated with sweat
he calls out through the door
i didnt do anything
every officer in the room lifts his gloved hand and points his index barrel at the closet door
the effect is deeply accusatory
an officer speaks his voice electronically manipulated to be as menacing as possible
come out of the closet on your hands and knees
two officers aim their barrels at the perimeter of the door
in repeated small sonic blasts the closet door is blown off of its frame revealing johnny among the dresses
johnny starts to rise and bam a section of floorboards is blasted away beneath his feet
hands and knees
johnny trips among the splintered floorboards and drops
he stays on his hands and knees and approaches
he lifts his head and looks up at the officer
another officer bends down with a device the words identiscan on its side and blips a red laser light into each of johnnys eyes reading his irises
the officer nods affirmatively to the other officer
to johnny john palmer if you were being arrested for any other crime i would now read you your rights
beat but you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife carol palmer
you have no rights
johnny on his hands and knees goes limp
in the background johnny is guided into a precrime police vehicle as the neighbors look on
carol and her son stand in the doorway stunned
two officers remove their helmets
the first man is tall sandy haired good eyes deeply blue this is paul anderson late thirties director of the precrime division washington the second man is ed witwer andersons
second in command late thirties big like anderson good face strong in the shoulders short brown hair
the two men are deeply comfortable together
they can speak or not
it doesnt matter they still communicate
two good cops good together
they walk side by side around the house dematerializing the holographic decoy cops
thought we might a had a runner
anderson seems tired takes a moment to answer
yeah a runner
a little chase thatd been good
fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them
smiles but only eight of us were real
witwer dematerializes the last decoy
we ever get a runner id be too old to give chase
youd love it
they get to the front of the house and watch the precrime vehicle holding johnny zoom soundlessly away
i love it more johnny boy doesnt get to murder his wife
beat its a beautiful world
the children play on their trikes
the wives talk among themselves
the birds sing the dogs bark
the little girl bounces her red ball again
she stops a
minute when two pieces of newspaper blow past her unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape
decorated in a s style
anderson lies in bed beside his wife lisa a pretty green eyed brunette
it is early morning they are both awake
her hand caresses his chest
maybe they will make love
lisas hand stops suddenly on the center of andersons chest
your hearts hammering
playfully i excite you that much
he turns to her and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile vanish
i used to love being a cop
youre still a cop
im a factory worker
we dont catch murderers
we process them
lisa takes a long breath
shes been down this road before
she speaks reassuringly
youre the best homicide cop in the country
anderson snorts disdainfully
great except theres no such thing as homicide
what i do best doesnt exist anymore
beat youre the director of a perfect system
a cop with a perfect record the precogs have a perfect record
they identify the accused i just put on my monkey suit and go round them up
lisa hugs him kisses the back of his neck
and then prosecute them
and they go to jail
and lives are saved
thousands of lives
beat and thats a cops dream
anderson is silent for a time
he sighs then smiles and turns to his wife takes her in his arms
youre a cops dream
anderson steps out of the shower and begins to towel himself dry he glances out a casement window
he tilts his head curious then wipes at the steam on the window
lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown talking on a cell phone
she hangs up moves quickly back into the house
cocks his head then goes back to toweling off
checkered linoleum floor
appliances out of the s
except there are little differences
when lisa puts a skillet of eggs on the stove the heating element is not an electric coil or gas but a shimmering field of light
lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket
anderson wears a gray suit thin blue tie white shirt wingtipped shoes
he doesnt look up from the newspaper as he speaks
lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs
she touches her long brown hair
i called about my hair
getting it done this afternoon
anderson looks like hes about to say something else when suddenly someone raps on the back screen door
anderson and lisa both turn and smile
come on in neighbor
want some coffee
frank dignazio white haired robust hesitates before coming in
a thin metallic arm with a red laser light arches quickly down from above the doorway shines into each of his eyes scanning the irises
the arm lifts out of view the screen door unlatches
frank enters the kitchen carrying a basket of tomatoes
brought these for your supper
thats so sweet
i gotta get rid of these things
one plant and im invaded by tomatoes
when i was a kid
anderson laughs claps his friend and neighbor on the back teases him
before all this genetically engineered crap
frank gives him an ornery look then a smile
yeah well its true
it used to be a challenge to grow things
now you put one plant in the ground then jump the hell out of the way
anderson gestures for frank to sit down
you guys are rushing off to work anyway
lisa sets the eggs down in front of anderson
you and ellie come for supper then
frank nods and pushes on the screen door
well bring some more tomatoes a new batch will have grown by then
they all laugh frank exits anderson goes back to his paper
anderson waves to lisa
her big studebaker drives off down the tree lined street and away
anderson approaches his chevy
he doesnt take out a key to unlock it
there is no lock
he slides in behind the wheel
doesnt take out a key for the ignition there is no ignition
a thin metallic arm arches down from the sun visor scans andersons eyes identifying him
a seat harness wraps around him and the car starts
anderson picks up a folder marked precrime and begins to read through the papers
the chevy backs out of the driveway and takes him to work
a vast spread of corporate and government buildings the spillover from washington d
across the potomac river into virginia
beyond the white of washington is the sprawl the massive unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts of the capitol
it is impenetrable and uninviting especially to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs
andersons chevy moves in a sea of fifties type cars
occasionally an ultramodern vehicle zips past them
in the sky above is another sea of advertising dirigibles holographic billboards hovercrafts skim jet transports
on one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to flash i like mike
then a picture of the smiling president appears
then the words re elect president mike billings for another four through his windshield anderson glances at a holographic road sign
the road sign reads fbi headquarters mile
precrime headquarters miles
anderson goes back to his papers
anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair
he abruptly rises and begins to pace
the room is large but he paces like a lion confined in a cage
he punches an intercom
a female voice responds
yes director anderson
wheres ennis page
why hasnt he delivered this mornings precog discs
ed witwer opens the door to the office
and casually walks in
ill find him sir
ed shakes his head smiles
bullying the staff again director anderson
anderson turns away and stares out a large window
witwer joins him
was that fun for you yesterday
the johnny palmer bust
it was okay
we got our man
anderson takes a long breath
when do we not get our man
they turn as ennis page a thin tight little man with burr cut hair knocks and enters the room
he carries a black briefcase marked zone washington alexandria va
the case is cuffed to his wrist
sorry im late sir
precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning four for our zone
put the case on my desk ennis
page hesitates doesnt do it
anderson moves quickly to page
what was i thinking
anderson leans over the briefcase
a small panel recedes a red laser scanner clicks on scans andersons eyes beeps affirmatively then clicks off
the cuff on pages wrist falls open
now page puts the case on andersons desk
anderson and witwer know just what hes going to do
page reaches down unable to resist straightening a pile of papers strewn on andersons desk
anderson and witwer exchange knowing smiles
when page looks up they try to cover but are not quick enough
he frowns tightly and heads for the door
anderson calls after him
witwer turns to leave too
now thats a guy who really cares
witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office
anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk and opens the briefcase
four small bright discs sit in rows
he removes one places it in a video monitor that lifts into view from the center of his desk
he sits back weary and watches
a young black woman stands in a hallway
she stares at a door gun in hand
she opens the door enters a bedroom
she glides toward a bed where a man lies sleeping
she lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form
anderson pops the disc jots down some notes pops in a new disc
a white woman stands at a stove cooking
a man comes up behind her slowly silently a necktie taut between his hands
he raises the necktie toward her neck hes not watching the screen
he is out of his chair now looking out the window
a tour of precrime is in progress like the public relations tours run by present day fbi
the tour guide a pretty smartly uniformed woman in her twenties leads a group of adults and children all with glowing nametags through the building
welcome to the main headquarters of precrime
smaller precrime branches are scattered throughout the united states
the group follows the guide slowly through the lobby
precrime was established in with the harnessing of the remarkable talents of the precognitive mutants
she points cheerfully to a stubby little man mr
harris can you tell me how many precogs there are
thats exactly right
a lot of people assume there are precogs in every branch office
but there are only three precogs right here in this building
and the information they give us we send out to all the other branches
beat and what is that information what do the precogs do
an eager boy timmy has the answer to that one
they protect us
the guide tousles his hair
chipper voice thats right timmy
because of the precogs youre going to grow up murderfree
isnt that something
they ever wrong
the precogs ever screw up when they predict a murder
the guide laughs tolerantly
its an infallible system
the precogs predict a homicide and our precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs
and right next door is the judicial center where we prosecute the future murderers
can we see the precogs
no im sorry
that part of the building is not open to the public
beat now if youll just step this way she waves the group on toward an elevator
the chamber is an elaborate hypertech hospital constructed for the maintenance of three beings the precogs
they are triplets two of the precogs are male one is female
technicians swarm all over them like worker bees
the bodies of the precogs are being tended to exercised cleansed groomed
the head of each precog is encased in a complex ornate helmet that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright metallics
the helmets pulse slightly and the surfaces seem to flow and shift like oil on water
a network of micro thin cables that are actually strands of light rise medusa like from each helmet then centralize into a single strand and connect to a massive mainframe
the precogs appear to be in suspended animation or in comas
they are absolutely still and limp except for their faces
their faces are in constant motion the lips mouthing scenes from murders only they can see
life for a precog is an endless cycle of death
we recognize her fragile and perfect face from the opening scene of the movie
she floats in a glowing nutritive bath
like her brothers she seems to be eternally young or eternally old
the technicians lift her from her bath
she is dried dressed in a robe then guided into an over sized throne like chair
her brothers are guided into their thrones on either side of her
not once are their helmets removed
what they feed into the mainframe is too valuable
it must be gathered twenty four unrelenting hours a day
ennis page sits in a room just off the precog chamber
he can see them through a large window
he works a large computer console the gathering point for the information the precogs constantly feed the computer
perhaps every ten seconds a small disc is released by the computer and mechanically gathered sorted and placed under pages watchful eye into a black case
anderson is in the room standing quietly behind page
as director anderson is authorized to come and go but from his fussy movements its obvious page sees anyone else in the room as an intruder in his special domain
anderson turns and looks through the window at the precogs
what would they think about if we unhooked them
page looks up from his work
they dont think sir
they just see
anderson is silent
theyre not even alive really
anderson contemplates the scene nods to pages words then turns and walks out of the room as page looks on
the female precog sits in her chair
her eyes are open
she faces the window that looks into pages main frame room
in the window we see anderson leaving the room
the female precogs eyes drift closed
a trial is in progress
the defendant is johnny palmer
he sits ashen at a table his defense attorney beside him
there are no jurors in the juror box
there is a judge and stern
there are a few people in the public seats
the precrime prosecuting attorney is lisa anderson
she wears a black robe and addresses the director of precrime anderson who sits in the witness stand
director anderson do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of carol palmer by her husband
it is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of times
anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the yes
this is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the precognitive mutants and recorded by the precrime division
this is the immutable evidence of the infallible system
the murder of carol palmer will occur in one week june th at in the morning
lisa steps back
the judge reaches out and anderson hands him the disc
the judge inserts it into a special video machine on his desk
anderson steps down his ritual part in this trial completed
a huge monitor comes to life behind the judge
he does not turn around to watch he has his own monitor
johnny palmer watches eyes wide
we now see in detail what we previously heard the precogs act out in the beginning of the movie
the palmers family room
johnny reaches into carols sewing basket for the scissors
carol stands defenseless in front of him
their son cowers in a corner of the room
johnny please johnny please
youre scaring me
johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace
considering i dont like you any more carol
imploring put the scissors down
youre scaring me
we cut away from the monitor and stay on johnny palmers face as he sits at the defense table
he winces at each terrible exchange
dont grab at me
johnny palmer cries out as the monitor goes blank
i didnt do it
it didnt happen
the judge hits his gavel
how does the defense plead
the defense attorney glances at his watch then quickly rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual
the defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system
we are guilty
we throw ourselves at the mercy of the court
the precogs are wrong
the court guards are on him in an instant
they lead him out of the courtroom
anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and enters a disheveled room
the fifties interior is drab a formica table bad curtains a frayed lazy boy positioned in front of a tv
ed witwer is already on the scene
he stands a few feet from the body of a man gunshot wound to the head a handgun on the floor nearby
to anderson looks like the old days
anderson nods to his former partner
anderson leans over the body
that would be bad news for an infallible system
witwer is suddenly bored
we know it cant be a murder the precogs wouldve seen it
why do you insist on coming to these things
keeps the system honest
and besides i like to pretend im a cop
anderson turns to an officer
whos got the coroner
another officer steps forward with a large blue case
right here sir
the officer places the case beside the corpse and opens the latches
inside the case is a large metallic apparatus the coroner
it comes to auto life and begins to unfold itself it rises crab like and steps out of its case
except for his mouth the doctor doesnt move
his projected image stands beside the body his arms folded behind his back
he is the interface the way the humans communicate with the crab apparatus
hello director anderson
the coroner crab begins to walk the body which is face down on the floor
it moves slowly hesitating as it crawls the bodys back to insert various razor thin probes and core samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord
this a homicide doc
im presently analyzing neurohormones assistant director witwer
i have not concluded my examination
the crab engulfs the back of the head probes the wound
im detecting carbonization of skull fragments around the entry wound
witwer whispers to anderson
the guy put the gun to his own head
i have not determined that yet assistant director
you have good ears for a ghost doc
the coroner crab steps away from the body
please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position
two officers turn the body face up
the crab inches close to probe the face
disconcertingly it lifts the eyelids and examines the interior of the mouth so that for a moment the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive
then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs at last it comes to a standstill
the holographic doctor closes his eyes as if in thought
can you imagine if this was homicide
who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more
anderson gives him a hard look
know how dammit
you know how
beat but you know what im saying
the state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives
god bless the precogs
the doctor opens his eyes
this event is a negative homicide
a mortal wound was generated by a calibre bullet self delivered to the parietal portion of the skull on june th at pm
eastern standard time
this event is a positive suicide
the holographic doctor begins to shimmer then disappears back into the coroner crab
the crab crawls back into its case folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body and shuts down
witwer turns to anderson
its time to stop coming to these partner
anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a stretcher
anderson in black tie with lisa in a shimmering blue gown at his side moves through a huge room filled high level government officials and politicians
a little bit of me dies every time i come to one of these things
its only a party paul
id never have let them appoint me to precrime if id have known this was going to be part of it
youre exactly what precrime needed
an amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job
the public loves the precogs
but they give people the creeps too
youre something they understandp a regular cop running things
anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed banquet hall
lets invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue
burgers and beer think theyd come
a barrel chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair senator malcolm takes hold of andersons elbow from behind
id come mr
and id make all the other assholes come with me
lisa reddens anderson gives an embarrassed cough
the senator laughs and claps him on the back
nice job this morning
another negative homicide
the precogs never let us down
malcolm smoothly occupies lisa while the senator eases anderson in the opposite direction i have a dream paul
i know you do senator
hundreds of precogs
not just predicting murders but predicting all crimes
burglary arson assaults how about jaywalking
now theres a crime
the senator smiles through his teeth
i dont want a police state you know that
but we have an opportunity here and no sir we dont have that opportunity
there are only three precogs
theyre a lucky accident of nature
there are no more
beat we can make more
just give me your support
help me increase funding for the precog engineering project
precogs arent sheep or pigs
seeing into the future is a gift a nonreproducible event
there was only one mozart and there are only three precogs
the people want to be safe
they want that more than they want food or love
he gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers
look at us its and weve wrapped ourselves up in the s like a big security blanket
because we want to feel like they felt
senator a world filled with hundreds of precogs is not my idea of a safe place
the senator gives it one last shot
sure could use your help paul
i decline senator
icily dont think ill come to your barbecue after all
the senator moves off
anderson stands stiffly among the sea of black ties and exquisite fifties dresses
anderson walks through the lab with a tall pale man dr resfield the head scientist
it is not a place that warms andersons heart
biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting and examining protoplasmic tissue masses
other technicians peer through massive microscopes
still others use robotic arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded glass barriers
you dont get out here much
not my sort of place
resfield emits a dry little laugh
the head of precrime squeamish
when it comes to needles and scalpels yeah
i promise we wont use any on you
what do you use them on
beat on bits of this and that
anderson looks at him
the doctor pauses outside a thick door
an identiscan device quickly reads their eyes and the door opens with an electronic hiss
anderson looks around the lab
technicians lower mesh cylinders into some sort of chemical vat
another technician turns a dial and an electric charge courses through the roiling liquid
whats happening here
were in an interesting phase
whats in the cylinders
a fusion of sources
from the precogs deceased mother
from the precogs themselves
a fusion of
in lay terms we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth
the cylinders shudder as the voltage is increased
and then we add mutating variables
anderson stares into the roiling vat
resfield waits for more questions
but it is clear from andersons expression he has already learned enough
anderson sits in his office reviewing precog discs for premurders in the local washington area
we stay on him as he watches the monitor
he pops the disc jots down some notes slides in the next disc
andersons mouth slowly opens
he leans close to the monitor his face ashen
frank is on his hands and knees working his vegetable garden
he whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich soil
he sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate
he lifts his straw hat in greeting gives a smile
its what are you doing playing hooky
anderson tries to smile
but it wont come
he looks around the abundant garden
its great out here frank
you got the touch
frank straightens with a grimace
i got the arthritis is what i got
anderson reflexively looks up at a high whining sound from over head
frank follows his gaze
a precrime hovercraft glides into position overhead
frank stares then lowers his eyes to the ground
he takes a long sad breath
ah shit neighbor
beat goddamn precogs dont miss a beat do they
beat can we do this inside
ellies not home
andersons voice is full of pain
frank wanders the kitchen trying to focus on his situation
anderson has trouble meeting his friends eyes
through a window we can see black suited police officers with mirrored helmets swarming outside franks house
distracted i thought id buried it all
thirty five years all those minutes and days to bury it
beat but suddenly you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets my god it throws you
frank stops pacing
he stares at a kitchen drawer
hed served his time frank
i know its not fair
its way beyond not fair
at anderson bitterly
yells god damn the precogs
why couldnt they have been around to save my girl
softly now theyre catching me
frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun
i really shoot the bastard huh
next wednesday at noon
andersons cop eyes are all over the gun
its not in you frank to kill anybody
tell it to the precogs
its set in stone now right
frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter
almost inaudible i dont want to be a part of this world anymore
i know frank
frank gives anderson a look no friend you dont know then frank looks hard at the gun on the counter
tell me paul
do the precogs see everything
then they wont have seen this
frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own head
on andersons anguished face at the sound of the gun going off
anderson stands with his old partner witwer on franks front porch
behind them through an open door we see lisa comforting ellie dignazio in the living room
anderson is deeply shaken
witwer tries to talk him through it
we had to bring him in
anderson doesnt respond
he was a future murderer
angrily you blame him
the guy killed his daughter
witwer lets the implication of his words sink in
anderson turns and watches as they wheel franks draped body into the back of an ambulance
andersons bitterness erupts
i hate the precogs ed
i believe in them absolutely and i hate them absolutely
witwer listens to him
and that goddamn lab trying to grow more of them
put a precog in every home you know
so we can have more franks people shooting themselves over who knows what
witwer kneads andersons shoulder talks to him in soothing tones like youd calm an agitated horse
precrime did the job it was supposed to do
the two men can hear ellie sobbing inside the house
you know it
and you believe in it
its not easy
it beats us down
ellie in there no doubt she hates you right now
anderson turns to witwer
thats why i got into this business to be hated
anderson almost manages a small smile
witwer puts his arm around him
walks him away from the scene
they hated us when we were regular cops
now were precrime and they still hate us
its one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows about
their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness
anderson looks into his partners good open face
then they both look away their understanding of each other complete
anderson stares out the window at franks house illuminated by the moon
its a mournful sight
lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed
ennis page in the mainframe room just off the precog chamber picks up a black briefcase marked zone washington alexandria va
he approaches the door and his eyes are scanned
the door opens with a hiss
we follow page as he walks through doors and corridors until he reaches a long hallway leading to the directors office
andersons secretary angela looks up on pages approach
he walks around her desk
his eyes are scanned and the door to andersons office opens
anderson looks up wearily
anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor almost absently
as we have seen him do before he swivels his chair away from the monitor and stares at washington d
across the potomac
hovercrafts and transports skim through the sky above the washington monument
the camera stays on andersons back as the sound from the precog disc begins
he hears his own voice speaking in strained agitated tones
lets not do this ed
anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and horror at the monitor
shows anderson and witwer in a room a few feet apart pointing guns directly at each other
their eyes intense and panicked
who murders whom
eds eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red seconds tumble away
witwer lowers his gun
he stands unresisting before anderson
witwer sees his own death in andersons wild eyes has always seen it
anderson fires his weapon puts a bullet straight into witwers heart throwing him back against a wall
witwer slumps dying beneath the huge digital clock which reads anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank
his hand goes to his mouth
his body begins to shake
he hugs himself but he cant stop the shaking
the disc pops out of the side of the monitor
it is a small sound but it has anderson up and out of his chair as if it were a gunshot he reaches for the disc but cannot touch it
his legs suddenly weaken and he drops to one knee beside his desk like a man in need of prayer
there is a single thought that screams through his brain
it is an almost visible thing filling the room blackly
anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate
i kill you
beat oh god i kill you
as anderson pulls himself up and tries to reach again for the disc
in an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie the three faces of the precogs hover in the misty darkness
their closed eyes open in sudden unison
they speak as one
after a long moment the eyes close again and the precogs fade into the mists
anderson looks up sharply at the sound of a knock on his door
every normal sound seems grotesquely amplified the traffic outside his own breathing
his senses are on overload
the door begins to open
a stockinged leg is the first thing anderson sees
his secretary angela
she hesitates before fully entering the room anderson grabs at the incriminating disc
he sees his eyes reflected in its alloy surface
he pushes the disc deep into his pants pocket
somehow he finds his voice
she looks at him uncertain
then she places a small stack of papers on his desk
need you to sign these
and your eleven oclock starts in five minutes
beat budget coordination with the fbi
beat you okay sir
anderson runs his hand through his hair cant think fast enough
he sees her glance at the black precog disc case
he shuts it awkwardly and it auto locks
have page take this
angela steps back disturbed
but sir the procedure make procedure
long beat im not okay angela
my head and stomach
im going down to the clinic
or maybe just home
angela looks relieved at the explanation
he moves past her
his fingers fidget against the hidden disc in his pocket
ill speak to witwer put him in charge for the rest of the day
he hesitates at the door turns to look at his office and at his view of washington
then he is gone
anderson looks in the door of witwers empty office
he takes a step inside
witwers booming voice sounds from behind him startling him
breaking and entering
thatll get you five to ten hard
witwer immediately scans his old partners ashen face
anderson can hardly bear to meet his friends eyes
he reaches into his pocket as if to lift the disc into the light
if he could just do that show it to witwer
andersons hand comes out of his pocket empty
take over for me today
witwer makes a show of backing away
dont give it to me
you probably have that trans virus going around
a stomach thing
i hate stomach things
anderson almost smiles
witwer looks at him
anderson almost reaches out for him
run the place okay
right into the ground
beat go on home before i call infectious control and have them spray you down with something
anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway
witwer calls out
you want me to do the discs or hold them for you to review when you get back
cant let them back up
call you later
take it easy all right
witwer lifts his hand in farewell anderson fixes on that last image witwer waving goodbye
anderson sweating now leans against a thick cement pillar and pulls out a cell phone
he hits a button
lisa sits in a meeting
her phone chirps softly
she glances at the display then rises to take it
she goes to a corner of the room
listen to me
lisa presses her phone close to her ear
i can hardly hear you
weakens the signal so it cant be picked up
alarm moves across her face
but were on secure listen dammit
im going to murder ed
the precogs picked it up
on lisa can she have heard right
paul his crackling voice faintly comes through the phone
lisas phone goes dead
anderson looks down a long row of parked precrime ground transports
they are sleek and menacing the black shells lumpy with dangerous gadgetry
in the distance a police officer holding an armful of equipment opens the back of one of them
he looks up at andersons approach
he puts his equipment down and salutes
anderson nods moves close
whats your name officer
bob uh robert smythe
these the new python transports
the young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride is about to speak when anderson touches a palm sized nova stun gun to the base of his neck
sincerely sorry officer smythe
the officer buckles
anderson catches him rolls him gently into the back of the transport
then anderson quickly reaches into the transport and begins stuffing equipment into a duffel bag a helmet and black uniform the weapon glove a folded rifle a holographic scanner and
other equipment whose function we can only guess at
anderson looks up at a sound echoey footsteps
they approach then fade away
anderson places the officers hands and legs together then aims a nozzled cylinder at them
he shoots a spray of blue bindfoam chemical restraint sticking the man to the floor of the transport in an adhesive glob
then he leaves the scene running
anderson grips the wheel of his chevy driving down
the fact that he cant control his car that the steering wheel has no function his speed is predetermined and his direction is guided by satellite is maddening now
from inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his steering wheel
anderson slams it with his fist
through his windshield anderson sees a four year old boy in the drivers seat of a passing red and black ford
his mother sits in the passengers seat blithely reading
the boy mimics anderson gleefully slams his steering wheel too then laughs
anderson turns and looks the other way into the distance at the sprawl the vast unzoned city attached to washington d
you can see it in his face a man could lose himself in there
anderson stands on an embankment
he holds the precog disc in his hand ready to throw it into the river
he stands like that
and then slowly lets his hand drop
he doesnt do it
lisa enters the house in a rush
every shade is drawn
paul anderson sits in an overstuffed chair absolutely motionless like a man who has died suddenly
lisa doesnt get it
she continues toward him
moving heats you up makes it easier for them to pick you up on their thermals
she looks at him scared stops in her tracks
she is suddenly suffocating
its a hundred degrees in here
i turned the furnace all the way up
your hair dryer
if they come itll buy me twenty seconds
nobodys coming for you
anderson stares at her
on the phone what you said
she shakes her head in disbelief
anderson speaks choking on the words
im going to kill ed witwer
its not true
andersons right hand hangs over the side of his armchair
we see the bright disc cupped in the palm
he seems about to reveal it to her but doesnt yet
he keeps staring at her intently
something is holding him back
youve been unhappy
theres a lot of pressure on you
and then frank
one week from today
tuesday june at five twenty in the morning
shoot him lisa
beat you need to take time off
anderson laughs harshly
you dont have to worry about that
she steps toward him
gently i want to hold you
if you love me stand there
and dont move
tears well in her eyes
i saw the disc lisa
i shoot him
in the chest
and he dies
ive watched a thousand murders
this time i star in one
you wouldnt do it
the precogs are never wrong
they emit a single disc
the immutable evidence of the infallible system
the room is terribly hot his words she begins to sway unsteadily
anderson focuses on her
well figure this out
well review the system
there is no review
theres only the disc
it shows my guilt
theres no defense
her long hair
you cant run
please lets a sound outside
they both turn
a deep silence
the furnace churns out heat
and anderson looks at lisas hair and finally understands
slowly and very carefully anderson slides the disc back into his pocket
he rises from his chair
for the first time he goes to her reaches out and touches her hair
it was strange
i watched from the bathroom window
you went out in the backyard to make a call
she looks at him
an appointment you said
for a haircut that afternoon
lisas hand jumps to her hair
you didnt get your hair cut
you went to the trouble of calling first thing in the morning
it was that important
she reaches for him
he pulls away
everythings going to look wrong
youre going to distrust everybody and everything now
lisa implores him
you cant distrust me
beat it was ed i called
anderson cocks his head
why lie about it
stop being a cop and listen to me
a booming electronically altered voice suddenly penetrates the walls of the house from outside
there is no escape
anderson betrayed glares at his wife
your birthdays tomorrow
we wanted to
but bes already on the move running for the upstairs
drop to your hands and knees and stay there
precrime is entering your house
lisa screams as her front door is sonically blasted off its hinges and a swarm of precrime officers in mirrored helmets hurtle in
they move past her and spread through the rooms and up the stairs like a disease in fast motion
helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out scanning rooms for thermal presence
an officer steps out of a small room
he speaks his voice electronically altered
hes got a hair dryer going
screwed up my reading
the others nod
were not picking up shit
they rush into rooms with increased urgency
we follow officer as he moves counter to the group and down the stairs
he hesitates as he moves through the living room which is awash in personnel
lisa stands against the wall pale and shaken
he looks at her for a long beat then steps over the shattered door and out into the sunlight
everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm
but andersons house looks like a waspss nest someone has kicked
four precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it engines whining
black python transports are all over the street out in front and more keep coming
and everywhere on foot there are precrime police
officer i approaches a python ground transport
another officer guards it weapon out his head turning right to left
he settles on officer s approach and raises his weapon
officer doesnt even break stride
he walks right up to the guard and then right through him
a holograph decoy
officer enters the python
officer removes his helmet its anderson
and then comes the moment of truth have they cancelled his identiscan access to precrime vehicles yet
a little scanner arm arches down from the visor and flashes a red beam into his eyes
anderson presses his lips together
the python turns on and a generated voice greets him
paul anderson clear
anderson grips the steering wheel
but his time since it is a law enforcement
vehicle the steering actually works
anderson pulls out
from above as the python transport slips away from the chaos
then higher and we see that the direction the python is headed will take it from the green of the suburbs through the white of washington and into the dark
of the sprawl
ed witwer sits alone in an antechamber
he stares at an oversized oak door then looks down at the floor
he runs both hands through his hair
he is tired his eyes weary lost
a voice comes over the intercom
enter now please assistant director witwer
witwer pulls himself together and opens the door
witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table
powerful men sit at the other end of the table
swanson sharp boned the fbi director
cronin awl like eyes the cia director
chief justice pollard whose face reveals nothing
vice president almer whose tongue darts across his dry lips unsettlingly
unpleasant looking men in an unpleasant mood
cronin looks up from a printout hes been reading and stares at witwer
the central question is why does anderson want to kill witwer
cronin holds up the printout
we checked your finances
nothing irregular you dont steal from him he doesnt steal from you
you havent done anything that he might have discovered and vice versa
swanson holds up another sheath of papers
personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him
beat hes done nothing to you or you to him
witwer presses his lips together
you fucking his wife
witwer gives him a bad look
there we are
so you are friends partners and soul mates
anderson has no motive
i cant think of one
beat maybe justice pollard the precogs are mistaken
witwer looks away
jesus he wants out of this room
you dont believe that do you
barely audible no
the precogs are infallible
senator malcolm is impatient with all this
youre goddam right
so gentlemen screw the motive
we got a pre murderer on the run and a nasty little pr problem
the very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on witwer
and here is our solution
you are now director witwer
witwer shakes his head starts to protest
almer silences him with a raised finger
precrime must demonstrate its willingness to go after one of its own
now look cronin talks right over him
the public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor
therefore precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job
and who would pursue a murderer harder than his intended victim
you went after anderson yesterday because it was right and because you believe
almer speaks with a tight irony
and your belief will certainly grow stronger with each tick of the clock
witwer looks at the men with thinly veiled hatred
but he does not deny their words
haw long will it take director
wiltwer takes a long breath concentrates his mind on the task he cant avoid
he knows precrime of course
and the streets hes rusty but hell remember how to work them
itll come back to him fast
witwer almost smiles
justice pollards not smiling
were not here to praise caesar were here to bury him
witwer looks at pollard then lifts a finger and touches his right eye
he cant avoid iris identification
every door he opens every atm he uses or taxi or transport he boards hell get scanned
quietly it wont take long to find him
the eyes that look back at witwer are unblinking
the unzoned city is full of s iconography but it all feels different than it did in the suburbs
where the burbs were ike the city is joseph mccarthy
the fat ramblers and studebakers have a little grime on them
the womens dresses are tighter and more urgent the mens suits have some shine at the elbows
you look over your shoulder here move faster and smile a lot less
and some streets you dont go on at all
andersons python moves down one of them
he stops under a blackened suspension bridge gets out
hes still in uniform
he holds a duffel bag
he starts to walk away from the python then hesitates
hes left the door open
he shakes his head at his sloppiness
goes back and shuts the door
walks away again
hes left a small device on the passengers seat
digital numbers shoot by in reverse
anderson continues walking away
he doesnt look back as the python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame
its not a gasoline powered vehicle so it doesnt explode
it just ceases to exist
through a smeared window anderson sees racks of suits and dresses hanging in clear plastic bags
he gets to work on the door
lisa lies in her bed alone in the dark
she listens to an almost inaudible sound a high whine
a precrime hovercraft floats high above her house a dark moon in the low clouds
a worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the clean clothes piled on the floor
it almost looks like a nest like someone slept there anderson in a blue suit and fedora carrying his duffel bag stands on a subway platform
he takes out a cell phone dials a number
he looks up at the sound of a train
the approaching maglev train has a lit sign on its front car rd street express
search and command room
witwer moves up and down the aisles past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking displays
a precrime technician suddenly sits upright
witwer picks him out of the crowd and zeroes in
witwer grabs a phone punches a button paul
the technicians scramble to pinpoint anderson on a glowing holographic map
anderson holding his phone is identiscanned along with everyone else as he steps onto the train
another technician calls out to witwer
witwer covers his phone mouthpiece
hes been scanned
hes on the rd street subway
technician calls from the other side of the room his cell phone tracks for the sprawl
we got him on the subway too
anderson sits on a seat in the rear of the car
why am i going to kill you ed
theres no motive my wife calling you before breakfast
we were planning a surprise party
it was going to be today
beat ironic happy birthday partner
this partys no fun ed
its a hell of a surprise though
beat im having trouble trusting people ed i gotta tell you
at precrime they upload a map display of the express trains route
we see a blue light moving the train
and two separate red dots along its route
an officer points at the dots and speaks to witwer in a low voice
the train makes two stops here and here th then rd street
witwer covers the mouthpiece to the officer split the units go to both well never make th witwer waves him away do your job
you there ed
you gotta come in paul
im a cop ed
i need a motive
well figure this thing out together
precrime transports zoom through the city anderson looks out the window into the tunnel dark
he talks to witwer
itll get ugly if you keep running
and your eyes paul every move you make a scanner will pinpoint you for us
i saw a news flash
youre the new director
is that the point of this
didnt think so
but it has to be something ed
witwer looks at the display map
we see the blue train nearing its first stop th street
we see two waves of lighted green dots precrime units heading for th and rd
anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train next stop th street
if i come in it puts me close to you
if i get close
i may kill you
i cant risk that
beat anyway theyd force you to lock me up
and thatd be it id never get my chance to solve this thing
witwer needs to keep him talking youre kinds liking this in a way arent you
and you get to be a real cop again
we get to flex our muscles
precrime vehicles pull up
hovercrafts appear in the sky above
andersons train is just finishing off loading passengers
the doors close and the train begins to pull out as the first helmeted precrime officers flood the platform
one of them points
anderson is visible through the window talking on his cell phone
witwer stares at the map
the train has stopped at th street
but andersons still talking
he isnt getting off hes going on to rd street the last stop
technician presses his earphone close listens then calls over to witwer
witwer covers his mouthpiece
we have visual verification hes still on the train
witwer gives him a thumbs up
we stay on witwer as he listens to anderson and watches his train move toward rd on the map
i want to tell you something partner
now the map shows all the precrime units swarming toward the rd street subway station
i gotta do this
i have to figure this thing out
beat but listen to me now
if it was you running id come after you ed
witwer stares at the map at all the units hes sent after his friend
youre a cop
and im a future murderer
beat do your job ed
come after me hard because jesus christ i wouldnt sleep or eat until i had tracked you down and put a gun to your head
precrime officers pour down the stairs toward the train platform
witwer watches on the map at all the little symbols merging together like a gameboard but this game ends in a reallife confrontation between one man and an army of
you wouldnt shoot a cop would you paul
he looks urgently to the phone technician hes still on the line
witwer presses his ear to the phone
he can hear the subway make its stop
then he hears a chorus of mechanized voices the voices of the precrime police the screams of panicked passengers police
everyone down on your hands and knees
then oh shit
the precrime officers aim the index barrels of their gloveweapons at anderson who sits blithely on a seat holding his cell phone to his ear
anderson begins to shimmer then dematerialize ghost like into nothingness
he was a holographic decoy
what is actually there on the train seat is andersons cell phone
rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice recorder
anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets of the sprawl
every city has its underbelly
if you lifted the fat dark underbelly of the sprawl this is where youd end up
the streets here feel like alleys clotted and tight
there are streetlights bright ones but the light dies at its source never makes it through the sour air down to the ground
the retro fifties look comes apart here
the people that you see and you only catch quick glimpses of them they move like rats wear black mostly tight fitting tech fibers
andersons caught one of the rats a thin bald guy in black
anderson has him pinned up against a wall
theyre having some kind of exchange which consists of the guy answering none of andersons questions and anderson pressing him harder against the wall
finally the guy does something odd
he lifts a finger and pulls down andersons right lower eyelid
anderson lets him
then the guy does the same on the left
has a long look
and then nods
anderson releases him and they go off together
an oppressive brick thing on a side street
the facade is crumbling
nothing good happens in a building like this
the guy leads anderson to the building then scurries off into the night
a stained overstuffed chair in the corner a dreary little kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink
but jarringly in the center of all this is a make shift hypertech medical setup a gleaming operating table an array of lasers scalpels and surgical equipment an anesthesia console
anderson sits in a chair facing doc
doc is a big man with delicate fingers
he sneezes then blows his nose hard into a handkerchief
got a cold
anderson looks at him uneasily
its not just doc its the whole setup the needles and scalpels the medical thing which anderson truly does not care for
doc sneezes again then looks up at his patient
i could cut open your chest sew a dead cat in there and youd never get an infection
not with the spectrum antibios ill be shooting into you
im not here for cat surgery doc
then he waits expectantly
anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card
a preset cash card
doc slides it into small console watches the numbers flash up
he frowns sighs
its all i could safely move he waits
docs not thrilled but finally he nods
time to got down to business
doc walks over to a large medical cabinet and opens the door
its full of eyes and parts of eyes
a cryo jars
you understand what i told you then
i cant just give you new irises
the scanners will read the scar tissue
alarms will go off
im a cop i know i gotta take your eyes out
anderson knows this too wishes doc would shut up anderson yeah
and put in new ones
i get it doc
anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the operating table
he lies down
do me quick before i run out of here
anderson lies there blinking up at the ceiling
he listens to doc preparing instrument trays
its a bad sound
the suspension bridge where we saw anderson vaporize the python transport
witwer stands watching as a precrime techno unit sifts through the white ashes
witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the potomac
its a pose a track dog might hold nose up testing the air for a scent
we cant see anything at first because anderson cant see anything either
hes in a deep post surgical haze
docs voice comes to him
its warped and ugly
dont take the bandages off for twenty four hours
youll go blind if you do
anderson makes an affirmative grunt
now we see his surroundings even though anderson still cant
he lies in a grungy bed his head and eyes swathed in white dressings
doc stands over him
youre in a room
i had you moved here a couple miles from my place
if they find you they dont find me
anderson grunts weakly
a guy will come in feed you once
beat i juiced up the nano reconstruction around your new eyes cause i know youre in a hurry
fuzzily nano re
organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels
itll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs
anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages
doc forces them away
im giving you a bonus might come in handy
doc takes an air syringe out of his pocket and touches it to andersons hand
its a temporary paralytic enzyme
someone spots you you duck into an alley shoot this under your chin
doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of andersons chin
the enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush
you wont look like the same man
you tighten up again in about thirty minutes
hurts like nothing you ever felt
its vicious but effective
ill put it in your bag
finally doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places it on a dresser beside andersons bed
im setting up a timer
when it buzzes tomorrow take off your bandages and get the hell out of here
anderson groggy starts to say something else but then he hears a door open and close and doc is gone
the precrime presence mounts on the streets
a couple of units move past the boarding house but they dont stop
anderson sits in a chair his dressings like a blindfold
he looks like a hostage
he is sweating
keeps reaching for his dressings to scratch then forces himself not to
he speaks to someone we dont yet see
the guy doc said would come
im hungry but sick to my stomach
guess i should eat
beat you gonna help feed me
now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent to help anderson
its the rat guy the thin bald man anderson had roughed up the day before
the guy has a bowl of hot soup in his hands
he stares contemptuously at anderson
so how do we do this pal
the rat guy doesnt say a word
he simply tips the hot soup and it splatters down into andersons lap
anderson cries out in pain and surprise
the guy walks out of the room
twenty hours gone by
four more to go
precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch looking for leads looking for anything
the timer shows one hour to go
anderson sits in a chair squirming miserably
his dressings are wet with sweat and frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked at them
to himself fuck
he is this close to ripping the dressings off a precrime transport stops
two officers get out
one of them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk and does a read on the boarding house
the other does a read on a pawn shop and bar next door
the officer doing andersons boarding house calls to the other officer
got warm bodies in this place
what should it take three or four spiders
speed things up so we can go eat
the officer opens the back of the transport and takes out a box
he removes four round balls
they are silver as big as billiard balls
he goes up to the boarding house gets identiscanned and the front door opens
he rolls the balls down a dark hallway
then he goes back out to the transport and leans against it bored
he holds up an electronic clipboard and waits for the data to come in
the balls roll about eight feet then suddenly come to autolife as they spin
they open like flowers flowers with legs
a fist sized spider takes shape
on its head is an identiscan lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna
an old woman sits at a card table eating a bowl of something unidentifiable
she looks up with annoyance as she sees a spider scuttling across the floor toward her
it makes a clicking sound on the floor as it comes
shes poor living in the sprawl she knows the drill
she continues to eat as the spider crawls up the leg of the card table
she barely watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand
its nice to have a little company she smiles toothlessly at her joke the spider hops onto her am and inches up then moves across her shoulder
it grips her cheek lightly as the identiscan antenna reads her eyes
then it leaps off her and onto the floor and clicks away across the linoleum
the precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column with his laser pen and waits for the next one
anderson sits in his chair
he cocks his head listening
his body tenses
something feels wrong
the timer shows ten minutes to go
blindfolded for a day and a night anderson has no idea how much time he has left
three seconds four hours
a flattened spider squeezes under his door
anderson tenses as it clicks across the floor toward him
he knows that sound
anderson stumbles up and out of his chair
he starts to grab at his dressings remembers docs warning and stops himself
the spider waits for him to settle then clicks toward him again
anderson moves around the room avoiding the spider
he is dripping with sweat starting to breathe hard
the spider comes faster
anderson crashes into a table brings it down
falls across the bed
the officer squints at his clipboard
one of the spiders is taking too long
he adjusts his thermal scanner and sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room
the other officer finishes reading the pawn shop and the barroom then wanders over to officer
they both watch the screen
beat or a guy who doesnt want to get read
anderson forces himself to sit still because he knows the consequences
the spider advances starts up his leg
the timer has not buzzed
anderson cant touch his dressings
the spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face
it whirs and hums trying to adjust its antenna against the dressings
the officers eye the thermal scanner as they reach for their mirrored helmets getting ready to go in
the spider crawls all over andersons head trying to get past the dressings for a read
anderson has no choice
he starts to lift at his dressing
the spider senses his cooperation freezes in place
anderson wants to scream
he unwraps his head tugs the eye pads away from his eyes
he rips them off
the spider sits on his shoulder waiting
andersons eyes are tightly closed
he opens them light brighter than a magnesium burn brighter than a nuclear flashpoint
light to buckle the knees and push the brain beyond endurance
and though all this the faraway sound of a buzzer going off
the timer has finally sounded
andersons open eyes are streaming with tears but he has survived the moment
it comes into slow focus the spider all business reads his eyes
then as if nothing unusual has occurred it jumps off his shoulder and crosses the floor
it flattens scoots under the door and is gone
the officers see that the spider has gotten its read
they pull off their helmets
they start putting their equipment back into the transport
anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror
his new eyes are tender and bloodshot
and they are not blue like the ones he was born with but a deep brown
anderson is exactly the same and utterly different
he grabs his duffel bag and gets the hell out of there
lisa looking drawn and scared sits in witwers office
witwer isnt looking too well either
they told me to move into pauls office
i said fuck you very much
softly i dont want to do any of this lisa
i know that
beat everybodys got their reasons for wanting you in charge
so do i you wont bring him in dead
but if he shoots a cop
beat which is what he does four days from now isnt it
witwers eyes imp involuntarily to a clock on his desk
hed never hurt you
i know that
but the other thing i know is the precogs are never wrong
the words are leading them no place good
they stop talking and just sit there
anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with several people waiting for the n
the double decker tram comes
people get off then the line starts to move forward as people get on
hes last in line
each person gets identiscanned as he boards
andersons putting his new eyes to the test
if the scan goes wrong hes positioned himself to run
the woman ahead of him gets scanned pays her fare
anderson goes up the steps and a red beam reads his eyes
the tram driver glances at a monitor beside his steering wheel then nods at him
welcome aboard mr
plenty of seats in the back
anderson nods moves casually to the back
but his jaw muscles are flexing hard working off the tension
senator malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den
he wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos adorning the cherry wood walls
hes feeling cozy and safe the way rich people can afford to
no identiscan spiders would ever be sent under his doors
no intrusions of any sort nothing that a coiffed secretary or a loyal wife wouldnt announce before hand
which is why he doesnt immediately understand the small sound at ear level coming from just behind him
its a metallic click click
he turns amiably
his eyes instantly widen and his knees buckle when he sees hes looking into the barrel of andersons cocked gun
time to upgrade your alarm system senator
senator malcolm tries to regain his composure
his fear embarrasses him
your work up of witwer
the security panel wouldve done one
beat why do i kill witwer
the senator finds his voice
theres no motive
theres always a motive
anderson presses the gun to the senators forehead
he slides the barrel tip back and forth across the senators sweaty skin
it makes a greasy red mark
i couldve come to anyone on the panel
but i picked you
beat of all the shits on that panel i like you least of all
so if this gun goes off ill feel bad but not you know devastated
you can almost see a thought dawning on senator malcolm
and then shockingly he spits in andersons face and turns and walks to the other side of the den
his tone is mocking
what the fuck was i worried about
you cant kill me
the precogs wouldve seen it
anderson realizes this too lowers his gun
the senator is even laughing now
for a moment anderson does nothing then he moves toward the senator again
the senator stands his ground smugly
kind of like something kafka wouldve cooked up
beat you like that cockroach
youre fucked and youll never know why
the senator is laughing hard now
anderson lets him
tell you something about the precogs senator
theyre great on murder
but its the little things they fail to see
anderson hits the senator so hard it bounces him across the floor and into the cherry wood panelling
several of his beloved photos crash down onto him
little things like that for instance
anderson steps over him and walks out of the room search and command room
witwer stands there amidst all of the technology speaking to a group of precrime officers
he hasnt shown up on one goddamn identiscan in three days
no one says anything and then lieutenant glaser speaks up
hes found a room hes going to sit it out
yeah except for holding a gun to senator malcolms goddman head in his own goddman house last night andersons sitting it out
beat why hasnt he been scanned
the officers look at their shoes
why is he invisible
hes moving around but he isnt being seen
lieutenant glaser tries again
hes beating the scanners no one beats the scanners
witwer reaches up wearily rubbing his face and eyes with his hands
the fingers dragging across his eyes stop
then his hands drop away and he looks at his men
hes done his eyes but the scarring always he went the whole way
the crazy bastard had his eyes removed
new ones sewn in
that takes weeks to heal
if youre prepared to go blind a street surgeonll juice up the repair cycle
they dont give a fuck about risk
witwers eyes flick to a digital clock on the wall
its something he cant help doing now
hes going to do what it takes to stay free if it blinds him maims him or kills him
witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable
a mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her teenage son
he pours it into his cereal bowl then puts the carton down in front of him
theres a flexible vid screen on the side of the carton about the size of a playing card
as the sleepy kid watches the disposable vid screen sparkles to life
nothing unusual they always do that
for advertisements lost kids or in this case crime bulletins
a good one
the kid straightens up
a fully rotating mug shot of paul anderson fills the screen followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime hes been charged with
the kid watches for a while then gets bored and pulls the dexi pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of that
a big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch a bowl of popcorn perched on his belly
he stares at a tv monitor thats the size of a twin bed
andersons face fills the monitor
the tv image is so big that anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence
its like god coming to pay a visit even if you want to avoid him you cant
the big man with the popcorn tries to do just that
he surfs through a zillion channels but andersons visage is omnipresent
andersons face fills the skies too
witwer and precrime have pulled out all the stops
advertising dirigibles float by with andersons image on it
holographic billboards with anderson hover in the air
there are so many andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the weather a special type of cloud
people on the streets look up briefly interested then go about their business
one person who is paying deep attention to all this is anderson himself
he stands on a street corner wearing dark glasses and a fedora staring at a public video kiosk
the mug shot of anderson disappears and is replaced by a precrime spokeswoman
the united states supreme court has issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of former precrime director paul andersons future murder of edward witwer the current director
his mouth slowly opens
he steps back against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket
he looks at the precog disc in his cupped hand then quickly puts it away
he stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather around excitedly
crowds of people look into the sky in store windows at other video kiosks
they have the enthralled anticipation of a mob at a public guillotining
she continues her declamation the video you are about to see generated by the precognitive mutants is the immutable evidence of the infallible system
reassuring smile citizens are urged to call precrime with any information that may lead us to the whereabouts of paul anderson future murderer
shakes his head in confusion and disbelief
but he has the precog disc
the old guy him nudges him this oughtta be good huh
and there it is anderson and witwer standing there pointing guns at each other
the whole thing just as we saw it before
all the way through to the fatal moment
anderson shoots him
witwer slumps dying
the video stops
and then begins to play all over again right from the start the precrime number scrolling along the bottom of it
moves quickly through the crowds
ennis page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so full of cigarette smoke it doesnt seem capable of supporting life
but it supports the kind of life page is interested in
an emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool beside page
he gives one shake of his head and she slides away again
his eyes cut to a group of females
he waits for the next approach
as a hand reaches over his shoulder and places a precog disc on the bar in front of him
page makes a sound and tries to jump away as if the disc is something lethal
which it is in a way
anderson presses him back down on his stool
sits next to him
page stares at him scared
anderson looks straight ahead as he speaks
ennis page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of selfloathing
beat direct quote from your psychological profile the kind of shit i had to know as your former boss
page is an obsessive compulsive type nine
niners are great for the kind of work you do keeping all those precog discs in order
you can almost see pages heart slamming in his chest
he tries to hide it with tough talk
i fuck whores and im orderly so what
somethings out of order ennis
deeply out of order
page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar page you got a disc anderson picks it up holds it tight in his fist not a disc
when i went home sick i stole it
i took it with me ennis
i wasnt sick i was running with the evidence
lets that sink in so how is it that precrime has one too
utterly baffled you cant make copies anderson waits
lets page work through it
its the basis of the system
the immutable evidence
copies are impossible
beat you went home
a little later i came in with a disc for mr
witwer to review
i wasnt halfway out the door when he cried out
anderson is barely breathing hes listening so hard
he was in shock
he showed me
it was you shooting him
then all hell broke loose
he had to send the precrime units to your house
ennis you gave out the same disc twice
less than an hour apart
the one i stole
and then another one
of the same event
the precogs can only move forward to new events
into the future
they never repeat
anderson looks around
patrons are beginning to look over in his direction eyes lingering
page seems in a daze
as an obsessive compulsive niner the concept of an untidy system is disorienting
anderson starts to say something to the man then doesnt
on the way out anderson gets identiscanned
an automatic digital voice calls out after him
have a nice night mr
symington anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of the sprawl
a young guy with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone
he picks up the receiver and immediately gets identiscanned
a light goes on hes about to dial
anderson appears out of nowhere shoulders him out of the way
the young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back onto the sidewalk
anderson grabs the hanging receiver
hey you cant
he reaches for anderson then thinks better of it
anderson is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses
im gettin a cop
the guy scurries off
anderson dials quickly
lisa walking down a hallway in the judicial center stops to answer her beeping cell phone
she leans against a wall as lawyers and judges pass by
lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall your phone will be bugged
so we cant meet we cant do anything
nowing youre listening is enough
lisa nods as if hes right there
he is right there for her
this is all shes got
when precrime stormed the house i thought youd called them
witwer sent them
he saw the disc and had to do his job
beat tell me you forgive me
of course i forgive you
theres no time left
he has to get off the line and start moving again
a vast weariness enters his voice
all these people i need to forgive me
beat do you think frank forgave me
all i could do for him was send him gardenias
long beat i love you
lisa almost cries out when he hangs up
she flattens herself against a wall
she stays like that for a long moment pulling the sound of her husbands voice his words deep inside of herself
and then she gets a look as one of those words registers profoundly
whispers to herself frank hated gardenias
a public cemetery along the potomac
theres not much land left for new graves
a funeral is taking place
a lot of mourners in dark s suits and dresses
the service is nearing its end
frank dignazios newly dug grave is nearby
lisa stands there looking at the temporary marker and the flowers and wreaths piled up against it
two rows over they are lowering the casket into the ground
high in the sky a precrime hovercraft everpresent in lisas life floats in the low clouds with a barely audible whine
lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers
her hand drifts near a white gardenia wreath
there is a small envelope tucked beneath a blossom
she takes it
then she rises and begins to walk back to her car
the funeral is over and the mass of mourners many wearing dark glasses fan out toward a long line of cars
one of the mourners brushes past lisa
she looks up and he tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over them at her
she looks into his eyes
and its jarring the blue eyes gone that theyre brown now
but its him hes there and she wants to reach out for him
knows she cant
hes already moving on
hes risked everything for a look
he slips into the black sea of mourners she goes to her car neither of them ever breaking stride
the precrime craft hovers unaware lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the alexandria washington connectway
a precog disc falls into her hand
her mouth opens shes never held one before
and there is a note with it it reads the precogs generated duplicate discs
this is the first
precrime has the second
anderson has to eat bad food quickly and on the run
he gathers up a wrapped sandwich a bag of donuts something to drink
he waits in line
he doesnt like to be in a line waiting
the woman ahead of him argues about change
he presses his lips together
and then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera dome attached to the ceiling
it gives him a fish eye reflected view of whats happening behind him
precrime police are happening behind him
he doesnt stop to ponder as two python transports zoom up outside the store
anderson vaults the counter knocking the customer and the clerk to the floor
anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can
he hears the mechanically altered commands of a precrime officer calling from the store
drop to your hands and knees
anderson crashes out into an alley and clambers up a fence
sonic blasts shatter the air around him
chunks of brick fly off the walls on both sides
but he is full of adrenaline and there is no stopping him
a different part of the city
anderson hunkers low in the back seat of a tram
he looks up as the driver swears what the hell anderson stands up looks down the aisle through the windshield
precrime transports are heading straight at the tram going the wrong way on a one way avenue
theyve even taken radio control of the p
system on the tram
drop to your hands and knees
anderson cant believe it how are they suddenly pinpointing him
the passengers turn in unison like cattle and stare at him terrified
anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit doors smashing them open and tumbles out onto the street
he rolls and is up on his feet in a second reaching into his bag for a glove
he pulls the weapon onto his right hand as he whirls around sizing up his predicament
precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the street
he looks up
he is surrounded by skyscrapers and buildings he is walled in at the bottom of an urban canyon
people freeze against the sides of buildings run into doorways where they can
passengers in trans and taxis or cars stay there pressed against their windows watching
nothing moves except the python transports closing in
the lead officer speaks with that menacing electronically altered voice
lower your weapon or we will neutralize your threat potential
the precrime police are out of the transports now advancing at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men
anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building closest to him
the large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building
anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward it his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement
do not move
anderson is up on the sidewalk now two feet out from the building right beside the high pressure hydrant
he stops looks up looks down looks at the police advancing
it is a moment for prayer
anderson doesnt have a moment
he spreads his feet and fires a massive sonic blast down at the sidewalk
the effect on the underground water main is immediate
a geyser of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up from the sidewalk lifting the tumbling anderson fifteen feet into the air right alongside the building
the stunned police officers try to take aim but andersons bouncing at the top of the geyser
and they cant fire anyway because officers workers stare at the excitement from every window in the building
all this in a time span of seconds
the world spins crazily for anderson but he manages to grip hold of a metal support beam holding the buildings sign one story up
the police try to see what hes doing but the torrent of water from the water main break obscures his moves
he pulls himself onto a ledge steadies himself slides along it toward a second story window
the office building gawkers lurch backward from the window as anderson blasts it to sparkling dust and leaps inside
the building covers almost an entire city block
anderson dripping wet runs from one end of it to another blasting through doors shoving terrified workers out of the way
he is like a wide receiver running the length of the field jumping obstacles slamming through over and around whatever he must to get to his goal
and then he reaches his goal the windows overlooking the avenue next block over and parallel to the one where precrime ambushed him
he spots a double decker turbotram moving slowly in the stream of traffic
it pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers
anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of the bus
it is a bone jarring landing
he loses consciousness for a second rolls the length of the roof and slides off it onto the pavement
he lies there trying to rouse himself
traffic brakes to a stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in the road
no one wants to touch him
a single car horn sounds and then a chorus of them
anderson rouses struggles to his feet and takes off in a limping run
anderson out of breath and in pain leans against a post at the far end of the passenger platform
there are tracks on either side of him one marked uptown and the other downtown
he feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that the downtown train is coming in
and on his left too the uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view
which maglev train will lead him to safety
which one wont they pinpoint
he runs up to a teenage kid who has his arm around his girlfriend
they step back startled
hes got a flat top hair cut she wears a pleated skirt and saddle shoes
the trains pull in
pick one for me
point to the train i should take
i dont know
the girl lifts a nervous finger and points
he runs to board it as they run in the opposite direction to the downtown
he sits at the back of the half empty train watching the dark rush by
a train chosen arbitrarily its impossible they could find him
a station stop
he starts to get off is actually on the platform then steps back onto the train
the rushing dark again
when the maglev eases to a halt at the next station he gets off this time
he walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people
he eases back and lets them go up first
precrime officers crouch around the bend silently snatching people out of the way as they come into view
they wait but anderson does not come
and he does not come
on signal the precrime officers rush down the stairs
anderson hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive bindfoam
as they run below him down the stairs
they go out of sight he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for him
the strain of hanging by one arm is killing him
he reaches up
with a laser knife and cuts away at his coat sleeve releasing himself from the glob
he drops to the stairs and instantly slips up them
he surprises a helmeted officer just around the bend
he slams him against the wall yanks off his helmet and holds the laser knife against his throat
the officer s clearly terrified
he speaks hoarsely through andersons choking grip
dont kill me
anderson looks at the panicked officer
anderson closes his eyes trying to put it together
he opens them
but the precogs wouldve predicted me killing you
youd know whether i do or not
the officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy
anderson suddenly gets it
he tightens his grip on the man
they shut down the system
theyve shut down the precogs
the officer nods
theyre off homicides
theyre redirecting them to help us locate you
which is how they knew where hed be every time
anderson chops quickly at the base of the mans skull knocking him out
and then he runs because what else can he do
lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door labeled courtroom
she holds a briefcase in one hand
down the hall other courtrooms are in use but not this one
she enters the dark and vacant courtroom
lisa sits at the judges bench in the empty courtroom
the lights are dim
she takes a small battery powered tv out of her briefcase
she turns it on
the murder of witwer by anderson is being shown over and over in a continuous loop
flashing at the bottom is the hotline number precrime
then call now
now lisa takes out the precog disc anderson gave to her the first disc
she places it in the specialized monitor on the judges bench
the tv and the judges monitor sit side by side
the tv plays the version of the murder from the second disc the judges monitor plays the version from the first disc
she stares intently her eyes flicking back and forth from one version to the other
they seem absolutely identical
when the judges monitor goes blank she starts it over again
lisa stares watching her husband murder his best friend endlessly
a gas station right out of the fifties
an attendant in a uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield of a sky blue rambler
in the background anderson walks toward a mens room
anderson looks at himself in the mirror
he reaches out and touches one reflected eye which is a deep brown
it is still startling to him the color of his eyes
then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air syringe doc gave to him
he looks at it nervously
it is filled with ccs of an opaque green liquid
he touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin
he closes his eyes
then he screws up his courage and hits the plunger
the liquid is pneumatically delivered with a searing hiss
anderson screams out in agony slams back against the wall of the bathroom
his hands reach up for his face which looks like its boiling from within
the skin on both cheeks begins to pucker
the muscle tone around his chin goes soft and begins to sag like an old mans
that is the effect like he is aging fifty years
his forehead wrinkles the skin under his eyes droop
healthy pink is replaced by bloodless gray
the attendant knocks nervously on the door you all right in there
when the door opens an unhealthy looking old guy with a fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom
anderson nods and walks past the attendant who watches after him uncertainly as he wanders off
the perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around the headquarters
there may be a massive campaign to find anderson but the precrime public relations machine continues to run without interruption
there are ten people in the group and the physically transformed anderson is among them
they all wear glowing nametags
andersons reads mr
he keeps his hands in his pockets and his head low
we have heard the tour guides spiel before
welcome to the main headquarters of precrime
smaller precrime branches are scattered throughout the united states
she is about to go on when she looks over at anderson
he is fidgeting uncomfortably
all right mr
anderson moves up close to her a little too close
he whispers to her embarrassed
she gives him a professional smile and points in the distance past the elevators
anderson nods and heads off
she calls after him
well wait right here for you sir
anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor
anderson stands outside a door marked housekeeping
above the doorway is an identiscan device
anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small cryo jar
imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs the irises a luminous blue
the operations room in precrime
the technicians sit at their computers and holographic tracking displays
witwer paces among them
his eyes keep flicking to the digital clock on the wall
then they cut back to the men and machines that are telling him nothing
witwer does not look well at all when a technician leans close to his computer monitor witwer almost leaps across the room to get to him
he looks over the mans shoulder
what is it
must be a glitch
anderson just got identiscanned
witwer grips the back of the technicians chair
the technician types the data through again
its him hes been scanned
where is he
the technician looks up at witwer
but hes had his eyes done
tries to think it through
barely audible he had to have
the technicians computer flashes the next piece of information
when he speaks its the last thing witwer wants to hear
jesus christ sir
hes in the basement of this building
all eyes turn to witwer
the unspoken question hangs in the air
andersons come to murder witwer
throughout the building every available precrime officer begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement
four officers stand guard in the chamber
they listen to the orders coming in on their earpieces
three of the guards rush out of the room one stays behind
the three precogs sit in their oversized chairs the female in the middle the males on either side of her
their eyes are open
and they are deeply alert
two technicians tend to the precogs
at the back of the chamber through a large window we see ennis page sitting at the huge mainframe
a ring of precrime officers three men deep stand guard around witwer
witwer looks like he wants to kill them all
this is ridiculous
lieutenant glaser replies forcefully standing orders from the security panel sir
if he wants to get to me hell get to me
no he wont sir
witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly
then his eyes flick to the wall clock
armed precrime officers clog the corridors conducting defensive searches of one room after another
all they are coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers
in the chamber are one guard two technicians and three precogs
and all of them are left in sudden darkness as the power is cut
the officers around witwer reach for their maglite flashlights
the search and command room suddenly looks exceedingly vulnerable
a technician calls out from the darkness dont worry air emergency generators will kick on in five seconds
the green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room seem alive with fireflies
five seconds go by
then ten more
he got the generators too
there is a long moment of silence
and then witwer begins to laugh
the room is utterly dark and silent
the silence is broken by the sound of something rolling across the floor
somebody speaks probably the guard
an explosion of light fills the room in strobe like blasts
and leaping through the light is anderson
the temporarily blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees
anderson stun guns them quickly
the strobes fade and anderson sets a zirc flare on the floor
we see that the enzyme is wearing off his facial features are returning to normal
he is oblivious to the precogs in their chairs
it is the equipment he is after
through the observation window we see ennis page watching in horror as anderson severs the light cables connecting the precog helmets to the mainframe
anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window blowing it out and knocking page unconscious
then he reaches into the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of blasts
anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a presence behind him
perhaps it is because the movement is so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection
a hand the fingers pale and slender reaches out and takes hold of his hand
anderson whirls around weapon out
and there before him is the female precog
he looks at her then beyond her to the other precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in their chairs
her helmet is off
she is young but her close cropped hair is silver white
and when she speaks her voice is like the wind whispering through time
save us anderson
anderson can feel the seconds ticking away his carefully planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way
i have to get out of here
she grips his hand
it is beyond pitiful this frail little woman pleading
and her eyes she wont let him go
she is beginning to weaken to sway on her feet
a sudden realization floods over anderson
you let me get here didnt you
you stopped giving them information so they couldnt track me
the precog female is fading fast
she tries to reach out for him and her legs give way
save and what can anderson do but catch her before she falls
what can he do but throw her over his shoulder and in the fading light of the flare make a run for freedom
lisa has been staring at the judges monitor and the tv screen for over an hour
the two versions of anderson murdering witwer play over and over
wearily to herself help me paul
she hits freeze frame on the judges monitor at a moment during his confrontation with witwer when andersons face fills the screen
lisa looks with deep urgency into her husbands eyes
and it is his eyes finally that tell her everything
lisas hand rises to her open mouth
she keeps the image on freeze frame and turns and looks at the tv which shows precrimes disc over and over the number scrolling along the bottom
when the same close up of anderson flashes onto the tv screen she leans close to it and squints
anderson stares right back at her
and for the first time lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical
and now theyre brown
for the first time in days she allows herself a small smile
power has been restored to precrime headquarters
witwer walks slowly through the ruins of the chamber
emt teams work on ennis page and the other dazed personnel anderson has left in his wake
technicians cluster around the two remaining precogs the brothers
their eyes are closed and they are limp
their lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other
lieutenant glaser is with him but when witwer speaks it is almost to himself
why didnt the precogs know he was coming to do this
the lieutenant has no reply
witwer runs both hands through his hair
it has begun to wear him down the ticking of the clock
the next time he shows up itll be to kill me
we wont let that happen sir
witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him then gives the lieutenant a withering look
you wont huh
when the lieutenant tries to speak to him witwer walks away and goes over to the technicians working on the precogs
he stares at the precogs
to a technician when can we get these things operational
theyre a hive mind sir
it takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational
which witwer does not want to hear
witwer leans very close to the technician
these two are all i have to find the man who is about to murder me
hook them up and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to
they are a machine and i need that machine at my disposal
the precogss lips stop for a microsecond and then begin their silent movements again
ennis page is a man unglued
he sits on a tidy little sofa in a tidy s style living room
but his movements have become untidy
he puts a very tiny pill on his tongue
when he drinks from a glass of water it dribbles down his chin onto his shirt
not like ennis at all
when his doorbell rings he slowly looks up then looks down at the floor again
he doesnt answer it
it rings some more
and then lisa is standing there before him your identiscan is off ennis
i could just walk in here
to turn it on
she sits down beside him
you dont look surprised to see me
she glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside him three gone
i need your help
unexpectedly tears well up in enniss eyes
he took one of my babies
hes desperate ennis
he had to
beat we have to help him
lisa holds the precog disc in front of his eyes
he closes them against the sight as if it were an evil talisman
its a fake ennis
enniss eyes open again
this is the first disc
you delivered it to director anderson
he reviewed it
and then he stole it and went on the run
ennis tries to think through his fear and haze
his words slur
but he thought it was real and ran with it
the pills his tidy world coming apart ennis is losing it
an hour later you delivered a second disc of the same event
witwer reviewed it
it was real
beat how do i know this
ennis just wants her to go away
he wants it all to go away
tears stream down his face
director anderson had his eyes changed
they were blue
now he has brown ones
ennis is sliding away
lisa takes hold of him
makes him listen dammit
she points to the disc in her hand
this disc the fake one shows a blueeyed anderson murdering witwer two days from now
he doesnt have blue eyes anymore
the person who faked this disc had no idea he would change his eyes
lisa shakes him
but the second disc has to be real because he has brown eyes when he murders witwer
beat somebody tried to frame him with a fake
and somehow it all became real why ennis
how could this happen
ennis gives her a look thats on the other side of comprehension
you handle the discs
how did a fake one get delivered
enniss eyes roll back into his head
he spilled coffee everywhere
what are you
but ennis sags unconscious
she shakes him hard even slaps him but ennis is out
she lets him drop down on the sofa
from outside the house somewhere high in the clouds comes the whine of a hovercraft
lisa looks once more at ennis then gets out of there a small dreary room invisible with insignificance
which is just the kind of room you want if youve stolen a precog
the female precog lies on a cot
anderson sits on a metal folding chair watching her
her eyes slowly open and look at him my brothers arent here
you didnt even look around
beat we can sense each other
you must save anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head
i saved you
it was the best i could do
she turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall
there is a fading pink cabbage rose
she traces the outline of it with her thin finger
she turns back to him
thank you anderson
it is deeply eerie for him chatting with a precog
what am i going to do with you
her eyes grow very serious
name me anderson
give me a name
ive never had one
anderson rises moves around the small room
he is shamed embarrassed
she turns to the wall
listen to me
beat listen to me
it is heartrendingly touching the smile she gives him when she faces him again
they shifted your precognition so you would locate me
and it hurt us physically
did you know that
the helmets the controls
guiltily i didnt know
for a long moment he cant say anything
but there are things he needs to understand
when they shifted you to find me you didnt reveal everything
that i was going to break into precrime
we saw our chance
you would need to shut us down you would have to come
we wanted you to come
you used me to save you
have been used all my life anderson
anderson cant meet her eyes
no one cared that we were human
from a human mother
taken at birth
hooked to machines
beat we have been alive anderson
enslaved for the greater good
her words are unbearable for both of them
she traces the outline of the wallpaper rose again
but now i have a name
and i know the man who has named me will not allow me to be enslaved again
anderson looks at her then goes to the window carefully watches the street below
whats going to happen to us
can you see that
and away from my brothers
i see glimpses and hints of things nearby
but its all
beat im tired of the future anderson
she lies on the bed watching as anderson comes back to her
he sits carefully on the side of her bed
then be reaches out and gently touches her cheek you didnt know i was going to do that did you
she is almost too overwhelmed to speak no
it was lovely
and now it is anderson who is overwhelmed if he were not already dead it wouldve killed ennis page to see the state of his living room
precrime officers everywhere
blood on the rug
a gun beside the sofa
witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the coroner crab walk pages body
it whirs and clicks as it probes and takes samples from various sites
the holographic doctor waits patiently as the coroner crab makes its determinations
lieutenant glaser talks quietly to witwer who else could itve been
the crab probes the ragged hole in pages head he grabbed a precog so he could commit an undetected murder
beat page worshipped the system
he fell apart
the lieutenant rolls his eyes
witwer doesnt say anything
he just stares at the body the crab finishes
the holographic doctor unfolds his arms and turns his head to witwer
he is only a computer interface but even so it seems as if there is surprise in his digitalized voice
this event is a positive homicide
beat a mortal wound was generated by a calibre bullet delivered to the left occipital portion of the anterior skull on june th at am eastern standard time
a phase two investigation is in order
no one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes and the coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself back in its box
at last someone moves
it is witwer
he lifts his arm pulls back his shirtsleeve and stares long and hard at his watch
lisa sits biting her lip as witwer watches two monitors play the two versions of andersons murder of witwer
she reaches down and freezes on a close up of anderson on the two monitors
on the left monitor anderson has blue eyes on the right he has brown
the one on the left the first disc its a fake
he doesnt have blue eyes anymore
witwer stares for a long time
but the precogs predict the infallible truth
they dont emit fake discs
and now lisa smiles
she has set her lawyerly mind to the solution
it is her moment exactly
you cant tamper with the precogs induce them to make fakes
beat but that doesnt mean someone couldnt have made a fake disc on their own and inserted it into the delivery system
the simplicity of it is inconceivable
witwer speaks carefully trying to process it bypass the precogs and slip a fake disc in with that days real ones
excited were all programmed to believe anything we see on a precog disc
the system has never been wrong
witwer stares at the proof before him
the different colored eyes of anderson
he ejects both discs and holds them in his hands
you have to call off the hunt
he was set up
witwer looks at the two discs he is holding long beat its gone too far lisa she shakes her head shocked at his response he was set up
you both were
if paul kills you youre both out of the picture
who wants us out
of what picture
stop this thing
and then we can investigate witwers mouth opens and closes
he tries again
ennis page was murdered last night
the blood drains from lisas face everything points to paul
hes not a murderer
i think he is
and a future murderer
what does it matter that the first disc is a fake
if the second ones real
witwers hands close tight on the discs
lisa stands there motionless
then she turns and leaves his office abruptly
he watches her go
rose sits in a chair near the window
she is chewing lightly on a cracker
her face shows wonder at the crackers texture and taste
she holds it up and admires its shape
andersons mood is less wondrous rose
listen to me
im going to leave you here
i have to keep moving
you must save my brothers
theres no time
ive done what i can do
rose waits for him to finish
she looks out the window at the street scene
come here anderson
he does reluctantly
do you see that boy in the blue hat walking with his mother
beat in sixty seconds he will walk beneath those workers installing a window on the tenth floor of that building
two men struggle to lift a large window in place
way below the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk holding his mothers hand
theyll drop the window killing him
it is impossible to save him
anderson turns to her shocked and then he runs for the door hurls it open and disappears down the hall
rose listens to his footsteps crashing down the stairs even as anderson rushes out of the boarding house the workers have lost their grip on the window
the little boy in the blue hat and his mother walk unwittingly toward disaster
they do not appear to hear the mens cries
the window falls end over end above the boys head
the sunlight sparks off of the glass so that from a distance it looks like a star falling from the sky
a woman across the street sees what is happening and cries out
but what anderson does is run
he runs faster and harder than humanly possible
he does not care if he is recognized or hit by a passing taxi
he is going to get to that boy
he has to get to that boy
anderson rams the boy from behind just as the corner of the window frame kisses the boys blue hat
he knocks the boy to safety as glass and metal smash into the sidewalk
the mother does not even have time to scream
she is on the ground stunned but anderson has saved the boy
he rolls away and gets to his feet
before anyone can put together what has happened anderson has ducked into an alley and is gone
anderson enters the room again out of breath some small cuts on his face and hands
he stands across the room staring at rose
rose considers him
when she speaks her voice is near and distant at the same time
for anderson it is as if the words are coming from a place inside his own head
it was impossible to save that boy but you did anderson
its in you
its what you are anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a wall
you knew it wasnt impossible
that id get there
rose reveals nothing
you are a man who saves others
beat save my brothers
anderson almost laughs
her persistence is unbelievable im in a lot of trouble right now
my brothers are in more trouble
theyve moved them to
an awful place
ed witwer hes in the most trouble of all
who saves him rose suddenly grimaces in pain and grips the side of her head
she curls into a fetal position
anderson goes to her touches her thin shoulder
her eyes roll into the back of her head
whose pain is she feeling
anderson doesnt want to think about it
because anderson has destroyed the precog chamber the two precog brothers have been brought here
the room is makeshift uncomfortable
a place for experiments
the brothers are strapped into chairs
they are helmeted
but unlike before large bore needles have been placed in their jugular veins
connected to the needles are long twists of iv tubing
there are several ivs running at high drip rates
witwer has his back to all this
he stands with dr
resfield watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge mainframe
resfield a man not given to squeamishness looks back at the precogs uneasy
were not really set up for this type of he stops talking when he looks into witwers hollow eyes
witwer is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words
anderson tries to get rose to drink some water
her skin is translucent unhealthy glistening with sweat
try to drink
she pushes the cup away
she closes her eyes as if even the dim light of the room causes her pain
we have to get her here anderson
she opens her eyes
anderson doesnt like the feel of this
i dont know
what are you seeing
we have to get her here
youre scaring me rose she covers his mouth with her hand stop talking
it uses me up
for a long time rose says nothing her gaze is locked onto a distance beyond the room
at last she speaks
in three minutes your wife will take a walk
lisa sits in her office
but she cant stand it the sitting and waiting
she has to move
she gets up and hurriedly leaves her office witwer walks past lisas secretary toward the open door of lisas office
im sorry she stepped out for a few minutes
witwer stares into the empty office
there is a clock on lisas desk
his eyes fix on it
lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble building
she takes a deep breath then heads down jefferson boulevard toward the city
a sleek black transport with two precrime officers in it follows her from a discreet distance
in the sky above the ubiquitous precrime hovercraft lisa walks down the street
she hugs herself barely aware of her surroundings
she passes by stores restaurants payphones video kiosks
people push past her
on a street corner as she waits at a red light the payphone beside her begins to ring
if she hears it she gives no indication
a kid reaches for it listens hangs up
she walks on
an art gallery
as she comes abreast of another payphone it suddenly starts to ring
this time lisa glances at it
but again walks on
the transport weaves through traffic nearby she walks past the k
lawrence graphics museum
and another restaurant
and a payphone
and this time finally when it too rings she turns and looks hard at it
a man begins to walk over to it
lisa almost knocks him out of the way to get to it
she grabs at the receiver
i need you
lisas forehead sags against the side of the payphone
she basks in the sound of him
set your watch exactly
lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens lisa okay
this is what you have to do
we now hear anderson continue in voice over as we follow lisa through a sequence of events
lisa walks up the steps of the museum at hang up the phone and enter the lawrence museum
lisa walks quickly through a display of th century magazine advertising
the two precrime officers walk into a room filled with chinese graphics
at the two precrime officers following you take a wrong turn into a different room losing sight of you for ten seconds
the officers start toward the entrance way to another room then hesitate uncertainly and go for another entrance way
lisa hurries down the steps lisa boards the a maglev train an undercover transport officer will have received emergency orders to follow you
hes wearing a red tie
he has short blond hair
the blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far end of lisas car watching her
at the next stop lisa gets off
he follows not too far behind
lisa starts up the stairs
she looks at her watch then makes herself pause a few moments to keep within andersons time frame
she starts up again
as you come around the bend cry out and turn around and slap the officer
lisa does this and the officer reels back surprised
at the same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into view and see this happening
lisa starts to run
when the undercover officer tries to stop her the two men grab the officer and they get into a fight
lisa looks at her watch then taps the window for the driver to stop
she gets out
stay on ninth street
underneath ninth street is the main power feed for the sprawl
itll mess up the navigational beacon on the hovercraft
beat keep switching taxis
but stay on ninth
she hails another taxi
she holds her hand over the identiscan before it can read her
the taxi driver looks at her sees her smile sees the prepaid cash card she holds out to him
two hundred dollars if you dont scan me
its the sprawl stranger things have happened
he grabs the card and jerks his head for her to get in
they take off
lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky
it is dense with holographic billboards skim jets dirigibles
somewhere in all that is a precrime hovercraft
and the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale
the hovercraft will try to drop altitude but the air traffic will slow it down
beat precrime loses you
youll have to walk two miles
dont get scanned
lisa walks hurriedly down a side street
she stands out in her white dress a spot of vulnerable color in world of black
too vulnerable to pass up
a man in a gray overcoat slides out from between two buildings in front of her
he is not coy about his intent
he comes straight at her all business
lisa freezes in place
she looks at her watch
the man grabs her by the shoulder
when she starts to scream he claps his hand over her mouth hard
you bite me bitch ill pull your teeth out
her eyes look around frantically
he starts to drag her backwards into the dark
anderson leaps into view and slams the mans head into a light post
it takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens his grip on lisa
his legs at last collapse under him
anderson scoops lisa off the ground
she hugs him hard
then pulls back from him
she gives him a look
cut it a little close there honeybunch
rose got the street wrong
shes getting weak
rose sits up in bed silently watching lisa and anderson together
lisa needs to touch him
she keeps a hand on his arm brushes back a loose look of his hair
rose is mesmerized by her actions
she drinks in everything every bit of life
anderson and lisa are deep in conversation
they speak to each other as if rose were hardly present in the room
anderson is trying to process everything lisa has told him
i dont think there were supposed to be two
whoever planned it wasnt counting on two
they are silent for a long time
rose watches them work it through
an infallible system
every disc ever generated has been true
somebody wants you out of the way so they make a fake disc
who ever doubts the discs
never doubted it
i saw it
and believed it absolutely
i was certain i was going to murder witwer
anderson is shaking
lisa wraps her arms around him
his voice is a stunned whisper
i saw the fake and believed so much in the system that i saw myself as a murderer
beats and the precogs picked up those thoughts
and generated the second disc
the real one
a self fulfilling prophesy
i believed it was true
and that made it true
anderson and lisa turn and look at rose
she lies curled on the bed her face to the wall
if all this is based on a lie the fake disc then do i really kill witwer
beat we see what we see
im sorry anderson
its been predicted
such a small voice delivering a message of such finality lieutenant glaser tries to get through to witwer
witwers back is turned to him
we cant take chances sir witwer doesnt move or answer
it happens in less than three hours
beat we put you in a hovercraft and keep you airborne until after the event
lieutenant glaser shifts uncomfortably ive been ordered to get you onto the craft
by force if necessary
the event is inevitable lieutenant
witwer doesnt turn around
the precogs are never wrong
the event will take place
im a believer
i dont leave this room without you sir
the security panel insists
anderson and lisa keep working it peeling away the layers
rose lies silent
nobody could slip a fake disc past ennis page lisa shakes her head
he was the weak link in the perfect system
obsessive compulsive niners cant allow changes in the routine something threw him off
beat he tried to tell me
it didnt make any sense
something about spilled coffee
beat someone was in his office with him
and coffee spilled
we stay close on anderson and lisa as roses voice cuts in
we were always treated as if we werent alive
as if we werent there the camera pulls back and they are watching her as she continues to speak
you forget that im here
you talk between yourselves
and when you need me to see into the future then you turn to me
what is it
beat we werent just lost in the future
we were in the chamber too
our eyes were open
in the present
and then anderson gets it
he kneels beside her bed your eyes were open
what did you see rose
who would i have told
who ever talked to us
who cared that we could talk
who spilled the coffee
rose stares stright ahead
rose sits in her chair in the precog chamber
her brothers sit in their usual places on either side of her
the technicians tend to them
roses eyes are open
she sees everything in the room
the technicians the machines
and across the room a large window where she can see ennis page working the mainframe computer
rose watches through the window
as the computer emits discs page gathers them ed witwer entered pages office
witwer carries a mug of coffee
ennis page goes red in the face stares at the coffee
speaks to witwer angrily pointing to the coffee
we cant hear the words
page was so upset at the sight of the coffee
witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table
it tips and spills
page looks like his head will explode
he pulls a neatly folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the coffee stain on his
ed witwer took a disc from his pocket reached over page and put it in one of the open cases
witwer closes the case
he looks through the window into the precog chamber but the only one watching him is rose and what does she matter
page rises angrily from cleaning the rug
witwer shrugs in apology and leaves the room
page stares after him
rose is weeping
she looks at anderson and lisa
i didnt understand what id seen
and i had no one to tell
lisa puts her arms around rose anderson tries to comprehend what he has heard
lisa turns and speaks softly to her husband
the perfect system brought down by a cup of coffee
long beat he set into motion his own death
he didnt know it would go this far
to rose what makes me leave this room
if i stay here i wont kill him
but rose and her brothers have already answered that question for him
lieutenant glaser looks at his watch
witwer is still in his chair turned away from him
you see if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me then you dont believe in the infallibility of the precog system
lieutenant glaser has his orders
he begins to approach
and as he does witwer swivels his chair around and lifts the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots lieutenant glaser in the forehead
and what i do not want around me are nonbelievers
witwer steps over the body as if it doesnt exist and walks out of the office locking the door behind him
witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete building that houses the lab
the lights are out in all the windows except the back section of the second floor
there the lights burn brightly
witwer sees precrime officers posted at intervals around it
he smiles as if he knows something they dont
he looks at his watch
it is a cool night but his face is slick with sweat
he walks to the entrance of the building
an officer s startled to see him
theres been a development
a bodys been found in the sprawl
theyre checking it out
i need to see what the precogs have seen
witwer is identiscanned
the door opens and he goes in
resfield looks up as witwer strides into the lab carrying a tv under his arm
witwer is the last person he wants to see
borrowed this from the technicians lounge
you dont think theyll mind do you
you shouldnt be here director
resfields eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall the red numbers ticking off time in seconds
witwer looks for a plug finds one
plugs in the tv
this is exactly where i should be
youre under a lot of strain director
witwer finds what hes looking for the continuous loop of his murder by anderson
and tvs so good for that soothes the mind
witwer turns his sweaty face to resfield and gives him a bright smile
the scientist looks like he wants to run out of the room
witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the precogs
two technicians hover over the precogs adjusting ivs and turning dials on the precogss organic helmets
the precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial
but they are no longer violently seizing they are too weak for that
bring me up to speed doc
were getting nothing from them
and thats because
witwer still grips him by the elbow
i dont know
do you think they know where anderson is
its impossible to tell
beat weve done everything
maybe even too much
they know how to find anderson for me
beat theyre the perfect machine doctor
you just have to know which button to push
rose looks like shes on fire
anderson wets another towel wrings it over the sink
lisa takes it and wipes down roses face and arms
roses lips are moving soundlessly
her eyes are shut tight
she begins to writhe in bed
come on rose
we hold it together for an hour witwer lives and im not a murderer
she wont last an hour
it suddenly looks much worse than that
roses body contorts horribly and she arches up off the bed
lisa cant control her
anderson reaches for her wraps her in his arms trying to hold and comfort her
she begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms
hes killed him anderson
rose stiffens into a seizure posture then her body goes slack
anderson eases her back on the bed
he stares at her stricken
her voice barely leaves her now you didnt save my brother
anderson reels at her words
did he kill both of them rose
rose manages to speak one last time
her whispered words damn him
does it matter anderson
looks down at rose
he starts to move quickly
lisa takes hold of his arm
if you leave this room
anderson kisses her
then im a cop just trying to do hisjob
he reaches for his duffel bag
when the door closes behind him rose turns her head slightly and looks
and then her eyes drift closed as she goes to a place deep within her own mind
he passes by several cars on the street
but theyre all auto drive they wont do him any good
so he smashes a store window within forty five seconds a city police transport zooms up lights flashing
two city officers leap out of the transport
they approach the smashed in store window weapons drawn
which is a mistake
anderson rises into view behind them and sonically blasts a small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on
as they trip and fall he is already spraying them down with bindfoam
their second mistake is they left the engine running to power the bank of nits tracker lights on the cars hood and roof
anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets of the sprawl a beacon of light in the darkness
the digital clock races through time
witwer reaches his hand up and touches the vanishing numbers
the camera pulls back and we see dr
resfield and the two technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner
and when we see the lab in its entirety there sprawled on the floor in front of his chair is one of the precog brothers
a small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of his skull
the other precog sits very still in his chair
he is still connected to everything his helmet is in place the tvs drip into him
his eyes are open and when witwer moves the precogs eyes follow him
witwer can feel them on him
he turns around
is he coming
beat i think yes
the precog looks at him
and you think yes
witwer points to the tv screen running andersons murder of witwer
witwer smiles triumphantly
infallibly immutably yes
the precog looks at him
witwers smile vanishes and suddenly strides across the room and claps his hand over the precogs eyes
then he turns and stares again at the clock
three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the building facing outward toward the parking lot weapons cradled in their arms
behind them is a line of yew bushes
as we watch the officer on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes
several moments pass and the same thing happens to the officer on the right
the officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right
then he looks hard
he grips his weapon tight and swings left
no one there either
anderson drops him hard from behind
the officer crumples onto the cement
but andersons not done with him
anderson lifts him up struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance
anderson holds him upright in place
the mans head lolls backward
perfect for what anderson needs to do
anderson reaches his fingers towards the mans closed eyes
he pulls up on the eyelids
an identiscan over the entrance clicks on and reads the mans eyes
access granted the doors hiss open
anderson enters the building dragging the officer with him
anderson enters the lab
the very building sickens him
what he sees sickens him even more
the remaining precog sits strapped into his chair
witwer sits beside him in the other precog chair the dead brother at his feet
witwer wears the dead precogs helmet
his hand is in his lap holding a gun
he grins when anderson appears
he takes off the helmet drops it on the floor
i figured since i can see the future too maybe i could get a little disc action going
beat just kidding
anderson stares at his old partner
then he looks up at the digital clock
five seventeen am
witwer looks too then turns back to anderson
you find you been doing that a lot this week
looking at clocks
beat three minutes to go
anderson turns to the tv
theres never anything good on you know
now witwer smiles
thats the old paul
youre not the old ed
youve lost it
witwer rises from the chair the gun in his hand
you lost it
you went weak in the knees partner
im not your partner
witwer looks at him sadly
the air went out of you when frank dignazio killed himself
he was guilty
i accepted that
no you didnt
the doubts were creeping in on you
the lab trying to engineer more precogs
malcolm pressuring you to expand
witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining precog brothers cheek
belief is the basis of the system
it was your job to be the ultimate believer
witwer is breathing hard
he lifts a hand and wipes the sweat from his face
and when frank died you faltered
im a cop i see into the hearts of men
beat and the thing about you is you wouldnt have just walked away
never been my style
witwer gives him the flicker of a smile precrime needs to grow
you would have stood in its way
the security panel wouldnt have understood that
what youre capable of
what a bulldog you are
beat look what youve been doing to us all week
youre the best
so you took matters into your own hands
i understood the threat
i understood anderson looks at the dead precog
you killed a precog
you ended the system you wanted to protect
this lab will make more
believe it paul
they look at the clock
knowing the exact moment of your death its made you crazy ed
witwer looks at the tv
the tv reality is almost in synch with what is happening in the room
witwer lifts his gun and then realizes something is terribly wrong
anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the disc except there is a major difference
anderson lifts up both hands you didnt bring your gun
thats exactly what im talking about
you dont believe
anderson just looks at witwer raging at him
the system is infallible anderson doesnt seem to be witwer reaches behind him and pulls a second gun from out of his belt
i guess thats why ive always carried two
he tosses the gun to anderson
it clatters at andersons feet
you cant have it both ways
you dont want to die
thats why you lured me here to kill me first
beat but it you dont diet the system is flawed and you couldnt live with that
witwer shoots him once in the right thigh
anderson cries out falls to the concrete floor
pick it up anderson speaks through his teeth anderson it doesnt happen
witwer looks frantically at the tv at the clock
he reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back iv feeding into the precogs main line
a thick yellow fluid begins to flow toward the precogs jugular vein
youre killing him partner
and what choice finally does anderson have
he reaches for the gun
lets not do this ed witwer trains his gun on anderson
anderson trains his gun on witwer
witwer lowers his gun
and stands there between anderson and the doomed precog
the yellow liquid has almost reached the precogs jugular
anderson shoots witwer once in the heart
witwer is thrown back across the room against a wall beneath the clock
anderson drags himself to the precog and rips the yellow iv out of the main line
the yellow drips onto the floor mingling with witwers red
anderson crawls to his friend and cradles him
witwer whispers something and anderson leans close to hear him
now do you believe
anderson pulls away from witwer and lets him take his last breaths alone
and then slowly emerging from the mists of darkness a pale beautifully proportioned face
it is roses face
the camera pulls back and we see that she is lying on a grassy hillside
her brother is lying beside her
they are looking up at the night sky at a sky filled with stars
rose stares up into the sky and speaks in a soft voice to her brother
can you guess what im thinking
beat james smiles
and then after a long moment so does rose
