b if window
href b b mulholland drive screenplay darkness
distant sounds of freeway traffic
then the closer sound of a car its headlights illumine an oleander bush and the limbs of an eucalyptus tree
then the headlights turn a street sign is suddenly brightly lit
the words on the sign read
the car moves under the sign as it turns and the words fall once again into darkness
gliding we follow the car an older black cadillac limousine as it winds its way up mulholland drive through the darkness of the hollywood hills
there is no one else on the road
as we drift closer to the car
two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat
a beautiful younger dark haired woman sits in back
she sits close up against the door and stares out into the darkness
she seems to be thinking about something
suddenly she turns and looks ahead
the car is slowing and moving off to the side of the road
what are you doing
you dont stop here
the car stops half on half off the road at a dark blind curve
both men turn to the woman
get out of the car
two cars a convertible and a late model sedan are drag racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the cadillac limousine
the cars are filled with crazed teenagers
two girls are standing up through the sunroof of the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back
the cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of mulholland drive
the driver still in his seat has a pistol with a silencer attached pointing at the woman
the other man is getting out of the car
the woman is clutching the seat and the door handle as if trying to anchor herself
she is visibly afraid
the man who got out of the car tries the womans door but it is locked
he smiles as he reaches in through the front door and unlocks her door
he opens her door
as he reaches for her the womans face becomes flooded with light
her eyes dart to the front windshield
the driver flooded with light turns just as the late model sedan slams into the cadillac limousine
there is an explosion of metal and glass amidst thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in death
the convertible screams past with hardly a notice
the driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is jettisoned through the windshield
the other man is torn as the cars screech over him
the woman is brutally thrown into the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying rocks engulfs her
the disastrous moving sculpture of the two cars wants to climb up the hill then stops and slides back toward the road the cadillac tips onto its side
then all is silent
a fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we see the woman appear then crawl out of the cadillac to the road
her face is vacant
there is a bleeding cut just above her forehead
she stands for a moment clutching her purse lost then begins to walk as if in a trance across mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness
the woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile desert plants
sirens can be heard in the distance
she crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a coyote which snarls and leaps at her
she screams and strikes out with her purse in self defense
the coyote backs away snarling
the woman then loses control and runs at the coyote and it races off
she falls to the ground
we can hear the thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder
she gets up and stumbles through the trees
when she clears them she is standing overlooking all of los angeles glowing down below
she clumsily starts down toward it
the woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at franklin avenue
a car races by and its headlights flare on her face
her expression shows fear and panic
she doesnt know where she is or where to go
she runs frantically across the street
she moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her into a residential area
the woman crosses sunset boulevard
coming up sunset in the distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going
she hurries into the darkness of another residential area
a car turns onto the street and comes toward her
she instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes
as if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves desperately down another residential street
a drunken couple round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward her
she runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front of an apartment building
the couple passes by without noticing her
feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep
police paramedics surround the wreckage
two detectives harry mcknight and neal domgaard both mid s to stare at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the crime scene lights
a coroners van pulls out just after an ambulance
the ambulances siren begins to wail as it speeds off
the coroners van cruises slowly
detective harry mcknight and detective neal domgaard continue staring
they do not look at each other
they are each motionless for a long moment
you feel it
they continue to stare
sammy thinks the caddy had stopped along the shoulder
man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin
then you got that blind corner
two guns in the caddy
the boys found this on the floor in back of the caddy
neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring
yeah they showed me could be unrelated
any of those dead kids wearin pearl earrings
could be someones missin maybe
thats what im thinkin
detective harry mcknight turns and crosses mulholland
his eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder each desert bush just beyond
he slowly raises his gaze to the shining lights of hollywood laying far below like a galaxy
he looks out and wonders
the clang of a metal gate wakes the woman
it is just getting light and she sees an older red headed woman carrying a suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its trunk open
the cab driver appears with two suitcases which he sets down next to the car
the red headed woman and the cab driver both go back through the iron gate
the woman in the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into the courtyard of this apartment building
she sees the red headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come back out with more luggage
they leave the apartment door open
when the red headed woman and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the bags into the trunk and backseat
their backs are to the woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly into the courtyard and through the open apartment door
the woman comes into a living room where a single trunk remains
she goes further into the apartment and crouches down in a back corner of the kitchen
she listens as footsteps come across the courtyard
she hears the red headed woman and the cab driver get the trunk
she hears them set it down once they have it in the courtyard
she hears the steps of the red headed woman come back inside the apartment
she hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen
remaining frozen the dark haired womans eyes look up as the red headed woman walks right past her grabs a set of keys off the kitchen counter then leaves the
the woman can hear the door being locked
she lets go slides to the kitchen floor and passes out
two well dressed men herb and dan mid s are sitting at a table drinking coffee
herb has finished eating his breakfast but dan hasnt touched his bacon and eggs he appears too nervous to eat
a blonde waitress with a nameplate saying diane lays the check on their table smiles then walks off
why did you want to go to breakfast if youre not hungry
i just wanted to come here
i wasnt going to say anything but why dennys
why this dennys
its kind of embarrassing but go ahead
i had a dream about this place
you see what i mean
okay so you had a dream about this place
its the second one ive had but they were both the same
they start out that im in here but its not day or night
its kinda half night but it looks just like this except for the light but im scared like i cant tell ya
of all people youre standing right over there by that counter
youre in both dreams and youre scared
i get even more frightened when i see how afraid you are and then i realize what it is theres a man
in back of this place
hes the one
hes the one thats doing it
i can see him through the wall
i can see his face and i hope i never see that face ever outside a dream
herb stares at dan to see if he will continue
dan looks around nervously then stares at his uneaten food
dan contd thats it
so you came to see if hes out there
to get rid of this god awful feeling
herb gets up picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to pay
dan just sits
as herb is paying the bill he looks over at dan just as dan is turning to look at him
from dans point of view herb is standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream
herb gets a strange feeling turns back and finishes up with the cashier
he motions for dan to follow him
dan rises reluctantly and he and herb make their way outside
now herb waits for dan to lead the way
dan takes herb across the front of dennys to a narrow sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back
they begin walking down the narrow sidewalk past a payphone
dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear corner of the building
red bricks glide by slowly
beads of sweat cover his face
he finds it difficult to breathe
herb is just behind him unable to see the fear overtaking his friend but herb can feel something himself
the red bricks moving by now are coming to an end the corner is coming closer the corner is now very close
suddenly a man a face
a face dark and bum like moves quickly out from behind the corner and stops freezes staring into dans eyes
dan lurches back
all his breath is suddenly gone
he falls back into herb who tries to catch him as hes falling
dan hits the ground unable to breathe his eyes wide with horror
herb looks up the man is gone
he looks down to dan
you all right
he kneels down and studies his friend
he feels for a pulse in the neck
he listens for breathing
his friend is dead
herb contd my god
the airport sits in blinding sunlight and veiled with smog
a big jet lands
a blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us
as the blondes face fills the screen we move with her and stay with her as she goes
her face is bright and her eyes move here and there taking in everything
she can hardly believe shes in los angeles the city of dreams
she and the old woman pass under a sign which reads welcome to los angeles
the girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail
the girl and the old lady exit the terminal with their bags
an older gentleman has joined the old lady
they stop at the taxicab stand
the old lady takes the blonde girls hand
its time to say goodbye betty
its been so nice travelling with you
thank you irene
i was so excited and nervous
it was sure great to have you to talk to
now remember ill be watching for you on the big screen
smiling okay irene
wont that be the day
the best of luck to you betty
take care of yourself and be careful
okay i will
betty and irene give each other a hug
the old gentleman nods to betty and takes irene off
betty smiles after them
suddenly someone is grabbing her bags
she turns abruptly to find she is next in line and her cab is waiting
she turns once more and waves at irene as her bags are loaded into the trunk of the cab
smiling excitedly havenhurst
they get into the cab and close their doors
the cab pulls away
betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of the cab looking at every building tree and sign
each street sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to herself as they pass by
she sees la tijera la cienega venice boulevard pico boulevard olympic boulevard wilshire boulevard etc
until they reach fountain and turn right
bettys heart is pounding when she sees havenhurst and the cab turns left
in the middle of the block on the right the cab pulls over and stops
betty sees her new home
an ancient gorgeous courtyard apartment building built during the golden age of cinema
the cab driver puts bettys bags down on the sidewalk next to her
she can barely stop looking at the building long enough to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away
betty picks up her bags and enters as if in a dream through an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working fountain at its center
a sign on a door to her right reads manager and she rings the bell
an older once very beautiful woman wearing heavy make up and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door
an unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen of the still closed screen door
ten bucks says youre betty
i am mrs
it is mrs
lanois isnt it
in all my living glory baby
pleased to meet you
you can call me coco
stay there ill get the key
coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling a huge drag off her cigarette
she starts off into the courtyard and betty picks up her bags and follows
as coco speaks smoke comes out of her with every word
i guess it was your grandfather was it
he called me to check in said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in
farmer i hear
yes he is
he raises corn
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too
you dont have to tell me
its written all over that pretty face of yours
you came here to be an actress
i just hope youll remember theres never been a great poem called tits and ass
you probably dont remember her but louise bonner lives right over there in number
when she isnt drunk she runs a damn good acting class
have many famous actors and actresses lived here
i was meaning to ask you that
honey all the great ones came through here at one time or another
a haunting music begins to swell
coco contd people say in the springtime when the wind blows the smell of the jasmine you can still feel the presence of everyone of them
i guess ive come to quite a place
sweetheart you dont know the half of it
the music fades
coco looks down suddenly
on the cobblestone courtyard in front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog
she angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level
coco contd yelling up wilkins
that dog craps coco turns back to betty
coco contd you dont have pets do you
no i dont
theyre allowed but i dont like em
for obvious reasons
one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo
you wouldnt believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard
lets see your aunts apartment
its a good one
i can hardly wait coco
the dirty and torn black cocktail dress of the dark haired woman along with her shoes purse and undergarments are in a pile in the bedroom
we drift off them toward the bathroom where the dark haired woman can be seen showering through rippled glass
theres the sound of a door opening
we see a movement through the glass and the shower goes off instantly
we can hear the dark haired womans frightened breathing as she waits frozen listening
betty enters thrilled with what she sees
the apartment is filled with movie memorabilia deco furniture oriental rugs brass floor lamps and a massive tiled fireplace
she sets her bags down and stares
i told ya
now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding
so heres the key and you need anything just give a holler
coco hands betty the key everybody in this buildings pretty much okay with me or they wouldnt be here
if you want later ill introduce you around
no hard feelings if you dont and dont forget the rooftop garden
its just up the stairs we passed
its open to all the tenants
you can see the hollywood sign from there
oh coco thank you
thank you so much
you got it
see you later honey
coco leaves and closes the door behind her
betty begins to explore the apartment
after walking a circle in the living room she passes through the kitchen
she moves down a hallway looking at paintings and posters
she goes into the bedroom
she smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge ornately carved head and foot board
she notices the soiled dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer
she stands back up shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling tiles
as she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in the mirror above it
suddenly something catches her eye and she opens the shower stall
there before her is the naked beautiful dark haired woman
she quickly closes the shower door
betty contd im sorry
ruth didnt tell me someone was going to be here
im so sorry
im ruths niece
my names betty
im sure she told you i was coming
theres a silence
there was an accident
i came here
i saw the dress
are you all right
there is another silence
betty contd what happened
a car accident
are you okay
i think so
i was just taking a shower
oh my god
ill let you get back to that
im going to get unpacked
betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she stops and looks back in
betty contd whats your name
we see a close up of the dark haired woman
we see her eyes widen with a kind of fear
shes frantically thinking searching her mind for an answer
betty contd im sorry
ill get out of here and we can talk later
betty is unpacking in the bedroom and putting her belongings in the closet and the dresser drawers
many of her aunts things are still there
the dark haired woman is looking at herself in the mirror
she turns and begins looking around the bathroom at shampoos cosmetics until her eyes fall on a poster of gilda starring rita hayworth
the bathroom door opens and the dark haired woman comes out wrapped in a towel
shes drying her hair with another
she and betty stare at one another
my name is rita
do you work with my aunt
its none of my business
she has pretty red hair
she is very kind i think
she sure is
shes letting me stay here while shes working on a movie thats being made in canada but i guess you know that
i couldnt afford a place like this in a million years
unless of course im discovered and become a movie star
of course id rather be known as a great actress than a movie star but sometimes people end up being both and that is i guess youd say sort of
why i came here
im sorry im just so excited to be here
i mean i just came here from iowa and now im in this dream place
you can imagine how i feel
i think ive been hurt
betty goes to rita
betty contd sit down
betty sits rita on the bed
she leans down and looks at her head and face
betty contd where were you hurt
rita motions to her head above her forehead
betty looks through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black bruising
betty contd we should get a doctor
but this could be serious
i need to sleep
if you have a concussion you shouldnt sleep
it will be okay if i sleep
i need to lie down and sleep
all right but
im going to check on you
rita lies down and is instantly asleep
betty leans over her and listens to her breathing
she gets a blanket and drapes it over the beautiful sleeping rita then leaves the room
the street level of the office building is filthy and houses stores selling racks of cheap toys
up above we see office windows and a big sign saying office space for rent along with a telephone number to call
we drift in toward one of the windows on the sixth floor
two men are in the room joe and ed
joe leans up against a rack of filing cabinets
he is in his late twenties
he looks like a run down heavy metal rocker wears a blue denim shirt open t shirt underneath black denim jeans and motorcycle boots
his black belt has silver studs
hes smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at the desk has said
his laugh is easy and his grin is infectious
the man at the desk ed wears a clean crisp black suit like a business mans but unlike a business man his blonde hair is long enough to go over
so man thats unheard of
an accident like that
who coulda foreseen that
so youre looking good
whatcha doin these days
well not much ed
just doin some stuff for this guy
making ends meet huh
yeah look at my digs
times are tough
oh things arent so bad
gee i hope youre not goin to get in any trouble
it was just a thing
the story made you laugh
yeah thats a funny story
looking like hes rubbing the small of his back joe moves over to ed at his desk
joe looks down to the surface of the desk to a small worn black book
joe contd so there it is
eds famous black book
yeah the history of the world in phone numbers
joes hand still at the small of his back moves into view holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out and fires a hole through eds temple
blowing eds brains out across the desk carpet and wall
eds head bangs down on the desk then is still save the leaking of blood from the wounds
joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window behind eds desk wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and places the cleaned gun in eds right hand
he places eds right forefinger gently onto the trigger
as he puts the finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the gun goes off
the bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap wall at the far end of eds office
joe hears a muffled scream
joe contd disgusted with himself oh
with a sense of just more stuff i got to do joe moves slowly and begrudgingly out of eds office checks the corridor and goes toward the screaming which still
he opens up the office door next to eds and finds a heavy set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her buttock and lower back
he sighs and walks over to her and cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the screaming
wide eyed she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office
joes foot catches on a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone crushing blow on top of him
the woman begins beating his face with her meaty fists
joe snaps her head back instantly stilling her violent activity
he wrestles the stunned heavyweight back to her feet and out her door
he pushes and pulls her into eds office
just before they enter joe notices a man with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the corridor
he stops and calls to the man
joe contd hey man
shes hurt bad
get down here and use the phone
help me out
you gotta call the hospital
the man hesitates
not sure if this jives with what hes seeing
joe contd i mean it
get down here quick
shes hurt and i cant do everything myself man
joe pushes the woman inside eds office throws a glance back down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing
long thick black cord as he goes
joe goes in to eds office with the woman
he throws her down on the floor in line between eds desk and the bullet hole in the wall
she starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up
joe grabs the pistol from eds dead hand and lifts it to fire but the woman has turned around and is almost standing
joe contd no no no
you gotta be turned around
he goes to her slaps her hard in the face and spins her around
before she can turn again joe races back to place himself in the proper line at eds desk and quickly fires two silenced shots into the back of her head
the man with the vacuum enters
his eyes begin to widen in reaction to the scene
just then joe fires a bullet into the mans chest
the man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his hands rush up to the wound
as the vacuum cleaner whines joe rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the corridor
he pulls him into the room the man moaning and clutching his chest starting to collapse
joe releases him and the man goes down
the vacuum cleaner seems to be screeching now in the threshold
joe fires the last bullet into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner
the bullet shorts out the internal wiring of the vacuum
that in turn blows the buildings circuit breaker and all the lights go out
joe contd disgusted with himself oh
now he hears voices voices moving into the corridor
what the hell
whats this cord doing here
its the vacuum
its the vacuum what did it
joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in eddies hand eddies finger on the trigger
joe picks up the black book turns and makes his escape by going out the office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape
we see three men sitting at a conference table raymond ray hott president of production wearing a crisp blue suit vincent darby senior vice president wearing a crisp green suit
and robert smith talent manager wearing a crisp brown suit
ray and mr
darby sit at the head of the table and robert smith sits along the side
a younger man adam kesher enters and sits down with an arrogant nonchalance next to robert smith
adam is dressed in a frumpy old fashioned plaid shirt worn jacket dark blue cotton slacks and a pair of old brown wing tips
as he sits he is holding and twirling a vintage iron golf club
so whats the problem
there is no problem
so why did you idiots bring me here
im in the middle of making a picture
silence for a moment
a man enters through a rear door and whispers something to mr
darby and shows him something on a piece of paper
darby studies the piece of paper
to man who entered what was it last time
the man who entered points to something on the paper
darby contd okay lets try the next one
the man nods and leaves
he isnt gonna like it
whore we talkin about here
robert smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to adam
you see adam
there are some suggestions which are to be brought forward
and i know you said you would entertain suggestions and thats all anybody here is asking you to do
whatre you talking about
an open mind
youre in the process of re casting your lead actress and im

before us is a huge modern office building of glass and steel
two men in dark suits have exited a large limousine and are walking up into the building
we drift up the facade higher and higher moving in toward the top of the building
the men exit an elevator and move through a lobby where a plaque beneath an enormous bronze sculpture reads ryan entertainment
gliding we travel behind the two men down a wide carpeted hallway with blonde wood and glass on each side
they enter through two large blonde wooden doors to the conference room
the men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place
darby and robert smith stand immediately
adam remains seated
darby is the only one near enough to attempt a hand shake but when he offers his hand it is not taken
the men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and without acknowledging anyone
one of the men in a dark suit opens a briefcase
ray has been trying to make introductions
the castigliane brothers
let me introduce you around
after theyve already seated themselves
this is mr
darby whom you know and this is the director adam kesher and his manager robert smith the castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this however during the introductions the
one with the briefcase removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of ray
ray contd ah
shes very pretty
we see the photo of the girl of a nice looking blonde someone weve never seen before
adam looks like he doesnt know whats going on and hes getting upset about not knowing
his manager robert smith is beginning to see the makings of a confrontation hes starting to panic
referring to castigliane brothers may i offer you gentlemen anything
uh whats the photo for

ray still standing with a forced smile turns to the castigliane brothers
wed be happy to put her in the pile for considerations

theres six of the top actresses that want this thing
this is the girl
you better take care of this
hold on adam
theres no way theres no way
luigi castiglianes espresso is brought in by the man who had been in earlier
the man sets the espresso down in front of luigi and takes a step back
the room becomes silent watching the espresso man and luigi
without looking up luigi speaks softly
leading forward to hear pardon
the espresso man leaves the room
luigi looks at the espresso
vincenzo stares at adam
adam is doing his best to stare down vincenzo
the espresso man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the espresso
espresso man contd will that be all sir
luigi doesnt answer and after a moment of standing very still waiting the espresso man turns and leaves the room
adam is stared down by vincenzo and averts his eyes to the espresso cup
he looks around at ray and mr
darby seeing them stare at the espresso cup
vincenzo keeps staring at adam
luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand
with his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it above the napkin
he brings the cup and napkin to his mouth
he takes a sip of espresso
a small fleeting expression forms on luigis impassive face as if for one millisecond he is going to vomit
his mouth opens and he allows the espresso to fall and dribble onto the napkin
he pushes any remaining espresso in his mouth out with his tongue
he holds it in that position for a moment
luigi castigliane stands up
that was a highly recommended
thats considered one of the finest espressos in the world sir
luigi just stands there
a small thread on his left suit jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back into the fabric
vincenzo closes his briefcase takes out a hankerchief and cleans his nose then stands placing the handkerchief back in his pocket
wait a minute
whats going on here
vincenzo just stares toward adam as if hes not even there
theres no way that girl is in my movie
that is the girl
the castigliane brothers begin to leave
adam stands up trembling with anger
that girl is not in my film
it is no longer your film
adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in
the castigliane brothers leave
as the big blonde wood doors close behind them adam starts to boil
screaming youd better fix this ray
ill speak to someone
turning to his manager and youd better speak to someone too
or find yourself another client
this smells like a set up to me
back to ray and by the way ray i dont know who these guys are kidding but every foot of film ive shot is in a vault at the lab
that only i can access
no ones getting that film
this is a catastrophe
turning toward ray you told me they might insist on a girl thats all
why didnt you tell me robert
thats what i mean
you set me up
i woulda never come here
standing im leaving
im a director you dont want to lose
you guys better fix this
adam storms out of the room
i didnt know that was going to happen
adam exits the building carrying his iron
an attendant takes his valet parking ticket
while adam still fuming waits for his car he notices the big limo standing off to one side
he stares at the car and the huge limo driver leaning up against the front drivers side door
adams car arrives a late model porsche
before adam gets into his car he addresses the attendant
did the castigliane brothers get out of that limo
they two guys in dark suits
adam nods and walks over to the limo
the limo driver eyes him and his iron suspiciously
adam raises his iron and smashes out the limos windshield
he whacks two big dents in the hood then smashes out a headlight
the limo driver starts towards him
adam laughs runs to his car and takes off
betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living room
a half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the coffee table next to her
she is talking on the phone
no grandpa you wouldnt believe it
its more beautiful than i ever dreamed
no she left me a lot of food
the refrigerators full

betty hangs up the phone takes a big bite of her sandwich and lays flat out on the couch chewing and smiling up at the ceiling
she suddenly remembers rita and her promise to look in on her
she gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom
rita is still asleep when she enters
she leans down and finds rita breathing normally
she feels her forehead
satisfied that all is well betty quietly leaves the bedroom
betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself a cup of coffee
she takes the coffee outside to the courtyard to a white metal table just outside her doorway
she sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun
across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in one of the apartments
she drinks her coffee and listens to the music
some birds fly by overhead
she takes another sip of coffee
the blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in tempo and volume
the phone inside rings
betty takes her coffee back into the living room shutting the door behind her
she crosses to the leather couch and picks up the phone
betty contd hello

goodbye aunt ruth
betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone
she sits for a moment listening
silently she stands and moves toward the bedroom
as she approaches the bedroom door she stops at something she sees
rita is sitting on the edge of the bed crying quietly
betty goes into the bedroom
rita looks up at her with desperation
betty contd youre awake
i think i misunderstood you
i thought you knew my aunt and thats why you were here
i just talked to my aunt on the phone and she wants me to call the police
rita starts crying harder bows down covering her face with her hands
betty contd rita
crying harder im
bettys heart softens
what is it rita
still sobbing im
i thought when i woke up
i thought sleep would do it
betty kneels down in front of her
crying i dont know who i am
what do you mean
crying im not
i dont know what my name is
i dont know who i am
betty looks down at the purse next to ritas dress
she picks it up and hands it to rita
this is your purse
your name must be in your purse
rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation
something is worrying her
she looks at betty for help
betty contd you want to know dont you
rita slowly unzips the purse
the pressure of its contents force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to be
cash in hundred dollar bills
both rita and betty almost stop breathing
they look at each other then back to the money
rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets it on the bed
she reaches back inside and comes up with the only other remaining item in the purse
a blue key
betty sees ritas expression change to a kind of horror note this blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and does not look like a door key
ray crosses a carpeted closed area
he mounts a flight of stairs
at the top of the stairs theres a plain blonde wood door
ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it
the door opens automatically
ray passes through and goes down a narrow hall
at the end of the hall there is a small elevator
again ray punches in a code
the elevator opens and ray goes in
the elevator door closes but the elevator does not move
finally a womans voice comes through a speaker
who is it please
the elevator begins to move up
when it stops the door opens and ray walks into a windowless reception area where a beautiful italian woman sits behind a large blonde modern built in desk
very quietly you may go right in ray
ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits
the receptionist pushes a button behind her desk chimes sound as the double doors open to an enormous office with no windows
heavy rich brown curtains line the walls
ray enters and the doors close behind him
ray takes a few steps forward then stops
there is a solid glass wall that we now notice running the width of the office
cut into the glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus
beyond the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a very plain blonde wood modern yet not motorized wheelchair
the man is paralyzed except for his right hand and head
his head appears small in relation to the size of his body
his suit is immaculate and one of the finest weve ever seen
his manservant stands in the shadows behind him
good afternoon mr
roque stares at ray silently
ray contd do you want him replaced
roque continues to stare
i know they said
i guess its so
alright but that means we should
shut everything down
is that something that
do you want us to shut everything down
ray doesnt know what to do
he struggles to interpret mr
roque does nothing but stare
ray contd then well shut everything down
the doors open as he approaches them and he leaves the room
the doors close
vincenzo and luigi are staring silently and without expression at the broken windshield of the limousine
the limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering the driveway to the building
he turns to the castigliane brothers
the other car is here sirs
please allow me
the limo driver opens the rear door of the new limo then hurries around and opens the other rear door
the new driver gets out of the car
limo driver contd heres the key to the car
take it straight to the garage
theyre waiting for you
the limo driver closes both back doors after the castigliane brothers are seated within
he then gets in himself and maneuvers the big limo out into traffic
two guys joe the guy who killed ed in the sixth floor office and billy another unkept rocker type delivery man are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a
girl laney who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor health
her hair is long and stringy
shes wearing a tight short sleeve blue sweater black jeans and boots

no no no i told you
theyre all real happy

billy contd can we eat in the van

the three make their way to the van
joe looks over at laney
joe contd you sure you dont want anything

as laney is getting her cigarette and lighting it
joe contd any new girls on the street these days

youll keep your eyes open for me wont you baby
joe spanks her butt as she gets in the van
you bet you will
roque in his wheelchair is still in the center of the huge softly lit windowless office
his manservant standing silently behind him
the small built in wheelchair phone rings
roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote device he holds in his right hand
a slender streamlined microphone rises from the arm of the chair
he listens through a high tech earplant which we now see
roque contd thank you
he pushes two buttons one after another on the remote device
we hear a small click a dial tone a number being dialed and a phone ringing
we see the back of a mans head and just over his shoulder we see the top of the phone which is ringing
the man picks up the phone and brings the receiver to his ear
shes still missing
we hear a small click and the line goes dead
roque pushes a button and the microphone descends back into the chair
again we see the back of the mans head
hes dialing a new number
he brings the receiver to his ear
we hear a phone ringing we hear a click the phone being answered
we see only a black rotary wall phone and a portion of a greasy filthy kitchen the receiver has already been lifted off the phone and we see only the
cord extending to someone off screen
off screen talk to me
again we see only the back of the mans head
a mans hairy arm enters frame and the receiver is placed back on the phone then immediately picked back up and with the receiver held in the hand the hairy
man dials a new number
part way through the dialing
the surface of this table is high gloss ultra smooth material
a very modern phone sits on this table and begins to ring softly
a hand enters frame a womans hand
the skin is pale white almost translucent
the fingers are long and seem slightly too large
at the ends of the fingers and thumb are stretched tapered high gloss red fingernails which slightly curve downward
the forefinger of the hand presses a button on the phone
a small tone sounds followed by a very modern sounding coded signal
aunt ruths apartment day we pull back from ritas face until we see that betty and rita are sitting on the leather couch about four feet apart staring at the
they just sit this way for awhile
what do you think about then
well what do you think about
what do you mean
if you dont remember anything i mean what goes through your mind then if you dont remember anything
i do remember the car crash
i told you
i remember the glass
i think about that sometimes
i remember walking here sort of
now i remember this place and you
thats about it
how do you remember how to talk
i dont know
you dont remember anything else
no she covers her eyes with her hands there is something
something there i cant tell
i cant describe it
struggling to figure it out to express it there are things there
betty thinks about what rita has said
somehow it seems to make sense to her
you dont know where it came from
when you think about them
does it make you remember anything
i dont know about the money
it makes me feel
a car a late model generic sedan is moving toward us
two men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving slowly
as they go each man is scanning sidewalks buildings passing cars as if hunting for someone
they pass by us and as we turn we leave them and pick up adam driving in the opposite direction in the other lane
we stay with adam
adam drives his porsche up a palm lined street
the voice activated phone connects the line to adams office
a secretary answers
adam keshers office
shes on the set
ill connect you mr
another ringing sound then a voice
paul i have mr
kesher for cynthia

adam listens to dead silence for a moment or two then cynthia speaks
adam where are you

adam this isnt like you

there must be something we can do
im going home
ill call you later
the girls are still sitting on the leather couch as before but now silently off in their own worlds
after a moment
i wonder where you were going
bettys question hangs in the air
slowly we move close to rita who is on the verge of remembering something
suddenly mulholland drive
thats where i was going
maybe thats where the accident was
there must be a police report
we could call
we could call anonymously from a pay phone
just to see if there was an accident
rita sits worrying
betty contd come on
itll be just like in the movies
well pretend to be someone else
i want to walk around anyway
im in hollywood and i havent even seen any of it
come on rita
do you feel up to it
just to see
just to see if there was an accident on mulholland drive
lets find you something to wear
betty laughs as she holds one of ruths dresses in front of rita
my aunt dresses like miss marple
off a blank stare from rita shes kind of a frumpy woman detective in british movies
rita laughs along with betty
betty goes back in the closet
betty contd heres something okay
she brings out a pair of khaki pants
betty contd try these on
you can wear one of my t shirts with it and it wont look bad with those sandals
adam pulls into his driveway but is blocked from entering the garage by a poolmans truck
he gets out of the car and looks at the truck sees the insignia on the door which is a blue square with the word gene above and the word
adam hears steps behind him and turns
a japanese gardener is coming toward him smiling and bowing
you remember me
i am taka
for long time i not see you
i pleased to see you
taka reaches out his hand and adam shakes it
its cause im never home in the day time
its good to see you again
the garden looks great
taka bows smiling and nodding and goes back to work
adam heads toward the front door of his house
adam enters puts his iron in his golf bag just inside the door then looks around
he can see the pool through a wall of plate glass windows but there is no one visible poolside
calling out lorraine
then louder lorraine
he hears a noise something falling
he walks in the direction of the noise
it leads him to his bedroom
his expression darkens as he approaches the closed door
he hears voices as he throws the door open
lorraine and the poolman gene are in bed
now youve done it
just forget you ever saw it
its better that way
what the hell are you even doing here
adam stands stunned for a moment
then finds himself walking over to the dresser and opening the top drawer
he removes a large case
lorraine contd what are you doing
adam starts walking out of the bedroom with the case
lorraine contd adam leaves the bedroom and starts through the house
he goes into the kitchen and looks around numb but trying to think
lorraine is getting dressed as fast as she can
hes probably upset lorraine
adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage
he turns on the light and looks around
he spots some paint cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen
he can hear lorraine calling his name
she seems to be coming closer
he sets the jewelry case and the paint can on the floor kneels down and opens the paint can with his car key
just as lorraine enters the kitchen he opens the jewelry box and empties the full gallon can of hot pink paint into her jewelry case
he puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them about
lorraine rushes toward him
lorraine contd lorraine grabs hold of him
starts pulling his hair slapping his face
she tears his jacket
adam stands all at once and with his wet hot pink hands he pushes lorraine and slams her into the kitchen counter just as gene the poolman enters
gene grabs ahold of adam cocks back and slams his huge suntanned fist into adams face
thats not a way to treat your wife buddy
i dont care what shes done
adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries to hit gene
gene blocks his punch and slams adam again knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and spills the jewelry case
adam now covered with paint is picked up by gene and thrown out toward the front door
throw him out
lorraine opens the front door while gene picks adam up moves him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn
lorraine slams the door behind him
adam picks himself up severely dazed and bleeding pretty badly he heads for his car
taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at adam as he gets into his car
adam drives away pink paint and red blood all over
rita is now dressed to go out and is studying herself in a mirror
she turns and her gaze falls to her purse
she picks it up and looks questioningly at betty
betty contd no
you shouldnt take that
lets hide it
they look around the room
theres a hatbox in the closet above the clothes rack
betty brings it down takes out the hat and rita puts the purse inside
betty puts the hat over the purse in the hatbox and puts in back in the closet
betty puts out her hand
rita looks at it for a moment smiles and they shake
all dressed now betty and rita leave aunt ruths apartment and walk across the courtyard past cocos apartment and out through the iron gates
no one is about
betty and rita walk along
birds are chirping in the trees which line both sides of the street
betty is smiling and once again looking around at everything
her good mood and excitement about life lifts ritas spirits
coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people a middle aged woman and a young boy around years old
the boy is very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking awkwardly on crutches
as the two groups pass each other on the sidewalk betty is struck deeply by the boys brilliant luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with wisdom
after they pass each other betty turns back and sees the boy and the woman enter havenhurst
betty and rita continue up the street
the girls walk along the busy boulevard past guitar shops video stores
betty is looking for a payphone
ritas eyes dart back and forth nervously
shes beginning to feel frightened
we see the red brick building
it is dennys
betty and rita are walking to the payphone
betty digs out some change from her purse
she picks up the receiver drops in a quarter and dials the for operator
an operator answers
hollywood police department please
is this an emergency
no no i just want the number
hold for the number
betty gets the number for the hollywood police station re deposits the quarter and dials
hollywood police department im inquiring about an accident that happened last night on mulholland drive
ill connect you to traffic
sergeant baxter speaking
well i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive
yes there was
can you tell me what happened
was anyone hurt
may i have your name please
betty hangs up
she turns to rita smiling like a girl whos done something bad and gotten away with it
there was an accident
he wouldnt tell me anything else but that was your accident rita
i just know it was
maybe theres something about it in the papers
come on ill buy you a cup of coffee and we can see
betty and rita enter dennys
rita and betty are seated next to the table where dan and herb sat earlier in the day
they both have a cup of coffee in front of them
betty has a newspaper open and she is scanning the last pages
betty contd maybe it happened so late its not going to be in todays paper
not that i can see
the same waitress diane comes up to the girls table and freshens up their coffee
betty looks up and smiles sees dianes nameplate
betty contd thank you
rita shoots a look from betty to diane to the nameplate
close up nameplate the word diane is huge from ritas pov
back to scene diane finishes pouring ritas cup and smiles at betty
will that be all
you want your check
just the coffee
rita you want something
still staring at the nameplate thinking no
just the coffee
well take our check
diane searches through her many checks to find betty and ritas
the manager of dennys standing with a woman in a blue dress calls dianes name
diane turns and looks to the manager and the woman
a fleeting fear goes through her eyes
she surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes out a mont blanc fountain pen which she puts under bettys check as she places it on their table
she does this very quickly but betty notices this and diane notices betty noticing
diane walks quickly over to the manager and the woman in the blue dress
betty turns and watches a heated conversation that she cant hear but she sees the woman in the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then leaving
the manager says something to diane and diane turns her pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the manager showing him her innocence
he waves her off and she goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food
betty stops watching and turns her attention to rita who is tense and lost in a thought
betty contd what is it rita
without moving a muscle shhhh
at that moment diane the waitress reappears at their table
diane looks betty in the eye and while looking at betty her left hand slides the mont blanc out from under the check and back into her pocket
come in again
betty holds her gaze
relieved diane leaves and goes about her business
betty looks over at rita waiting for her to tell her something
rita slowly turns and focuses on betty
i remember something
i remember something
betty and rita are walking back to the apartment
we see them from a distance
they are talking and gesturing in an excited and animated way
just after they enter through the iron gates of havenhurst and are out of sight we notice a car moving slowly up havenhurst toward us
we notice two men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for something
the door slams shut
rita grabs bettys shoulders
diane selwyn maybe its my name
betty and rita are sitting next to each other on the leather couch
betty is rifling through the phone book
she finds the listings for selwyn
her finger drifts down and finds d
selwyn followed by an address and phone number
it is the only selwyn with a d
she hands the phone to rita
strange to be calling yourself
maybe its not me
call the number
betty reads the number off and rita pushes the corresponding buttons
each tone seems to be louder than the last
the ringing seems deafening
theres a click and the phone is answered by a machine
a womans voice is heard loudly
coming from answering machine hi
this is me
leave me a message
betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also straining to hear everything
the machine starts recording
betty hangs up the phone immediately
its not my voice
but i know her
maybe the voice isnt diane selwyn
maybe thats your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are
taka is bowing and smiling and nodding to someone we dont see
takas pov a man kenny in a sharp black suit is walking down the driveway past gene the poolmans truck to the front door of adams house
parked at the street is a big limo with vincenzo and luigi castigliane sitting in the back
kenny knocks on adams front door
lorraines hands are covered with pink paint
pink paint is on her face and clothes
she slams the door but kennys foot stops it and pushes it back with a force that shakes the wall as the door slams open once again
kenny enters the house
this is adam keshers house
like hell it is
gene comes out of the kitchen fast his hands covered with pink paint
i guess you dont understand english
she asked to leave
heres the door
gene grabs hold of kenny and starts to push him out the door
kenny rabbit punches gene in the nose with lightning speed his fist like a sledgehammer
gene goes down
lorraine shrieks and leaps on kenny
her long fingernails going for his eyes
kenny slaps lorraine hard
the shriek stops instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet
gene is back up and going for kenny
kenny gets three punches in on genes head before gene hits the ground unconscious
kenny rubs some pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off his jacket
he begins walking around the house calling out for adam
he sees nothing and hears nothing
he goes back to the front door and sees adams golf clubs sitting there
kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club
as he snaps each club we see lorraine and gene remain out cold on the floor
and in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box spilling out onto the kitchen floor
finishing his work with the vintage golf clubs kenny leaves
kenny jumps into the front seat of the limo
vincenzo and luigi nod to the driver and they take off
taka hoes some weeds beneath a jacaranda
night descends on los angeles
millions of lights down below twinkle like stars
we see the courtyard at night
some of the apartment windows have dim warm lights
most all is in darkness
the only sound is the water flowing in the fountain with muted distant traffic
far away a siren wails softly
betty and rita are on their hands and knees around the coffee table
a map of l
is unfolded and betty is running her finger along a street
her finger stops
its right about here on sierra bonita
thats not too far away
an older beautiful woman drunk is walking slowly strangely toward the door of aunt ruths apartment
whats wrong with that
im not sure about this
i know youre afraid of something
well be careful
tomorrow well go over there and well find out
the woman moves up to the door we see her face
her eyes have the eerie look of one possessed
she knocks mechanically on the door
betty and rita both turn with alarm
betty gets up stares at the door then at rita
rita waits not knowing what to do
itll be okay
betty opens the door
betty finds the face of the actress louise bonner staring questioningly at her
betty contd yes

where have you been coco

coco takes louise back through the darkness of the courtyard
betty closes the door and turns
she catches ritas look
rita is staring at her horrified
establish a hotel manager is walking toward the door of room
he knocks softly on the door
the door opens and adam kesher is standing there still beaten looking with remnants of pink paint
what is it
im sorry mr
kesher but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card
the fact is mr
kesher a representative of your bank called us
howd they know i was here
i dont know
all we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files

adam taking out his wallet
i dont know whats going on
thats so much baloney
ive got enough cash for one night okay
thats fine mr
you can pay cash when you check out
it was my duty to inform you
ill check out in the morning

the hotel manager turns to leave and adam closes the door
adam crosses the room to the phone and dials a number
the phone is answered
someones shut off my money
where are you adam
what do you mean you know
someone called me
when they couldnt get you they told me you were as good as broke
i didnt believe then so i made some calls
but im not broke
i know but youre broke
where are you
beverly hills hotel
ive got enough cash in my pocket for one night
do you know somebody called the the cowboy
yeah the cowboy
this guy the cowboy wants to see you
jason said he thought it would be a good idea
oh jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the cowboy
should i wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters
something tells me this guy is connected with whats happening adam and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away
whats going on
its been a very strange day
and getting stranger
where do i meet this cowboy
i mean do i have to ride out to the range
sort of funny boy
if i tell him the meetings on youre to go to the top of beachwood canyon
theres a corral up there where hell be
you gotta be kidding
will you meet with him
it is that kind of a day
ill call him then call you back
if you want you could stay at my place
that would not be a good idea
im just offering a place to stay
i understand cynthia and thank you for the offer
ill find a place
now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me
okay but you dont know what youre missing
git along little dowgie and call me back
adam hangs up and seems to sag cupping his forehead and eyes with his hand
adam in his porsche makes his way up the canyon
adam feeling like a fool drives up the dark winding canyon road
as he nears the top of the canyon the residential area gives way to desert brush
the road winds steeply up to a dark dead end where an old barn and stable sit
adam parks in a little dirt lot and walk up past the barn to the corral
his eyes grow accustomed to the dark and he
no one is around
theres only a light wind and a few twinkling stars in the sky above
suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from the corral gate flare up
adam hears a noise in the brightness and turns
there walking toward him into the light is the cowboy dressed in clean blue denim jeans well oiled unscuffed beautifully engraved cowboy boots a red embroidered ivory buttoned cowboy shirt
complete with string tie
atop the cowboys head is a x white stetson
the cowboy is smiling warmly as he approaches
he stops in front of adam and begins to speak with a true slow western drawl
howdy to you
sure want to thank ya for drivin all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel
whats on your mind
well now heres a man who wants to get right to it
kinda anxious to get to it are ya
a mans attitude
a mans attitude goes some ways toward how a mans life will be
is that somethin you agree with
did you answer cause you thought thats what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right
i agree with what you said
what did i say
that a mans attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be
so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life
well just stop for a little second and think about it
will ya do that for me
okay im thinking
youre too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin
now i want ya to think and quit bein such a smart aleck
can ya do that for me
wheres this going
what do you want me to do
theres sometimes a buggy
how many drivers does a buggy have
so lets just say im drivin this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me
now i know a few things
i know you have had a rough day
youre probably thinkin i dont know the half of it but in actual fact i know every part of it
the business of gittin thrown off your movie the heartache of seeing your wife with another man
losin access to that precious film vault
adam suddenly looks stunned unsure
cowboy contd realizin you dont have hardly a nickel to your name and then add on to that the sickenin feeling some men are gonna catch you and hurt you
bad for bustin their vehicle
some days are like that
they are rough but what will tomorrow bring
will it be better than today
a lot of that is up to us individually
up to us and our attitude
when the castigliane brothers said this is no longer your film they meant it but they didnt mean you were not going to direct it
i want you to go back to work tomorrow
you were re casting the lead actress anyway
audition many girls for the part
when you see the girl that was shown to you earlier today you will say this is the girl
the rest of the cast can stay that is up to you but that lead girl is not up to you
now you will see me one more time if you do good
you will see me two more times if you do bad
the cowboy turns and walks until he is engulfed in darkness
through the darkness adam hears the sound of a car door opening and closing then another opening and closing and then the sound of the car driving away
adam walks up in the direction the cowboy took but he sees no sign of a car nor any dust nor any road
he goes back down past the barn and stables to his car
there standing by his porsche is the cowboy
cowboy contd you thinkin thisll work out cause i was thinkin it just might
it will work out
good then but just in case that banks gonna stay closed a bit longer
you understand that
youre an understandin fella
so this is the last time i see you then unless i do bad
no this one doesnt count
its part of the original one
until we meet again
adam gets in his car and drives off leaving the cowboy smiling behind him
we see the rays of the rising sun falling on the huge letters of the hollywood sign and the hills surrounding it
we see ritas face as we hear betty off screen
youre still here
i came back
i thought thats what you wanted
we see betty
angrily nobody wants you here
moving back we realize that the girls are acting out bettys audition scene
rita is reading her lines
my parents are right upstairs
they think youve left
i can call them
i can call my dad
but you wont
youre playing a dangerous game here
if youre trying to blackmail me
its not going to work
you know what i want
its not that difficult
furious get out
get out before i call my dad
he trusts you
your his best friend
this will be the end of everything
what about you
what will your dad think about you
thats what you said from the beginning
if i tell what happened
theyll arrest you and put you in jail so get out of here before
betty pulls a table knife out from behind her back
before i kill you
then theyd put you in jail
betty mimes with moving fingers tears flowing from her eyes
cry cry cry and then i say with big emotion i hate you
i hate us both
betty drops the kitchen knife and both girls start laughing
betty contd such a lame scene
but you are really good
betty mimes tapping a cigarette in a cigarette holder ala dietrich
thank you dahling
on the move coco is just bringing her cigarette in its holder up to her painted red lips
the phone is ringing and shes crossing the room to answer it
into phone hello

ill go over and have a look around

coco puts down the receiver with a long sigh
betty and rita are sitting on the leather couch having some coffee
the front door to the apartment is open and sunlight is pouring in through the screen door
betty looks at her watch
oh no wonder im starving
im going to fix a sandwich
you want one
im all right
youve got to eat something
youre just nervous about going over to see if youre diane selwyn
rita just looks at her
betty starts for the kitchen
betty contd suit yourself
ill share mine with you if you change your mind
betty goes into the kitchen
suddenly theres a knock on the screen door and coco peers in seeing rita on the couch
rita looks up
who are you
betty comes out from the kitchen and sees the situation
can i see you outside a minute betty
betty walks past rita pats her on the shoulder and goes outside to see coco who has moved away to wait
the screen door slams
coco and betty face each other close out of earshot of rita
your aunt called me
i was afraid of that
she wants to know whos staying in her apartment
slowly deliberately its just for a night or two until she finds her own place
i tried to explain that to aunt ruth but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up
i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didnt know any ritas
sweetie look at me straight
betty lifts her eyes to cocos
shes very nice
we went to school together
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her
i met her in junior college and she was from this other town
coco looks hard into bettys innocent face
betty contd you can call my grandparents
im sure theyd tell you that i dont lie and i sure wouldnt allow a stranger to invade my aunt ruths apartment
i was married to a director for thirty years
he had an uncanny ability to read people
maybe some of it rubbed off on me or maybe i had it all along
youre a good kid
what youre telling me is a load of horse pucky but it comes from a good place
ill trust you to sort this out
now im not going against ruth
shes got enough to worry about up there in canada
if she asks im going to say everything is okay and you make sure it is
coco places her hand on bettys shoulder and squeezes it if you need any help you know where to find me
betty puts her hand on cocos shoulder and gives her a squeeze
youre really something coco
dont make me out to be a sucker
louise bonner says theres trouble in there
you remember last night
sometimes shes wrong but if there is trouble get rid of it
coco turns and walks away
betty studies her and thinks about what she said before turning and going back inside
betty enters through the screen door
rita studies her
is everything all right
is it bad for you that im here
slightly forcing a broad smile everything is a okay but ive gotta get that sandwich
on her way to the kitchen she checks her watch
betty contd and ive got an audition in one hour
detective neal domgaard throws two wallets down on the desk in front of detective harry mcknight
harry pauses in the middle of a large bite of grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato
he looks down and studies the wallets

betty is coming out of aunt ruths apartment
she calls back in to rita
i hope im back in a couple of hours
dont drink all the coke
we hear laughter from inside and rita call out
when i get back ill have the cab waiting so be ready to go
betty closes the door and heads across the courtyard
she knocks on cocos door and in a moment coco answers
sorry to trouble you coco
its all right gorgeous
im on my way to my audition
before i go i wanted to ask you if you could remember the mans name
aunt ruthies friend who helped put this together
it completely went out of my mind

itd be so embarrassing naw
he wouldnt have cared
just give him a good performance and hell be happy and ive got a feeling youll do just that
ill let you know
you dont want to be late
good luck honey
betty takes off through the iron gates and coco smiles as she watches her go
betty is wide eyed and filled with awe at something she is seeing
the cab pulls up to the gate
betty pays the driver and gets out
she stands for a moment staring at a dream
she walks through the gate and as she goes is stopped by a and where do we think were going miss
betty stops and turns
to my audition
and who are we auditioning for today
and do we know which of the fifty seven buildings wally brown is in
smiling no we dont
well now weve got to figure that out first dont we
wallace brown is in the executive building on the second floor
we want to go in and turn right at the first street
then we want to walk three blocks down past stage to the white executive building
once were on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there
now do we have name
lets see if we have a pass for betty elms
and we do
here we go
and good luck miss
thank you very much
betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the receptionist
she hands over her pass
the receptionist looks at it hands it back to betty and points down the hall to her left
number on the left
betty walks down the long corridor past several offices
the door to office is open when she arrives and she enters a large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one side
may i help you
my name is betty elms
im here to audition for
have a seat and ill get mr
the receptionist stands walks to a door knocks twice then enters
she closes the door behind her and betty is alone in the sitting room
she sits on a couch and looks at the old movie posters covering all four walls
in a moment the same door opens again and an elderly distinguished looking gentleman wally brown comes out smiling
betty stands up immediately
im wally brown
your aunt is a very dear friend of mine so its particularly nice to meet you
very pleased to meet you
id like you to meet everyone
as they walk into wallys office
wally contd i took the liberty of inviting an extra person to see your audition
she saw your resume picture and was very interested in meeting you
inside wallys office several people rise out of chairs when wally enters with betty
wally contd betty elms this is jack taft my assistant jimmy katz who weve already cast for the part of chuck
hell be doing the scene with you
this is julie chadwick and bob brooker the director and our surprise guest is sarah james
we couldnt afford her to cast our picture but as casting agents go shes the best
why thank you wally
she and betty shake hands
pleased to meet you
this is nicki my assistant
nicki a very stylish thin girl with black cat eyed glasses nods coolly to betty
and this is martha martha johnson who you met out front
betty nervously smiles to the room
shall we get to it
would you like a water or a coffee before we begin
bettys hands are beginning to sweat
no no im fine
well then take a seat everyone
betty why dont you join jimmy and well play the scene
is there anything youd like to say bob
something to betty before they begin
betty stops on her way across to jimmy and looks to bob the director
its not a contest see the two of them with themselves so dont play it for real until it gets real
betty doesnt know what to say
she catches sarahs assistant nicki rolling her eyes
betty continues walking toward jimmy who opens his arms to her as she approaches
hes old enough to be her father
just tell me where it hurts baby
i want to play this one close bob
like it was with that girl whats her name with the black hair
that felt good
betty looks from jimmy to bob
thatd be good jimmy
just dont rush that line again
i told you
the line where you say before what
i was playin off em
they say theyll arrest you
and stuff like that
put you in jail
they say it like that
they all say it the same way so i react like that
jimmy turns to betty
jimmy contd look
whats your name
you dont rush it
i dont rush it
we play it close just like in the movies
jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around betty and brings her in against his pot belly
jimmy contd dads best friend goes to work
jimmy smiles as he brings betty a little closer
she is trying to concentrate through the nervousness and jimmys breath
there is a silence as jimmy looks her in the eyes
everyone in the room is looking betty in the eyes
betty and jimmy start the scene
it is very difficult for betty as jimmy has her in an absurd clench now
youre still here
i came back
i thought thats what you wanted
jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile
he gives the last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear
nobody wants you here
betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from jimmy
jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist
betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground
my parents are right upstairs
they think youve left
jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward betty
betty pushes him back
i can call them
i can call my dad
but you wont
he grabs betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him
he puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and keeps going down her hips
he jerks his hand back
betty looks down and sees jimmys hand hovering above her thigh
betty takes her hand and gently presses down on jimmys hand
she slowly looks up with the most seductive smile
jimmy lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh and squeezes her thigh as he sees her smile
with his other hand jimmy gently pulls her closer
something has started coming over betty and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way
shes surprising herself
almost a hot whisper youre playing a dangerous game here
if youre trying to blackmail me
its not going to work
jimmy now surprises himself
he becomes almost tender and genuinely worked up from the heat coming off betty
you know what i want
its not that difficult
where the scene should turn to anger from betty it cant now and betty plays it as she feels it
she stays in very close to jimmy looking him right in the eyes
whispering desperately slowly get out
get out before i call my dad
he trusts you
youre his best friend
her arms go around him this will be the end of everything
jimmy gets lost
he doesnt know where he is anymore
he can only see bettys eyes
what about you
what will your dad think about you
betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper
lost in heat
thats what you said from the beginning
if i tell what happened
theyll arrest you and put you in jail so get out of here before
caught by her transfixing sultry eyes and almost breathless
he finds himself taking an extra long pause before what
as scripted betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her back but wraps the knife around behind jimmy and pulls him into a kiss
as she kisses him whispers before i kill you
jimmy panics and pushes betty away with his hands on her shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance
he finally is able to say his line
then theyd put you in jail
as scripted betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy for her to do this because shes ashamed at how the sex of the scene took her
tears begin running down her cheeks
she backs away
i hate you
i hate us both
she pretends to drop the knife
the scene ends
everyone in the room has become mesmerized by betty but they soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the performance
sarah turns to nicki
im going to take her over there
to everyone wow
betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling still shocked at herself
well there it was
there it was it was
baby you got a way
i mean it was forced maybe but still humanistic
yeah very good really
well thank you betty and i mean that
that was very impressive
youve done your aunt proud and im going to tell her the first chance i get
well speak again soon im sure and thank you so much for coming in
well thank you
betty doesnt quite know what to do
she moves to the center of the room and just stands
remnants of the scene still staying with her
sarah stands and nicki stands just after
thank you wally
im sure you all have a lot to talk about
well walk betty out
well yes indeed
our pleasure sarah and dont you be a stranger
wed love to see you around here again real soon
well come along betty
sarah takes bettys hand and they go to the door
betty turns back once more and smiles
thank you again mr
it was nice meeting all of you
everyone nods and waves and betty is taken out by sarah and nicki
the three of them walk down the corridor
oh god that was awful
bettys head spins to sarah
a look of shock and let down on her face
sarah james contd oh not you betty
you were stellar and i mean that but poor wally
hell never get that picture made
wallys days were up twenty years ago
sickening little laugh how about that jimmy katz
jimmy katz never had a day
jimmy katz never had a minute
betty finds herself getting a little upset
they seem very nice to me and wally
brown is a very close friend of my aunts so
settle down betty
dont get me wrong
i love wally
i ought to
i was married to him for ten years
betty does another shocked head turn
sarah james contd and i love actors all actors jimmy katz included
we just get a little catty sometimes
now we want to take you across the way and introduce you to a director whos a head above the rest
hes got a project that you would kill
at the word kill betty turns to her once again with a questioning look
sarah james contd knock it right out of the park
we see what looks like a recording studio right out of the s
were looking through a plate of glass
a blonde girl is standing at a vintage microphone
behind her are three back up male vocalists dressed in three tone shiny s suits
we hear strings soar up and the blonde girl begins to sing sixteen reasons by connie stevens
the male vocalists backing her up flawlessly
we move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound stage
a screen test is being shot of the girl and as we continue moving back we see the director adam kesher surrounded by his crew
behind them there are many people standing eating watching working
the stage is full and bustling
the song plays loudly over
sarah and nicki bring betty into this scene through a giant stage door
a guard mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set
the song continues to play over
as sarah leads betty up close adam turns and his eyes fall on the beautiful face of betty elms
sensing something betty turns and sees adam
they each seem to feel the thrill of the thunderbolt but each embarrassed to stare longer than they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the song
calling out through an electronic megaphone cut it
he gets out of his chair and walks into the set up to the blonde girl
he shakes her hand
adam contd thank you very much carol
it was really great of you to come in
i know how busy you are
oh man are you kidding
i love this script
where do i sign
i love you but theres no way theyre gonna let me cast this thing until ive seen everyone
ill let you know as soon as i can
i know you will
cause my managers gonna bug you day and night
itll be my pleasure
now get out of here
oh youre just so cruel
dont forget me
im the girl thats going to play this part
lightly pinching her cheek see ya later
adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor
he looks around
he sees betty being introduced by sarah to some of the studio executives
he goes over to his assistant director and looks down at the mans notepad
adam contd whos next hank
adam wonders worries
is she ready
bring her out
hank speaks into his walkie talkie headset
the sound of his voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage
through walkie talkie camilla rhodes next
adam looks up a beautiful blonde steps into the set in front of the microphone
it is the girl
the back up singers step in behind her
adam nods to hank
hank contd turn over
the cameraman calls out speed
through megaphone playback
countdown before the music begins
adam contd the strings soar up and camilla rhodes begins to sing
on the set betty hears the song again and turns and watches
once again her eyes find adam as his eyes are finding hers
this time adam turns away
he watches camilla for a moment
she is passable but not spectacular
adam reaches out and pulls hank over to him
get jason over here
hank gets on his walkie talkie
adam wants to see jason
adam continues to watch camilla rhodes sing
jason goldwyn a tall sixty year old silver haired man comes through the crowd and stops at adams side
he looks down at adam but adam continues watching camilla rhodes
jason follows adams gaze and he watches camilla sing then turns back to adam
adam slowly looks up right into jasons eyes wondering how much jason knows but jasons face doesnt give away a thing
did you want to tell me something adam
this is the girl
at that moment ray having overheard comes to jasons side
he smiles at adam
excellent choice adam
adam is sick with himself
across the room betty panics when she looks at her watch
i have to be somewhere
i promised a friend
she quickly shakes sarahs and nickis hands saying im sorry im sorry and runs off like cinderella
adam turns and sees her running off out of his world
chris isaaks song except the new girl segues in over connie stevens and plays as adam sarah and nicki watch betty disappear out the sound stage door
chris isaak song except the new girl continues
an idling cab sits waiting with back door open
chris isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone
betty and rita come out of aunt ruths apartment
betty is laughing pulling on rita
theres nothing to be afraid of
across the courtyard cornell dumont a strikingly handsome young black musician is on his balcony playing the saxophone
he stops playing when he sees the girls
he stands and looks as if recognizing someone
betty and rita stop and look up shielding their eyes from the sun
cornell dumont contd hey hows sol
to rita im sorry
i forget your name
almost inaudible rita
well i havent seen sol lately
tell him to come by the club
biting her lip
cornell smiles and picks up his sax
and whats your name
big smile cornell dumont
he begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup
whispering ask him who sol is
rita hurriedly starts for the gate
betty contd maybe he could help
betty follows rita through the gate to the waiting cab
they get in and the cab pulls away
betty reaches and gently grabs ritas shoulder
she speaks firmly but quietly so the cab driver wont hear
why didnt you ask him
sol knows you
whispering back but i dont know sol
i never heard of sol
id just get in trouble
thats why we shouldnt go see about diane selwyn
its better not to get in trouble
youre not going to get in trouble
youre going to find out who you are
finding out who you are gets you out of trouble
rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and doubt all over again
betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand
she turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides of the street
it should be around here
rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up sierra bonita
they near a modern apartment compound of bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and vegetation
a smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex
betty contd points thats it
nudging rita does it look familiar
rita shakes her head
rita is looking at a black car parked down the street facing
she discerns two men sitting in the front
what is it
what do you see
quietly frantic those men in front in the car
do you know them
to driver keep going
go around to the back
betty gets rita out of the cab and pays the driver who then drives away
the girls go through a rear gate and enter the complex walking along a curving concrete walk
this leads them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a rough hewn wooden plaque
they scan the list
they both look around the various doors near them
betty spots a sign which says behind an arrow bungalows through
betty contd its this way
they set off down another sidewalk toward bungalow
as they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a chainlink service gate to the alley
standing in the alley is a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses
both girls dive for the bushes
the man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and motion
both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay as still and quiet as possible
betty contd panting whisper now youve got me scared
peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in their direction
suddenly he turns and smiles at something to his left
he hurries off but soon returns carrying two heavy suitcases followed by an older woman in a yellow dress
both betty and rita crawl further forward
they see the limo and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary limousine driver just going about his work
the girls stand up relieved and a little embarrassed
betty contd see i told you there was nothing to be afraid of
they go up to bungalow and stand for a moment facing the front door
betty doesnt listen to rita
she knocks strongly on the door
they stand waiting
theres no answer so betty knocks again harder
rita contd no ones
suddenly the door opens
an attractive middle aged woman stands before them
but it said
i switched apartments with her
just walk down that way
its just to the right
the woman seems to be looking now at rita
middle aged woman contd its kind of hidden by the foliage
betty and rita start to leave
middle aged woman contd she hasnt been around for a few days
well leave her a note
starting toward them ill go with you
shes still got some of my stuff
the phone rings from inside her bungalow
middle aged woman contd turning back oh
ive got to get that
the woman hurries back inside and closes the door
betty and rita quickly move up the walkway toward bungalow
i guess youre not diane
rita still fighting her fear doesnt answer
they reach bungalow
its set back beneath tall bushes and an old eucalyptus tree
the front door is in deep shadow
without even looking at rita betty knocks quickly
theres no answer
she knocks again
betty contd still not home i guess
the girls drift off to the side of the bungalow
betty tries to see in the windows
she tries a window and to her surprise it opens
i dont think
looking around for anyone watching cmon help me in
ill open the front door
betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding her head through the open window
rita reluctantly pushes and betty is in
as she closes the window
betty contd meet you at the door
rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as betty opens it
betty has her hand over her mouth and nose
betty contd i dont know if you want to come in here or not
theres some kind of horrible smell like
rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she reacts to the smell
betty begins to go through the bungalow and rita follows
all the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn
they move slowly looking around at everything as they go
betty looks to rita to see if any of this is something she remembers
rita looks as though shes walking in a trance
through the half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor
the middle aged woman is just shutting the door to her bungalow
she walks quickly in the direction of bungalow
betty and rita are moving down the corridor
they pass a small room and look in at a couch wardrobe and make up table
they move on down the corridor to a door which is almost closed
betty touches the door and it seems to swing open on its own
they enter the room and stop cold
a scream starts to build inside rita
before them is a dead woman lying on a bed
great chunks of mattress are standing upright having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts
a dried sea of blood surrounds the bloated gray body of the woman
the scream comes out of rita as a force propelling her to look closer
betty lunges after rita her eyes also not able to leave the sight
she covers ritas mouth with her hand and brings her close
the scream is stifled by bettys hand
in the silence that follows knocking can be heard
betty freezes and keeps rita quiet with her hand still placed over her mouth but she cant stop ritas violent shaking nor the horror in her eyes
the middle aged woman backs away from the front door looking around at bungalow
shes not sure if she has heard something or not
she wonders then turns and goes back to her bungalow
just as she has disappeared the door to bungalow flies open and rita followed closely behind by betty runs with a look of horror directly toward us until her tortured
face fills the screen
sounds churning music
sounds music churning continues
great sobs almost hysterical wrack ritas body as she bends over the sink scissoring into her long dark hair with a frenzy
there is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep through many strands of hair
bettys is rushing to her her hands reach tenderly but firmly for ritas hand holding the scissors
she keeps her from cutting and moves closer whispering in ritas ear
rita cant stop crying but lets betty hold her
i know what youre doing
through uncontrollable sobs what
i know what you have to do but let me do it
rita turns and looks up at betty her eyes red with crying
betty pulls her up facing her
rita lets betty take the scissors
they look into each others eyes
betty gently strokes ritas cheek wiping away some tears
betty contd let me do it
panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various open bottles used q tips towels combs a brush a bowl and lots of long strands of cut black hair
we continue moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds
the reflection of the new rita moves into the mirror
she has short beautiful blonde hair blonde eyebrows and no make up
bettys reflection comes in beside ritas
they stare at the new rita in the mirror
quietly with assurance you look like someone else
we move off the door of aunt ruths apartment and crane slowly up to the apartment above hers wilkins the one with the wayward dog
we move closer to wilkins apartment and as we move in we hear a phone ringing
wilkins still in his pajamas bathrobe and slippers from morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching ottoman surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups
his jack russell terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the phone ringing on a side table next to wilkins
wilkins comes out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs his hand through strange matted tufts of dirty blonde hair
hows it going
no its okay
yeah im working but
they wanted this script a week ago
whats wrong with your house
sure you can have the couch
no its no problem
its just i gotta
i gotta work
any chance you could bring some food
no i got plenty of money i just havent gone out for awhile
wilkins contd murphy and ill be glad to see you
no no no hes got plenty of food
rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is setting it on the bed
what are you doing
betty is sitting on the bed opposite
rita opens the hatbox and removes her purse
she opens the purse and takes out the money
she sits down on the bed and while staring at the money she thinks of what to say
youve been so good to me
now we know why
why i was so afraid
we know what kind of trouble im in
i only have this to offer
ill give you this if i can stay here for awhile
i dont know what else to do
betty moves across the bed to the side of rita
she puts her arm around rita and holds her
i want you to stay here and you dont have to give me that money
but i want to
we shouldnt touch that money
we dont know about that money
that might be dangerous money
you have to start all over again
you look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person
whoever you want to be
it sounds kind of nice
being somebody brand new
hey lets introduce the brand new you to hollywood
we havent seen the roof garden yet
the girls come out the front door
betty leading and pulling a much happier rita along with her
they half run across the courtyard to stone steps under an ivy covered eave
the girls race up the stone steps toward us
soon their wind blown smiling faces fill the screen as they look out
there before them are the lights of hollywood with silhouetted palms slow moving theater kleig lights and floating above it all the giant sign in the hills reading hollywood
here i am hollywood
my names betty
betty contd to rita say it
here i am hollywood
my name is
they look out maybe waiting for an answer blowing in the santa ana wind
we move in to the pile of money next to ritas purse
past that we move down inside ritas purse
we see the blue key and move closer to it until it fills the screen
we drift along the red bricks past the payphone along the wall until we come to the corner
slowly we round the corner and move to a dark alley
there amongst the dumpsters and trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure
we move closer to the figure
it is the bum and the bum sits
we move closer and the bums face fills the screen
its face is black with fungus
its eyes turn and they seem to be red
