written by rian johnson over a grimy concrete wall creeping by
we emerge from
a gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway
on the embankment beside the hole brendan frye squats shoulders hunched
his dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel
not more than six inches deep
just beneath the surface a young womans pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against the edge of her body like a docked boat
a pebble plinks into the water beside it
a single locker
that same arm bracelets and all slips a note through the slats then leaves quickly
as the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker
the note falls to his feet
the figure is brendan
he unfolds the note folded in a triangle pico alexander
pico and alexander
brendan looks up from the watch
he sits on the curb of a wide suburban street eats lunch from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner
he shows no surprise when it begins to ring
brendan goes to the phone and puts the receiver to his ear
silence for a moment then a thin female voice from the phone
originally dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel
the street names were changed in production to match existing streets we couldnt afford to create custom street signs
over phone brendan
slow deliberate status quo
her voice thins to a high strained breath
she is crying
whats going on em
through strained crying its good to see you brendan
brendans eyes glance around the surrounding street
emily is crying again
emily contd contd its been some time
i didnt even know your locker
i had to ask brain
more crying noises
em why dont we meet somewhere
i screwed up real bad
i really screwed up
screwed up how
blubbering fast and incoherent i did what she said with the brick i didnt know it was bad but the pins on it now for poor frisco and theyre playing
it all on me slow down now what
you gotta help me brendan i think tug oh
with a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black mustang roars by
brendan drops the receiver and spins out of the booth
there another pay phone up the hill empty
brendan turns to the black mustang far down the street
a mans hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side window
the mustang turns the corner gone
brendan walks after it finds the cigarette butt on the street
a pale blue arrow is printed on the filter
in the distance the class bell rings
the high school is open air the hallways are alleyways between buildings
a short kid with eyeglasses the size of because of the orientation of the street this was all flipped when we shot it and the hand came from the passenger
the dialogue in the ending field scene was changed to match causing mass confusion for about half an hour on set
volkswagen headlights sits against the wall
brendan enters leans on the wall beside him
its been awhile
where you been eating
back of school
yeah no ones seen you
whats it been a couple months
yeah its been awhile
you gave emily my locker number
a few days ago
was i wrong
to give it
its been so long i dont know you twos stats
it has been awhile
whos she been eating with
uncomfortable i dunno
its hard to keep track
shrugs can be
the brain avoids brendans gaze
she hasnt been doing too good
im not looking for a patch up
ems life is her own
but she asked for my help
help with what
i dont know
i dont even care its not my business
i just want to know shes ok so ive got to find her
thats all this is
i know she was poking in with the ivy bound cheerleading elite
laura dannons crowd
across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair kisses an football player
laura dannon there with the rabbit
brad bramish with her
cream on the upper crust
brad laughs heartily
softly hes a sap
i wont argue then
anyway em tagged after them for a bit but it didnt work
so she picked her way down the food chain
last i seen she was with whasshername that drama vamp
small time dealer augh the evil one the one you dated kara
thats my bus
you know her locker number
keep your specs on find me if she shows
the brain trots off
in the distance brad and laura laugh and he kisses her
her hair blows in the wind
locker is open its door swinging gently in the wind
brendan sits against the massive building flipping through loose papers
he finds two photographs one of emily hugging him the other of emily with a beautiful sharp eyed girl at a party drinks in hand
sorting more papers he finds a red card with a sequined mask on the front
the bottom edge has been torn off
sixth period has broke
masses of students pile into busses
a huge chunk of brown building
brendan strides towards it
drama people sit on the floor facing the stage
brendan steps behind one the sharp eyed girl from the picture
she holds a freshman boys head in her lap
pets it like a dog
she looks back at brendan her face in shadow
through a mocking smile hello brendan
come to see the show
kisses the freshmans forehead purring
no i didnt
nudges the freshman with his toe lapdog blow
the freshman sits up looks to kara like a spooked puppy
to the lapdog stay
to brendan dont be mean
im all friendly
to the lapdog watch your head kid that thing bites
the dog pops up again
kara pulls him down and nuzzles his ear
brendan contd contd i need words
about emily kostich
she stops nuzzling a little too quickly
to the dog get me my purse
he goes hurry
he breaks into a trot
kara smiles at brendan
still picking your teeth with freshmen
you were a freshman once
she slides her fingers up his arm
he growls and pushes them away
way once sister
you and em were tight for a bit
whos she eating with now
youre a cutie
you gonna tell me
guess youre up from the underneath then
the whole jerr thing blown over
lucky strikes you and your partner get bulled you come up clean
but i guess you were always the brains of the outfit
one of many instances of an allusion to the jerr backstory most of which were trimmed back in the editing process for clarity
the author has threatened to write it as a stand alone short story but probably never will so in a nutshell when brendan and emily were still an item she
started hanging out with jerr a small time dealer
brendan didnt approve so he partnered up with jerr then ratted him out to trueman
emily found out and that led to their breakup on the field which we see in a flashback
sometimes i wonder why i dumped you
standing to go god
i dont know where shes at brendan
i know you do so why dont you want me to find her
maybe im looking out for you
going well i appreciate that
you looking to get back into things
i could use you
he is gone
behind kara the play goes on
the play is seen in shadow play through the backdrop
brendan slips in through an exit door crosses the backstage area and enters the dressing rooms
cramped and empty
pictures of kara with friends are stuck in the mirror
brendan roughly searches drawers bags pockets
a red edge behind one of the photos the same red card with a mask on it but whole
across the bottom in small print halloween in january call for details brendan pulls a phone across his desk and dials the number on the flyer
over phone hello
hello maam this is tom im a friend from school
could i speak to
he trails off
over phone oh hi tom
lauras here hold on
over phone yes
im calling for details
details about the party
who is this
i dont think weve met
well then i dont think youre invited to my party
its a rather exclusive gathering
i can imagine
she starts to speak he cuts her off you should really work on your invite management
that might be a personal room for improvement area in your life
but discretion of your invite sending aside i have procured a certain someones invitation and would like details
a beat of silence
you think youre cute whoever you are
waitll you get a load of my felt fedora and spats
who are you
or ill hang up
you dont know me ill save you some time
i know everyone and ive got all the time in the world
folly of youth
ask whose invitation ive got
slightly what you said
bush street up in stockton cove
buzz at the gate
but who brendan hangs up
he folds his hands under his chin and stares at the phone perfectly still
the clock on his desk says
brendan at his desk tapping away at tetris
the desk is empty tetris paused
a shower runs behind an ajar door in the background
an imposing private community gate
brendan coasts up on his bike and ditches it in the bushes
he checks the call box directory dannon using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks briskly up the street
shiny cars line the curb
party noises come from an upscale two story house
brendan takes a short breath then strides up to the front door
large and clean with a two story ceiling and a railed staircase at one end
fifteen or twenty clean people some in costumes mill about in cliques
brendan comes in as if he doesnt mind who sees him coming in
he gets a couple odd stares but no one stops him
with non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to the beer keg in back and draws half a cup
richly adorned crowded lit with bright pools of light
brendan drifts in and stands in the back deep in shadow
the music comes from a baby grand piano set against one wall
laura dannon leans against it
she wears a red kimono and is striking against the velvet black piano
lauras kid sister years old with glasses sits at the piano playing all i do is dream of you
laura sings lovely and soft but with strength
brendan watches from the back his face obscured in shadow but his eyes gleam
through the darkened window behind him a match flares up and someone standing outside lights a cigarette
laura finishes the song
the room applauds and she ruffles her kid sisters hair
brendan ducks out and into by the time we got around to production this had changed to someone to watch over me but the publishing rights proved too expensive i
we chose the gilbert sullivan song which besides being lovely was also in the public domain i
brad bramish the jock who was kissing laura in the parking lot sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd
he holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named biff at his elbow
if the coach wants to play me ill play but i cant put my best game in if ive got to worry about whether im going to be in there
halftime last game coach is pissed i ran it on a pass play out on the field he says to me you gotta think about the team and you gotta
you know and if you run that ball again youre out and i said to him you gotta let me play
im out there let me play and hes saying no youre out and i kept saying let me play
let me play
let me play
just right in his face he was
just let me play
let me play
let me play
no you gotta no let me play
let me play
let me play
brad hunches forward his face swollen purple yelling that over and over
tom steps in front of brendan blocking his line of sight
brendan scans the rest of the room
his eyes catch on laura leaning against a divan
her bright sharp eyes cut through the room straight into brendan
he wags his eyebrows at her
she looks away quickly
brendan turns back to brad still shouting let me play
tom stands between them
brad falls silent
most of the room follows suit
tom turns around
brendan smiles good naturedly
brendan contd could you step aside please
im trying to follow brads story and its difficult when i cant see his face
the room watches brendan
tom mumbles something and steps aside
brad stares at brendan stupidly
brendan flashes a dopey grin and tips his glass
stumbles he doesnt give me a play to make what can i do you know
he falls into awkward silence
biff starts babbling
brendan looks at brad who is staring back at him
brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to laura staring at him too her eyes slightly amused
brendan cocks an eyebrow
the slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth and she wags her eyebrows once at him
brendan glances back at brad looking at laura now not amused at all
brendan stands to go
biff chatters on
brad cuts him off
brad contd hey
what are you doing here
unless your anecdotes got a nd act
why dont you leave
leaving thats what i was doing
with a lit wet bar at one end
brendan goes to the bar puts ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor
brendan pauses glass touching his lips
he downs half of it
i like a man who knows what hes drinking
thats a pretty sick thing to be attracted to
brads not a good guy to get on the wrong side of
they stare at each other in silence
she studies his face
the broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid
quit your yappin and fix me one
and slips out a sliding glass door
he fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water
brendan joins laura hands her a drink
suburban lights fill the valley below
laura sips her drink
ill never get through all this
she sips more
i knew your old partner jerr since grade school
how long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting
a few months
could have helped himself out by turning me in but he took the heat
he was a good guy
you knew him
yeah i did
so why are you here tonight
im looking for emily
she wasnt invited
she had an invitation
well like you said ive got to work on that
ems been awol for a good month nobodys seen her
i saw her yesterday
nearly nobodys seen her
so what did she tell you
winces score for finesse
listen youre scratching at the wrong door
i wasnt with emily enough to know details of what she was in i just got wind of the downfall and i didnt get any details of that except that
it was bad
so now that were showing some cards
if you havent got a finger in ems troubles whyd her name get me into your rather exclusive party
keep up with me now
i dont know but it sounded like you did and a bodys got a right to be curious
now im not so sure
well ill put that body to bed
i dont know a damn thing about whatever troubles and that works for me
i just want to find her
a long beat
laura studies brendans face then seems to come to a decision
coffee and pie
the words hang in the air a moment
a look of recognition from brendan
coffee and pie oh my
and you didnt hear it from me
he sips his drink
a voice calls from the glass door
laura flashes brendan a look and goes to her
they have quick quiet words and the girl leaves
laura turns back to brendan
laura contd contd will you wait here for me
youll stay right here and wait ill be five minutes
the moment she leaves brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence into the neighbors yard
brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks around
laura comes out the front door cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street
brendan begins to follow but a noise from behind the fence stops him a match being struck
brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole
a brightly lit window in the side of brads house and through the window the party
a dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat all inky black
the figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party absently stroking his cheek
brendan steps back snap
the figure freezes
then making no noise at all it spins to face brendan a towering black form against the window
the glowing cigarette falls to the grass
a metallic glint and a clicking sound not unlike a gun
brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass
through the hole the black of the figures cloak whips away
brendan hesitates then hops the fence
brendan lands on his feet
no black figure to be found
the cigarette still smolders on the ground
hand rolled plain paper
brendan gazes through the window catching his breath
then he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street
peeking around the house brendan sees laura cut across the lawn and trot into the street
using parked cars as cover brendan follows
between cars brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black mustang
laura goes to him and speaks quickly
the dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows
laura says something to him
grunting something angrily he gets in the car with the bald kid and peels off
laura turns and slowly walks towards the house
when she is gone brendan stands throws a look back at the house and walks off down the street towards the guard gate
the two drinks where brendan left them
laura takes hers and drains it
the suburban lights twinkle like stars
the sun rises over carrows family restaurant a squat structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel ravine
a banner from in the window coffee and pie oh my
a pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster
their beady eyes follow brendan in sync as he approaches
he goes to the nearest one
silence and blank stares
brendan calmly moves to the next stoner
brendan moves to the next one
a thin head pokes from around the dumpster
maybe you shouldnt be here
brendan steps around the dumpster
dode slumps against the wall thin and delicate in dusty black
slivery eyes pale lips muffled intelligence
kara told me you know where ems at
and why are you looking for em
she asked for my help
listen man ive got plenty on my plate without dealing with some jilted ex
its not about that
whatever its about act smarter than you look and drop it
where is she
shes with me and right now thats the best place for her
leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle
youre on the bright side of dim dode but if i thought you had this half handled id be eating lunch
wheres she at
better get while its good
dode contd heel it now dig
the big stoners appear behind brendan threatening
dode turns his head away to light a joint
brendans fist slams into his face sending the joint spinning
brendan slams dodes frail frame against the dumpster
the stoners stand in the exact same position deer in the headlights
one makes a half hearted motion to intervene
throw one at me if you want hash head
ive got all five senses and i slept last night that puts me six up on the lot of you
just easy brendan slams dode into the wall
to dode wheres em
deliberate shes with me
she was tight when she called you man
came to and freaked
she told me to shake you if you came by
said youd only make things worse
brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly well
he drops dode
put him down man
deal with whatever this aint about and drop it
to brendan nothing more here bra
tell emily i want to see her
tell her if she still wants my help or not thats her business but i want to hear it straight from her
she dont brendan walks away
she knows where i eat lunch
when brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction and stay out punk
brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes
a moment later dode hustles away from carrows
the sun is rising as brendan tails dode through the twisty suburban streets
brendan takes cover as dode stops by a white hatchback
a girl gets out of the car and embraces dode
her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girls arm
dode speaks quickly to her she nods and speaks back
he hands her a slip of paper which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket
they embrace again dode walks off and the girl gets in her car
brendan stumbles after the car but it is quickly gone
he watches it go then follows dode back towards school
dode slumps into the front door of the brown building
brendan watches him from a distance eyes thoughtful
after a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of students
brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long empty utility road behind the school
reclining on the wall reading lord of the flies
he raises his eyes and sits up suddenly
off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure approaches stumbling
brendan jumps and hits the ground running towards the figure
meet the girl with cheap bracelets the girl dode spoke to the dead girl emily
he catches her just as she stumbles and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered hallway
emily and brendan sit in silence
she is very pretty but she looks bad
too much makeup not enough sleep
she sniffles speaks to her shoes
i must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone
she taps her shoes together lightly eyes fixed on them
emily contd it was dumb i got paranoid over a really stupid thing
i was high i went crazy for a little bit but now you have to forget about it
thats how you can help me now forget about it
she turns her weak eyes to brendan for the first time
his stare is unwavering searching
she pushes on
emily contd brendan i know youre mad at all these people cause you think i went away from you and went to them
but youve got to start seeing it as my decision stop being angry because where i want to be ats different from where you wanna be at
angry who fed you that line em
she looks back at her shoes
and stop picking on dode
hes a good guy
the carrows rat
hes a good friend
so what am i
strained anger yeah what are you
eating back here not liking anybody how are you judging anyone
i loved you alot but i couldnt stand it i had to get with people
i couldnt heckle life with you i had to see what was what
she taps her clogs
one has a hole worn through the sole
her face contorts seizes up and she is sobbing
emily contd im sorry brendan
she buries her face in his shoulder
he has a hard time speaking
youve got to come back to me em
i cant love on your terms brendan
i cant do that im not like you
youre in a spot i can get you out of it
come back to me and whatever heat follows you ill deal with
youre not hearing me no
i dont want to be put away and protected
emily contd no
tell me about the trouble the brick and the pin you gonna fix things like you did with jerr
i came to say goodbye for good
whatever you have to do to let me go do it
im gonna let you go ive decided that
make sure that youve got to promise you wont torture yourself that youll let me go
she embraces him enveloping him in her jacket
his face is a frozen mask
emily contd let me go
as she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from her jacket pocket
he watches her as she walks away
brendan sits in the back flipping through the address book
the teacher drones on about the significance of the pigs head in lord of the flies
illegible scribbles names numbers nothing that stops his search then the note dode gave her a corner of loose leaf paper which looks like this brendan studies the paper intently
the brain studies the paper
busses pull into the parking lot behind them
brendan is distant lost in thought
do you know anything else about this
our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to brendans lunch spot to save us a location change
the degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been commented on has always bemused the author who cannot for the life of him remember a
single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school
shakes his head mm
whyd you let dode fly when he came back to whose her name at the theater
shrugs dismissively kara
its their turf i couldnt hear them without being seen and that would only biff their play
best to know its there let it ride and see what comes of it
touches the paper but anyway
well if this is what i think it is it didnt come straight from dode less hes playing out of his league
beat i can only give you my best guess
when the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town
i know under the piers one down by the bike trails in the state parks another
theres alot of them
the pitch is theyve got little symbols for each one and thats how they tell each other the place so word wont get around
so this might be that
but dode wouldnt know it
this is upper crust
dodes pie pan grease
brendan studies the symbol
call anything up
how many places start with a
or if its a shape or just a random symbol
anyway even if you figured it out what good could you do
shes smart she knows the play shes gunning to square things
you said her business was none of yours so shes alright forget it now
go home sleep
brendan plays tetris on his computer staring off into space
his moms voice calls good night and the hallway light turns off
by the clock radio on brendans nightstand
the slip of paper rests beside it
brendan lies in bed staring at the symbol on the paper
his eyes tense
growing larger burning with a searing intensity then folding into darkness
water rushes overhead over concrete concrete with a hole in it the runoff tunnel just for an instant then back underwater screaming
brendan choking screaming plunging upwards
a woman with no face falls from the darkness and kisses him her long hair sweeping around him then pulling away
as the last strands slide off his face he wakes up with a start
the clock says
brendan drips with sweat breathing raggedly
he takes the paper and a pencil from the nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this flash cut the runoff tunnel lining up perfectly with the now shaded
his eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks off the light
brendan walks off into the hazy pre dawn light
brendan stops at a high wall of weeds listening to the low gurgle of moving water
slowly robotically he pushes through
face down bobbing gently in shallow water
red foam clings to her
silently as if lowered by a string brendan sinks down squatting in the mud
his lungs empty in one choppy breath
he pulls his glasses off sluggishly
a contorted frozen mask eyes wet
stringy flowing gently in the water
then suddenly snapping to attention
from the tunnel
the inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum
silent but then the scrape of a shoe against concrete then echoing footsteps running away
brendan springs like a cat sprinting into the tunnel
nearly pitch black
sets of running footfalls
brendan is chasing running full speed into the blackness heart pounding we almost dont notice that brendans are now the only footfalls
silence in the darkness except for brendans breath
and someone near
brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down
an inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach
brendan curls on the ground the figure over him
low whisper your little em
the figure runs off
brendan raises his head painfully the figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end of the tunnel then is gone
emilys body is still there
brendan crawls out of the tunnel and collapses in the shallow water beside the body
he rests his head on his arm eyes on ems hair
cold and barren nearly empty
brendan limps across the barren lawns
a line of phone booths on campus
brendan nearly collapses against one
he dials still in a stupor
saint clement police
brendan stares into space eyes burning voice on phone contd saint clement police hello
brendan hangs up
early morning mist below a squat brick building
warmly lit sheltering the few souls scattered here and there at tables
the brain sits at one of them reading an impossibly large book
he watches curiously as brendan approaches him
brendan falls into a chair
the brain looks him over
the brain contd youre up early
thick distant i couldnt sleep
nods back to his book find emily
brendan breathes out softly
the brain contd you alright
what are you here for zero
nah i gotta take the early bus cause the others dont run by my street
time to reads nice
so whats the word with em
cant raise her
no i cant
so what now
i dont know
i guess its
i dont know
brendan takes a long moment
he stares down at his glasses wet with condensation
brendan contd brain i cant let her go
i was set to but i cant
i dont think i can
you think you can help her
you think you can get the straight maybe break some deserving teeth
i think i could
brendan rubs his forehead
kara tried to rope me
she came right out and asked
she was scared
tell me to walk from this brain
tell me to drop it
walk from it
grins youre thick as what all brendan
yes i am
brendan cleans his glasses
he looks brain in the eye and his mannerisms come back into focus
brendan contd id need you to op
like on jerr but that was cake to this
and unlike jerr theres not much chance well come out clean
twenty four seven on this one
you okay to op for me again
the brain barely smiles
what first tip the bulls
brendan puts on his glasses stands to go
no bulls would gum it
theyd flash their dusty standards at the wide eyes and probably find some yegg to pin probably even the right one
but theyd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes and if were doing this i want the whole story
no cops not for a bit
so what first
i dont know
your mom still have the cell
in her car
borrow it for a few days get me the number
stands to go wait for my word and cover for me first period
im going to be a little late
a vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint
brendan trudges across it his steps heavy
he stops and stands very still staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to flat gray pin straight
brendans voice starts speaking rapidly confident and clear
this describes the location at my school that the showdown scenes were originally written for
between when i wrote the script and when we shot it however the school expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field and so we reluctantly moved these scenes
to the football field
yeah it was personal
jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him but im nobodys bull runner
this wasnt a business sit
i bulled him
got in tight partnered up and sent him over
pan around to reveal brendan
he looks different edgier more alive wearing different clothes and a thin goatee
he keeps talking directly at us
brendan contd id bull the lot of them em id burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again
jerr and whoevers next
i want to keep you safe
an arm swings into frame wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish
it slaps brendan hard in the face
he catches it
emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement
brendan grabs her sleeve
she twists away
he grabs her shoulder grabs her waist she resists and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the
gulls cry in the distance
you cant keep me safe brendan
im in a bigger world now and you cant hide me from it and you cant beat it
not if i dont want you to
brendans face looks lumpish while emilys is strong
she stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field
watching her go
it is back to present day pale clean shaven sullen
his eyes are cold with resolve
brendan sloshes down into the water
without delicacy he lifts emilys body and pulls her back into the tunnel
which joe would not even consider thank god
brendan lays the body down
two beady eyes peer at him from the darkness he freezes
the eyes hop forward a gull
the two watch each other for a moment then the gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel
brendan follows it without looking back at the body
brendan and the brain lean against a wall
the brain slips him a piece of paper
theres the cell number
keep it on vibrate
pats his jacket pocket yeah
better stop meeting me in the open too
im going to start getting visible and i need you on the underneath
trueman asked for you
wants words in his office
keep him off me stonewall him he wont bite just keep him away from me
so whats first
make ems troubles mine
im going to throw a few words at you tell me if they catch
a very early draft held on the tunnel after brendan left and revealed a dark figure dode creeping away from the top of the tunnel causing the pebble described on
page to plink into the water
or bad brick
that might be a drink
vodka and milk or something or maybe not
frisco farr was a sophomore last year i think
real trash maybe hit a class a week
didnt know him then and havent seen him around
the pin yeah
the pins kind of a local spook story
you know the kingpin
ive heard it
supposed to be old like lives in town
all apologies to frisco farr who the author did actually go to school with and who was neither a druggie nor real trash but was a great guy who simply
had a very cool sounding name
he is now the author was horrified to learn practicing law
jake runner right
ask any dope rat where their junk sprang theyll say they scraped it from that who scored it from this who bought it off so and after four or five
connections the listll always end with the pin
but ill becha you got every rat in town together and said show your hands if any of themve actually seen the pin youd get a crowd of full pockets
you think the pins just a tale to take whatever heat
beat but whats first
a show of hands
brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks through another door and into sunlight
kara smokes a cigarette
brendan leans beside her
annoyed hey brendan
here for the show
would you go then honey cause ive got this headache
try smoking like a chimney ive heard that helps
in an admittedly paltry concession to clarity this was changed to dope runner in post production
brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes
brendan contd isnt this dodes brand
kara snaps her head towards him a flash of anger
she catches herself and smiles cooly
you dont know dodes brand
oh i do now
angry again kara snatches the pack from him
brendan contd im going to start shaking things up
give me the story and you might miss the bite
the story about what
he turns and walks away
the story about what
i dont want to play games if youve got a headache
get me if you want to spill it but i cant guarantee safe passage after tonight
i dont know what at the stage door not slowing
tell the pin that brad was my calling card and i need words
through the door and into the theater
he spins to see karas face just before the door closes
the brain walks out of a classroom and brendan swings behind him
fast and low tail kara through lunch
shes got rehearsal but shell blow early
she goes home drop her else wait for my call
the brain turns and brendans gone
brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of or flashy luxury cars set aside at the far end of the lot
brad bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible front door open
a small crowd hangs about brad his crony biff at his elbow
thats all im saying is put me in the game and ill do what needs to be done but they dont put me in what needs doing dont get done
and dont come crying to me man
get off my grill man you didnt put me in dont come to me if you didnt let me play
brendan scans the rest of the cars
his eyes catch on laura dannon sitting in another convertible off to the side
her bright eyes cut through the crowd straight into brendan
he wags his eyebrows at her
she looks away
brendan walks into brads direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars
what are you doing here
alright you got me
im a scout for the gophers
not amused oh yeah
of all things yeah
been watching your game for a month but that story just now clenched it
youve got heart kid
how soon can you move to minneapolis
a few snickers around the crowd but nowhere near brad
flat with anger yeah
cold winters but theyve got a great public transit system
theres a thesaurus in the library
yeahs under y
go ahead ill wait
who invited you
to the parking lot
well gee i kind of invited myself
i think youd better leave then
no im having too good a time
just the same
brendan smiles slightly and very deliberately crosses his legs
brads face tenses
brad contd maybe you want to go someplace more private
brad says who else
by lifting his arms
brendan contd as if hes been asked to the movies sure
brendan stands and walks off
brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him
he leads them behind a parked vw van and turns to face brad
people gather around in a wide circle
brendan pulls his jacket off as brad hangs back mumbling
you know whats good for you youll just beat it
beating a small frye wont win me anything and its not going to do you any good laura pulls up in her convertible behind brad watching
in the next moment brendan cuts brad off by putting his fist in his face
brad grunts but doesnt lose ground
brendan throws his short stocky frame into brads larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs
brad tags brendan in the ribs then smacks the palm of his hand into brendans face shoving him back onto the pavement
he comes at brendan with his big fists clenched
brendan kicks brad full force in the shins
brad tumbles and brendan comes up fast connecting hard with the point of brads chin
brad gets his balance fast and before brendan can throw another he throws one himself then another both into brendans stomach
brendan pulls back and kicks brads shin where he had kicked it before
brad roars and hits brendan very hard in the face
brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into brads nose
the sound of eggs breaking and brad falls backwards like a board
he stays down holding his face
brendan staggers back breathing hard and looks up at the small crowd
some stare at brendan some at brad but nobody seems about to do anything
brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off pushing past the last few people rushing over
hey is there a fight
he throws a last look at laura who meets his gaze and drives off
brendan walks away from the lot towards the school
laura pulls up beside him in her car
brendan ignores her and b lines for the school
laura brakes hard parking by the curb
brendan limps down the hallway
laura appears behind him trotting to catch up
youre quite a pill
where are you going
why did you take a powder the other night
same reason im taking one now
he keeps walking i dont get you
thats a chilly heel to be giving a girl whos where you want to know about
ill get where im going just fine
i want to help you
silence behind him
he stops turns wearily
she looks genuinely hurt
brendan contd contd look i cant trust you
you ought to be smart enough to know that
i didnt shake the party up to get your attention and im not heeling you to hook you
your connections could help me but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me so im better off coming at it clean
i wouldnt have to lead you in by the hand i cant trust you
brad was a sap you werent you were with him and so you were playing him so youre a player
with you behind me id have to tie one eye up watching both your hands and i cant spare it
youre not brad
no im not
he turns and walks away
she doesnt follow
brendan slumps against it receiver to his ear licking a bruised lip
he wears dark glasses
on the phone you didnt call
kara went home though didnt she
yeah but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didnt want on her phone bill
get the numbers
are me and brad front page news
all the buzz
you really do that
is brad the pin
brads a sap
i downed him on his field and his crew didnt bite
so now i know hes a sap and anyone who acts like he isnt is profiting by it
thats not why i roughed him though
brads the schools biggest jake buyer so if this pin is behind all the selling i just got his attention
anyway nows just shaking things out
look you know a kid around the burgh lanky short shaved head turns a black tang
i told you before i dont know the car
those types are a nickel a pound but nobody i know that you dont
and trueman again keep him off
and keep your specs on i need to find that kid
brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly
a lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face
brendan hits the pavement
the lanky kid is over him in a split second beating his face and body with short heavy blows
flashes of the lanky kid a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face
after a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures
a car peels out and roars off brendan lies still
the class bell rings very distant
legs criss cross before his eyes each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared
brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office
a man in his early thirties behind a wood colored desk and name plate gary trueman assistant vice principal plays with a pencil
you didnt know this boy
no sir never seen him
and he just hit you
like i said he asked for my lunch money first
good thing i brown bagged it
trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on brendan
ive been looking to talk to you
brendan doesnt react
trueman contd youve helped this office out before
i gave you jerr to see him eaten not to see you fed
fine and well put
accelerated english mrs
tough but fair
anyway then we know youre clean and youve despite your motives youve been an asset to us
i think youre a good kid
i want to run a couple names by you
brendan stands to go
trueman contd were not done here
angry i was done here three months ago
i told you then id give you jerr and that was that im not your inside line and im not your boy
thats not a very helpful anger builds you know what im in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here
what are you in
and no more of these informal chats if youve got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and ill see you at the parent conference
hold it i could hold it could write you up for talking back to a vp
for looking at me in a threatening way
id exercise a little more tact mr
you cant pull a play like that unless i need you for something
so do i
so maybe youre gonna need me too
alright i need you off my back completely for a few weeks
there might be some heat soon
interested if its something i cant cover i wont go to bat for you
if i get caught like that its curtains anyway i couldnt have brass cutting me favors in public
im just saying now so you dont come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts
trueman bites a thumbnail
okay heres what i can do
i wont pin you for anything you arent caught at
ill ride it a little while as long as it doesnt get too rough
but if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it i cant help you
also if i get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you dont deliver the veep will need someone to hand over police wise
and ill have you
there better be some meat at the end of this like you say or at least a fall guy or youre it
sure i am
got one more favor to ask
gary trueman throws brendan out
get the hell off my campus punk
brendan glances around and limps off
no stoners no dode
brendan breathes uneasily
brendan leans against it
no dodes mia all around
im of that karas got him but who knows where
i shook but shes not spilling
no more job offers
so shes got a play
and i know enough about kara to let that worry me
alright keep your specs on for him
any other news
laura dannon came to me looking for you
considers this she did huh
fourth period nearly shook me upside down
cant say i didnt enjoy it but whyd she come to me
shes tapping kara and kara knows you know me
shes some piece of work
if i had known where you were i might have told her
thats the spirit
ask around for dode tail kara again at lunch
i got knives in my eyes im going home sick
ill call you tonight
bordering a supermarket
brendan trudges along
suddenly he stops
parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black mustang
the sun hangs low
brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly
he peers inside
a tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat
he pulls the door handle locked
brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head ready to drop it through the window
his eyes catch something in the distance
the lanky shaved head kid whose name is tugger
coming towards him fast
brendan stands there for a moment then lets the chunk fall to the ground
he casually leans against the car removes his glasses puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket
tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement
tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys
brendan gets up and comes towards tug his face stiff
tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth
brendan falls to his knees
while tug unlocks the door brendan stands up woozily
grunting tug spins and grabs brendans jacket pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face back and forth three times
when tug lets go brendan drops like a stone catching himself on his hands and knees
the car door slams
the mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot spins around and stops facing brendan
its motor purrs deeply
brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly head up eyes fixed
a crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward
it comes straight at brendan rumbling like a tank
brendan stops walking and stands very still eyes steady
the gap between him and the car closes in no time at all
it speeds past him not six inches to his left brushing the edge of his jacket
brakes squeal behind him
brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang idling about fifty feet away
he stops at the window
tugger eyes him curiously with some respect
i want to see the pin
nods slightly yeah i guess you do
twisty and narrow
the black mustang flies through them at impossible speeds roaring past like a bullet
loud engine noise jostling grunting
then a metallic jangle some scraping and a clink
the trunk pops open revealing brendan holding a jack rod
tug is putting a tape in the deck eyes down
behind him the trunk pops open then pulls down out of sight just as he looks back up
brendan holds the trunk about three inches open just enough to see which street signs pass by
loud music plays from the car sweet baby james by james taylor
the car zooms on
through the ajar trunk
the mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagles head
brendan closes the trunk
a small one story house slightly run down
tugger opens the trunk and drags brendan out covering his eyes with a palm slams the trunk and goes inside
when they are gone the broken trunk drifts open
a very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other end
tugger drags brendan down the stairway drops him and goes into the lit room
taylor flatly refused which given the context was probably wise
brendan lifts his head painfully
surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys some dressed like tugger others dressed in black
tug pokes his head out
arms pop out of the darkness and drag brendan towards the lit room
a small room amazingly messy
clothes strewn about groves of empty bottles precarious piles of books
the overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos but of a nest comfortably woven and very worn in
a slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk writing under a green bookkeepers lamp
brendan is shoved into the center of the room
tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls
brendan watches the thin figures back
for a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin mans pencil
then he sighs and swivels around
mid to late twenties
sallow features tired eyes
his clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up
you the pin
beat of silence so now im very very curious what youre going to say next
maybe ill just sit and bleed at you
the pin shifts in his seat bored
helled if youre gonna go breaking my best clients noses and expect me to play sandbag
anyway youve been sniffing me out before then sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse with a nick on its ear he can suck on
they do that
brendan blinks so now you got tugger to bring you here which he never does and you got me listening so im curious what youve got to say that better
be really really good
dannon in from the hall first she oughta hear this
amused no dice soldier
would have been a neat trick though
shrugs then slowly i was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal anything so youd let me walk
then i was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh
the pins eyes shoot to tugger who doesnt flinch
he knows zippo
vista blanca the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox
the world turns on its side as tugger pushes brendans head down into the carpet
you gonna do what now
the pin walks towards them
one of his shoes is twice the size of the other
no good soldier
the cronies around the room begin cackling
tugs face is a mask of rage
brendan cant breath
his face swells
pin contd alright let up
but tug doesnt let up
brendans world grows hazy the cackling laughter reverberates then a clean voice pierces the din
tugs face breaks for a moment and he lets go
brendans head lolls to the side
laura stands in the dark doorway
brendan sees tugs knuckles and a flash of white for a split moment as tug hits him in the face
the pins black body spills out across the frame leaving us in black
brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor
a bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling
tugger sits five feet away watching him like a hungry dog
brendan stares back at him through thick glazed eyes
where are my glasses
tugger grins hell with ya then
which walls the door in
tug points amused
brendan heaves himself up and tug shoves him back down
brendan winks at him stands and lurches towards the door again
tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall but freezes when he hears a door latch click
sneering he drops brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall
sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness
light footsteps clack on the cement floor
suddenly tug vanishes the rooms darkness just seems to swallow him
the thin whispery voice of the pin speaks softly
sorry about this kid but what the hell with what you said before
his disembodied face appears a few feet about where tug had sat
pin contd where you were at with all of us and the tug a fist away youve got to use your nut
allay the situation so yeah youre not scared of me i got it but im also thinking youre a little nuts now so youve got that trade off with your
but nuts isnt all bad so maybe it was a good play
i dont know
he is standing in front of tug
his black clothes and broad rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room such that his face seems to bob about in space
brendan stifles a cough
pin contd so laura talked me down
lets get you upstairs back with the living
brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes
the kitchen is on the first floor of the pins house or rather the pins mothers house
she is a soft old lady in a pastel cotton dress currently bent over the fridge mumbling
i thought we had orange juice brendan im sorry
how about tang or thats more like soda isnt it or not soda but it hasnt got any juice in it it cant be very fortifying
waters fine maam thanks
now just a moment we have apple juice here if youd like that or milk though youve got that in your cornflakes i dont know if drinking it as well
might be too much
apple juice sounds terrific
its country style
she shuts the fridge
tugger and the pin sit behind her looking comfortably bored
the pin a sharp black hole against the soft yellow kitchen eats oatmeal cookies with small delicate bites
ill even give it to you in a country glass howd that be
im fine mrs
the pin kisses her on the cheek
okay well im going to go um do something in the other room now
she shuffles out
to brendan so hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale
i dont know
it starts out same as before and this floor aint carpeted
were cooled off
yeah well your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head
i want him out
the pin grins thinly uncomfortable
looky soldier the ape blows or i clam
stands violently so clam
whatve you got i cant beat out of you back in the basement
the pin and brendan are perfectly still watching each other
give us a few minutes tug
tug turns to him but pin keeps his eyes on brendan
pin contd ill call you if whatever
tug stomps off slamming the narrow door hard behind him
the pin goes back to gnawing his cookie
pin contd so
brendan sets down his spoon
about a year ago i had a small time dealing partnership with jerr madison
till he took the fall for you
i didnt ask him to but he was a straight player
i got out clean almost
nothing on my official record but the vps play it like i owe them one
when i made it clear i wasnt playing their hound dog well they didnt like it
they keep calling me in badgering me
gee thats tough
i dont like being told whose side im on
so now they think im on your trail im in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours
you havent got me yet
considering the benefits my services could yield i dont think thats unreasonable
and what are your services exactly just so i can be specific on the invoice
shrugs whatever serves your interests
the pin stands
ill have my boys check your tale and seeing how it stretches well either rub or hire you
youll know which by end of the day tomorrow
brendan stands but doesnt follow as the pin opens the narrow door tugger went through and descends the dark stairs behind
pin contd were done
the moment the pin vanishes into the basements murk laura comes up out of it
she takes brendans hand
ill drive you back
they zig zag though the twisty suburban streets
brendan stares sullenly into space
just drop me at school
they take a hard turn how long was i out
half an hour
it took all of it for me to cool the pin down
flatly but sincerely thanks
they drive on in silence
lauras convertible stops and brendan climbs out painfully
he studies her face for a moment
you trust me now
less than when i didnt trust you before
if you can tell me your angle in this maybe i can
brendan leans on the car his face close to hers
laura contd contd im on the in top level of the tower and i know everyone but i dont know all what goes on
i knew em when she tried to get with me and brad and i liked her
she was smart
but she wasnt us and it didnt work
when she left she took some souvenirs dirty habits she wasnt strong enough to control and a connection to the pin to keep them going
a few months go by and the next i hear the pins raging over a situation with some certain junk em was partial to and the downfalls coming on ems
you think em scraped the junk off the pin
not to weasel in a plug but the original version of this scene shot as written is on the deleted scenes section of the dvd
available at fine retailers everywhere
i dont know but whether she scraped or copped or just ran her tab around the world and into her own back it must have been grand
ive never seen the pin so hot
this all helps but its not what i asked
whats your angle in all this
i dont know
im usually pretty sharp but
maybe i see what youre doing for emily trying to help her
and i dont know anyone who would do that for me
now you are dangerous
throwing the car in gear she peels out and leaves him standing alone in the fading evening light
brendan pushes through the gloom past forest scenery deeper and deeper until he comes to a door
hazy and cramped
everything blends into the color of flesh
no walls are visible it is all billowy piles of costumes
brendan pushes in
kara sits at the mirror putting on eyeliner
sing song brendan brendan brendan
wheres dode flopped
she makes a face i know you two are cozed up so youll tell me or you wont
oooh getting feisty
giggles last time we talked you were giving ultimate tims
you went to laura didnt you
told her my tale
all part of your plan
turned out to be
i feel so cheap and used
gol i must seem a real cad
sometimes i just hate myself
kara grins dreamily
whatever happened to us brendan
wheres dode flopped
she turns to face him
we were a pair and a half for a few months werent we
sometimes i miss having someone i can talk to
you ever miss having someone
i guess you must
brendans face is a mask
i need to hear dodes tale about emily
darkly you better be sure you wanna know whatcha wanna know
brendan stands coughing
lauras working with me now and ill have the pin and tug in my corner soon
the sooner i get the truth from dode or the truth about dode from you the safer youll both be
pass it on to dode anyway
maybe hell have the sense to get out from under you before he gets hurt
you didnt did you
brendan leaves without looking back
brendans at his desk on the phone
on the phone so what happens now
now we wait for the pins answer
unless his crew spotted vp trumans social call this morning itll be yes
id give us
if were in i get under his skin and see whats what
you stick to kara keep your specs peeled for dode and stay away from laura
the brain is quiet for a beat
i think shes with us brendan
too sharp ill let you know when she is
a beat of silence
brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment in silence
the class bell rings and the cage quickly empties
brendan limps in opens his locker
a note falls to his feet
it is folded into a star
he pulls it open
twelve thirty pico he fishes the old note out and compares them different handwriting
the locker cage is now empty and silent except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls
brendan looks up from the notes
a lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him
he wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdogs
you the pins
the lug keeps coming
brendan contd so whats his answer
closer not slowing
brendan tightens his hand into a fist
and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lugs right paw
brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso
before the lug winds up for another slash brendan is running
brendan runs through the empty campus square the lug follows
wind rushing sweating the lug very close
their footsteps clatter on the cement
brendan swings around a corner doubles back and stops with his back to a wall hes lost sight of him
brendan sweats listening
the lugs footsteps echo through the hallways coming from all directions at once
then it seems clear hes down the hall on brendans right
brendan dashes left
the lug looms over him his knife hand flashing
brendans jacket shoulder tears open and the white filling inside turns red
he stumbles back blindly gets his footing and scrambles out of reach
brendan sprints away down the hall gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner
brendan drops to a sitting position
kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet
the lugs footsteps are impossibly loud
just about to round the corner
on his socked feet running silently back towards the corner
the lugs footsteps crash like symbols as they both come around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed
brendan slides like a baseball player tangling his legs into the lugs
the lug pitches forward with frightening momentum
he hits the halls metal handrail with his arms and head
a hollow gong reverberates through the hallway and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut
a wallet with a couple of twenties and a student id chuck burns three hash pipes fifteen joints a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie
brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off
brendan breathes heavily into the phone
chuck burns big lug with hair like a sheepdog
on the phone yeah i know him i just cant pin him to any crowd
hes definitely not muscle for anyone
he taps the carrows crowd but doesnt hang with them
if youve got a guess i could check it out the pin
if hes with the pin everythings kablooie and i gotta blow the burgh
ill check it
im in third now brendan spots the pins cady pulling into the parking lot
if i dont call by three call in the bulls
brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along the sidewalk
the cady pulls up beside him and he stops walking
the door swings open and a voice comes from inside
with no perceivable hesitation he does
brendan sits beside the pin
the windows are tinted and the car is very dark
the seats are pink vinyl
the car lurches forward
brendan and the pin are silent for a beat not looking at each other
a stocky kid in the front seat turns and reaches into his jacket
for a moment he stays like that hand in his jacket eyes on brendan
brendans face is placid
tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in brendans lap
pin contd thats what youll get every week for your services
less of course theres a specific job involved in where you get sliced in with my crew
the pin holds his hat in his hands fingering the rim
were doing a thing down at the hole tonight
south of t street yeah
its sort of a welcome you in thing
the car stops
brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked him up
the cady drives off
brendan checks his watch
a phone begins to ring
brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone holding the receiver to his ear in silence
on the phone i know what you did
i saw what you did
the voice is low and garbled filtered through something
anyone i tell it would ruin you some way
and im going to tell someone
are you making an offer
or maybe ill just do you in
hire another hash head to blade me
originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery but during post production we decided it was one layer too many and identified the caller as dode
brendans first line was overdubbed in post to say dode
instead of so
dont need no blades shamus
i just gotta squawk
what do you want
just to see you sweat
brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a moment
then he inserts a coin and dials
on the phone brendan
yeah im fine
keep digging on the burns lug but the main thing is to find dode
he set up whatever emily walked into its getting more and more urgent we talk
trueman was looking for you
trueman and the vp
no just trueman
asked for me
no but looked
thats not good
alright keep me posted
brendan hangs up
a bonfire burns about a hundred feet off
figures jump through the blaze to thrash music
the pin and brendan wander towards us on the dark beach
so im going to start you on the dope circles cleaning up the turkish dues pulling in the strags
just to see how you handle
anyway there isnt much else doing
im tailing out this big deal but thats almost done
what was it
biggest i ever done and there was a snag in it but its almost done now
what was it
almost you said
its over enough
youre gonna make me curious being so curious
they sit in the sand facing the breakers
pin contd i gotta lay something out
youre coming into a certain situation and im bringing you in sort of because of it
if ever you want to witness a look of pure horror shoot a micro budget feature film and tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a
beach at night
turns out its difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment
shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution
beat i didnt tell tugger to hit you for the brad bramish thing
laura and i i decided i oughta hear what you were gunning for before i made an enemy
tug just did it though
he was hot and he just hit you
hes been doing that
hes got my best interests i know hes loyal he just gets hot
muscle you cant controls no good at that
youre working for me not tug thats all
a moment of silence
the breakers crash
things can get you know its tough sometimes
twisted complicated watching all the i dont know
everyones got their thing
silence you read tolkien
tolkien the hobbit books
his descriptions of things are really good
he makes you want to be there
the waves crash
behind them with no warning at all a train shoots by
tug stands with his hands jammed in his pockets flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and squealing behind him
the clock radio blinks
the phone is ringing
brendan half wakes and puts it to his ear
on the phone dont go to class
fifth period trueman and the vp come in asking for you
did they call your mom
i got home late
get out of there too then
meet me behind the library
ive got some stuff
a cold gray morning
the brain hands brendan a photocopy of a newspaper clipping local youth hospitalized frisco farr was found on a sidewalk outside pinkertons deli three weeks ago
he was in a coma his stomach contained a sausage sandwich a horse dose of heroin and traces of choleric tricemate a poisonous chemical found in laundry detergent
friscos still under and nobodys talking so nothings come of it
no the chem the junk must have been cut with put him down
could that form of heroin be called brick
no it was a concentrated powder its street handles whip or rock or brock
fishes a note from his pocket here
i told you to stay clear of laura
you tell her to stay clear of me
he gives the note to brendan who unfolds it roughly
mutters i gotta get voicemail
the note reads meet me at the southeast corner of the school at
brendan crumples it into a ball
brendan contd no
tell her ill be at the pins at one
any luck with the lug
the brain lays out a local newspaper with emilys picture local girl missing
this isnt good
the brain looks hard at him
brendan stares off into space for a beat then takes the brains cell phone and dials
brendan contd into phone mr
brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with lauras distinct handwriting on each
on the phone this is trueman
what the hell are you doing asking for me in class
what the hell are you doing out of class
very deliberate the vp and i needed to ask you a few questions about emily kostich who you might have heard is missing
its a very serious thing
the police are involved
the vp and i knew you two were close so the vp and i came to ask you questions but you were truant

ive been cut loose
im not safe here
we shouldnt have met in the open
alright lay low but ask on the underneath for dode
thats all that matters now find dode but do it on the underneath got it
what are you going to do
id like to have played it safe but theres no time
the pins not letting anything drop so i gotta push things a bit
i dont know
just find dode
the bird of prey mailbox looms ominously
brendan knocks on the front door
he presses lightly on the screen door and it gives
brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens the narrow basement door
he descends into inky gloom
deathly still and silent
barely breathing brendan goes to the lit doorway at the end of the hall
brendan floats through the room like a ghost to the pins desk
slowly then with greater confidence he rifles through it papers and trinkets meaningless
he reaches beneath the desk knocking it gently with his knuckles
quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down into the desk frame
brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches thick
he pulls out another
thumbing the stacks pure hundreds
something creaks in the hallway
silently he replaces the money and drawer his eyes on the doorway
he creeps towards the door on the balls of his feet
brendan creeps towards the stairs passing other doorways all open but for one
he stops for a moment listening silence
brendan enters the room pitch black but for a small high window
brendan pulls the curtains aside
a beam of sunlight spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark
brendan jumps back and his reflection in the large mirror jumps as well
a white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark room
brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light reflecting it around the room like a flashlight
more junk a mattress then a strangely bare corner with a single white lump in it
the white bird stands behind the lump its dark eyes caught in the bare light
the bird flies out the window
brendan goes to the white lump a small brick of white powder
white chalky residue patterns the floor there were other bricks there before
behind brendan in the mirror something moves
someone else in the room
he throws brendan across the room then heaves him into a wall
what with the poking genius
maybe youre poking for your bull friends
dont be a sap
i cant even face up at school the vps so hot for me
maybe youre looking to make good
im looking to find this big game the pins played not to gum it but just so when its tail jams in my back ill know who to bill for
you oughta ask him what you wanna know
he didnt tell me
tug loosens his grip
brendan gasps for air
brendan contd when a gee im paid to side with wont give me the straight that makes me nervous
makes me angry
tug draws back a bit
tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of brendan
there was ten of them
i dont know where he picked them he didnt tell me
so we get ten kils of brock there aint enough marks in the whole burgh to eat that
so he unloads eight of em up way north even up to the docks
i dont know who
didnt tell you
that was eight
so thats the tenth in there
we gotta break it into doses sell em off round the high maybe some by shorecliffs
what about the ninth brick
there were problems with that
he stops thinking harder than hes used to
his scar reddens slightly then he jerks out of his trance
tugger contd quickly it disappeared
someone skimmed it
we started raising hell with all the likely suspects and whatayaknow it came back
but it came back bad
one of ours took a dose off the top and it laid him out
yeah poor frisco
you heard about that
well track down the rat
just takes time
i heard something fell with emily kostich
dont know her
a quiet pause
tugs scar reddens a bit more
has the pin talked about her
not to me
yeah he might know something
tell me what he says cause if you heard something you know i wanna check
the screen door swings open enter the pin
if hes surprised he doesnt show it
just shooting the shat
yeah just shooting it
his big foot clunks on the linoleum
he eyes a very sick looking brendan
pin contd you alright soldier
brendan moves a hand dismissively sniffling
pin contd so tug i got a call
someone who says they know something about emily
where shes at now
says wed want to know
wants to meet
so well meet him
to brendan emily was tugs girl for awhile
you know emily didnt you
a while back
youve heard shes missing
yeah i heard that
so maybe you want to come along too
what has emily got to do with you
looks at tugger show maybe well find out
he gives a slip of paper to tugger
pin contd four oclock
tugger glances at the slip then slides it to brendan
it has the symbol drawn in pencil a horn honks outside
thats my ride
the pin calls after him as he leaves
brendan falls into lauras idling car
roughly a payphone anywhere
what brendan throws the car into drive and they jerk forward
the mobile customer you have called is away from the phone brendan slams the phone down violently and walks back towards the car
his legs quiver and a coughing fit hits
hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees
lauras arms wrap around him except it isnt laura its emily
brendan spins backwards into emily kissing his mouth her hair around him but it isnt her hair its lauras
brendan shoots upwards and sits up with a jolt
laid out in the back seat laura dabbing his head with a wet napkin
barks shakily what time is it
lie down brendan what time youve got a fever youve got to go to the hospital or what time is it
youve got to rest youre feverish
he throws himself out of the car
brendan falls to his knees coughing
get back in the car im taking you home youre sick you need shut up
he keeps yelling that until she does
his head spins
brendan contd okay youve got to what youve got to do is drive around to the carrows lot
ill be up on the the blacktop the basketball field
so youve got to go by you or me to get down there
if you see anyone but the pin or tugger or their crew go down into the ravine honk four times long short long short
but dont be seen
get back in the car
will you do it
i need you to do this
i need you here
he holds her shoulders
a beat then her face registers resignation
a flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball courts faintly outlined across its surface
brendan stands crooked watching the barren horizon
the wind blows bitterly and the sky is dark
then a speck
coming towards brendan across the field
brendan slumps towards it
still a dark dot
brendans face snaps into recognition
what are you doing dode
he holds a newspaper
you gonna stop me
what do you think youre doing dode
i saw you
i saw what you did
whatd you see
i saw you
whatd you see me
you were with her dead and you took the body
yeah i did
thats all you saw
what about before
did you see who killed her before i got there
face ashen you killed her
i found the body dode
you i thought you didnt but we figured out i got the news on ya cause you hid the body why wouldnt whos we
youre always talking always this and that smartso youre gonna shut up now
i didnt kill her dode
youre not going to talk this
dode i know youre thinking of em i know you tried to help her shut up
youre gonna shut your brendan staggers the world blurs out for a moment then snaps back
dode contd put it over real nice so im telling you now youre in over your head you dont want to put your hand in this dode shakes the newspaper
shes dead you why was she scared dode
she came to me who was she scared of
i think i know why i just gotta know who
dode throws the paper which scatters in the wind
youre trying to confuse me
you couldnt stand it
your little em
she was gonna keep it it was mine and you couldnt stand that
what was yours
i had you pegged
what was yours
i loved her
and i woulda loved the kid
im gonna bury you
brendans face is empty
dode walks stiffly away
brendan puts a hand on his shoulder but shrinks back in a coughing spasm
dode grabs brendans wrist and hits him in the face
brendan hits the pavement
bright clouds sharp light
emily flies towards us glowing then dimmer her wings splutter out the clouds turn gray and we are looking at emilys picture in the newspaper article
brendan pulls the newspaper off his face lying in a fetal position
dode is nowhere to be seen
slowly painfully brendan hoists himself up
he coughs and splutters barely able to keep his footing
he limps across the field
every step is agony
the wind blows against him
the black field seems impossibly long still he keeps limping forward towards the ravine
brendan slides down the embankment landing on his feet
gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are tugger the pin five of tuggers flunkies and dode in the middle
everyone looks at brendan
a long silence
brendan clears his throat
whatd i miss
dode here says emily kostich is dead
nobody reacts to that
brendans face is placid
he says he knows who did it
he says he knows where the bodys at
beat of silence and he says he wants more money than i think the informations worth
that so dode
to the pin so walk
whats the info have to do with you anyways
plenty he says
and he wants cash on the nail
hes a pot skulled reef worm with more hop in his head than blood
why pay for dirt you cant believe
youll believe this
shrugs maybe you will
youll believe it cause its someone close to you
the pin looks up at brendan whose face is loose and nonchalant
maybe its hot but its dode you cant trust it
tuggers eyes are locked on dode his scar the color of raw liver
brendan laughs and turns away
im getting my shoes wet for this
let him milk you if you want
to brendan stay
to dode its still too much
no its not
you wont complain when you hear it
tugger twists a stick in his hands
brendan watches him curious
murmurs so maybe you should
you had her against the wall with the brick i know my business
its still too much
with growing confidence its not cause thats not why she was killed and its real important to you cause the person who killed hers real close and cause hes got
a lot to lose and he knows if i dont bury him by spilling to you i spill to the bulls and bury him for real and hes really really scared she had a kid in her and he couldnt stand tugger springs like a cat
he grabs dodes hair and knees his face
brendan stumbles towards them
tug its alright
tug has dode on the ground kicking his stomach and chest
tug backs off
dode raises his head
tug pulls the gun from his jacket
brendan yells slips and falls into the shallow water
tug levels the gun at dodes head and fires one shot
the back of dodes skull comes off
the rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind them and birds fly out
dode remains upright for a moment then falls limp into the water
the pins face is stupid lifeless
tug turns to him gun in hand
pin contd thickly tug
tugger fires dirt kicks up and the pin scrambles back
brendan crawls towards tug yelling for him to stop
tug fires twice more both misses and the pin is away
brendans vision blurs
he stumbles and falls into the shallow water
brendans eyes open watch it sleepily then sharpen
brendan sits up in the bed
tugger sits in a chair bedside smoking
brendan watches him for a long moment in the rooms dim light
she sprung it on me just
thats a hell of a thing to spring on a guy
i dont remember much
laura talked me down after said whatever she knew her said it wasnt true but i still think sometimes
i think bout it being true
bout it being mine
and maybe i did it cause i thought it was true
a hell of a thing
brendan stares at him through cold empty eyes
tugger contd you up
you werent doing too good there for awhile
laura said take you you know hospital but i couldnt
whats the stats
everyones just laying low
youre here with us at my folks place
the bulls got dode fore the tide took his body
yeah strong tide wouldve taken the body like out to sea
it can do that
but the fuzz got there first
tugger contd so everyones assuming its war but no ones said it yet
everyones lying low
youre with us
the hell i am
brendan swings his legs over the bed
tug steps in front of him staring him down
brendan contd alright im with you
so just lie low
sleep some more
laura she said you should sleep
brendan runs his fingers through his hair steps into his shoes and hobbles out of the room
about ten more kids dressed like tug are cleaning guns
brendan nods to them
they nod back not paying much attention as he goes out the front door
on a lamplit street corner brendan leans against a payphone
on phone brendan
are you what man have you heard about dode i was there
you where were you yesterday
kasprzyk took my phone turned it off
i just now got it back
alright listen are you okay
is my name in the papers with the story
is it just dode in the papers
what do you mean
listen im going to be calling you tonight probably late
sleep with your phone on
could you get a car if you needed to
if its late enough i could take my moms be ready then
brendan kicks in the door
kara sits in front of the mirror in a soft pink robe a boy on the floor beside her
did you hear about dode
you scheming tramp
you set that poor kid up you hid him fed him your tale
you got info from laura and held dode like a card till you could play him
brendan throws a chair
the boy stands
i dont know what youre talking about
youd bury me at the same time but it was mostly for the money
you got dode thinking em had his kid thinking i did it and that was enough for him but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in
him cause he couldnt come away from the deal without it and make you happy
sit down youre a mess
russ go get my shoes from the wardrobe locker would you sweetie
he goes trying to look mean at brendan
brendan and kara watch each other like caged rats
kara contd still wish you knew what you wanted to know
if its any consolation it probably wasnt dodes kid
it might have been tugs but frankly i wouldnt bet a horse it was a crowded field there at the end
brendan grabs a clock and throws it
karas mirror shatters revealing a grimy dark wall behind
kara contd meany
you want my tale brendan
i still know what dode was selling but id play it smart
a quick call from a payphone to copland they drag the tunnel and youre through
she comes very close to him
her robe falls open slightly
kara contd five thousand
i know you can get it from the pin but even if you cant i want it by first period tomorrow or i play my hand and bury you
she turns away lets her robe fall
kara contd now get out
brendans eyes burn
he lunges at her
drama geeks sit in groups
the dressing room door flies open and kara flies out stark naked
brendan flies out after her
what are you doing
showing your ace
brendan storms out
also on the dvd
fine retailers everywhere
brendan walks past the bird of prey mailbox
a voice from the screen door far enough
everyones paying social calls
beat of silence
so what are the stats
the stats are war soon as the press heat dies
and if youre with him youre with him
tug got hot
tugs been after my digs from the get go
hes been anxious cause he thought if you found out he killed emily youd turn him over
he was right
i told him to get the straight no roughing
i wasnt even there
so hes a hot head
so you dont want him on your side at least lets have a pow wow fore we start digging trenches
maybe we can all walk away amiable enemies
what would it take
i dont know
wed have to square everything between us
he owes me some money
alright but we can talk
lets clear it all before it boils up again
youll be here
brendan turns away
she comes out of the house with her purse
laura contd ill drive you back
laura drives brendan stares at the passing lights
whats going to happen
laura contd do you feel better
weak i dont know
brendan stumbles in
tugs hands grab him roughly
for a smart guy you aint too smart
i said lay low
he drops brendan
laura kneels beside brendan feeling his forehead
she was at the pins
yeah shes our go between
so heres the sit
you and the pin are going to pow wow four oclock tonight his place
take all the muscle you want you wont need it
he wants to talk straight and youre going to work with him for whatever he needs cause you dont want war

the pins sitting on the brick profits hitting him now would be post
make peace and wait for your chance
hes right tug
smooth it out
between coughs besides hes got you on the dode thing
warll mean you vs
him and every bull in the burgh
tugger turns away thinking
yeah well talk
to brendan you going
brendan stumbles into the bedroom
brendan lies on his back
sweat stands on his forehead
spinning dizzily from brendans pov
then the fan is still and the room is spinning then the fan then the room
brendan clamps his eyes shut
a door creaks open
croaks go away
laura floats across the room to him
her hair falls around him
brendan shrinks back
she puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead
brendan tries to speak but cannot
he fingers slide over his face
she pulls off his glasses
her hands all over his face
brendans throat contorts in a hard swallow
his eyes are wet
her hair her hands all warm and gentle touching him
im sorry brendan
in silent sobs first then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms
spinning above them
laura lights a cigarette
they lie beside each other
dont go tonight
ive got to make sure it plays out smooth
itll play however it plays without you there
ive got to make sure
cause if theres war im in it too
well lets just i mean why not just run away
ive got a car
brendan gives a wry look ive got an aunt in new orleans she wouldnt care
brendan grins yeah its a stupid thing but think about it why not
her smoke drifts into the fan
i wasnt serious but we could go for awhile
just until everything clears
brendan watches the smoke
she stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest
stretching his arm across the table he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger
his glasses lay on the table
through the left lens the cigarette is magnified
pale blue arrow on the filter
lauras arm stretches across his chest
he looks at it then up at the fan spinning
brendan slips out of bed
a glowing clock radio reads
a swarm of silent activity
tugs flunkies prepare various weapons
brendan goes to tug
tell your boys no knuckle business
theyre just ready
your folks left a car here
take it and lauras
brendan tosses tug the keys ill go first in yours
the hell ill take the scenic route to draw off any tailers
theyll think its you they might even radio back that youre alone
he tosses brendan his keys
got a cigarette
i dont smoke
ive seen you smoke
i dont smoke cigarettes
give me fifteen minutes then go
brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night
overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights
brendan talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang
on phone yeah
alright i warned you
can you get the car
go to clancy off pico west of la grange
park outside and wait
she hasnt got a car but if she blows on foot or gets a pick tail her
ill call you when it gets light
silence thanks brain
click brain hangs up
brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway limps up to the front door and knocks
one of the pins boys lets him in
crowded with tense looking punks half dressed like the pin and half like tugger
the pins mom is shuffling about pouring them milk
several more punks from both camps crowd the hall and more lean in the darkened doorways
brendan passes through quickly
the pin at his desk flanked by two of his boys
tug sits in the center of the room two of his punks beside him
brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser
i want full assurance that any heat from emily and dode is gonna be on just you
i dont even want my name pulled in the shindig
second you owe me six cs no rush but i want your shake that itll come home in not too much time
tugs eyes burn his scar reddens
to tug thats square
you did them after all
lay low itll blow over
stick on this one of youll dish it to bury the other and youll both get the rap
as to the six did you borrow it
then you owe it
shouldnt need a shake on that
tug looks at the pin
alright to both
lets seal it up and blow for keeps
the last brick
brendan looks up sharply taken off guard
that aint the point
im gonna start selling it
how do i know it aint bad
why would it be
why was the last one
cause someone got greedy
tug heres had the means to swipe half and cut it bad for a long time
now were splits my loss of trusts retroactive
did you tug
eyes hot on the pin no
alright so lets shake and blow
not good enough
tug shoots to his feet kicking away his chair
what would be good enough
i wanna see him dose it
just to prove it
then were square
hell for that
i didnt touch your junk thats it
i wanna see it
your not wanting to dose its telling me something right here
yeah it better be
its telling that im out from your thumb that i aint playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple no more
everyone in the room is on their feet
brendan steps forward
ill dose it
all eyes to him unbelieving
if itll shut you two apes up ill take the dose and if i dont die were all right as rain and if i do die you two have your
war so long as you keep it off my grave
johnny go with him
tug just stares at brendan then tosses his hands up slightly and turns away
they all wait
from the next room
more breaking then scuffling and shouting
the two punks look at their bosses then run out
tug starts to follow but brendan holds him back
the noise through the wall grows tremendous a full brawl
the ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies hitting the ground
then from not too far away a gunshot
the pin stands and goes towards the door but brendan shouts brendan contd no
and slams it shut
a few tense seconds
footfalls then tangles falls through the door his chest red
the pin bends over him
gasping the brick its gone
the bricks gone
tangles stops gasping
the pin stands eyes blazing at tug
make peace huh
talk it out
get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose
tugs scar is fiery red
he coils his body snarling
no thats not was it bad tug
snag it so i dont know or sell it off to flat the war odds
shouts pin think about it alright i did all that
tug blows past brendan like a train and slams the pin into the ground with his fist
he punctuates his words with hard straight blows into the pins face
tugger contd i cut the brick i stole the money i faked a peace i snagged your junk i did it all
he pulls the gun
brendan shouts and throws himself on tugs arm wrenching it sideways
the gun clunks onto the carpet
the pin flips tug over and for a moment brendan is caught between them hit and torn rolling over the gun
tug grabs it brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off firing into the ceiling
brendan screams thrashing wildly and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two
the pin is on top pinning tugs gun hand to the carpet straining to keep it there
brendan leaps to his feet staggers then winds up and kicks tug in the wrist with all his strength
a terrible crunching popping sound
brendan takes the gun from his limp hand
brendan backs off a few steps
the pin strains to keep tug down
pin contd do him now
brendan stumbles back
tug roars flips the pin over and beats his face mercilessly
brendan stumbles out into the hall
from the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling relentless sounds of fighting
brendan walks backwards as if in a trance eyes glued to the pins door
inside wild shadows splay across the walls and the pin shouts brendans name
light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall beside brendan splinters
brendan spins on his heel and fires three shots into the darkness which falls silent
he turns the gun back on the pins doorway
with a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark
they broke the lamp
the dark doorway looms up before brendan inky black
horrible sounds come from it blows breaking bone screams
the pin screams brendans name over and over calling for help
brendan steps back
time slows down
brendan drops the gun
it thunks on the carpet
in one motion brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the pins doorway turns and runs into the room where he found the brick
brendan runs through clawing past dark fighting shapes running like a man possessed
he breaks through the darkness and heaves himself up through the small window
brendan scrambles out slips on the grass and hits the ground hard
two sharp gunshots come from the house
everything is suddenly still
brendan stands slowly
he notices a light from the mustang the trunk has drifted open
inside a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic
cheap plastic bracelets
brendan shuts the trunk solidly then walks off down the street and vanishes into the inky night
a moment later police cars pull up sirens blaring lights turning the dark streets bright as day
the morning is cold and clammy
brendan slumps against the payphone
where are you
on phone library
where are you
did she blow last night
stayed there till six thirty then walked to school
you didnt give her a ride did you
but she came straight to school from tugs
she there now
not with me but here
tell her i wanna meet up on the basketball field in half an hour then go home and get some sleep
brendan hangs up then pauses lost in thought
brendan sits against the massive gym building writing on a piece of looseleaf paper
brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled vp offices
wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes
brendan stands crookedly hands in pockets eyes trained on the cold black horizon
a speck appears
brendan waits for it bracing himself against the wind
she puts her arms around him a warm embrace
brendan draws back
softly did you see it all
with tug and the pin
brendan looks at her a moment
i took your advice and didnt go
laura looks at him strangely a little uneasy
the papers say six dead three around the house one girl in the trunk of tugs car and the pin and tug
brendans face is frozen in an ambiguous frown
tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there
they tied him to dode too
and the girl
well good thing you werent there
lauras face softens a bit
you think the girl was emily
laura embraces him again and doesnt let go
you loved her
distant yeah i did
you did all this cause you loved her
and now its finished
tightens her embrace i love you
laura pulls back looks at his face
it is a mask
no its not finished
tug pulled the trigger on em and he got the fall but the bulls coulda found that out without me
laura pulls back more
brendan contd i set out to know who put her in the spot who put her in front of the gun
that was you angel
drifting back further what are you talking about
it was you
what you want the whole tale
you want me to tell it to you
bewildered tell it to me
alright from the top
you had your fingers in brad bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the pin who you were hooked with
emily came to you and brad you saw her for what she was an insecure little girl trying to get in
she goes on the backburner
meanwhile maybe youre getting bored maybe just greedy so when the pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot
you hook one take half and cut it back to size but you cut it bad
maybe accidentally maybe to down the pins operation doesnt matter
you put it back but poor frisco doses off it and lands in a coma
voice strengthening so now the pins fuming maybe hes jealous of brad so he comes to brads crowd looking for blood or at least a scape
you know trouble
theres going to be a war over this
and theres emily
she trusts you
she wants in
its duck soup
you frame her for the bad brick then you cut her loose
you turn on your heel and bite her in the throat
last week on the payphone pico and alexander she saw something she was scared of
tugs car driving by the pin driving but she wouldnt have seen the pin
no she was across the street angel
she saw the passenger side
she saw you
she saw you and ran like she saw some devil
lauras face is very still quivering
brendan why are you and she took the hit
dode hid her away but the pin was on to her tracked her down told her to meet him that they would make good
gave her a time and a place
and sent tug
just to get the straight
but maybe you had talked tug up or maybe he just blew a fuse but em sprung it on him that she had her kid and he did what anyone
could count on tug doing he hit her
she took the hit for you
you let her take it
thats the tale
youre going to tell me its not
look at me
she crumples against him looking him straight in the eye
you know me
ive only helped you
how can you it isnt true
she sobs through a tensed straight face
brendan holds her stare but his eyes are distant
i hope it isnt
i want you to have been on my side all along not just trying to get me under your thumb like brad and the pin and tug
no but i think you knew that meeting was going to blow up
i think that was your final play
but i hope im wrong
i hope everything i wrote in the note i dropped at gary truemans office this morning is wrong
about your and brads involvement in the pins runnings
i hope you didnt steal the brick last night
in your purse
breathes i didnt
that means you didnt let me walk into a slaughterhouse
you didnt lead tug and the pin and their crews to the slaughter
and when trueman reads the note takes my cue and searches your locker he wont find a damn thing
something changes in lauras eyes
trueman and several other men force lauras locker open
from its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out spins through the air and shatters silently on the locker cage floor
a moment of silence between them
the basketball nets jangle
laura steps back
she looks as if she has been punched in the face
gently its done
her face does strange things subtle contortions
she watches his eyes
he doesnt look at her
her voice shakes
thats most of it
i told em to tell tug it was his
told her it would soften him up
she said she wished she could keep it but she didnt love the father
i was going to drive her down the next day wed found a doctor
she was starting to show
you know whose kid that makes it or have you known all along
slowly steadily she straightens up
her figure takes back some dignity
she steps towards him deliberately
right up against him
she brings her head to his puts her lips to his ear breathes warm breath and says two words
the first is laura contd mother the second is low guttural and lost to the whistling wind
she turns and walks briskly away
brendan watches her go across the dark barren field of asphalt
brendan turns to see the brain hopping a chain link fence
brendan turns his eyes back on laura
you get your straight
i wouldnt have salright
chuck burns came to
the knife guy
spilled it all to the bulls guess brad bramish hired him
on his own just a grudge thing
nods slightly fits
you did good brain
yeah you too
the brain starts to walk away but turns back
the brain contd whatd she whisper to you
she called me a dirty word
alright you dont have to tell me
as what all
brendan stands alone on the asphalt field watching laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence
the first period bell rings and brendan walks back towards campus
