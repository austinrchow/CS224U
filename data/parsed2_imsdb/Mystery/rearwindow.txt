by john michael hayes based on a short story by cornell woolrich final draft december although we do not see the foreground window frame we see the whole background of
a greenwich village street
we can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross town street sharply etched by the morning sun
some are two stories high others three some have peaked roofs others are flat
there is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction
the apartment buildings have fire escapes the others do not
the neighborhood is not a prosperous one but neither is it poor
it is a practical conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes luck or hope and careful planning
the summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat
it has opened windows wide pushed back curtains lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy
yet people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other
except on direct invitation
the camera pulls back until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen
it is so large that we do not see any features but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running
the camera pans off this to the right hand side of the window and moves to a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window
the camera moves on into the open and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window
we are able to see inside this room
a short balding man is standing near the window shaving using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf
to the right of him is a battered upright piano
on top of the piano is a radio
the music selection coming from the radio stops and the announcer is heard
the time a
wor new york
the temperature outside friends is your life worth one dollar
the man shaving quickly puts down his razor hurries to the radio and changes the station moving past a number of commercial voices until he again finds some music
contented he returns to his shaving
the camera moves on and over to a far building
it passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes
it goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor bedroom of a couple
we are near enough to see an alarm clock hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously
a man rises lazily to a sitting position
he gropes to switch the alarm off
we see that his pajamas are stained with sweat
in his sitting position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him
to our surprise the head of this other person a woman rises where his feet are
they have been sleeping in opposite directions
they sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night
the camera now moves down toward the left onto another low building
it moves in a little to a living room window
just inside the windowsill a small fan is oscillating
the fan sits on the right side of the table and to the left of it is an automatic toaster
behind the toaster stands a full bodied young woman apparently wearing only a pair of black panties
her stomach navel and the lower part of her chest are naked
just below her breasts the curtain partly drawn has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward hiding her breasts shoulders and head
two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster
she takes them out butters them
then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee maker
she picks up the coffee maker and swings back to the table to sit down
she does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed but hidden by the fan as she sits down
the fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee far enough to reveal that she wears no bra but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her
lack of clothes
the camera moves on to a distant street corner seen between two buildings
the traffic is very light at this hour but a sanitation department truck moves through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust
three little kids in bathing suits run behind the truck playing in the water
the camera moves off and around to some buildings at the side
as it skims this building we see a hand emerge from one of the windows and remove the cover from a birdcage which is hanging from a hook on the
in the cage are two lovebirds arguing
the camera now pulls back swiftly and retreats through the open window back into jefferies apartment
we now see more of the sleeping man
the camera goes in far enough to show a head and shoulders of him
he is l
a tall lean energetic thirty five his face long and serious looking at rest is in other circumstances capable of humor passion naive wonder and the kind of intensity that
bespeaks inner convictions of moral strength and basic honesty
he is sitting in an everest and jennings wheelchair
the camera pans along his right leg
it is encased in a plaster of paris spica from his waistline to the base of his toes
along the white cast someone has written here lie the broken bones of l
the camera pans to a nearby table on which rests a shattered and twisted speed graphic camera the kind used by fast action news photographers
on the same table the camera pans to an eight by ten glossy photo print
it shows a dirt track auto racing speedway taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track
a racing car is skidding toward the camera out of control spewing a cloud of dust behind it
a rear wheel has come off the car and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly into the camera lens
the camera moves up to a framed photograph on the wall
it is a fourteen by ten print an essay in violence having caught on film the exploding semi second when a heavy artillery shell arches into a front line korean
men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a solution of blasted rock dust and screeching shrapnel
that the photographer was not a casualty is evident but surprising when the short distance between the camera and the explosion is estimated
a signature in the lower right hand corner of the picture reads l
the camera pans to a second photograph of a picket line at an aircraft plant strike
strikers non strikers and police are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot
clubs fists and truncheons swing blood flows faces twist with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their feet
the picture represents no distant cautions photographic observation but rather an intimate report so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he
had best defend himself
the same signature l
jefferies is in the corner
the camera pans to another framed picture this one a beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at frenchmans flat nevada
it is the cul de sac of violence
the picture taken at a distant observation point shows some spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through binoculars
the camera moves on to a shelf containing a number of cameras photographic film etc
it then pan across a large viewer on which is resting a negative of a womans head
from this the camera moves on to a magazine cover and although we do not see the name of the magazine we can see the head on the cover is
the positive of the negative we have just passed
the camera finally comes to rest on a pile of magazines perhaps a hundred or so
they are all of the same publication
the screen is filled with the top of a desk
in addition to the usual telephones blotting pad etc
the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints and even larger sized mat prints
some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions
the center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page
behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk
the camera pans up and we are now face to face with ivar gunnison and jack bryce
gunnison is sitting on a window ledge and beyond him we realize we are high above the new york streets
bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him
gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand
bryce has a cigarette in his mouth
he scratches a match and is about to light it when he notices that gunnison still reading the cable has reached into an inside shirt pocket and produced a cigarette
quickly bryce moves over to light gunnisons cigarette
then he settles back to light his own
gunnison doesnt even bother to thank him
looks up indo china jeff predicted it would go sky high
from the looks of davidsons cable it might even go higher than that
and we havent even got a camera over there
stands this could go off in a month or an hour
ill pull somebody out of japan
heads for his phone bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town
picks up phone get me l
to bryce still holding phone name me a better photographer
he cant but his leg
dont worry it comes off today
bryce gives gunnison a startled look
i mean the cast
to phone shooting through the open window onto jeff
he is shaving himself with an electric razor as the phone rings
he shuts off the shaver picks up the phone
on filter congratulations jeff
for getting rid of that cast
who said i was getting rid of it
at this moment his attention is drawn to something across the way
he looks up expectantly
there is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression
while jeff is continuing his phone conversation we see the object of his look
two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof
they are smiling and talking although we cannot hear their dialogue
each wears a terrycloth robe
with their backs to the camera they take off the robes slipping them down over their shoulders slowly
then seductively they turn revealing the full beauty of their tanned and bathing suited bodies
it is almost as if they want to be noticed the center of neighborhood attention
they at least have all of jeffs attention
then they spread the robes in front of them and lie down on the roof and out of sight
jeff seems a little disappointed
during the whole of this previous action the conversation between jeff and gunnison has gone on as follows with logical proof this is wednesday
gunnison how did you get to be such a big editor with such a small memory
next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon
thats too bad jeff
well i guess i cant be lucky every day
forget i called
i sure feel sorry for you gunnison
must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week
gunnison is now seated at his desk with the phone receiver to his ear
his assistant bryce can be seen vaguely in the background
that one week is going to cost me my best photographer and you a big assignment
jeff asks eagerly and alertly
we hear gunnisons reply
theres no point in even talking about it
jeffs eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees
jeffs attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment
the camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan
loud ballet music is pouring from her open window
the girl now dressed in dark and revealing leotard and ballet slippers has just turned away from a portable record player
she begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation
she gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance toward the ice box
with her feet still moving she throws open the door and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room gnaws the chicken bone occasionally waving it in the
air as part of the choreography
she now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices some butter nearby
with swaying body she puts down the chicken leg and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread
she picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg
jeffs eyes drop from the ballet dancers room to the one underneath
the camera pans from the window of the dancing girl to the window below
someone is reading the new york herald tribune
the paper lowers and we see an elderly lady in her late sixties
she is a faded refined type
she looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid
she resumes her reading
jeff is amused by what he sees but continues his conversation with gunnison which has gone on through all the scenes with the ballet dancer
filter indo china
got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning
the place is about to go up in smoke
pleased excited didnt i tell you
didnt i tell you it was the next place to watch
on filter okay
when do i leave
with that cast on you dont

ill take pictures from a jeep
from a water buffalo if necessary
youre too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with
ill send morgan or lambert
i get myself half killed for you and you reward me by stealing my assignments
i didnt ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
a little angry you asked for something dramatically different
you got it
quietly so did you
wont let him hang up youve got to get me out of here
six weeks sitting in a two room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors
at this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing
it is a simple but broken melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano or carefully composing a song
it clashes abruptly with the music from the ballet dancers apartment
it irritates jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music
its worse than the chinese water torture
we now see the source of the piano music
it comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio
the short balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack
he continues this process fighting the interference of the ballet music
the opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear catching
it is slow hard work and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancers apartment
he stands by a table at the window which is littered with records the morning coffee cup unwashed the remains of breakfast old newspapers song sheets etc
he takes a cigarette out of his mouth looks for an ash tray and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup
he then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player
jeff frowns at the double sound and raises his voice a little
he continues the conversation which has been heard all through the previous scene
read some good books
ive been taking pictures so long i dont know how to read anymore
ill send you some comic books
low tense listen if you dont pull me out of this swamp of boredom ill do something drastic
on filter ill ill get married
then ill never be able to go anywhere
its about time you got married before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man
can you see me rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry the electric dishwasher the garbage disposal and a nagging wife
jeff wives dont nag anymore they discuss
jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees we see a three storied flat roofed apartment house
the brick is weather worn and faded
each apartment has three windows facing the back one showing a hallway one a living room and the window on the right opening into a bedroom
on the second floor a man has entered the living room from a hallway door
he carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen
he sets down the case heavily removes his hat and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand
he takes off his coat and tie
his shirt is stained with sweat underneath
he rolls up his sleeves and his well muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark husky build
with his eyes still focused on the distant apartments jeff continues talking with gunnison
maybe in the high rent districts they discuss but in my neighborhood they still nag
well you know best
call you later jeff
next time have some good news
he hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman
the salesman looks toward the bedroom door hesitates then reluctantly walks toward it
for a moment he is hidden by the wall
jeff shifts his look more to the right
the man enters the bedroom
we can see a woman lying on the far bed
near her a small table is covered with medicine bottles spoons boxes of pills a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill
the woman sits up as the man enters
she takes a wet cloth off her forehead
before the man even reaches her she begins talking somewhat vigorously
pointing to a wristwatch she seems to be saying something such as you should have been home two hours ago
i could be lying here dying for all youd know or care
the man stops short of the bed makes gestures of trying to placate her but she goes on scolding
his attitude changes to weary patience then irritation then anger
he shouts back at her turns and goes out of the room
back in the living room he picks up his hat throws it against the wall in anger and leaves the apartment slamming the door behind him
jeffs attention is suddenly diverted to himself
his leg under the cast begins itching
he squirms tries to move the leg a little
it gives no relief
he scratches the outside of the cast but the itch gets worse
he reaches for a long chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill
carefully and with considerable ingenuity he works it under the cast
he scratches and a look of sublime relief comes over his face
satisfied he takes the scratcher out
as he replaces it on the windowsill his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window
we see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard
he is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie
in one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake and in the other a pair of trimming shears
he goes to a small patch of flowers perhaps three feet square
they are beautiful multi colored three foot high zinnias
he kneels down inspects them touches them affectionately and with some pride
his anger seems to have left him replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people
he stands up carefully hoes the ground them rakes it
then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant
finally he waters them
jeffs attention is turned to something else of interest
into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer the elderly lady
she wear a broad sun hat dark glasses and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter
she carries a copy of the herald tribune and still wears her hearing aid
she settles into a folding canvas deck chair
her skin is dead white and her body is thin to the point of emaciation
no sooner has she settled into her chair than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden
she gets up walks to the fence and looks over
he notices her but doesnt speak
she begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers
he listens for a moment then looks directly at her
the strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments
she moves away from the fence started and a little shocked
jeff is seated in the foreground in a waist shot
behind him the entrance door to his apartment opens
stella mcgaffery comes in
she is a husky unhandsome dark haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse with dark coat dark felt hat with a white uniform showing underneath the coat
she carries a small black bag
stella pauses on the landing to watch jeff
he doesnt appear to notice her entrance
loud the new york state sentence for a peeping tom is six months in the workhouse
he doesnt turn
as she comes down the stairs of the landing holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand and there arent any windows in the workhouse
she puts her bag down on a table
it is worn and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse
she takes off her hat coat and hangs them on a chair
years ago they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker
is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker
he doesnt answer
she opens the bag takes out some medical supplies a thermometer a stop watch a bottle of rubbing oil a can of powder a towel
she talks as she works
weve grown to be a race of peeping toms
what people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once in a while
she looks up at him what do you think of that for homespun philosophy
a look at his face shows he doesnt think much of it
readers digest april
well i only quote from the best
she takes the thermometer out of its case shakes it down
looks at it
satisfied she walks to jeff
she swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her
jeff starts to protest
now look stella she shoves the thermometer into his mouth
see it you can break a hundred
as she leaves him holding the thermometer the camera pulls back as she crosses to a divan
she takes a sheet from underneath and covers the divan with it
talking all the time
i shoulda been a gypsy fortune teller instead of an insurance company nurse
i got a nose for trouble can smell it ten miles away
stops looks at him you heard of the stock market crash in
jeff nods a bored yes
i predicted it
around thermometer how
stella stops for a moment and looks at jeff challengingly
i was nursing a director of general motors
kidney ailment they said
nerves i said
then i asked myself whats general motors got to be nervous about
snaps her fingers overproduction
collapse i answered
when general motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day the whole countrys ready to let go
a patient suffering look comes over his face
he takes out the thermometer
stella in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market
it crashed didnt it
jeff has no answer
defeated he puts the thermometer back into his mouth
stella goes on with her work
i can smell trouble right in this apartment
you broke your leg
you look out the window
you see things you shouldnt
i can see you now in front of the judge flanked by lawyers in blue double breasted suits
youre pleading judge it was only innocent fun
i love my neighbors like a father
the judge answers congratulations
you just gave birth to three years in dannemora
the camera pans her over to him
she takes out the thermometer looks at it
right now id even welcome trouble
flatly youve got a hormone deficiency
how can you tell that from a thermometer
those sultry sun worshipers you watch havent raised your temperature one degree in four weeks
she gets down the thermometer
sterilizes it with a piece of alcohol soaked cotton in her other hand
she gets behind the wheelchair the camera pulls back as she pushes it over to the divan
she puts the thermometer away in its case
then she helps him off with his pajama top
she helps him stand on one foot
he hops one step then she lowers him face down on the divan
she gets a bottle of rubbing oil
the camera is very low at one end of the divan
jeffs head half buried in the sheet is large in the fore ground
beyond him stella looms large and powerful looking
i think youre right
there is going to be some trouble around here
stella takes a handful of oil slaps it on his back
i knew it
dont you ever heat that stuff up
gives your circulation something to fight
begins massaging his back what kind of trouble
you must be kidding
a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
she expects me to marry her
i dont want to
slaps cold oils on him thats abnormal
wincing im not ready for marriage
a man is always ready for marriage with the right girl
and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open
indifferent shes all right
she hits him with some more cold oil
he winces again
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause
peers at him what is it
you have a fight
after a pause her father loading up the shotgun
its happened before you know
some of the worlds happiest marriage have started under the gun you might say
shes just not the girl for me
shes only perfect
too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything but what i want
cautiously is what you want something you can discuss
jeff gives an exasperated look
its very simple
she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties
people with sense can belong wherever theyre put
can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a weeks salary in the bank
almost to himself if only she was ordinary
stella sprinkles powder on his back spreads it around
the camera pulls back as she helps jeff to a sitting position
he buttons on his shirt
youre never going to marry
but when i do itll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress a lobster dinner and the latest scandal
i need a woman wholl go anywhere do anything and love it
the camera moves in as she helps him into the wheelchair listening to him with exaggerated attention
he stops as he notice her attitude
then he goes on with less conviction the only honest thing to do is call it off
let her look for somebody else
i can just hear you now
get out of here you perfect wonderful woman
youre too good for me
after pause thats the hard part
she swings him around in front of the window
he starts to look out
im not educated
im not even sophisticated
but i can tell you this when a man and a woman see each other and like each other they should come together wham like two taxies on broadway
not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle
theres an intelligent way to approach marriage
nothing has caused the human race more trouble
jeff swings his chair back to look at her
weve progressed emotionally in interrupting baloney
once it was see somebody get excited get married now its read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you cant tell a petting party from a
civil service exam people have different emotional levels that interrupting again ask for trouble and you get it
why theres a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years
then he refused to marry her
because she only scored sixty one on a look magazine marriage quiz
jeff cant help smiling
when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits
we still are
and weve loved every minute of it
thats fine stella
now would you make me a sandwich
okay but im going to spread some common sense on the bread
lisa fremonts loaded to her fingertips with love for you
ill give you two words of advice
smiles she pay you much
stella leaves for the kitchen in a huff
jeff turns his chair to the window
jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady and the man with the flowers
the elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair her face covered with the herald tribune
there is no sign of the man with the flowers
jeffs eyes travel up to the ballet dancers window
she is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror
dreamily and methodically she is brushing her long copper colored hair
his eyes are suddenly turned in another direction sharply to his left
he is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him
a shade has gone up and a man obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort
having accomplished this he turns back into the room and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway
he hands a key to the young man and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them
he gives them a studied but agreeable nod then departs
we now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit
the boy who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat
he takes off the hat and scales it over to a nearby chair
quickly they are in each others arms kissing passionately crushing the girls corsage and pushing her hat back a little
they part the boy laughs nervously and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor
he looks back into the room and beckons her to come out
she follows him wonderingly
for a moment both are lost from sight
when they reappear he is carrying her in his arms over the threshold
he sets her down closes the door and they kiss again
they part still holding hands and looking into each others eyes
then slowly and significantly she looks toward the open window
he releases her hands goes to the window and pull down the shade as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat
there is a soft understanding look on jeffs face and he gives an involuntary sigh
he is unaware that stella is now standing behind him
quietly window shopper
he freezes turns slowly to look up at her
the camera makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on
the camera pulls back into jeffs apartment until his head fills the screen
he is asleep
a shadow of some other person creeps over his face
his eyes start to open
he looks up
the screen is filled with the eyes nose and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the camera to kiss jeff
the face is more or less in shadow a faint light coming onto the profile from the window
it moves down until the lips move out of her bottom of her screen and just the remain for fill the screen
the two big profiles filling the screen
the girl kisses jeff firmly but not passionately
then her head moves back an inch or two
softly hows your leg
mmmm hurts a little
and your stomach
empty as a football
and you love life
not too active
anything else bothering you
she gives a low
warm laugh and the camera pulls back to show that lisa has been bending over jeffs wheelchair from the side
as she straightens up it pans her swiftly over to the corner of the room keeping her in big closeup
she turns on a low hanging light
we see her full facial beauty for the first time
it is a warm intelligent face
as she moves reading from top to bottom light on lisa the camera follows her quickly to another lamp
she gets a little farther away from us so that we now see her down to her waist
she turns on the second lamp and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face
carol the camera pans her over to a third lamp which she turns on
she is now full figure beautifully groomed and flawless
her dress is high style fashion and dramatic evening wear
jeff looks across the room at her
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice
only because its expected of her
she does a professional models turn in the dress showing off its features
right off the paris plane
think it will sell
jeff replies depends on the quote
lets see theres the plane tickets over import duties hidden taxes profit markups a steal at eleven hundred dollars
a low whistle that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
who buys them
she laughs pleasantly
even if i had to pay it would be worth it just for the occasion
she looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which is littered with a number of his personal effects
her own handbag is also on the table
as she talks her eyes scan the table as if shes looking for something specific
off puzzled something big going on somewhere
looking up from the table going on right here
its a big night
off its just a run of the mill monday
the calendars loaded with them
lisa finds what she has been looking for
picks up an old and cracked cigarette box examines it as she talks
its opening night of the last depressing week of l
jefferies in a cast
off hasnt been any big demand for tickets
she turns to look at him and moves toward him carrying the cigarette box
smiling thats because i bought out the house
this cigarette box has seen better days
lisa facing jeff in the chair
picked it up in shanghai which has also seen better days
its cracked and you never use it
and its too ornate
im sending up a plain flat silver one with just your initials engraved
now thats no way to spend your hard earned money
i wanted to jeff
a sudden intake of breath oh
she turns around quickly and dashes to the door dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes the camera panning with her
she goes up the two steps stops turns back to jeff
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the
you have perhaps an ambulance outside
she reaches for the doorknob turns it simply better than that
she swings open the door and stands to one side
framed in the doorway is middle aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar
hes carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin
his reaction is one of tender amusement
thank you for waiting carl
he smiles nods enters
he goes down the stairs as she follows
the camera goes with both of them
kitchens on the left
ill take the wine
he hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table
he moves toward the kitchen
good evening mr jefferies
carl goes into the kitchen
up to carl just put everything right in the oven carl
off yes maam
enthusiastically lets open the wine now
its a montrachet
appreciatively a big glassful
she moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet
produces two glasses hold them up
corkscrews on the right
she finds it
puts the glasses on the table uncovers the wine and begins screwing in the corkscrew
i couldnt think of anything more boring and tiresome than what youve been through
and the last week must be the hardest
yeah i want to get this thing off and get moving
struggling with cork well im going to make this a week youll never forget
carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven
he sets it down he sees lisa struggling with the corkscrew
let me madam
he takes out his own professional corkscrew quickly inserts it and levers the cork out
he deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine replacing the bottle in the wine bucket
lisa has opened her purse to produce some money in bills
she hands it to the waiter
this will take care of the taxi as well
carl without looking at the money puts it in his pocket
thank you miss fremont
he picks up the warning oven
have a pleasant dinner mr
carl goes up the stairs and out the door while the camera remains on lisa and jeff
she picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward jeff
she seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass
we notice that the outside is considerably darker by now and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside
they raise their glasses in a silent toast and sip the wine
the camera closes in until they are both in a tight tow shot
what a day ive had
not a bit
i was all morning in a sales meeting
then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne just over from paris
with some spy reports
back to the for lunch with the harpers bazaar people thats when i ordered dinner
then two fall showings twenty blocks apart
then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward were trying to get his next show
softly looking up to him then i had to dash back and change
mock seriousness one girl to another tell me what was slim hayward wearing
seriously she looked very cool
she had on a mint green she breaks off with a little laugh and a slight reproachful look at jeff
she sips her drink then says and to think i planted three nice items about you in the columns today
jeffs opinion of that is a short chuckle
you cant buy that kind of publicity
thats good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
how could i run it from say pakistan
she puts down her glass and slides along the window seat nearer to him the camera closing in
she looks up at him with a serious frankness
jeff isnt it time you came home
you could pick your assignment
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
as if he cant believe her you mean leave the magazine
for yourself and me
she adds eagerly i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow
fashion portraits jeff interrupts her with soft laughter
offended dont laugh
i could do it
thats what im afraid of
he gazes into space could you see me driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep wearing combat boots and a three day beard
he chuckles at the thought i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
looking directly at her lets not talk any more nonsense huh
she stands up
the camera pulls back
id better start setting up for dinner
she moves away behind him into the kitchen
jeff gives a sigh of relief exhaling his breath then looks down toward his legs in thought
he holds this attitude for just a moment then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his
neighborhood beyond his window
behind him we see the vague form of lisa bringing in a card table which she proceeds to unfold
jeffs attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not seen before
this belongs to a single woman about forty years of age
she lives alone
her apartment is below that of the salesman with the invalid wife
jeff leans forward with increased interest
behind him we get vague figure of lisa laying a cloth over the card table
a nearer view show us a more intimate picture of the woman jeff is concentrating on
she is thin and unattractive
at the moment she is putting on her make up in front of the bedroom mirror
she gives a half turn and picks up a pair of horn rimmed glasses which she puts on and leans nearer to her mirror
she picks up a lipstick and proceeds to paint her lips carefully
having completed her make up she takes off her glasses and surveys her face in the mirror
she stands up swings the skirt of her dress around admires herself in the mirror
she is quite flat chested and the dress hangs unattractively
she lifts her chin gives one last look and turns toward her living room
as if shes preparing to meet someone
without taking his eyes from the scene jeff picks up his wineglass and drinks
as he drinks his eyes move slightly over
the camera has panned slightly to the womans living room window
a small candle lit table is set up with dinner for two
the spinster sweeps into the room smiling
she goes to the door opens it and in pantomime admits an imaginary caller
she pretends to kiss him lightly take his hat and place the hat on a chair
then she shows him to a seat at the table disappears into an unseen kitchen and returns with a bottle and two glasses
she sits down pours two drinks
she lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man opposite her
jeff gives a faint sympathetic smile and subconsciously raises his glass in response
in the background lisa having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table is returning to the kitchen
having finished her drink the lonesome woman pours herself another one
then she starts to take a sip smiling across the table at her imaginary guest
she lowers the glass onto the table
the smile fades from her face as her head drops
suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob
jeff his glass in hand looks out sympathetically
he is unaware that lisa is standing behind him and is also watching this little drama
thats what is know as manless melancholia
nods agreement miss lonely hearts
at least thats something youll never have to worry about
you can see my apartment all the way up on rd street
not exactly but we have a little apartment here thats probably about as popular as yours
he points you of course remember miss torso
both of them swing their eyes a little to the left
the kitchen lining room combination of the ballet dancers apartment has now been made more presentable
the ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large chinese screen
all kitchen utensils have been put away replaced by more attractive effects and lamp light softens the surroundings
miss torso is now wearing a cocktail dress which shows off her figure to great advantage especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of
hors d oeuvres
she is the perfect hostess animated charming and with an added personal touch for each guest
she is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning
her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men one wearing black tie with a touch of grey in his hair a long island socialite a
young rather handsome actor in grey flannel suit and last a bright pleasant young man who might possibly be from wall street wearing a blue pin striped suit
the latter two are engaged in an animated conversation
the young man in the grey suit is showing the other young man some newspaper cuttings hes taken from his pocket
miss torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty
she takes it over to the window and starts to fill it
the man in the tuxedo follows her over with a casual glance toward the other two
he stands beside her as she makes the drink
he looks at his watch with some impatience and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time
she turns gives him a light kiss on his cheek as if shes telling him to be patient
instead of pacifying him it makes him more amorous and he puts an arm around her shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek
she turns to face him they look into each others eyes a moment and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips but only long enough so as to
attract the attention of the other two men
with a little admonishing look she moves away from him and makes him rejoin the other two
jeff turns and looks up to lisa with a grin
well she picked the most prosperous looking one
shes not in love with him or any of them
how can you tell that from here
you said it resembled my apartment didnt you
she moves away with a significant look to him
the camera moves in until jeff is in semi closeup alone
he ponders over her last remark then changes his look to another direction
the newlywedss apartment has the shades still drawn
although theres a light burning inside
there is a slight but warm smile on jeffs face as he looks at the drawn shade
his eyes move away from the newlyweds apartment and slowly explore the neighborhood to his right
he finds something of interest and stops to stare at it
his face sobers at what he sees
the salesmans apartment
we see both the living room and the bedroom
the salesman has prepared a dinner tray and is carrying it from the kitchen through the lining room into the bedroom
he places it on the lap of his wife sitting up in bed
he puts a couple of pillows behind her back to make her more comfortable
she doesnt bother to thank him but is busy examining the content of the tray
her attitude shows her dissatisfaction
nothing is right
its not what she wanted and its badly prepared
she begins criticizing him
he starts to answer her back but decides better of it and instead leaves the room
he goes to the kitchen reaches up to a wall cabinet takes down a bottle and pours himself a drink
then he returns to the lining room listens a moment
the wife is grudging beginning to eat the dinner
the husband quietly lifts a phone from the cradle and dials a number
jeff becomes completely absorbed with he sees
he leans forward a little
we get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made
whoever he has called answers
and instantly there is a marked change in his attitude
he relaxes smiles is warm
he talks softly perhaps guardedly with an occasional glance at the bedroom door
in the bedroom his wife has become aware of the call
quietly she moves the tray gets out of bed and goes to the bedroom door to listen
the wall hides her from our view
then suddenly she apparently opens the door because the living room we see her arm suddenly appear pointing at the man and the telephone
he speaks quickly into the phone and hangs up
his face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom
in the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed followed by the husband
she is laughing and he is answering her in angry tones
she climbs in bed laughing
the more she laughs the more angry he gets and the harder she laughs
finally he leaves the room goes into the living room back into the kitchen and has another drink
he stands there controlling an outburst of emotion and seems almost to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist
while jeff has been engaged in watching this little drama the sound of a piano has started
he now diverts his attention from the salesmans apartment to the source of the piano music
he turns his eyes in the direction of the composers apartment
through the studio window of the song writers apartment we see the man at work again on his original melody and he is farther along the line of the melody
it is beginning to take some shape and give promise of its full beauty
jeff listening to the composer
his head turns as lisas voice comes over emerging from kitchen wheres that music coming from
the camera quickly pull back as jeff swings his chair around
lisa is emerging from the kitchen carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor
in the studio apartment
probably had an unhappy marriage
putting down the food i think its enchanting
she pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table
we now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table and the rest of the room lights are out
almost as if it were being written especially for us
pleasantly no wonder hes having so much trouble with it
a faint shade of disappointment is seen on lisas face but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table
well at least you cant say the dinner isnt right
jeff looks at her soberly
lisa its perfect looks down at the food without enthusiasm as always
the brightness drains from lisas face and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table
lisa slowly helping jeff to lobster from the main dish
shooting over jeffs shoulder we see beyond him the divan bed upon which lisa is stretched out
there is one light burning behind lisas head
a fierce discussion is in progress
lisa gesticulates with her hands body and legs
there cant be that much difference between people and the way they live
we all eat talk drink laugh sleep wear clothes jeff raises both his hands
well now look lisa draws back one leg and points a finger challengingly
if youre saying all this just because you dont want to tell me the truth because youre hiding something from me then maybe i can understand theres nothing im hiding
its just that wont let him break in it doesnt make sense to me
whats so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldnt live in both places just as easily
some people can
now if youll let me explain ignores him what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures
its just like being a tourist on an endless vacation
thats your opinion
youre entitled to it but its ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special private little group of anointed people
jeff begin to get desperate
i made a simple but true statement and ill back it up if youll just shut up for a minute
lisa stretched out on the divan
she looks at him for a moment without speaking
then if your opinion is as rude as your manner im not sure i want to hear it
we see jeffs hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture
soothing her lisa simmer down will you
something starts her up again you cant fit in here i cant fit in there
according to you people should be born live an die on the same loud sharp lisa
lisa turns on her side and stares into the room angrily
after a moment of silence jeff says earnestly did you ever eat fish heads and rice
of course not
you might have to if you went with me
ever try to keep warm in a c at fifteen thousand feet at twenty below zero
lisa still looking out into the room and without turning says oh i do that all the time
whenever i have a few minutes after lunch
ever get shot at run over sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera
she doesnt answer obviously annoyed at the unnecessary questions
those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle and those nylons and six ounce lingerie quickly three
well theyd be very stylish in finland just before you froze to death
begin to get the idea
she turns at last and looks across at him
if theres one thing i know its how to wear the proper clothes
shooting over lisas shoulder and down her body with jeff in the chair beyond
jeff says as if remembering some old experience huh
try and find a raincoat in brazil
even when it isnt raining squints at her lisa on this job you carry one suitcase
your home is the available transportation
you sleep rarely bathe even less and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive
jeff you dont have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me im wrong
if anything im making it sound good
a thoughtful pause lets face it lisa
you arent made for that kind of a life
few people are
lisa realizes she is getting nowhere
youre too stubborn to argue with
jeff getting angry
im not stubborn
lisa with sarcasm
a lesser man would have told me it was one long holiday and i would have awakened to a rude disillusionment
jeff is definitely angry
now if you want to get vicious id be very happy to accommodate you
lisa starts to rise from the divan the camera panning up
she moves away from the camera into the center of the room as she says wearily no
i dont particularly want that
she turns faces him so thats it
you wont stay here i cant go with you
jeff looks across at her with some concern
it would be the wrong thing
lisa from jeffs viewpoint
you dont think either one of us could ever change
right now it doesnt seem so
lisa begins to move around the room assembling her possessions preparatory to leaving
she puts a comb and other effects into a handbag
she gets her stole
all this as she talks
simply im in love with you
i dont care what you do for a living
somehow i would just like to be part of it
jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it and remains silent
lisa pauses in the act of gathering her things together
and its deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine
i guess im not the girl i thought i was
theres nothing wrong with you lisa
you have the town in the palm of your hand
looks at jeff not quite it seems
tosses a stole over her shoulder goodbye jeff
you mean goodnight
i mean what i said
jeffs eyes follow her up the steps toward the door
he calls out to her impulsively as we hear the sound of the door opening
lisa turns in the half opened door
cant we just sort of keep things status quo
without any future
jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand
well whenll i see you again
lisa standing in the open doorway
not for a long time
not at least until she begins smiling tomorrow night
continues smiling as she close the door softly behind her
the pleasantness on jeffs face slowly melts into baffled discouragement
he reaches for a nearby phone picks up the receiver dials
it buzzes on filter
receiver up on filter
is that you jeff
the word is everything
now what time does my plane leave tuesday
unhappy jeff wont give him time to argue i dont care where it goes just as long as im on it
wearily after pause okay
well pick you up
thats more like it
goodnight old buddy
jeff hangs up looks up to the door through which lisa left
hes not particularly happy
jeff returns to the window
he lights a cigarette and smokes it peacefully as he contemplates the neighborhood
the camera slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an odd window lit here and there
in the distant street there is still some traffic passing with one or two pedestrians going by
the camera completes its sweep and starts to move back again
somewhere a dog howls
the panning camera comes to a sudden halt
jeff smiles a little but as the howl continues his expressions sobers
his eyes begin to scan the neighborhood as if looking for the source
he fails to find it and sits there puzzled and disturbed
the scene and the sound of the dog jeffs chair is turned facing the window so that we see the darkened room behind him
there is just one side light burning which illuminates the side of his face
his head nods sleepily as he dozes
he opens his eyes and looks out as a slight sound of rain starts
from his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting to fall
it is sort gentle rain not a downpour
there are still some windows lit in the neighborhood
the apartment house corridors all have small night lights burning
jeff wakens a little more fully as his attentions is drawn to the couple who sleep on the fire escape
the increasing rain cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside
the man hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing of the fire escape lets it slip through his fingers
as if falls to the garden below the camera fans swiftly down with it
when the clock hits the ground the alarm goes off sending a shrill sound through the neighborhood
jeff smiles at the incident and then lowers his eyes slightly as something else catches his attention
coming out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor below is the salesman with the nagging wife
the shades are drawn in his apartment but a light burns dimly behind them
the salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase the same one we saw him with earlier in the day
the sound of the alarm startles him
he turns toward the window a moment listening
then reassured that is is nothing important he turns and moves down the corridor
jeff is puzzled
he looks down a moment in thought
then he darts his eyes and swings them toward the left
he looks steadily toward the distant street corner
the street corner lighted by a lamp is deserted
a moment later the salesman still carrying the suitcase moves diagonally across the corner head down against the rain
jeff looks wonderingly at this nocturnal activity
then he looks down at his wristwatch
jeffs watch reads
the watch now reads
more puzzled allows his eyes to travel from the street to the apartment corridor
the salesman is see coming down the corridor to his apartment still carrying the aluminum case
he quickly enters his apartment door in a business like manner
jeff starts to assume a thoughtful air when he is startled by a light which falls across his face from the right
he looks toward the light
the light comes from the song writers apartment
his door is open and he is hanging onto the door frame his hand still on the light switch
he surveys his apartment
he appears rather drunk
he comes into the apartment closes the door behind him and sways a little
he wears a hat pushed back on his forehead and no raincoat
his clothes are quite wet
he might have even fallen
he looks disgustedly at the piano then lurches toward it
there is no doubt now as the state of his drunkenness
at the piano he viciously sweeps all the note paper off the music stand
this seems to give him some satisfaction but he loses his balance twists sideways and fall into a nearby chair
he remains there bleary eyed and a little sick
what he has observed seems to give jeff an idea
he moves his wheelchair backward and to the left alongside the side board
awkwardly with his left hand he reaches up for a bottle of whiskey
he cradles the bottle in his lap and reaches for a tumbler
he then wheels back to the window and pours himself a good long drink
he lifts up the glass starts to drink but something happening beyond his window startles him and he stops in the middle of his drink his eyes a little wider
the salesman is again leaving his apartment with his aluminum suitcase
jeffs eyes travel down to the street
a brief moment or two
then the salesman carrying his aluminum case crosses the street
jeffs face is expressionless
he just stares
jeffs head is nodding and dozing again
the side light from the song writers apartment is no longer on his face
jeffs eyes open then his head comes up quickly trying to clear the sleep from his mind as he remembers the object of his vigilance
the salesmans apartment shows the shades drawn and a dim light burning behind them
the camera pans to the empty corridor
jeffs eyes turn sharply in the direction of the street
the street is deserted
at the right hand side of the screen a light goes on
the camera pans over and we see that miss torso has returned from her date
she is wearing a three quarter length coat over her evening dress
she is inside with the door two thirds closed but she leans out to kiss someone goodnight
then it takes some coaxing to get the door completely closed
she turns the key in the lock
she listens a moment then comes to the center of the room
she takes her coat off and drapes it over chair
she removes the screen in front of the ice box then opens the ice box
she searches it for something to eat finds a big piece of pumpkin pie
she closes the ice box
she starts to eat the pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom
stopping a moment she puts the piece of pie on a table and proceeds to take off her dress
undoing the zippers she slides it over her head as she passes into the bathroom
the dress is thrown on a nearby chair and the bare arm picks up a piece of pie
she is now in the bathroom
we see her slip down the brassiere straps but the window does not permit us to see any lower
as she munches on the pie she pulls out a few pins holding up her hair which she proceeds to brush rhythmically
she turns and moves down her bare back
jeffs eyes suddenly switch to the street
we catch a quick glimpse of the salesman just passing the alleyway suitcase in hand
the camera pans across the ballet dancers apartment over to the salesmans apartment
it waits until he appears in the corridor
he enters his apartment
jeff sits in his wheelchair looking quietly out at the neighborhood sleep beginning to take hold on him again
the camera pans slightly over the whole of the neighborhood
the lights in miss torsos apartment snap out
only one light remains
it burns behind the drawn shades of the salesmans apartment
a big head of jeff
he is still in his wheelchair sound asleep
the camera pans off his face out through the window
the rain has stopped and the general light of dawn is coming up
the camera comes to rest on the salesmans apartment and corridor which is still dimly lit by the electric lights
we see the salesman emerge into the corridor pause a moment to allow a woman to proceed him
her back is to the camera and we do not see her face
they move away down the corridor
the camera pans back into jeffs sleeping face
it is now mid morning
the sun is shining
miss torso is practicing her dance to the sound of ballet music
we can hear the song writer at work but the thing that attracts our attention mostly is some action that emanates from the fire escape where the couple sleep at
on a long rope the woman is lowering an open wicker basket in which sits a small dog
when is reaches the yard below the camera panning down the dog steps out and runs off to explore the yard
the woman pulls up the basket and leaves it on the fire escape
the camera pull back into jeffs apartment where stella is busy massaging jeffs back at he lies face down on the divan
youd think the rain would have cooled things off
all it did was make the heat wet
stella hits a sore muscle in jeffs back
thats a stiff one
a low camera has jeffs head on the foreground with stella just behind him at work on his back
she attacks the sore muscle vigorously
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair
between clenched teeth how did you know
must have been staring out the window for hours
massaging harder whatll you do if one of them catches you
depends one which one
she stops massaging reaches for the oil
now miss torso for example stella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil
it takes his breath
keep your mind off her
shes real eat drink and be merry girl
and shell end up fat alcoholic and miserable
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again
someday shell find her happiness
and some man will lose his
isnt there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction
well the salesman could be available soon
interested in the scandal he and his wife splitting up
its hard to figure
he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
isnt he a salesman
now what could he sell at three in the morning
luminous dials for watches
house numbers that light up
he was taking something out of the apartment
she helps him to a sitting position
his personal effects
hes probably running away the coward
sometimes its worse to stay than it is to run
looks at him but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it
jeff turns his head away for a moment
she helps him into the chair
hands him his shirt which he proceeds to put on
the back of his chair is to the window
putting oil and power away what about this morning
the shades are still drawn in their apartment
stops in this heat
turns looks over his shoulder theyre up now
he quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile
the salesman having just raised the shades in the living room is now looking out the window
it is not a casual look but a long careful searching appraisal of all the apartment house windows in his neighborhood starting from his left to his right
his eyes move closer toward jeffs apartment
jeff in his chair facing the window stella beside him
jeff nearly knocks the startled stella off her feet with his arm
out of sight
he propels his chair backward quickly and stella moves to the side with surprising agility
they are both in shadow
a startled whisper what is it
whats the matter
jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window
quietly the salesmans looking out his window
stella relaxes gives jeff a disgusted look and starts to move out of the shadows
a federal offense
sharply get back there
hell see you
she moves back into the shadows
im not shy
ive been looked at before
still peering toward window its not an ordinary look
its the kind of look a man gives when hes afraid somebody might be watching him
the salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood
then something directly below his window catches his attention
he looks sharply downward his body visibly tensing
jeff with a restraining hand to stella begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at
the camera moves forward and as it reaches the edge of the window pans down and shows us what the salesman is looking at
the little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesmans personal flower bed
jeffs eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman
the salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog
the camera pans down and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog
we can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that hell get into trouble
the dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed moves away
the old lady is wearing a faded house robe
jeff is amused at the dog incident
behind him stella moves to the center of the room saying goodbye mr
ill see you tomorrow
grunts uh huh
she begins putting her equipment back into her black bag
jeffs eyes lift to the salesmans apartment and the amusement drains from his face
he leans forward a little tensely
the salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room
he is carefully wiping out the interior with dust cloth
jeff watching intently
stella putting the last of her things into her bag
and dont sleep in the chair again
jeff continues to what the salesman his face showing a great concentration of thought
stella picks up her bag stares at jeffs back a moment then starts for the door
jeff swings half way around in his chair just as stella reaches the top of the steps
she turns around
jeff points to a coat stand near the door
goes on quickly will you take those binoculars out of the case and bring them to me
she puts down her bag reaches for the binoculars takes them out the case
she comes down the stairs brings them to him
he immediately swings to the window and lifts them to his eyes
stella sniffs then goes to the door as she says trouble
i cam smell it
ill be glad when they crack that cast and i get out of here
as stella goes out the door the camera moves in until jeffs head and the binoculars are filling the screen
the salesman has completed his cleaning of the case
he is in the act of placing it on the floor
he turns and again glances out of the window
jeff quickly lowers the binoculars and edges back a few inches
he watches a moment then cautiously lifts the binoculars again
the man is now moving out of the living room and the binoculars pan him though to the small kitchen which is seen through a side window
the man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us but the image is very unsatisfactory
jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of exasperation on his face
he throws the binoculars down and then looks about him
he backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left
he leans down opens a cupboard door and takes out a long focus lens
then from a shelf above he takes a small exacta camera
he quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place
he wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye
through the view finder of the camera we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen
his back is still to us
he half turns and takes a used newspaper
he spreads it open along the drainboard
from the sink he takes out a large butchers knife and a long narrow saw
they disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up
having completed his job he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper wrapped parcel
for a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room
he does not reappear for a moment
jeff lowers the camera for a moment and watches tensely
suddenly he puts it up to his eye again
half of a mans body is now seen in the living room
then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room
he is not carrying anything
he sits down on a couch with a display of fatigue
he yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch
jeff lowers the camera
he watches the living room for a moment
then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen then return to the living room
his brow knits a little as we the thermometer outside of jeffs window registering degrees
the camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the song writers studio
he is dressed only in bathing trunks and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper
in the middle of his sweeping he stops hurries a step or two to the piano
he plays a couple of notes with one hand while he stands
listens plays them again
decides they are no good and returns to his carpet sweeping
the camera pans farther left to the salesmans apartment
there are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom but the living room and the kitchen are lighted
there is no sign of the salesman
the camera continues its pan to the left to include the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather
we now get an opportunity to examine these people more closely
the man is balding and middle aged
he is wearing striped pajamas
he is in the act of laying out the mattress
his wife is slightly younger peroxided faded show girl type
also wearing pajamas with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket the wife is leaning over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dogs basket now on
the floor of the courtyard
having been a one time siffleuse her call to the dog is clarion and melodic
the little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows and steps into the basket
it begins to move upward and the camera follows it
when the basket reaches the fire escape the camera pans on to the apartment of miss torso
she is in the bathroom brushing her long hair while her thoughts seem to be far away
the camera drops down to the apartment below occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid
for the first time we see something of her activities inside the apartment
she wears a short smock although her legs are still bare
she is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture
it takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved
the camera moves on much farther to the left and eventually comes to rest on the newly weds apartment with the shade still drawn
it moves on and at last passes though jeffs window and comes to rest on the two bid heads of jeff and lisa
her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks how far does a girl have to go before you notice her
jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window
if shes pretty enough she doesnt have to go anywhere
she just has to be
the salesmans apartment just as we saw it a moment ago
the shades drawn and lights out in the bedroom the shade up and lights on in the living room and kitchen
still no one in sight
well aint i
pay attention to me
we are now able to see that jeffs apartment is in darkness only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors window
by her position lisa is seated on jeffs sound knee her arms around his neck
im not exactly on the other side of the room
your mind is
and when i want a man i want all of him
she starts kissing him
dont you ever have any problems
murmurs kissing him i have one now
so do i
kissing tell me about it
slight pause why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase
and come back three times
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home
not that salesmans wife
and why didnt he go to work today
its more interesting
whats interesting about a butchers knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper
nothing thank heaven
looking again why hasnt he gone into his wifes bedroom all day
i wouldnt dare answer that
after pause lisa theres something terribly wrong
she gives up trying to interest him in romance and moves back from the embrace
the camera pull back
and im afraid its with me
lisa stands straightens out her dress stretches a little then she turns to the divan apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesmans life
looks at lisa what do you think
without returning his look something too frightful to utter
jeff is thoughtful for a moment then he relaxes and smiles a little
he turns to the window to look out again
lisa exits the picture
lisa stretches herself out on the divan
her head rest on the cushion at the far end and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose
however her expression is disturbed as she watches jeff
he stares intently out the window
he went out a few minutes ago in his undershirt and he hasnt come back yet
lisa weighs this information trying to make some sense out of it
jeff turns his eyes from the salesmans apartment and looks down reflectively
he looks up again and then his eyes catches sight of something
he leans forward slightly
miss torso is lying face down on her divan bed
the only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp
she is reading a book held in one hand while eating a sandwich in another
her back is bare and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts
at one point she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her
he looks away from miss torso thoughtfully
you know that would be terrible job to tackle
lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what jeff is referring to
she turns back to him with a blank stare
jeff turns and looks at her quite unaware of her surprise at his comment
how would you begin to cut up a human body
lisa sits bolt upright on the divan
she reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light
at that moment the songwriter returns to his composing
we can see him over lisas shoulder
he is beginning his song again and it has taken on new fullness and melody
although it is not complete it is farther along then before and he plays his theme a number of different ways trying to move it note by note to its
lisa just stares at jeff for a moment
jeff ill be honest with you youre beginning to scare me a little
jeff is staring out of the window again
over this we hear lisas voice quietly insistent jeff did you hear what i said
youre beginning to jeff puts out a restraining hand
interrupting be quiet
pause hes coming back
at last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor
he does not wear shirt but only an undershirt
slung over one shoulder with his arm through is is a large coil of sturdy rope
he goes through the living room into the bedroom
he does not put on the bedroom lights
jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars and trains them on the salesmans apartment
as seen though the binoculars the salesman comes out of the bedroom to the kitchen where he gets a carving knife
he turns around and goes back to the bedroom
the lights go on behind the draw shades after a short moment
the dim shadow of the salesman is seen moving around the room
lisa still stretched out on the divan looking at jeff suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan mover over to jeff the camera going with her
in a sudden surprise move she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window
he drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise
the camera moves in as lisa leans over jeff gripping both sides of his chair sharply jeff if you could only see yourself
now lisa abruptly sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing but doing it the way you are she gestures with with binoculars and with wild
opinions about every little movement you see is is diseased
do you think i consider this recreation
i dont know what you consider it but if you dont stop it im getting out of here
youd better before you catch the disease
insistent what is it youre looking for
i want to find out whats wrong with the salesmans wife
does that make me sound like a madman
what makes you think somethings wrong with her
a lot of things
shes an invalid who needs constant care and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day
maybe she died
wheres the doctor the undertakers
she could be under sedatives sleeping
looks up hes in the room now
jeff tries to turn around but she wont let the chair move
theres nothing to see
there is ive seen things through that window
bickering family fights mysterious trips at night knives saws rope and since last evening not a sight or sound of his wife
now you tell me where she is and what shes doing
maybe hes leaving his wife
i dont know and i dont care
lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses
lots of men dont speak to their wives all day
lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts but very very very few of them end up in murder if thats what youre thinking
its pretty hard to stay away from that word isnt is
you could see all the things he did couldnt you
what are you getting at
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard
jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that
that he shouldnt keep his shades down and hide behind them
thats where hes being clever
and thats where youre not being clever
he wouldnt parade his crime in front of the open shades
she turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds apartment
pointing for all you know theres something a lot more sinister going on behind those shades
the drawn shades of the newlyweds apartment
a dim light burning behind them
jeff looks turns back to her trying to suppress a chuckle
dont you see how silly youre being
okay lisa probably youre right
hes probably in the bedroom now entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick
ill admit to criminal insanity
now when do i start the cure
lisa half looks up and out the window
she opens her mouth to answer but a new look overtakes her face
it is concern surprise and a little shock
jeff sees the change is sobered and quickly turns the chair around
he looks out the window using his binoculars
the shades in the bedroom are now up
both beds are empty and stripped of their linen the mattresses thrown up over the end of the beds
the salesman sweating heavily stands over a large square trunk in the center of the room
it is stoutly bound by the heavy rope we previously saw him bring into the apartment
he wipes one forearm across his brow and then heads for the kitchen
in the kitchen he produces a bottle pours himself two or three straight drinks then leans with a display of exhaustion against the kitchen sink
jeff lowers the glasses
his look is sober
lisa stands behind him one hand on the back of the wheelchair
she too is serious
the camera moves in until lisas head fills the screen
she says slowly lets start from the beginning again jeff
tell me everything you saw and what you think it means
she is still staring out the window as the scene jeff is seated in the dark his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street
he is looking out of the window tensely as the camera moves in until he is in big profile
from jeffs viewpoint all the windows are dark
the couple are sleeping on the fire escape
the salesmans apartment is dark as well
suddenly a match flares and we see the salesman light a cigar
the flame of the match illuminates his face for a moment
when is dies out we see just the glow of the cigar burning
the camera is now facing jeff
we see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him
the phone starts to ring but makes only the slightest sound as he instantly picks it up
as he talks in a low voice he keeps his eyes on the salesmans apartment
we get an impression of sixth avenue behind lisa at the phone
lisa also talks in a low quiet voice
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr
lars thats l a r s lars thorwald
filter whats the apartment house number
west ninth street
jeff still looks toward the salesmans apartment
lisa smilingly says okay chief
whats my next assignment
to get on home
all right but whats he doing now
jeff is still looking toward the salesmans apartment
just sitting in the living room
in the dark
and he hasnt gone near the bedroom
now get some sleep
he puts the receiver down and resumes his vigil
all we can see is the glow of the salesmans cigar
jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair
he is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood
there is a touch of urgency in his voice
look doyle its just one of those things i cant tell you on the phone
you have to be here and see the whole set up
the camera pulls back slightly as stella emerges from the kitchen
she is carrying a tray with breakfast on it
eggs bacon toast and coffee
its probably nothing important just a little neighborhood murder thats all
as a matter of fact i did say murder
stella squeezes past the right side of jeff and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him
she peers out cautiously toward thorwalds apartment for a moment
then she squeezes back moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand
my only thought was to throw a little business your way
a good detective i reasoned would jump at the chance to detect
stella returns with the table and sets it up so that it is across jeffs lap
she gets the tray of food pausing to look toward thorwalds apartment
then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of jeff
he has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes
well i usually took my best pictures on my day off
nods okay doyle soon as you can
he hangs up
stella takes the phone and puts it down for him
he looks at the breakfast reaches for a knife and fork
stella i i cant tell you what a welcome sight this is
no wonder your husbands still in love with you
pauses in cutting food huh
you called the police
well yes and no
it wasnt an official call
hes just a friend
almost to himself an old ornery friend
he begins eating appreciatively
she moves behind his chair pausing to look toward thorwalds apartment again
jeff is just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when stella speaks
half to herself now just where do you suppose he cut her up
the hand carrying the bacon to jeffs mouth hesitates for a moment
answering herself oh of course
in the bathtub
thats the only place he could wash away the blood
the hand holding the bacon moves back to the plate
jeff just stares ahead
stella turns and walks into the kitchen
jeff pushes the food away and picks up the coffee cup instead
jeffs eyes over the coffee cup are staring intently at the backyard
the shades up
no one moving
the rope tied trunk still sits in the bedroom
to the left we see the basket lowering with the dog in it
we hear the woman whistling an aria
his eyes stray in an upward direction as he puts down the coffee cup
the camera pans up past the woman lowering the dog up to the roof where one of the sunbathers can be seen sitting up rubbing her body with sun tan
jeffs eyes moves down again
abstractedly his hand strays toward the piece of bacon
he picks it up
we are now aware that the salesman is now in his living room lying out of sight on the sofa because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting
to ascend toward the ceiling of his room
stellas voice is heard calling out from the kitchen hed better get that trunk out of there before is starts to leak
again the bacon stops before is reaches jeffs mouth
he puts it down on the plate again as his eyes move slightly toward the left
miss torso in ballet outfit is hanging up a small wash on a clothes line
it consists mostly of lingerie
she is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time
the camera pans over suddenly to thorwalds apartment and except for the smoke rising from the unseen sofa there is no activity
jeff seems to be getting a bit listless or bored by constantly watching thorwalds apartment
his eyes sort of stray around the neighborhood and end up looking toward the newlyweds apartment
shade down business as usual
jeff smiles affectionately and starts to turn his eyes away but something startles him and he looks quickly back
the shade suddenly going up in the newlyweds apartment
the young husband leans his hands on the windowsill and looks out
he is wearing only his pajama bottoms because of the heat and we see that he is a well muscled attractive young man
he looks around with some satisfaction
he turns at the sound of a womans voice behind him
h a a r r e e
he turns his head is thoughtful for a brief moment then he pulls down the shade
his smile almost becomes a private chuckle
stellas abrupt voice breaks in urgently look
jeffs head snaps toward the center of his window
stella has appeared behind his wheelchair
two men wearing tan coveralls are standing outside thorwalds door
one of them carries a clipboard
suddenly thorwald is seen sitting up on the living room sofa
his hair is disheveled and he is unshaved
he stands up and moves toward the door
he opens it and after a short exchange of dialogue he admits the two men leaving the door open behind them
he leads the two man across the living room to the bedroom
stella and jeff watching intently
he is feeling down alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars
a close view shows the two man carrying the trunk across the living room toward the corridor
jeff lowers the binoculars quickly
agitated i thought doyle would get here before the trunk went or id have called the police
to stella now were going to lose it
stella moves toward the door quickly
jeff turns quickly over his shoulder to watch her
she is already going up the steps
stella dont do anything reckless
as stella goes out the door she calls back im just going to get the name of their truck
up ill watch the alleyway in case it goes that way
we hear nothing from stella but the sound of her heavy tread down the hallway stairs
jeff returns to thorwald
he eases himself back into the shadows a bit and then raises his binoculars
jeff concentrates his attention on the alley way that leads to the street
just normal traffic
the binoculars swing to thorwald apartment
the salesman is now at the telephone
he has picked up the receiver and proceeds to dial
the binoculars still up to jeffs face
under them his mouth moves as if hes talking to himself
the salesman speaks some words to the operator
placing the call
as he does this he reaches with his other hand for a nearly bottle and working the cork out with one hand he pours a stiff drink into a tumbler
he drinks it as soon as he finishes talking with the operator
jeff lowers the binoculars a little and takes a normal eye sight on the alleyway
pulling across to the far side of the street we see the hood and cab of a freight truck
jeff quickly puts the glasses up
by the time the binoculars are up another truck has crossed from the left
in momentarily blocks out the side of our freight truck
by the time the two trucks part we can only see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out of sight
jeff is only able to read the words freight lines
the binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway
she looks toward the front of thorwalds apartment house
and by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside
she looks about her for a moment
jeff lowers the binoculars discouraged
the figure of stella is seen looking up toward jeffs apartment and arms outspread in a helpless gesture
shooting towards the big window with the neighborhood beyond jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window but now turned toward a newcomer
the second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars
this newcomer is police detective lieutenant thomas j
doyle the man jeff phoned earlier in the day
he is an intelligent appearing well dressed modern detective
he has a sense of humor
he lowers the glasses and turns to jeff
you didnt see the killing or the body
how do you know there was a murder
because everything that mans done has been suspicious
trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isnt there any more
ill admit it all has a mysterious sound but is could mean a number of different things
murder is the least likely
go ahead doyle tell me hes an unemployed magician amusing the neighborhood with sleight of hand
doyle paces a little
its too stupid and obvious a way to murder in full view of fifty windows and then sit over there he points smoking a cigar waiting for the police to
pick him up
well officer do your duty
youve got a lot to lean about homicide jeff
morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them
that salesman wouldnt just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage
ill bet its been done
almost everythings been done under panic
but this is a thousand to one shot
that mans still sitting around his apartment he isnt panicked
a pause you think i made all this up
i think you saw something that probably has a very simple explanation
shrugs his wife took a trip
she was an invalid
you told me
looks at watch ive got to run jeff
all right you dont believe me
doyle saunters toward steps picking up his hat on the way
i uh wont report it to the department
let me poke into a little on my own
no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity
we know the wife is gone
ill see if i can find out where
he goes up the steps to the door putting on his hat
he pauses his hand on the door knob
you have any headaches lately
jeff answers showing only the slightest irritation
not til you showed up
doyle still at the door uh huh
well itll wear off in time along with the hallucinations
see you around
he starts to go out the door and closes it behind him
from doyles viewpoint
jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture
before the door has completely closed doyle opens it again and looks in
by the way what happened to your leg
i was jaywalking
with nonchalance the indianapolis speedway
the door starts to close again as if doyle considered jeffs answer quite reasonable
then the door pops open and doyles head comes in a surprised expression across his face
during the race
jeff answers with a straight face
it sure stopped traffic
we dont see doyle again but only hear the sharp slam of the door off
then he turns back to the window
jeffs attention is drawn to something in the yard below
the little dog is busily scratching away at thorwalds pet flower bed
jeff smiles mischievously
suddenly his face changes as he sees thorwald coming out of his basement door carrying a watering can
he fills it from a nearby faucet
he does not notice the little dogs destructive activities
when the watering can is filled he straightens up turns toward the flower bed
he stops for the briefest moment when he sees the dog
he walks to the dog gently lifts him out of the garden and giving him a friendly little pat sends him off
he proceeds to patiently brush back the disturbed earth and then begins his watering
jeff is frankly puzzled by the salesmans friendly attitude toward the dog
he looks off in another direction as he catches of doyle who has appeared at the street opening
the detective is surveying the front of the apartment building where thorwald lives
a paper seller behind him offers to sell him a paper
doyle isnt interested
as doyle saunters forward toward the salesman house the scene doyle is nonchalantly leaning up against the side board with a highball in one hand
jeff has turned his chair around from the window to face him
he has a six months lease and has used up a little over five and a half months of it
takes a sip of drink quiet
drinks but not to drunkenness
pays his bill promptly with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman wholesale
keeps to himself and none of the neighbors got close to him or his wife
i think they missed their chance with her
studies drink she never left the apartment interrupting then where is she in the ice box
continues until yesterday morning
alert what time
jeff looks thoughtful a moment and then says with a touch of discouragement i think thats about the time i fell asleep
the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time
he puts down his drink and strolls toward the window looking out
the camera moves in slightly to tighten the shot
feel a little foolish
doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window
unconsciously he smooths out his coat and tie
he even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees
miss torso in ballet costume practicing her dance on the outside balcony
she is exciting and desirable
jeff notices doyles interest
hows your wife
startled at being observed doyle moves quickly away from the window affecting nonchalance
the camera moves back as doyle returns to his drink
jeff smiles at catching doyle enjoying miss torso
oh oh shes fine
not too convincing just fine
he tosses off the rest of the drink and his movement is almost a comment
jeffs face grows serious
who said they left then
who left where
the thorwalds at six in the morning
doyle quickly collects his thoughts and gets back to the case at hand
the building superintendent and two tenants
flat statements no hesitation
and they all jibed to the letter
the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station
now how could anybody guess that
they had perhaps signs on their luggage grand central or bust
sighs the superintendent met thorwald coming back
he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country
a very convenient guy this superintendent
have you checked his bank deposits lately
sharply well what good is his information
its a second hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself thorwald
anybody actually see the wife get on the train
i hate to remind you but this all started because you said she was murdered
now did anyone including you actually see her murdered
doyle are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish
if possible both
well then do a good job of it
get over there and search thorwalds apartment
it must be knee deep in evidence
i cant do that
i mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something
what he doesnt know wont hurt him
i cant do it even if hes gone
with sarcasm whats the matter
does he have a courtesy card from the police department
now dont get me mad
even a detective cant walk in anybodys apartment and search it
if i were ever caught in there id lose my badge inside of ten minutes
just make sure youre not caught
if you find something youve got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules
if you find nothing hes clear
at the risk of sounding stuffy jeff ill remind you of the constitution and the phrase search warrant issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim
he must ask for evidence
give him evidence
i can hear myself starting out
your honor i have a friend whos an amateur sleuth an one night after a heavy supper he shakes his head no hed throw the new york state penal code
right in my face
and its six volumes
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment
looking out window a detectives nightmare
what do you need before you can search bloody footsteps leading up to the door
looking out window one thing i dont need is heckling
you called and asked me for help and now youre acting like a taxpayer
turns and look at jeff how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question
ever get an answer
yeah frequently it ran something like this your request for transfer turned down he cant help smiling and neither can doyle
sorry i had to turn it down
he checks his watch im going over to the railroad station and check thorwalds story
he moves to the sideboard picks up a felt hat
forget the story find the trunk
thorwalds in it
oh i almost forgot
he pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket
jeff watches him intently
looking at jeff there was a postcard in thorwalds mailbox
refers to paper mailed yesterday afternoon three thirty p
from merritsville looks up speaks pleasantly thats eighty miles north of here
back to paper the message read arrived o
already feeling better
he looks at jeff with some smugness
slowly is is anna who i think it is
nods yes mrs
he puts on his hat and goes toward the door
maliciously anything you need
jeff is sober
a good detective
the sun has just set
the camera is concentrating on the long focus lens camera which fills the screen
just beyond there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich
jeffs hand comes in picks it up
we pan us with the sandwich until jeffs head fills the screen
except for a small light in the kitchen jeffs apartment is in darkness
as he munches he keeps his attention on the neighborhood
thorwalds apartment is darkness
the camera pans slightly to the left as we see the dog being lowered in its basket
we follow the basket down to the yard which brings miss lonely hearts apartment into view
she is wearing a kelly green suit and is seated at her dressing table
she seems to be putting on the final touches of her make up prior to going out
jeff looks down he smiles to himself
he turns and we see him raise the long focus camera to his eye
the long focus lens brings miss lonely hearts into an enlarged picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed
a pair of ill fitting horn rimmed reading glasses rest half way down her nose and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lip stick with
satisfied she takes off the glasses and examines her face as a whole through squinting eyes
she has faded good looks has fairly nice clothes but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing
her hair do makes her seem middle aged
she reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her and takes a long drink
putting the glass down she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick
unable to see clearly she puts on the glasses again looks and touches up her lips slightly
she puts her glasses in a handbag then stands to put out the lights
she walks into the living room finishing the drink
the long focus lens moves with her
she goes straight for a bottle of liquor and pours out a final neat slug and tosses it off
then she leaves the apartment with a show of determination
she turns out the lights behind her
jeff lowers the long focus lens and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriters melody which we have heard him trying to
the songwriter is at the piano poking out his melody slowly note by note
he is in black tie and from the looks of the apartment he is preparing for guests
an attractive girl is setting out trays of canapes glasses ice and liquor
she pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food
she listens a moment to the songwriters melody
her expression shows that it pleases her and moves her romantically
she comments on it to the songwriter who starts from the beginning again playing it more fully
a new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing
it is orchestral ballet music in a modern style
jeffs head turns in this new direction
miss torso and a male partner whom we have not seen before are practicing a pas a deux
he is a tall flowing haired young man lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity
they stop at one point to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching
by her gestures she is obviously a professional choreographer
the camera pans from this to the street beyond
standing there on the sidewalk looking up and down the street is a kelly green clad figure
he quickly raises his long focus camera to his eye
we are now given a waist high shot as the focus is adjustment by jeff
the figure is that of miss lonely hearts
she seems to be trying to figure out what to do or where to go
she nervously looks at a couple of men passers by
getting no reaction she crosses the street and seats herself at an empty table in front of the cafe
she orders a drink
she is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side
he is much nearer the lens because he is on this side of the street
he is therefore slightly out of focus
the lens suddenly sharpens
it is thorwald carrying a light weight cardboard box under his arm
the camera pans him over to the right until he is lost behind the building
he lowers the lens and we see jeffs eyes travel across the screen as he imagines thorwalds progression
then sharpening his look he picks up the long focus lens and easing himself back cautiously begins watching thorwald
thorwald comes up the corridor and stands unlocking his door
as he hesitates we are able to see the cardboard box he is carrying has the name of a laundry on it
he enters the apartment turns on the living room lights
he proceeds to the bedroom and the lights go on there
a number of suits and top coats are lying on an orderly pile on the bed
he takes the laundry out of the box and puts in on the bed next to the suits
then he goes to the dresser and instead of putting the laundry away he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers pajamas shirts sox etc
he piles these on the beds
jeff lowers the camera quickly
he picks up the phone and dials a number still keeping his eyes on thorwald
the phone buzzes on filter then is picked up and answered by a woman filter hello
a note of urgency has tom come in yet
not yet jeff
you havent even heard from him
not a word
for a moment jeff looks desperate
he doesnt know what to say
it is something really important jeff
im afraid it is tess
ill have him call the moment i hear from him
tell him not to waste time calling
to get over here soon as he can
i think thorwalds pulling out tonight
as an after thought dont worry tess
its a man
she laughs goodnight you idiot
a slight smile goodnight mrs doyle
he hangs up
then his brows knit a little as if hes puzzled about something he sees across the neighborhood
he lifts up the long focus lens
in the dresser thorwald finds an alligator handbag
he holds it up thoughtfully
we have previously seen this handbag hanging from the bedpost when mrs
thorwald was in bed
thorwald takes the bag into the living room where he picks up the phone and dials
long distance again
thorwald reaches his party
as he talks thoughtfully he takes some jewelry from the handbag a couple of rings diamond wristwatch brooch pearls etc
he discusses each piece apparently trying to make some decision
then seemingly satisfied he replaces them in the bag and hangs up
jeff lowers his camera lens and edges his chair forward in an effort to hear what thorwald is saying
but a sudden rise in the sound coming from the song writers apartment causes him to turn his head toward the studio with exasperation
the first four of the song writers guests come through the door admitted by the song writers girl friend
there is a squeal from the woman who great each other and hearty helloes from the men
the song writer dashes off a loud vamp of greeting on the piano then gets up to offer drinks
jeff turns his attention back to thorwald but gives up any attempt at listening
he lift the long focus lens up to his eyes again
having completed his call thorwald returns to the bedroom carrying the handbag
he goes to a pile of coats lying on the bed
he lifts the top two coats slightly and slides the handbag under them and out of sight
there is the sound of footsteps coming down the corridor to jeffs apartment
he lowers the camera lens and turns his attention to his door
the door opens and lisa stands silhouetted in the entrance black lighted by the corridor lights
its an attractive picture
jeffs head is turned toward her his back more toward the neighborhood
take a look
thorwalds getting ready to pull out for good
jeff abruptly turns back to the window as lisa dashes into the picture behind him and looks out
jeffs expression changes a little as they see the lights are out in thorwalds bedroom and thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living
he comes to the window glass in hand and looks down into the garden nonchalantly
over this we hear lisas voice questioningly it doesnt seem to be in any hurry
stares out the window exasperated he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds
coats suits shirts sox even his wifes he stops turns to her quickly
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost what about it
he had it hidden in the dresser
well at least it was in there
he took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance
his wifes jewelry was in the handbag
and something about it worried him
he was asking somebody advice over the phone
someone not his wife
i never saw him ask her for advise before
smiles but she volunteered plenty
jeff turns back to the window
thorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his hand
then he turns puts his unfinished drink down on a table and goes to the door
he puts the light out in the living room and goes out the door
he walks briskly down the corridor
i wonder where hes going now
i dont know
suppose he doesnt come back again
all his things are still piled on the bed
lisa moves toward a nearby lamp
well i guess its safe to put on some lights now
looking to left not yet
he picks up the long focus lens and trains it on the street intersection as lisa moves back to him
the street intersection
some traffic mostly pedestrian
miss lonely hearts still sitting at the cafe table alone
there is no sign of thorwald
he lowers the lens
he must have gone somewhere to the right
the camera pulls back as lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights
as she light increases we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress
she seems quite animated moving gracefully her skirt and hair swinging with her movement
jeff turns around to face the room
all day long ive tried to keep my mind on work
thinking about thorwald
nods yes and you and you friend doyle stops to jeff did you hear from him again since he left
not a word
he was going to check on the railroad station and the trunk
he must be still on it
as he talks she seems to be thinking something over to herself
he starts pacing trying to distill her thoughts
we see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her which lies prominently on the table
jeff watches her
something on your mind lisa
it doesnt make sense to me
women arent that unpredictable
losing a little patience lisa i cant guess what youre thinking
the camera closes in lisa stops faces him
her eyes sparkle and her body is tense with concentration
a woman has a favorite handbag it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it
then she takes a trip and leaves it behind
because she didnt know she was going on a trip and where she was going she wouldnt need a handbag
the camera eases back
but only her husband would know that
starts to pace again and the jewelry
women dont keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up
do they hide it in their husbands clothes
they do not
and they dont leave it behind them
a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry
you dont leave it behind in your husbands drawer in your favorite handbag
im with you sweetie but detective thomas j
doyle has a pat answer for that
thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband
thats what the witnesses told him
well i have a pat rebuttal for mr
doyle that couldnt be mrs
thorwald or i dont know women
still those witnesses
well agree they saw a woman but she wasnt mrs
that is yet
she comes over to jeff
he reaches up takes her hand
he pulls her into his lap
she puts her arms around him
she is very happy and kisses jeffs cheek
id like to see your friends face when we tell him
he doesnt sound like much of a detective
dont be too hard on him
hes a steady worker
i wish hed get there though
nuzzling jeff dont rush me
we have all night
theres a pause
then jeff moves back a little to look her straight in the eye
we have all what
im going to stay with you
youll have to clear that through my landlord she cuts him off with a kiss
when she pulls back i have the whole weekend off
well thats fine but i only have one bed and lisa smothers him with another kiss
she lets up
say anything else and ill stay tomorrow night too
lisa i wont be able to give you any she smothers him with still another kiss
then moves back
she laughs gets up
goes to the large handbag on the table
is is a mark cross ladies attache case
you said id have to live out of one suitcase picks up case ill bet yours isnt this small
thats a suitcase
starting to open it a mark cross overnight case anyway
compact but ample enough
she has opened it and surprisingly enough it is a compact outfit of pajamas slippers toothbrush toothpaste and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay
she comes to jeff sits in his lap again displaying the inside of the case ill trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night
gives in smiling id be no better than thorwald to refuse
the sound from the party in the song writers apartment becomes more noticeable as his party grows
and at this point he begins playing the song he has been composing for the past few days
theres that song again
she gets up from jeffs lap and puts the overnight case on the table
she goes to the window and looks toward the song writers apartment
jeff turns with her
the party at the song writers has grow considerably larger
an assortment of well dressed people have now crowded into the studio
they are drinking eating etc
at the moment a number of them are crowded around the piano listening to the composers newest song which isnt quite completed
however the melody has become more beautiful than ever
during the following scene we hear the melody being played a number of different ways on the piano
lisa stands listening entranced
where does a man get the inspiration for a song like that
jeff watches her
from his landlord once a month
its utterly beautiful
turns to jeff i wish i could be creative
you have a talent for creating difficult situations
happily i do
staying the night here uninvited
she sits down on the edge of the divan near jeff
she leans toward him
surprise is the most important element of attack
she smiles and beside youre not up on your private eye literature
when theyre in trouble its always their girl friday who gets them out of it
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and over passionate daughters of the rich
but he never ends up marrying her
stands up deadpan weird
she does a complete spin then ingenuously why dont i slip into something comfortable
you mean like the kitchen
and make us some coffee
exactly what i had in mind along with some brandy
she goes to the kitchen humming with the song writers melody which we can her off
jeff turns back to the window looks out
the shade is going up in the newlyweds apartment
the young husband throws up the window an lights a cigarette
he takes a deep and satisfying drag on the cigarette glancing toward the song writers party
just as he starts to exhale the smoke we hear his young wifes voice off h a a r r e e
he chokes on the smoke sputtering and coughing
when he recovers he throws the cigarette down to the back yard with a show of irritation
then slowly he pulls the shade down
behind us is sound of a door shutting over jeffs shoulder we see doyle coming down the steps slowly and seemingly preoccupied
jeff swings the chair around so that his back is to us
without looking at jeff doyle comes into the apartment takes off his hat and places it on the table
he runs a hand over the side of his head and down the back of his neck which seems to indicate some fatigue
looking expectantly at doyle
doyle reaches for a cigarette on the table and puts it to his lips
while searching his pockets for a match he hears lisa humming
his eyes turn upward
over the cabinet which divides the living room from the kitchen we can see a glimpse of lisas shadow on the ceiling
jeff has followed doyles look
doyle picks up cigarette lighter from table and lights his cigarette
as he is placing the lighter back on the table he sees from his viewpoint lisas bag containing her lingerie and overnight effects
his eyes turn from the lingerie up to doyle
doyles look is completely noncommittal
his eyes turn at the sound of the song writers party
he moves forward to get a better view as the camera retreats in front of him
he stops to glance out of the window
the party is now full progress
the room is overcrowded
and some people are now sitting on the floor with their backs to the window
others are outside
a crowd hides the piano player but music can be head competing with the babble
doyle turns his head away and looks straight out
his expression hardens a little as he sees the window of thorwalds apartment completely dark
he also is looking toward thorwalds apartment
he turns his eyes anxiously back to doyle
he seems to be trying to penetrate doyles mind
doyle turns his head from the window and looks down at jeff
he asks quietly what else do you have on this man thorwald
jeffs tension eases off a little by he is eager to talk
enough to scare me that you wouldnt get here in time and wed lose him
soberly you think hes getting out of here
everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom ready for packing
doyle looks back toward thorwalds bedroom
we see the dark apartment beyond him
doyle nods thoughtfully
he turns his head suddenly at the sound of lisa coming out of the kitchen
she holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy
they are cupped in her hand the stem between her fingers
she is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy
she is quite beautiful
doyle reacts to her appreciatively
she continues rotating the brandy
im just warming some brandy
she comes forward hands one snifter to jeff
she offers the second to doyle
note in the following set of scenes whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter it is being rotated regardless of their attitudes
doyle sort of smiles and takes the snifter awkwardly
tom this is miss lisa fremont
doyle bows his head slightly but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare
how do you do
lisa smiles in return
we think thorwalds guilty
she turns around and goes right back into the kitchen
doyle stares after her ignoring her remark still not recovered from the fist sight of her attractiveness
then quickly his eyes move down and to the left
the open overnight case with its displayed lingerie
slowly doyles eyes travel back to jeff
quickly guessing whats on doyles mind cautiously careful tom
doyles eyes travel past jeff to look out the window
he still holds the brandy snifter in one hand and a cigarette in the other
absentmindedly he still rotates the brandy
the sound of the phone ringing is heard
jeff picks up the phone
he listens and then looks up to doyle
just a minute please
doyle crosses and stands behind jeff as jeff hands him the phone
he juggles the cigarette the brandy snifter and the phone all at once
this is all done deadpan
he listens uh huh
thank you and goodbye
he hands the receiver back to jeff who hangs up
lisa comes back in with her own brandy snifter rotating it
the coffee will be ready soon
urgent jeff arent you going to tell him about the jewelry
doyle looks suddenly interested
he asks tersely jewelry
he has his wifes jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there
you sure it belongs to his wife
he turns his head to lisa who answers
it was in her favorite handbag and mr
doyle that can lead to only one conclusion
his head snaps back to jeff who answers that wasnt mrs
thorwald who left with him yesterday morning
you figured that out huh
his head moves back to lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice
its just that women dont leave jewelry behind when they go on a trip
before doyle can comment jeff asks impatiently come on tom you dont really need any of this information do you
doyle smiles at jeff and then strolls over to the table where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter
as a matter of fact i dont
doyle goes to the window and looks out as they watch him expectantly
he speaks without looking at them
his voice is flat and to the point
lars thorwald is no more a murderer than i am
jeff and lisa stare at him in astonishment
then jeff recovers and answers with some anger you mean you can explain everything that went on over there and is still going on
he spins around and his face has lost all its friendliness
he starts to place the room
and neither can you
points out window thats a secret and private world youre looking into out there
people do a lot at things in private that they couldnt explain in public
lisa and jeff
she replies with some sarcasm
like disposing of their wives
off get that idea out of your mind
it will only lead you in the wrong direction
but tom the saw the knives doyle breaks in takes a step forward
did you ever own a saw
off well in the garage back home we interrupts and how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it
or hundred knives youve probably owned in your lifetime
jeff reasoning but im not a killer
off your logic is backward
lisa cuts in spiritedly
you cant ignore the wife disappearing
and the trunk and the jewelry
doyle starts to pace up and down throwing out a hand in careful explanation
i checked the railroad station
he bought a ticket
he put her on the train ten minutes later
he holds his hand a few feet off the floor jeff and lisa
it might have been a woman but it couldnt have been mrs
that jewelry doyle comes up to the camera looking at lisa
look miss fremont
that feminine intuition sells magazines but in real life its still a fairy tale
i dont know how many wasted years ive spent running down leads based on womens intuitions
jeff is resentful of doyles comments to lisa
i take it you didnt find the trunk and this is just an old speech you once gave at the policemans ball
doyle has turned away into the center of the room
he swings around
i found the trunk a half hour after i left here
lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm of course its normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope
off when the lock is broken yes
what was in the trunk
a surly note to me
doyle comes toward the camera again
clean carefully packed not too stylish but presentable
off didnt you take it to the crime lab
doyle gives her a scathing look
i sent it on its merry and legal way
jeff challenges doyle why when a woman only goes on a simple trip does she take everything she owns
doyle with a studied gracious gesture to lisa
let the female psychology department handle that one
lisa answers but very coldly i would say that is looked as if she wasnt coming back
off thats what they call a family problem
persisting if his wife wasnt coming back why didnt he tell his landlord
ill answer it for you because he had something to hide
doyle hesitates a moment and lets his eyes wander to the overnight case with lisas lingerie
his eyes going back to jeff
blandly do uh you tell your landlord everything
jeff replies pointedly i told you to be careful
lisa looks down at jeff not comprehending
doyle points to one of the photographs on the wall
if id been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane you wouldnt have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal a big job fame money expressionless all the things
doyle has a complete change of manner
he relaxes and smiles
now what do you say we sit down to a quiet friendly drink or two forget all about this and tell lies about the old days in the war
he looks from one to the other
neither jeff or lisa display even the slightest friendliness
their faces are cold and set
then lisa speaks icily youre through with the case
doyle is relaxed
there isnt any case to be through with miss fremont
now lets get down to that friendly drink
jeff and lisa remain unmoved
a little self conscious doyle checks his watch and says with a pleasant laugh maybe youre right
i guess id better get home and get some sleep
no response comes across
his face sobers a little he reaches for his unfinished drink of brandy
he tries to toss it off like a straight shot of liquor
part of it shoots out of the brandy snifter down each side of his face and into his suit
he sputters a little and puts the glass down
jeff and lisa deadpan
doyle is wiping his coat lapels with a handkerchief
he looks at them pleasantly
im not much of a snifter
he starts away toward the door
if you need any more help jeff consult the yellow pages of your telephone directory
lisa still burning i hate funny exit lines
who was the trunk addressed to
doyle picks up his hat
he starts up the steps to the door
jeff points out a challenging finger
lets wait and see who picks it up
doyle poises on the step
he snaps his fingers
oh that phone call
to jeff i gave them your number hope you dont mind
off that depends on who they were
pleasantly the police department at merritsville
they called to report
the trunk was just picked up by mrs
he puts on his hat smiles and says
dont stay up too late
he quietly closes the door behind him
lisa and jeff
jeff turns his chair around and looks out to the neighborhood
lisa stands glumly behind him
the song writers party is now in full swing and fairly crowded
it is a happy gay affair
none of the gaiety is reflected in lisa and jeff
some new music is heard coming across the courtyard and jeff turns toward it with some irritation
miss torsos apartment has the door closed and all that we can see of her as she is lying on the divan is her legs swinging in arcs as she
exercise to record music
lisa is not looking in the same direction as jeff
all during this she has been staring out at thorwalds apartment
now her eyes are looking at the apartment underneath
she murmurs to jeff look
jeff turns his eyes in the same direction as hers
a light has gone on in miss lonely hearts apartment
surprise of surprises she has returned with a lover hooked
he is much younger then she and a little more keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him
her actions are coy and over feminine
she slips away from his hasty embraces and exploratory kisses with the proper flush of confusion and nervous giggle that seems to say its quite a surprise you find me
so desirable but me mustnt do anything improper you know
after all were practically strangers and what would you think of me
she pours a drink for each of them with gestures over genteel
as she sips her drink and look at him over the rim of the glass he tosses his off with nervous dispatch
he moves toward her this time more cautiously
an embrace a long kiss
she puts her drink down on the edge of the chair
it spills over onto the rug
he begins kissing her cheek her ear her neck
suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away
slaps him across the face
he moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out out out
he flushes with anger and embarrassment and his mouth twists into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her telling her what she is
she screams at him to get out
he leaves slamming the door behind him
she goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor makes a futile effort to clean it up and the collapses onto the rug sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body
lisa turns away from jeffs chair to get a cigarette from the table
she lights it as jeff turns his chair back to the room
as much as i hate to give thomas j
doyle too much credit he might have gotten a hold of something when he said this was pretty private stuff going on out there
he indicates the outside neighborhood with a movement of his head
she doesnt answer but studies the photographs on the wall of his room
do you suppose its ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long focus lens until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck and almost
read his mail do you suppose its ethical even if you prove he didnt commit a crime
im not much on rear window ethics
of course they have the same chance
they can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to
turns to him jeff if anybody walked in here i dont think theyd believe what they see
you and me with long faces plunged into despair because we find out that a man didnt kill his wife
were two of the most frightening ghouls ive ever known
jeff starts to smile at the realization
youd think we could be a little bit happy that the poor woman is alive and well
jeff smile is broad and he starts to chuckle
she relaxes and joins him
she sits on his lap her arms around his shoulders
whatever happened to that old saying love thy neighbor
i think ill start reviving it tomorrow with say miss torso for a start
she gets up goes to the blinds and proceeds to lower them one by on
as she get up not if i have to move into an apartment across the courtyard and do the dance of the seven veils once an hour
as she lowers the blinds shows over for tonight
she goes to the table picks up he overnight case
preview of the coming attractions
she goes to the kitchen entrance pauses
doyle think i stole this case
mock seriousness no lisa i dont think he did
she shrugs goes into the kitchen the camera panning her
jeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar a drink in his hand
he starts to take a sip from the glass when lisa comes out of the kitchen
she is an ethereal beauty in sheer peach nightgown covered by a gossamer matching kimono
she turns gracefully in front of jeff
he lowers his drink
softly what do you think
jeff puts his drink on the bar
he tries to decide how to answer her question
ill rephrase the question
lisa holds out the folds of her kimono
do you like it
studying it well if there was one less thread this way motions horizontally and two less that way motions vertically i might give up bachelorhood
lisa turns playfully toward the kitchen
ill be right back
blood curdling scream from the courtyard outside suddenly cuts through the night
startled both jeff and lisa move quickly for the window lisa lifting the blinds up
the long scream subsides into near hysterical sobbing
we get a high comprehensive view of all the apartments
light are going on in some windows shades are lifted on others people are beginning to lean out looking for the source of the cream and sobbing
the song writers party comes to a sudden halt as his guest crowd to the window
lisa and jeff at the window looking out startled
the landlord beneath the newlyweds looks out
tilting his head up toward the center of the yard
a couple comes out on the high balcony to the right
the newlyweds blinds come up and for the first time we see both of them at the window the girl looking over the boys shoulder
some members of the song writers party move out to the patio balcony to get a better look down in the yard
the bird woman comes to the window
her white face looks forward toward the center of the courtyard
miss torso pulling a around her comes out onto her porch and looks to her left
miss hearing aid comes quickly into her backyard
the couple who own the dog are standing on their fire escape
they are both looking down but while the husband is quiet the wife is holding her hands to the side of her head sobbing loudly
we have heard her sobbing since the moment of the scream which she uttered
lying near the sidewalk in the backyard below the couples fire escape is the silent body of the little dog they own
miss lonely hearts comes running out of the basement door
she goes directly to the dog picks it up in her arms
then she slowly turns and looks up at the sobbing woman above her
her voice clear its dead
its been strangled and the neck is broken
instead of increasing her sobbing this news quiets momentarily the woman who owned the dog
her hands go down to the railing of the fire escape gripping it fiercely
she lifts her face to the neighborhood her lips set and her eyes burning
her chest moves convulsively from the crying
which one of you did it
loud which one of you killed my dog
no one answers her voice is acid you dont know the meaning of the word neighbor
neighbors like each other speak to each other care if anybody lives or dies
but none of you do
you dont talk you dont help you you dont fighting tears even see
but i couldnt imagine any even of you being so low that youd kill a little helpless friendly dog
the only thing in this whole neighborhood who liked anybody
the guests at the song writers party begin to move silently back to the studio apartment
the people move off their balcony into the apartment
the woman almost screams at the people now as she looks up at the apartment
did you kill him because he liked you
just because he liked you
she breaks out sobbing anew and returns to her apartment and out of sight the crying growing fainter with her retreat
the husband leans over the fire escape and motions miss lonely hearts to place the dog in the basket which is already lowered
miss lonely hearts puts the dog in the basket and watches as the husband draws it slowly up
the bathing beauties go inside their apartment
the newlyweds draw their shades again
the landlord moves away from the window
the dog moves closer to the fire escape slowly the husband pulling the rope in hand over hand
miss torso goes back to her apartment
miss hearing aid turns down the volume of her hearing aid and goes back to her apartment
the dog reaches the fire escape and the husband tenderly takes it out of the basket
he turns to carry its into the apartment
jeff and lisa are at the window
he is holding on of hands
jeff speaks without looking up
for a minute doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong
but youre not
in the whole courtyard only one person didnt come to the window
he points thorwalds apartment
it is dark
the only light that can be seen in it is the glowing end of a cigar in the center of the room back from the window as if thorwald was
sitting quietly on his sofa smoking
lisa looks down at jeff
why would thorwald want to kill a dog
almost a laugh because it knew too much
he nods solemnly and then turns back to the window as both he and lisa look again towards thorwalds apartment
still dark and only the unmoving glow of a cigar showing in the center of the apartment
jeff stella and lisa are grouped at the window looking out
the camera is behind them
jeff holds the long focus lens to his eye
we wee the upper part of the bedroom window belonging to thorwald
the lower part of the window is covered by a wall
in the bathroom thorwald is wiping the enameled wall with a damp cloth
he rubs at particular spots now and then
over this we hear do you think this was worth waiting all day to see
is he cleaning house
hes washing down the bathroom walls
must have splattered a lot
we now see their faces
jeff lowers the camera with a long focus lens
neither he nor lisa make any comment
finally stella blurts out well why not
thats what were all thinking
he killed her in there and he has to wipe up the stains before he leaves
lisa turns away from the window
stella your choice of words stella also turns interrupting her nobodys invented polite words yet for killing
jeff who is still staring out the window has a look of sudden discovery on his face
he calls quickly lisa lisa on the shelf over there get me the small yellow box he turns halfway around and points
we see lisa moving behind him toward the shelf
he adds and that little viewer
he turns back to the window holding out his right hand to the side waiting for the box and viewer
the camera pulls back a little as lisa comes up and places the box and viewer in his hand
he opens the box which contains color slides and holds one or two of the slides up to the light
lisa looks down at him curiously and stella comes forward from the background
half to himself as he searches slides these arent more than two weeks old i hope i didnt take all leg art
discovers the right slide i think this is the one
puts the other slides to one side and puts the selected one onto the viewer with sounds of satisfaction
as he lifts the viewer to his eyes lisa asks impatiently jeff what are you looking for
he squints out through the viewer then looks away a moment without it
something that if im right might solve a murder
he looks back through the viewer
i think i know now why thorwald killed it
he takes the viewer from his eye hands it to lisa
you take a look and tell me what you see
lisa raises the viewer to her eye
through the viewer we see the identical view out of the window
over now take it away
the viewer moves away and we are left with the identical scene but not quite so still a slight breeze stirring the foliage
jeff looks up to a puzzled lisa
its just a picture of the backyard thats all
but theres one important change
the flowers in thorwalds pet flower bed
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around
to stella and digging in
points out window look at that flower bed
they all lean forward to look
the flower bed
the flowers have a slight dip in the center
jeff speaks off theres a dip at this end
and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks
theres something buried there
all three ease back in awe
lisa still looking out says breathing it mrs
suddenly stella begins to chuckle
they look around at her
her face sobers as she answers their unasked question you havent spent much time in cemeteries have you
they dont answer mr
thorwald could hardly put his wife into a plot of ground scarcely one foot square
jeff and lisa slowly turn their heads to look out at the garden
the garden again with its small indentation of flowers over this we hear the ghoulish voice of stella unless he puts in standing on end which would be very original
and not require the use of either a knife or a saw
my guess is shes scattered all over town
a leg in the east river an arm cuts in stella please
jeff looks at stella
somethings in there
those flowers have been taken up and put back again
has a hard time saying it it could be the knife and the saw
quickly call lieutenant doyle
no lets wait
lets wait until it gets dark
ill go over and dig it up
halfway through lisas speech jeff begins speaking
to stella im not going to call doyle until i show him the body of mrs
thorwald to lisa and youre not going to dig up anything an get your neck broken too
the camera eases back to allow lisa to sit on the divan and jeff turn his chair toward her
stella still look out the window thinking
what weve got to do is find some way to get in there and stellas quiet voice brings him to a halt
hes starting to pack
jeff whips back to the window lisa turns to look
thorwald in the bedroom methodically folding a suit into a suitcase
another suitcase unopened is visible
jeff is staring out gripping his chair tightly
there is a touch of desperation on his face
he looks down at the flowers briefly then swings around abruptly
he wheels away from the camera to the wall cabinet
we see him take a piece of notepaper a pencil and an envelope
he puts a name on the envelope and then proceeds to write something on the sheet of paper
stella and lisa edge up behind him and look down at what he is writing
the camera rushes down over jeffs shoulder just in time to catch the last word as he finishes writing the message
the envelope is addressed to lars thorwald
the massage reads simply what have you done with her
jeff at the window looking through the long focus lens
we get a glimpse of stella behind him
he is watching the alleyway and street
just regular traffic
suddenly lisa comes into the picture from the left
she is carrying a white envelope
she stops waves her hands at jeff smiles and then hurries on
the lens slowly pans to the right and stops on miss torsos apartment
she is standing on a small stepladder nailing curtains above her window
her legs are bare though she wears high heel shoes
we do not see more than half way up her thighs
the lens takes this in for the briefest split second of hesitancy then moves on to await the arrival of lisa along thorwalds corridor
she does not appear yet
the lens moves back to get another glimpse of miss torso who is now descending the ladder
she is wearing a leotard
over this we hear stellas voice what are you going back for
the lens quickly swings back to thorwalds corridor
lisa is seen turning the corner and approaching thorwalds door on tiptoe
jeff lowers the long focus lens to get a more comprehensive view of thorwalds apartment and corridor outside
lisa approaches the door of thorwalds apartment
the salesman comes into the living room
he finds a package of cigarettes extracts one and lights it
lisa kneels down and carefully slides the letter under the door
at this moment thorwald extinguishes the match tosses it into an ashtray and turns toward the door
he freezes as he sees the letter on the floor
this momentary hesitation allows lisa to straighten up turn and walk carefully but swiftly away
thorwald moves rapidly toward the door
he bends down scoops up the letter and examines it briefly
lisa is just turning out of sight at the end of the corridor as thorwald throws open the door
he looks and sees no one
he takes a few questioning steps down the corridor then stops to examine the letter again
slowly he turns and makes his way back to the apartment tearing open the envelope
jeff lifts the long focus lens to his eyes again
his expression is tense
thorwald stops in front of his door to read the note
there is some curiosity on his face
as he reads all movement and emotion drain from his body
he stands there frozen
jeffs voice is heard over you did it thorwald
you did it
suddenly thorwald turns and dashes down the corridor
jeff whips the long focus lens from his eye
as thorwald dashes down the corridor we hear jeffs voice
he cries out instinctively but almost to himself lisa
both stella and jeff frantic
accusingly you shouldnt have let her do that
if he ever interrupting look
lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below thorwalds
she hides pressing back against the wall tensely
in the corridor above thorwald returns frustrated
he comes out onto the fire escape directly above lisa
she is aware of him and immediately retreats into the doorway
she disappears down the lower corridor as thorwald searches his fire escape
there is a sigh of relief from both of them
thank heaven thats over
i have a feeling weve just begun
thorwald is now passing through the living room into the bedroom
he picks up a shirt and puts it on
he then returns to packing his suitcases moving unhurriedly
jeff rubs his chin thoughtfully
stella is scanning the neighborhood
we hear a radio or a television show off and there is distant rhythmic music coming from the cafe on thorwalds street
no doubt of it
the question is when
stellas brow knits a little as she sees something
she reaches for the long focus lens
mind if i use the portable keyhole
jeff hands it to her
not as long as you tell me what youre looking at
she lifts it to her eye
miss lonely hearts apartment
she has opened a small brown bottle and taken out four red capsules which she places on the white table cloth of her little table
there is a candle burning in a holder and other lamps also light the apartment
she is dressed in sedate street clothes
she sits at the table and by the light of the candle proceeds to open a black covered book and read it
the print is fine
she bends over it a moment looks up at the capsules and returns to the book
she seems quite at peace
stella and jeff are heard over i wonder
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules
you can tell that from here
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
would four of them
breaks in no but it makes the rest easy to take
and shes reading the bible
after a slight pause then i wouldnt worry too much
but lets keep an eye on her
stella lowers the long focus lens
you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all
you dont say
i might just take that compliment as an insult
the door bursts open and they both turn quickly toward the entrance
lisa comes in panting and flushed
she stands a second at the door catching her breath but smiling with the pleasure of sampling danger and escaping unharmed
wasnt that close
off too close
she comes down the stairs
what was his reaction
i mean when he looked at the note
as lisa comes up to the two of them
well it wasnt the kind of expression that would get him a quick loan at the bank
lisa comes close to jeff speaks warmly
jeff how did i do
he takes her hands
would have made a great layout for the bazaar
the model pressed back against a brick wall eyes wild tense
low cut bodice in new suspicious black with a some of the pleasure goes out of her face
stella notices it
interrupts jeff youd make a good door prize at a wake
it relieves the slight friction as both jeff and lisa laugh
lisa happens to look toward the window and the laugh dies
jeff the handbag
jeff and stella turn toward the window
jeff grabs the long focus lens lifts it up
thorwald has the new alligator bag belonging to his wife in his hand
he moves slowly across the bedroom out of sight behind the door
he doesnt appear in the living room
in a moment he reappears moving back to his packing
he puts the handbag into one of the suitcases the one which he has almost completed filling
he goes on with his packing
jeff puts down the long focus lens and turns around toward the room
the two women watch him expectantly
thorwalds wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag
supporting his proposition during that phone conversation he held up three rings one with a diamond one with a big stone of some kind and one plain gold band
excited and the last thing shed leave behind would be her wedding ring
to stella do you ever leave yours at home
stella lifts her left hand and looks fondly at her ring finger
the only way anybody could get that off would be to chop my finger lets go down and find out whats buried in the garden
i always wanted to meet mrs
jeff looks at them aghast
what are you two talking about
got a shovel
theres probably one in the basement
now wait a minute jeff if youre squeamish just dont look
now hold on
im not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers but i dont care to watch two women end up like that dog stella grows a little uneasy
her eyes drift toward thorwalds apartment
to lisa you know miss fremont he might just have something there
theres no point in taking unnecessary chances
he points give me the phone book lisa
lisa moves for the phone book on the stand near the kitchen
maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment
lisa hands him the book
we only need a few minutes
jeff looks for thorwalds number in the directory
ill try to give you at least fifteen minutes
finds the number chelsea
he looks up reaches for the phone we scared him once
maybe we can scare him again
picks up receiver pauses im using that word we a little too freely i guess
i dont take any of the chances
shall we vote him in stella
the two women smile
jeff picks up the phone and dials chelsea
the women watch him tensely
he holds the receiver away from his ear a little and the buzzer is heard sounding on filter
lisa looks toward thorwalds apartment then stella then jeff
he comes out of the bedroom toward the phone
he wears a light summer coat and tie despite the heat
in the bedroom everything is packed with the exception of one open suitcase
we see another suitcase his sample case and a couple of topcoats across the bed
he approaches the phone hesitantly undecided whether or not to answer it
off half aloud go ahead thorwald pick it up
you wonder if its your girl friend calling
the one you killed for
pick it up thorwald
quickly thorwald does pick it up
cautiously on filter hello
off did you get my note
there is a pause as thorwald gropes for an answer
we can almost hear his breathing
well did you get it thorwald
who are you
ill give you a chance to find out
meet me in the bar at the brevoort and do it right away
why should i
for a little business meeting to settle the estate of your late wife
after a pause i dont know what you mean
firmly now stop wasting time thorwald or ill hang up and call the police
breathing heavily i only have a hundred dollars or so
thats a start
im at the brevoort now
ill be looking for you
he hangs up before thorwald can reply
thorwald looks at the receiver a moment then he slowly hangs up
he stands at the phone thinking
he doesnt suspect he is being watched through the window
then he makes up his mind and starts for the door
after he goes out he tests the door to make certain it is locked
over lets go stella
jeff turns his wheelchair halfway around as lisa and stella start quickly for the door the camera panning them across the room
they pause at the sound of jeffs voice
jeff calls after them one of you watch this window
if i see him coming back ill signal with a flashbulb
the door slams off and we hear the footsteps of the women dying down the corridor as jeff picks up the long focus lens and takes a sight on the
thorwald goes past the alley opening
jeff puts down the lens and wheels quickly to the wall cabinet
he finds a box of flash bulbs and a reflector
he puts them in his lap and returns to the window putting the chair sideways
he leans out a little and looks down
lisa is in the courtyard directly below jeffs window
she has reached the stairway leading up and to the right
she looks waves at jeff as stella comes up to her carrying a shovel
the two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron ladder they will use to climb the wall between jeffs yard and that of thorwalds
jeff picks up the phone and quickly dials
the buzzer sounds on filter then the phone is lifted
a womans voice is heard and jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it
this is doyles house
this is l
jefferies a friend of toms
who am i talking with
he squints out the window
lisa has climbed over the wall and is helping stella down into thorwalds yard
the shovel is lying on the ground beside lisa
jeffs conversation continues over the action of the two women
this is the baby sitter
when are they expected home
im hired til one
they went to dinner and maybe night clubbing
well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with l
jefferies right away
i might have quite a surprise for him
does he have your number mr
he has it
jeff hangs up
stella is now beginning to dig carefully lifting the flowers off the center of the bed where they had dipped down
she places the flower plants on the sidewalk
lisa stands facing jeffs window and occasionally glances over her shoulder uneasily at stellas work
at this moment the sounds of musical instruments begin to be heard from the songwriters apartment
a little annoyed at the interruption jeff turns to look at the studio apartment
in the songwriters apartment several of his musician friends have gathered
one plays a guitar another a clarinet and so on
one by one they try out the theme of the songwriters new melody running through it in turn to become familiar with the notes
we therefore hear the melody played informally in different ways with different instruments
jeff shifts his eyes from the songwriters apartment back to the courtyard
stella is busy expertly handling the shovel
lisa has her back to the nurse but looks apprehensively over her shoulder
she then looks up toward jeffs apartment
jeff gives her an encouraging little gesture with his hand
then his eyes lift a little as he looks up
miss lonely hearts is sitting on the sofa writing a note with a pad on her knee
next to her on the table the pills are still in evidence
jeff picks up the long focus lens and trains it on the alleyway
the alleyway and street intersection with normal night traffic but no sign of thorwald
the camera lens pans across and down to the hole being dug by stella
we get an impression of lisas legs as we go by
the spade comes out of the hole and rests on the side
the camera lens pans up just in time to catch stella turning up to jeff
she throws out a helpless hand and shakes her head
jeff lowers the lens and looks down at the two women with evident disappointment
lisa glances up to thorwalds apartment
she turns and gestures some instructions to stella
then she looks up at jeff and gestures her intention to enter thorwalds apartment
she turns and dashes toward thorwalds fire escape as stella makes a fruitless grab to restrain her
jeff shocked and alarmed calls out lisa no
he looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to lisa
apparently no sight of thorwald
while lisa starts up the fire escape we see stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it
stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk
jeff tense and wide eyed watches lisa climb the fire escape
lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of thorwalds apartment
she tries unsuccessfully to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape
and then with some difficulty stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window which is open
she goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases
jeff quickly picks up the long focus lens and trains it on the salesmans apartment
lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand
there is an expression of triumph on her face
she opens it and her expression changes to dismay
she looks toward jeffs apartment and to communicate her dismay she turns the handbag upside down
nothing falls out
he lowers the long focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety
he mutters almost to himself come on
get out of there
his eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to lisa
lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry
she moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them
she finds nothing
as jeff watches tensely the door bursts open behind him and stella hurries into the apartment
ring thorwalds phone the second you see him on the way back
jeff swings toward stella
he reaches for the phone
im going to ring him now
as he picks up the receiver stella pushes his hand down again
give her another minute shes doing this for you
stella looks out the window and her face registers shock
jeff turns quickly to the window again forgetting the phone for the moment
miss lonely hearts
miss lonely hearts is in the act of popping an envelope up against the table lamp on the table next to the sofa
from the same table she takes a pill bottle and empties the contents into her left hand
replacing the bottle she picks up a glass of water
off call the police
we hear the sound of the receiver picked up and jeff starting to dial new york police
at this moment from the song writers apartment which has been quiet for a while comes a new burst of melody
it is the melody which the song writer has been composing during the past few days
now it is rich and full and completed as the musical group plays it
miss lonely hearts lifts her head to listen and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she
jeff and stella turn for a quick glimpse of the song writers apartment
a quick flash of the song writers apartment and his musical group gathered around the piano
maybe that music will delay her taking the pills
jeff and stella look back to thorwalds apartment
jeff has the receiver to his ear and the buzzer can be heard on filter
at the bottom of the picture miss lonely hearts is still listening to the music while in the apartment above lisa appears into the living room from behind the doorway
that leads to the bedroom
she looks across to the source of the music
she is as arrested by the melody as miss lonely hearts
then looking across to jeff she holds up her hands triumphantly to show him the jewelry she has discovered
at this point thorwald appears coming along the corridor of his apartment house
lisa is completely unaware of his approach
stella is so shocked she can only gasp for breath
jeff in near panic shouts in anguish
at this moment the phone is picked up on filter and a voice speaks precinct six sergeant allgood
jeff opens his mouth to speak but no words come out as his attention is focused on thorwald at the door unlocking it with his key
we see that lisa has heard the sound and looks toward the door all but frozen with alarm
the policeman on the phone repeats with studied irritation precinct six sergeant allgood
lisa dashes back into the bedroom just in time to avoid being seen by thorwald as he opens the door and enters the apartment
jeff urgently into phone with a serious and rapid voice a man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street
second floor rear
make it fast
phone is down on filter and jeff replaces his receiver
thorwald crosses the living room and goes into the bedroom
suddenly he looks onto the bed
he picks up the open alligator handbag
he turns facing the window looking down at the bag
he looks up in the direction of the living room
then suddenly his whole frame stiffens his head turns a little further around to his right
he is looking directly at lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom
he holds out the bag and without moving starts to question the unseen lisa
he takes a little step forward and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as lisa begins to emerge into the living room backing away slowly
by her gestures and nervous laughter she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment
he comes towards her and enters the living room as well
lisa edging toward the door points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in
he points to the window
she makes one more step toward the door but thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist
he twists it brutally and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window
her head snaps back against the head rest
with his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger and with his left open palmed he demands something from lisa
slowly her right hand comes up and opens
he takes the jewelry from her looks at it for a surprised moment puts it into his coat pocket
he reaches down with both hands and by the wrists jerks her to her feet
he is talking viciously to her
we can hear lisa calling out faintly jeff
thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood
he realizes that somebody might be watching him
he drags her across the room reaches up with one arm and the lights go off
the faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle but not clearly
an angry jeff is staring and trying to penetrate the semi darkness of thorwalds room
then he bends his head forward in despair and after a brief moment speaks with deep sincerity stella what can we do
stella staring out tense frightened
then her expression changes sharply as she looks slightly to the left
there they are
jeff looks up quickly
two policemen move quickly and professionally up the corridor toward thorwalds apartment
they stop at the door listen a moment and then push the buzzer insistently
inside the apartment lights go on and thorwald is in the center of the room looking toward the door
lisa staggers away from him trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair
she is as surprised at the interruption as thorwald
he listens looks back questioningly toward lisa then goes to the door
he passes into the kitchen
jeff and stella visibly relax
jeff doesnt say anything but a gesture of rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand gives an indication of how deep his tension was
after a moments hesitation thorwald goes to the door and opens it
jeff quickly puts a hand out and takes up his long focus lens
he looks through the finder
thorwalds head and shoulders fill the screen
for a moment thorwald is genuinely frightened by the sight of the police
we see him listening to the policeman out of the picture
thorwald turns slowly and we see him lose much of his fright and regain some control of his face
he completes his turn and is looking at the girl a little puzzled
he then swings back toward the police
a quick flash of jeff and stella looking
jeff still has the long focus lens to his eye
thorwald is displaying indignation and complaint to the police as he nods his head vigorously toward lisa
at this the police start to advance into the apartment going directly for lisa
she flashes a quick look toward jeffs window
she turns back as the first policeman reaches her
he starts to question her
stella turns away and goes quickly to the table for the binoculars
jeff still is using the long focus lens
we see lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner she used with thorwald previously as if to say she came into the apartment by mistake
thorwald listening comes quickly forward to contradict her vigorously
he holds out the jewelry in his hand and then picks up and shows the empty handbag
the policeman impressed looks back to lisa for an explanation
she has none
over this we hear stella frantically asking whats she trying to do
why doesnt she turn him in
shell be arrested
thatll get her out of there wont it
the first policeman indicates that lisa is to come along with him
he pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from thorwald about the attempted burglary
the second policeman reaches for the jewelry in thorwalds hand and takes it for examination
in the brief pause while the two policemen speak to each other lisa starts to wave her left hand behind her back
jeff looking through his camera
we get a closer view of the waving hand
she stops waving and holds her fingers spread out
with her other hand she points to the wedding ring on her left hand
the lens pans upward and across until it brings thorwalds profile into the picture
he is looking down directly at lisas hands
his head slowly turns and he looks right up directly into the lens
suddenly he becomes aware that lisa is signaling to someone who is watching him
jeff and stella
he drops the camera into his lap
hed seen us
stella hurries from the window turning off lights as jeff backs his chair into the room
as thorwalds attention is drawn back to the second policeman to answer further questions the first policeman takes lisa by the arm and leads her out of the apartment
he goes down the corridor pushing the curious people away from the door
the last light out stella stops to catch her breath and turns to jeff
when you took your first snapshot did you ever think it would bring you to this
urgently stella how long do you think hell stay there
squinting out window unless hes dumber than i think he wont wait til his lease is up
jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets
in the right hand drawer
stella moves to get it
what do you need money for
to bail lisa out of jail
she finds a billfold hands it to jeff
he takes it extracts some bills and begins counting them
as he counts stella comments you know you could just leave her there until after next tuesday so you could sneak away safely as planned
he looks up sharply at her and then without comment goes back to counting the money
with obvious disappointment one hundred and twenty seven
how much do you think youll need
first offense burglary he shrugs probably two fifty
gets an idea points the piggy bank
stella following his pointing finger gets a piggy bank down from a shelf on the sideboard
he takes it cracks it on the knee of his cast
it splits open and some money comes out
mostly bills a few silver halves
what he doesnt get stella picks up
thirty three here
totals one ninety
i got twenty or so in my purse
give me what youve got
jeff does as stella gets her purse
what about the rest
when those cops get a look at miss fremont theyll even contribute
stella goes up to the door
the phone rings
jeff grabs it picks it up
to phone just a minute
to stella ill tell you who it is when you get back
stella goes quickly out the door
he returns to the phone call glancing at the same time toward the courtyard
filter this is doyle jeff
urgently tom ive got something real big for you
wearily look jeff dont louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be interrupting harshly listen to me
lisas been arrested
slightest pause your lisa
she went into thorwalds apartment and he came back
the only way i could get her out was to call the police
angry i told you that interrupting i know what you told me
she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
thorwalds wedding ring
if that woman were still alive shed be wearing it
grudgingly a possibility
talking fast a fact
last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden
because he had something buried in there
something a dog could scent
like an old hambone
fast i dont know what pet name thorwald had for his wife
and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase
he wasnt taking his possessions because theyre up in his apartment now
you think perhaps it was old hambone
and one other thing doubting tom it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance
if he called his wife the day she left after she arrived in merritsville why did she need to send him a postcard saying shed arrived
after pause a detective whered they take lisa
i sent a friend over with bail money
maybe you wont need it
ill run it down jeff
we see thorwald leave his apartment and proceed down the corridor
just dont dally
thorwald knows hes being watched
he wont hang around long
if that ring checks out well give him an escort
he hangs up and just as he does jeff looks toward thorwalds apartment
he rolls forward to the window
he seems a little puzzled by what he sees
no movement or glow of a cigar
the corridor outside lighted but empty
jeff scratches the side of his chin studies thorwalds apartment as if he might see some small clue as to where the salesman is
he looks toward the intersection to his left
apparently he sees nothing
he turns to look down into the garden
miss lonely hearts is standing in the yard outside her apartment looking up to the porch of miss torso
the ballet dancer is in high heels and a fresh summer dress
faintly heard have you heard that song hes been writing
she indicates the song writers apartment
miss lonely hearts turns looks up at the studio apartment a moment then looks up at miss torso
nods yes im glad i was here when he played it
he sits quietly a moment thinking
suddenly he jumps a little as the phone rings
he reaches for it picks up the receiver
still looks out window hello
no answer hello doyle
tom i think thorwalds left
i dont see anything of he looks at receiver then hello
slowly he looks up toward thorwalds apartment
then back to the receiver
on filter a receiver can be heard carefully being replaced
jeff slowly lowers the phone into the cradle
he looks once more toward thorwalds apartment
then he turns his chair around quickly and looks toward the door to his apartment
quiet in the apartment and in the corridor
light showing beneath the door from the hall light
jeff watching waiting nervous at first
he reaches for the phone changes his mind
he looks around for some kind of a weapon finds none to suit him
he hears the slightest squeak of a floorboard and looks quickly toward the door again
another squeak of a floorboard so light and quickly passing that at any other time it would have no significance even if it could be heard
then the light beneath the door disappears
jeff squints at the door blinks squints again
no doubt about it black
he looks again for a weapon and almost by instinct he snatches up his flash holder and the small packet of bulbs he had taken out to signal lisa earlier
he tries to move his wheelchair farther into the shadows
his eyes are glued to the door of his apartment and his senses are sharp as a hunting dogs
he scarcely breathes
only the slightest sound is heard as the doorknob turns
the door slowly and carefully swings open but the corridor is too dark to tell at first who is entering
the door closes just as quietly
from the shadowed recess comes a heavy voice
a threatening voice
what do you want from me
jeff doesnt answer
thorwald steps to the top of the stairs and is now somewhat visible
he looks tall and huge and explosive
your friend the girl could have turned me in
why didnt she
jeff doesnt answer
his eyes watch thorwald
he licks his lip with nervous tension and grips the flash holder
thorwald comes down the two steps pauses at the bottom
what is it you want
a lot of money
i dont have any money
jeff doesnt answer
he moves forward a couple of steps
sudden loud anger say something
tell me what you want
jeff still doesnt speak
he grips the flash holder a little more tightly lifts it just the fraction of an inch as if he is prepared to use it
thorwald has advanced to the middle of the room his eyes on jeff and his hands clenching with the effort to control his anger
can you get me that ring back
loud tell her to bring it back
he advances a step
the police have it by now
then if the police get me you wont be around to laugh
thorwald starts to move threateningly for jeff
from a three quarter angle toward thorwald
jeff lifts the flash holder to face level and closes his eyes
he explodes the flash
thorwalds face fills the screen registering shock confusion
he throws up his hands for protection and recoils making an involuntary sound of surprise
a vision of jeff and the apartment as seen by thorwald
it is distorted and out of focus filled with large twisting balls of bright yellow color
thorwald blinking trying to regain his sight
jeff ejects the used bulb and quickly inserts another
he works furiously sweating
he gets the bulb in the flash holder just in time to meet thorwald coming at him
jeff closes his eyes and another bulb explodes in thorwalds face
thorwalds face full screen again as he recoils from the flash
the apartment as seen by thorwald again
big twisting balls of blinding yellow
thorwald stumbles back against the side table knocking objects off onto the floor struggling for balance and sight
jeff works rapidly to put a fresh bulb in the holder
thorwald regains his equilibrium and some of his sight
orienting himself he starts for jeff again
this time when the flash holder goes off we see it from jeffs angle
thorwald is lighted almost white shockingly outlining every detail of his face clothes hands
his rage and frustration are fixed for a brief but terrifying moment
he stumbles backward again trying to brush the light away from his face almost as if it were a solid enveloping substance
jeff ejects a bulb puts his last bulb into the flash holder
he tries to move the wheelchair a little further away from thorwald
then he raises the flash holder again
we see doyle lisa stella and the detectives come to thorwalds door try it
one of the men steps forward with a flat steel jimmy and snaps the lock open
they move quickly into the darkened apartment
doyle hits the lights inside the kitchen
the group goes into the living room
the lights go on
no sign of thorwald
doyle lisa and stella instinctively turn and look toward jeffs apartment
from thorwalds apartment shooting at jeffs window
a sudden bright flash is seen as the last flash bulb goes off
and it lights the scene of jeff in the wheelchair and thorwald diving through the air at him
darkness rushes in blacker than before
thorwald has finally reached jeff knocking the flash equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him
it is apparent that he is trying to pull jeff out of the wheelchair
jeff fights him off
the wheelchair crashes over spilling jeff to the floor
thorwald is on top of him lifting dragging him to the window
jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away from the window but thorwald is far too powerful for him
he strains to raise jeff to the windowsill
ill give you a good look out the window
slowly inexorably he raises jeff to the windowsill
jeff frantically grabs for the upright window frame wrapping his arms around it
thorwald shoves the rest of his body over the windowsill
doyle lisa stella and the two detectives crossing thorwalds yard see jeff going out the window
lisa is panicked
from doyles viewpoint jeff hanging out the window and thorwald hammering at his hands and arms with bare fists
doyle pushes lisa to one side and starts to scale the wall preceded by the two detectives
thorwald fights to dislodge jeffs grip
looking down on jeffs face showing his strain and the pain of thorwalds attack
the brick floor of the patio seems a hundred feet below
thorwald and jeff struggling
doyle pulling himself to the top of the wall
lisa stella and the two men below looking up
lisa is white faced and frightened
thorwald smashes at jeffs arms and hands
jeffs grip begins to slip
doyle reaches the top of the wall looks up at jeff
jeff as seen from doyles angle hanging somehow weathering thorwalds insane attack
doyle reaches for his service revolver
he doesnt have it
he looks down and calls one of the detectives back
your thirty eight
looking down at the two detectives from doyles point of view
creel grabs for his gun expertly
the holster breaks away
it is in his hand and with a deft movement he tosses it upward
doyle catches it turns up to jeffs apartment
thorwald still trying to loosen jeffs grip
the salesman in a complete wild sweating rage is beyond all reason
his glasses hang from one ear his coat is torn his tie pulled to one side
shooting over doyles shoulder as he steadies himself against the wall lifting the service revolver up for a shot at thorwald
his aim is careful slow painfully deliberate
jeff seems about to fall
the two detectives ahead of doyle are moving up below the window
lisa stand looking up her hands at the sides of her head frozen with panic
two detectives appear behind thorwald and grab him
the startled thorwald stops his attack on jeff as he looks wildly around to find the source of his new attack
jeff hanging from the window frame
he claws desperately for a hold
people rush to their windows looking out at the excitement
some people on the ground floor come out into the yard
doyle and the two detectives come into the patio beneath jeff
doyle directs them to improvise something to break jeffs fall leaves greenery their coats cushions from the patio furniture anything they can find
the four uniformed policemen rush into the backyard
lisa and stella come over the wall into the patio beneath jeff
they look up at jeff encouraging him to hold on
a detective goes into jeffs cellar door trying to reach his apartment before jeff loses his grip
the siffleuse and her husband are standing on the fire escape in plain almost somber clothes
they watch expressionlessly
beneath them the empty basket which once held their dog swings silently in the night air
jeff hanging from his windowsill
he loses his grip and plunges down into the patio below
two detectives throw themselves beneath him
they are knocked to the ground as jeffs fall tumbles both of them
after jeff hits he lies still twisted over to one side
doyle and lisa rush over to jeff
there is an audible sound of shock in the neighborhood as jeff has fallen various ohs ahs and possibly a stifled scream or two
lisa kneels down cradles jeffs head in her lap
there are tears in her eyes
her clothes are disheveled and her dress torn
her hair is disarranged
but withal her face is as beautiful as ever with love
jeff jeff darling
he opens his eyes
winces with pain
to the detectives get an ambulance
down to jeff dont move
try to lie still
lisa i i cant tell you how scared i was that you you might affectionately shut up
im all right
to doyle think youve got enough for a search warrant now
i can make it
at that moment a man appears leaning out of jeffs window
he looks down to the patio
looking up yeah
thorwalds ready to take us on a tour of the east river
stella tugs at doyles arm and stands on tiptoe to whisper something into his ear
doyle then looks up to the detective
did he say what was buried in the flower bed
its over in his apartment
in a hat box
doyle turns quizzically at stella
oh no thanks i dont want any of part of her she pauses then does a surprised take back to doyle what did i say
beginning on jeffs window thermometer the camera pans from right to left around the neighborhood
in the songwriters apartment we see the songwriter with a guest miss lonely hearts
both in dress and manner she seems quite happy and adjusted to life
the songwriter is placing the first recording of his new song on a record player for her to hear
it is a full symphonic arrangement which is heard over
thorwalds apartment is empty stripped of its furnishings
two painters are repainting the walls
the siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape training a new white dog to ride in their basket
miss torso is practicing her ballet again
she wears a white leotard
the sound of someone at the door interrupts her
she goes to the door opens it an inch or two cautiously
when she sees who is outside she throws open the door
an innocuous unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder
she kisses him fondly after closing the door
he puts down the barracks bag tosses his hat into a chair and with the attitude of a man who belongs there goes to the icebox to see whats to
the newlyweds are arguing
the camera pans past jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window
camera moves down to the lower part of his body and we see that both his legs are now in casts
the camera lifts slightly to show lisa sitting on the sofa nearby
she wears levis and a plaid cotton shirt
she is reading a book on travel
she looks up briefly at jeff
when she realizes he is asleep she puts down the travel book and reaches for the latest copy of harpers bazaar
