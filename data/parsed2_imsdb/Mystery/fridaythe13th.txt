b if window
href b b friday the th the track is silent
the camera looks at a sign
it reads established gradually we can begin to hear in the bg the sounds of children playing
in the bg a few dozen children in camp uniforms are enjoying a game of softball
in the fg claudette is looking for someone
claudette is years old
she is pretty
she wears a t shirt with assistant counsellor written on it
she fills out the shirt very well
failing to find whomever she is looking for claudette walks quickly in the opposite direction
the camera holds on the game for a few seconds and we the childrens voices fade slowly
ecu as a counsellor squeezes off a shot
the paper target is ripped in the black
the counsellor hands the weapon to a camper who snaps in at the line
claudette shouts up to the counsellor from the bg
have you seen barry
the counsellor smiles
he and chloe were at the lodge last time i saw him
the counsellor smiles
two children run by carrying indian headdresses
claudette passes them impatiently as she sees barry and chloe
barry is leaning against the front rail of the porch his arms behind his head the better to show off his physique to chloe and assistant counsellor who is currently
looking at him with cow eyes
in the bg we can hear a portable radio blaring out an everly brothers hit
barry is handsome and out for all he can get
he is not ashamed for being caught with this other good looking girl
weve got to talk
barry looks at chloe then eases off the rail
barry puts an arms around claudette looks over his shoulder at chloe and saunters off with the former
the everly brothers continue as we from over the tops of a rack of canoes we see barry and claudette walking along the shore
you said we were special
i meant everything
in the bg children leap into the water
continuing you know what i said though
i cant barry
the track goes silent
barry claudette walk along a path
this is not an aimless walk for barry knows exactly where he wants to go
he leaves the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing
claudette hesitates then goes to sit next to him
i care very much
he puts an arm around her and draws her close
does chloe kiss as good as i do
barry decides to be politic
i wouldnt know
she kisses him and they are locked
a bird calls wheels across the patch of sky above
the camera shifts to another angle just beyond the thicket of lacy vines
it is a slow tracking shot which gives the impression that we are watching the action from the pov of another person an unseen visitor
watching the two teen aged assistant counsellors making their first sexual encounters
this unseen observer will be called the prowler
barry reaches up outside claudettes t shirt to hold her breast
she reaches up to take his hand away
no they wont
he ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t shirt so that part of her bra is exposed
he seals her protesting lips by kissing her
from the prowlers pov the camera moves to get a better angle
a hand moves into frame and pulls back some branches to clear the field of vision
a branch pops
in a thick whisper somebodys there barry
come on claudette
a mans not made of stone
lets go back barry
i need you so much claudette
barry leans in and unhooks her bra
they kiss again passionately
the prowler pauses then moves never seen except for a bit of foot or hand from the pov of the camera closer and closer as the two teenagers become more
and more oblivious
the theme has snuck in
it becomes discordant
quick cut to barry claudettes faces their eyes closed the perspiration streaking their flushed skin
suddenly claudette looks up into the camera with terror
a hatchet flashes into frame and claudette goes down under the blow
the camera turns to barry
the prowlers powerful hand has him by the throat
he backpeddles trying to get away
another angle as barry is stopped against a tree
a hunting knife soars against the leafy sky
barry grabs the knife hand at the wrist
the knife falls to the mossy floor of the clearing
two hands go for the free blade
barrys hand has it
there is a confused jumble of struggle
onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the prowler
reaction shot barry horrified by the sight
the prowlers hand has the knife
it moves quickly forward
we can hear the blade strike
barry stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek
mcu the moss where the finger fell
the prowler reaches into frame picks up the finger and exits frame
quick cut to chloe out searching for the missing counsellors
she stands at the edge of the clearing her hands pressed on her temples her throat filled with a scream of terror
the music has stopped abruptly
it is completely silent
the screen is completely black
a small white shape starts to zooms towards the fg
the shape becomes a three dimensional rendering of friday the th
just as it gets to its final position the friday logo shatters a previously unseen pane of glass
there is a loud crash
the logo shifts to the upper left corner of the frame as we rolls titles white on black
the theme music is a reprise of the theme we heard during the forest sequence now done in a childlike arrangement
titles end and the music fades out
the track is silent
in a long shot we see the one main street
a newspaper delivery truck drives away from the camera
a girl walks down the street
superimposed title a medium shot in front of the bank reveals a day date time temp sign which blinks degrees degrees we can begin to hear a small town dj
over as a pick up truck moves down the street past the girl in her late teens
she has a knapsack a freshly scrubbed face jeans and a plaid shirt
she wears her hair in a long braid
she wears nike jogging shoes
this is annie
its on friday the th of june
this is big dave and its time for you lazy bones to get out of bed
its black cat day in crystal lake
dont forget the big drawing today to see who gets our friday the th monster surprise either a mans digital continuous readout watch or a panasonic color television set
in cu a hand moves to turn down an old brown plastic radio from which big dave is doing his morning man routine
dont walk under a ladder
dont spill any salt dont
the radio is turned way down
we see that the hand belongs to trudy a hefty waitress who wears her golden hair in a bun with a pencil stuck in it
buddy the boss is seen in the bg working the grill
the regulars are there five men and two women who always come in for breakfast
they are the retailers the oil delivery man the switchboard operators and the cop
annie walks in the front door crosses the past the cash register and walks down the counter
im sick of them repeats
i musta seen that kojak times
how far is camp crystal lake
they gonna open that place camp blood
cop what is it eddie
forty i heard they were gonna try miles
oil man bout that
with a wink be an interesting summer
can i get a bus or something
you goin out to the crossroads
the oil man nods
continuing give her a lift
paying up no sweat trudy
lets do it to it kid
annie steps aside as the oil man heads for the front door
he is smirking
hes fifty strong and balding
he makes no attempts to hide his appreciation for annies figure
i wouldnt send my kids to that camp for all the tea in china
kidding i thought you hated your kids
trudy looks around does a take then laughs
annie walks a half step behind the oil man heading for his truck which is parked there on the street
all the girls up there gonna look as good as you
i dont know
annie wonders if she should accept the ride with this guy
suddenly from between two parked cars pops ralph a crazy hobo who has two dead rats in his mouth their tails in his teeth they swing from him like a
get outta here
to annie dont worry about him
back to ralph gwon
its friday the th
he giggles and skulks away
climb on up miss
the oil man gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig
as the truck pulls away we see ralph through the windshield standing at the edge of the road
he is angry and upset now
he pats his rats
the oil man shifts looks over and smiles
his two front teeth are missing on top
must be the fourth time somebodys tried to reopen that place
camp crystal lake
something always happens up there
he turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the dj again
im gonna count to three and then you better get up
a beautiful day
jim says its gonna be a nine point five day
heres meatloaf from the bat out of hell album
the oil truck thunders along the road
the oil truck has stopped
annie stands alongside the drivers side
dont let the spooks getcha annie
thanks a lot for the lift
he nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have been if he were thirty years younger
he puts it in gear and roars off
annie looks around and sees an old gas station
it is closed
theres a sign which reads no gas til sat
a mangey dog sits on the stoop watching annie
annie kneels down and calls the dog
the dog comes
annie pets him and then heads off up the road
the dog watches her go
annie is beginning to get worried about the time
its hot and shes late
she looks up
from her pov a jeep barrels along the road towards us
annie puts out her numb
from the drivers pov we see annie waiting for a lift
the driver unseen shifts down until annie is alongside
the jeep an uncovered model stops
annie smiles a big delicious smile at us as we sit in the drivers seat
im headed for camp crystal lake
can you help me out
apparently the driver nods because annie beams at us
she tosses her pack in the back and hops aboard
the driver accelerates
the jeep roars along the road
the sun and shadows keep us from seeing the driver
still in the drivers pov the camera watches as annie looks around admires the woods the jeep the day
things are going her way
i cant remember being this excited about anything
i want to be a teacher when i finish at southern state
i guess ive always wanted to work with children
i hate it when people call em kids
sounds like little goats
the forest outside the speeding jeep is deeper and signs of civilization have all but disappeared
annie still turns and looks at the camera when she speaks to the driver
continuing the job market for teachers is supposed to be the pits these days but i dont care
when you have a dream as long as i have youll do anything
a look of surprise passes annies young face
continuing wasnt that camp crystal lake
just back there
in the fg the sign for camp crystal lake
in the bg the jeep roars off into the distance
frightened confused i think we better stop
the jeeps speed increases
annie grabs for the ignition key but the drivers hand darts out and slaps annie away
we see that this hand is missing its little finger
panicked without any other recourse annie looks about her and then leaps from the moving jeep aiming for the relatively soft underbrush alongside the narrow road
annie lands rolls is upended scratched by brambles and flips
she scrambles to her feet and starts running towards the camp
the jeep stops turns quickly heads back for her
from the drivers pov we see annie run looking back in fear
annies feet pound the hard packed dirt
she looks over her shoulder to see the jeep
the sun flares on the jeeps windshield keeping us from being able to see any details of the driver
in a final desperate move annie drives into the underbrush to escape
the jeep skids to a stop
the camera becomes the driver and chases into the thicket
branches and briars snap back at us
just ahead the terror stuck annie stumbles and falls
she screams as a knife flashes past her in a blur
when the knife has passed all we can see is a look of surprise on annies face
the camera pulls back
her throat has been cut
she collapses out of frame
a bird soars across the sky above
the track is silent
a gaily decorated camper van travels along the highway
we hear rock n roll over coming from a car radio as this much in need of repair vehicle passes a slower car
in the camper van are three young people
they are full of fun fresh and expectant as they head towards crystal lake
they are instantly likeable
at the wheel is ned a short year old whose well developed upper body is a tribute to his weight lifting
he is nice looking a joker who is always trying to get some attraction
he is funny and alert
next to him is jack an athlete whose clean cut look is as american as popcorn
he is quieter two years younger and not as smart as ned
he has to think things through
marcie is jacks girlfriend
she is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger jacks shoulders
she is a funny girl pretty and always looking for fun
she enjoys every minute of every day
she hasnt been touched by tragedy
sex is all you ever think of neddy
there you are dead wrong
sometimes i only think about kissing women
marcie finds a sore spot on jacks back
i was just wondering if you thought thered by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake
you are a true pierce of work ned
marcie hits ned on the arms playfully
continuing how about our last jay
jack reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a joint
what about the dope paragraph in mr
quote controlled substances are expressly forbidden
possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal
we got two weeks before the kids even arrive
then ill act responsibly
until then hit me
she takes the lighted joint and tokes
the van turns past the sign that reads camp crystal lake established marcie is wide eyed looking at the lush surroundings
yeah and it also look like it hasnt seen a coat of paint in six years
the camera sees what ned saw
the buildings are run down at the heels
it is the same camp we saw in the early scenes but time has torn the place badly
the van passes the camera and we see the three new arrivals looking out the window
this is the main building
it is the building where barry and claudette met
outside is a flagpole a small parking area a large overhanging tree
in the bg we can see part of the lake
in the fg there is a jeep
an axe flashes through the frame and hacks apart the halves of a huge tree stump
the camera pulls back to reveal a middle aged man in cut offs a bare chest hiking boots and beat up cowboy hat
this is steve christy
he is strong charming and engaging
he is animated always in motion impatient with how long it takes to do things
in the bg the van comes to a stop
no sooner has jack hopped down than steve is beckoning him over
wanta give me a hand here
jack smiles and comes quickly
ned steps down from the van and now we can see that he has had polio when he was a kid
his upper body is strong but his legs are slightly deformed
he and marcie hustle over to the big stump
continuing wanta roll this sucker out of the way
alice comes into the ms
she is carrying a shovel and a bucket and has obviously been working for a couple of hours
cabin b is ready
push on this side
alice this is jack marcie and ned
they exchange hellos as they bend to the work
continuing thats got her
im steve christy
welcome to camp crystal lake
you got some grubby clothes
climb into em
alice see if bill has cleaned out the boathouse
i want him to start with the canoes
what happened to brenda
you told her to sweep the courts
steve sets off
id rather she painted
lets go folks
as soon as hes gone ned turns to alice
i thought we had two weeks
you can changed in three
the camera looks down a long line of canoes each with its hull up
a brush slaps into view
bill is sweating while finishing a coat of paint on the last canoe
bill is a thin ascetic looking college sophomore
he rubs his long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone call his name os
he turns to see alice at the bottom of the trail
steve said for you to start on the boats
i finished the boats
alice nods slowly
ill tell him
she turns away
the others show up
everybody except the girl whos supposed to handle the kitchen
bill puts his brush in a coffee can of turps
alice look at him then turns again
you think youre gonna last all summer
im not sure ill last all week
pauses ill tell steve
steve and ned are rehanging a door
next to them is brenda a dark eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting the wall
on the other side marcie is scraping some flaking paint
shim it up just a scooch
ned levers the door higher at the top
steve uses a long ratchet screwdriver
continuing to answer your question my parents once owned this camp
there were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt
i promised them id reopen if i could
see if it closes right now
ned swings the door on its hinges
did you meet brenda
brenda turns and nods
continuing shes archery
hes rifle ranged
and im behind schedule
lets go ned
they exit with the tool box
marcie stops and turns to brenda who looks upward and blows the hair from her forehead
steve alice brenda marcie ned jack and bill are lugging a swimming float down to the waters edge
steve supervises as he carries the thing which is quite heavy
they ad lid as appropriate
there goes my hernia
are you sure youre lifting
not so fast
im walking backward
they drop the things carefully
come on back here and lets above the float in
they get behind it and shove it into the water
ned hops aboard for the ride flipping into a handstand
the screen has gone completely black
the door to the shed is whipped open quickly letting in the full brightness of the sun
there is a shape
the camera irises down so that we can see that jack has come in on an errand
as jack looks around we can take the time to see that there are a half dozen lantern a few cans of lantern fuel a couple of hibachis some entrenching
tools packs portable ice chests etc
up on the long side wall are a half dozen hunting knives in sheathes also hanging neatly
suddenly a hand comes into frame and touches jack on the shoulder as he is preoccupied with his task
jack turns with a start
he looks into the camera
reverse pov to see marcie standing in the doorway
what are those for
an indian raid
she points to the row of hatchets and knives
steves got a woodlore program
you see any life rings
marcie looks behind some piled up equipment
she pulls out two rings
meet me in my cabin after taps
she kisses him on the cheek and gives him a playful goose
they exit together
steve christy comes upon alice who is renailing floorboards on the porch of the arts crafts cabin
on the railing is a sketch pad which steve thumbs through
insert alices sketch
it is a moody pierce a sense of foreboding dominates it
otherwise it is the camps central compound featuring the tree that forms the central focus
you draw very well
i wish i could spend more time at it
alice misses a nail and hits her thumb
she reacts good naturedly and keeps on working
steve bends down next to alice
this isnt your cup of tea hunh
she shakes her head
continuing any particular reason
just a feeling
pause nothing personal
nodding you want to leave
i dont know
probably be best for everybody
you may not care a lot about this place alice but i mean to make it my whole life
its been my whole life
gimme a chance
stay a week
help get it ready
next friday if youre not happy ill put you on the bus myself
ill be grateful
he puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek
she looks up
he stands up
continuing ive got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff but ill be back around ten
if youre still up we can talk okay
she watches him cross out of frame
steve is at the wheel of his jeep
the counsellors are standing within earshot huddled around the jeep
you want it listed separately
brenda after lunch hit the archery range
if annie gets here have her start in on the kitchen
do your best
tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people
id like to look good
he wheels the car around and out the driveway
the others stand looking before ned breaks the silence
he neglected to mention this place is called camp blood downtown
they are all getting back to work
some campers drowned
then some counsellors got killed
late fifties sometime
they never caught the guy who did it either
neddy collects weird facts
next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake
as they laugh the camera holds on alice
brenda has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job
she enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area
she likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is or have others think her more sophisticated
brenda rolls a straw target out from under the lean to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance
there are already two such targets out a product of her efforts so far
the targets are heavy
this isnt an easy one person job
the camera closes in tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target
in mcu she lifts a target up
her head is very close to the face of the target
she gets it up lets the tripod take the weight and then just as she lifts her weight back an arrow streaks into the center of the gold missing her
head by eighteen inches
brenda whips around
we see what she sees a very cocky ned standing by the lean to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously
he has a feather stuck in his hair
she grabs the arrow and storms at him
she snaps the arrow in half
did anyone ever tell you youre beautiful when youre angry
plussed i dont believe you
want to see my trick shot
its even better
brenda still thinks hes a jerk but hes so outrageous theres little she can do
still laughing you ever fire one of those bows again and ill tack you up on the wall to dry
god but i love that sexy talk
brenda snatches the bow from him shakes her head and puts the bow down next to a collection of wicked looking arrows
this is a fairly large single room
the walls are bare and uninsulated
there are a few easels but for the most part the room is dominated by long tables and rough hewn benches
the light seeps through the streaked windows making the grey wood interior appear silver colored
alice her hair in a bandana has just finished sweeping up
the camera picks up on alices sketch of the central camp area on one easel
on a second easel she has done the preliminary sketch of the lake itself
it is also a moody picture
alice cocks her head to look at the sketches shivers just a little then goes on to her next task
there is a row of newly arrived cardboard boxes
she opens the first in cu with a matte knife
she take out the invoice and checks it against the first items gimp the plastic string from which all the campers will make lanyards
we watch through one of the dusty panes seeing the charcoal sketch in the fg alice in the bg checking her materials against her invoice
alice snaps around sensing that she is being watched
in cu her frightened face looks at the sun drenched dusty pane
her face relaxes until bang
the sound of a door slamming echoes through the room
the camera zooms back from her face to see someone standing in the doorway
it is bill
how you doing
alice smiles then turns back to her job of taking inventory
bill watches her
did you want something
she starts to take a box down from a high shelf
she doesnt realize that there is something on top of the box
steve said you were thinking of leaving
alice lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather working tools clatters down shattering the silence
alice fends off the flying implements and bill rushes to her side
continuing oh my god
continuing youre lucky
they stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor
bill looks at her while they work
continuing how come youre leaving
its long and personal
it has nothing to do with you or the other kids
maybe i can help
alice looks at bill and smiles
this really is a very nice if naive young man
and its this place
it makes no sense but it spooks me
smiling youre right
it makes no sense
as alice nods she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside
marcie is the source of the scream
she runs towards the camera dressed in cut offs and a floral halter
her feet are bare
when she get closer we see that she is being chased by jack and ned who have found two giant green bullfrogs
the screams were not serious and marcie is doing some of it for effect
brenda brings up the rear
they are all dressed more or less for a frolic in the lake
bill and alice stand in front of the arts crafts cabin
bill is smiling alice is a little bit amused
the frog people are after me
its swim time at camp crystal lake
come on alice i need protection
a long wide shot reveals the cool clear lake during the lull of a hot afternoon
at the edge of the lake in the shallows are the members of the group marcie jack ned brenda bill and alice
they are sitting or paddling or diving off the float
there is no real attempt to exert too much energy
gradually we become aware that this long wide shot is someones pov
the camera moves from its stable position now hand held on a trajectory around the side of the lake out of sight
branches brush and twigs are butted through
occasionally we can see part of the prowlers arm fending off the underbrush
the group sits or lies in the cool water more or less focused on ned who is acting as moderator
what do you want to be when you grow up
girls cant be cowboys
ned goes to jack
coach athletic director somewhere
now if you were a flavor of ice cream what would you be
the prowler looks in long shot down at the lake and we can just make out the counsellors
the camera pans and we move toward cabins
alice is treading water talking with brenda as ned comes up out of nowhere
vitamin cs supposed to neutralize the nitrites or something
ned surfaces between them
he looks with googly eyes at alice
there are sand sharks in this lake and they can eat the bathing suit right off you
im getting to you
ned does a porpoise drive and disappears
brenda is not laughing
she is looking off towards the cabin area
alice sees her and look where she looks
whatd you see
i dont know
marcies got me paranoid
the camera shooting from the prowlers pov moves to a place alongside alices cabin
there is underbrush about two feet tall and all around that area
the prowler stops leans down and reaches into frame with a gloved hand
the gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a burlap bag which has been secreted there
the hand lifts the bag which has something in it that moves
the camera moves around to the side of the cabin right below the window
the window is open making entry quite simple
the prowlers gloved hands untie the neck of the bag reach in and haul out quickly a medium sized snake
one hand has the animal firmly behind the jaws
the hand takes the snake and puts it through the open window leaving it on the clean white coverlet
it slithers across the bed
the prowlers hand closes the window
the camera moves towards one of the sheds
bill and alice are lying on the shore on their towels watching the others in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun
alice is on her stomach tracing angular designs in the sand
bill is on his back listening
it still hurts
i walked into it knowing id get hurt but i thought i could stand anything
pause i just wasnt ready for that kind of pain
we were supposed to meet in l
when i got back there he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife
bill turns over so he can look at her better
whatll you do when you leave here
i dont know
various feet enter the frame
bill and alice look up to see jack with his arm around marcie ned toweling his head and brenda putting on her blue workshirt
pistachio fudge ripple creme de menthe and i are going back to work
bill gets up
speaking as black raspberry i guess im ready
alice smiles at the reference
ill be along
in a nelly voice dont burn that gorgeous body or ill scratch your eyes out
they head off
alice turns over to tan her front
a machete rips through some vines
again it hacks at the brush
pulls back to reveal bill clearing away the years of vine growth which have choked off a path
he wipes the perspiration from his eyes and continues along
set up behind the cabin is a make shift exercise area
there are chinning bars pipeslashed between two trees and theres an aging set of parallel bars
there is even a set of weights made from tin cans pipes and assorted amount of cement
ecu of nedss face in a distorted twisted expression
he explodes his breath
we pull back to see brenda watching ned work out on the uneven parallel bars
he is really very good and there is no doubt about his strength
as ned moves off the apparatus brenda comes in and does a neat little turn which is dazzling
ned does a take
we wouldnt want you thinking youre the only show off in camp would we
the sun has dropped lower on the horizon
the camera looks down on alice as she sleeps peacefully in the late sun
a shadow passes across her face and she awakes with a start
cut back to see bill standing over her with a machete
i didnt know i was asleep
what time is it
alice gets up
now im only eleven hours behind schedule
steve is going to have a small cow
they walk away from the shore
alice is walking quicker than bill
we realize we have seen this cabin before when the snake was placed in it
you can only do what you can do
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes like you dont care about children
bill laughs at her imitation
continuing ill see you later
she turns to go up the steps to her front door
she stops and look down at him
he is serious and he cares
alice appreciates whats shes just heard
she knows that it wasnt easy for bill to say
youre very nice
they share a short silent moment
hope you will
bill smiles and turns and jogs off still carrying his long blade
alice watches him go
this might be a good place to stay
she turns and goes into her cabin
in the fg is the camp bed with its white coverlet
the snake is nowhere in sight which means it could be anywhere
alice is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her
the room is small
there is the metal frame cot an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top
the walls are a light blue freshly painted
the wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor whats going on in the campers section of the cabin on
the other side
alice looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees
she pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier
she smiles at herself
she reaches out in cu
open a drawer
takes out a towel
alice turns and goes to her footlocker
bends down and opens it up
takes out a terrycloth robe
she closes the footlocker stands up and heads out the door
alice heads from her cabin to the showers
alice walks into her room wearing her bathrobe her hair in a towel turban
she flicks off her shower clogs and looks for her hairbrush
she takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down
opens her top drawer
opens the next drawer
opens the next drawer
alice opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes
it flails at her right wrist a wrist which we have established earlier as having a navajo bracelet on it
the snake strikes the bracelet hangs on as alice tries to shake it free
the snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack
there is no way that alice can get past the snake to run away
her scream is loud
bill returning from his last half hour of trail blazing hears help
bill doesnt hesitate
carrying his machete he runs to alices cabin
marcie and jack follow in the bg
alice is backed against the wall
the snake could strike and get her
bill runs into the room still carrying his machete
he looks at alice
a tight whisper theres a fucking snake in here
bill sees it
he freezes then takes a step forward
carefully he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete cutting the snake into two pieces
blood spurts onto the floor
marcie and jack enter
jack carries a shovel as a weapon
marcie stops when she sees the embrace but then looks further to see the blood and guts
steve never mentioned serpents
jack would you get some paper towels
jack nods and exits
did he get in there
probably liked the scent of your perfume
jack return and tosses a roll to marcie
you okay now
bill gives her an extra hug
then steps back awkwardly stepping on marcies big toe
i walk on em all the time
to jack would you shovel mr
snake outta here
he picks up his shovel and we see in cu as he gets underneath the wide fanged snake
marcie begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper toweling
looking across the lake we can see the camp nestled in among the late afternoon rays of the sun
we can hear the sounds of the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt
the kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the same room cut off by a partition
the kitchen has a couple of sinks a heavy old stove long shelves a pantry larder and some windows which look out on the rear
brenda is making a salad for herself
she is a vegetarian
marcie is making a guacamole dip
in the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table
jack and bill are playing
she all right
get ready for the schneider
scared the hell out no chance
brenda four zip
howd it get in the drawer
alice walks into the kitchen
she has washed her face after getting her act together
she stands in the doorway to the kitchen
how you doin
can i help
its catch as catch can
im making a salad
the guys are planning to cook greaseburgers for themselves
theres a lot of dishes if you just want something to do
the way i feel thats perfect
alice goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the dirty dish pan
ned comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and pieces of old indian costumery
he does a bad dance
jack and bill quit their game and come to the doorway
what the hell
whered you get that stuff
its gonna be a long summer
when i was finding these goodies in the shed
i also found this letter which a camper never sent home
he takes a letter out of his breechclout
he pretends to read when really we can see that the paper is blank
improvising dear mom and dad camp blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellors body
alice leans against the sink and laughs
she is a very pretty girl younger than she first appeared
continuing and mommy we really love our counsellor
he says that whenever im scared i can sleep in his bunk with him
jack and bill laugh
ned takes off his headdress
continuing no wonder they lost america
how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that
whats to eat
whatever you make yourself
alice looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side
does she sees something
the camera pans slowly to look over her shoulder
the window pane is dirty and its a bit difficult to see but there is something standing there out by a cabin
but it stands doesnt move
is it a building
cut away to see alice using her dishcloth to clear the glass
when we cut back the shape is gone
reaction shot alice
a cold chill
alice looks around at the others who are still adlibbing about food
how can you eat that stuff
you like them rare
looks like dead animals
ned too bad that annie never cannibals
its old showed
she was supposed counsellor
to be a good cook
you can get all the protein no way i am gonna play chef you need if you mix them to all of you guys
womens lib from here on out
the squaws are revolting
alice looks up
pulls the light cord in the middle of the room
the bulb does not light
alice pulls it again
bad bulb or no power
its getting a little gloomy in here
steve taught me how to use the emergency generator
the town power lines are supposed to be real shitty
god but i love that macho talk
the indian used campfires
jack turns to bill
give me a hand
jack steps in and in cu we see there is a puddle where he is standing
the puddle is somehow significant
bill leans over jacks shoulder to see what hes doing
this is almost like the one at my uncles cabin in maine
here we go
the camera watches jacks actions tightly
in a reverse pov we see jacks tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates
he bites down on it
another angle as jack pulls the starter cord
the engine roars into action
yelling now ya close the switch
cu as jacks hand reaches in and touches a heavy duty metal switch
a spark arcs and we pull back to see jack with a perfect connection running through his body
there is a sparking sound the little light in the shed blinks jack screams the generator chugs roughly
hundreds of volts are streaking through jacks body and grounded through his wet shoes
bill reacts quickly knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection he takes a half step backwards aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect bruce lee
type drop kick on his friend severing the contact
jack stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead
the machine stops
jack lands almost unconscious
bill kneels into frame and cheeks jacks vital sign his eyes his carotid pulse his breathing
jack shakes his head
ill be okay
dont get up
take a second
jack lies back down
covers his eyes with his arm
you saved my life
i had to
i figured if i didnt save you
id have to give you mouth to mouth and that would have ruined my appetite
jacks looks up and smiles
bill give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet
satisfied that jack wont fall down bill goes to the shed and looks in
we can look in over bills shoulder and see a smoke scarred switch and a now silent generator
this puddle was enough to ground you all the way to china
jack looks in too
floor probably leaks
this area is full of springs
a short somewhere
bill leans down and sees a smokey colored wire that touches another wire
continuing theres the problem jack
wire worked itself loose
he starts to wind it round a set screw in cu
just in cause this bugger goes bad
im gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack
jacks walks away
the door opens at us letting in the limited light
jack comes in and goes to pick up a fluorescent lamp
he flicks it on
as he bends down to pick up two coleman lanterns the camera slowly moves toward the wall where once we saw all the hatchets and knives
they are all missing
jack takes his booty and exits
the light is gone and we are alone in the dark
ecu of the lightbulb over the kitchen area
it flickers on as we hear in the bg the sound of the generator start up
the bulb glows goes down glows cheerily
what hath god wrought
that was the telephone
you wily oriental
the phone was mr
watson come in here i need you
what hath god wrought was the telegraph
jack comes in with his lanterns followed by bill
last line of gone with the wind
frankly scarlet i dont give a damn
alice listens as she washes the dishes
it looks as if things will be okay
shows how much you know
its something about tomorrow
tomorrow is another day
marcie is finishing up making her green california dip
suddenly alice cries out
everybody whips around to see
alice holds up a piece of broken glass the bottom half of a bottle
she has cut her finger
it is not a serious cut but the blood is visible
this just plain aint my day
bill reaches into a cupboard and pulls out a bandaid
those things can be nasty
wash it out real good
bill comes up to alice
doesnt look too bad
that said the others go back to what they were doing
bill and alice are featured even though we can hear the others
bill takes great care and puts the bandaid on alices finger
they share this moment with soft smiles as the trivia contest continues
who played the role of gorgon in star trek
i dont want you getting melvin belli
that my i was careless
howd it get in there
somebody probably dropped something too hard
alice youre just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here
neddy is hovering over a bowl of california dip which marcie has just made
he dips a chip as soon as she steps back
soooooeeeeey piggy piggy
suddenly neds face goes red
his eyes bulge out
he grabs his throat and gags
coughs cant clear it
what is it
is it stuck
ned points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he writhes about
oh my god
roll him over
get behind him more
as bill and jack flip him over to try to give him the heimlich ned stops his act and grins from ear to ear
its a big finish ta da
reaction shots as it sinks in that ned has been putting them on
not funny ned
bill stands up angry but willing to keep his mouth shut
waitll youre really in trouble and see what happens
but its in the brochure
camp crystal lake has a full drama program
you just saw it
ned tries to laugh it off
they shake their heads
marcie walks away
jack looks at bill
chance to get even
ill spot you five points
hey look im sorry
ill never do it again
ned turns and heads for the door
alice comes up next to him
the others are out of earshot now
bill and jack play a little ping pong
ned is a little embarrassed by his play acting stunt
continuing im sorry
were gonna be working together for a while
youre a nice guy without all the entertainment okay
he knows what she means
he turns to look at the others
tell em im sorry
im gonna go lie down and catch some zs
today wiped me out
pause thanks alice
the camera stays on alices face as ned exits
in the bg marcie speaks
i hope thats the last time we see the camp crystal lake drama program
we watch ned come away from the main cabin and walk moodily toward his cabin
the camera stays with the troubled child as he stops leans down picks up a pebble and skips it off into the brush
it cuts through
he flips a few stones in his hand
ned looks off
we see what he sees a shape a human shape standing by a cabin
ned walks towards it
can i help you
alice is just drying her hands
she stands next to a giant stack of clean dishes and pots
brenda is reading a magazine while picking at some cauliflower and cucumber slices
bill and jack saunter in
you just had some lucky shots
he went to bed early
i dont blame him
hes probably setting up another one of his practical jokes
yeah like draining the lake
to marcie hey how about a walk by the lake
the others all go ooooooooh
continuing just a walk for chrissakes
kidding boy we sure do have a lot of filthy small minded people around here
to jack wait a minute ill get my diaphragm and be right with you
marcie puts an arm through jacks arm and they exit
the others laugh
jack and marcie walk across the pint needles towards the lake
there is the low rumble of thunder preceeded by a faint glow on the horizon
jack and marcie walk along the shore to the lake
they have turned on the flashlights which they carry with them
its shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees
makes me want to hold on and never let go
i love you
i love you
marcie pulls back
continuing what about neddy
i dont love neddy
he keeps on acting like such an asshole
dont call him
i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures
ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do you know
the moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light
looks like a storm
im a little scared of storms
always have been
since i was a kid
jack shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie shadows
she flashes hers at him
ive dreamed this dream
maybe half a dozen times
there is a thunderstorm
the rain comes down like pebbles
i can hear the sound
i try to close my ears off
it doesnt work
the sounds gets louder
the rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers
and the sound stops
a loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart
marcie is startled and reaches out for her lover
its just a dream
i call it my shower dream
they look at one another in the two lights
rain drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them
this is no dream
want to escape for a while
lead the way
jack turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin
marcie is only a half step behind laughing
from a distant angle we watch them run
there is no theme just the rumble of thunder
the door bursts open a flashlight pierces the shadows and jack and marcie rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the nearest bed
are you wet
just a little
wait a minute woman
he reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points straight up and gives them some light to see by
they go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by marcies hand coming up from behind jack and tugging his t shirt up towards his head
he leans back and takes it off and tosses it at the camera
the rain has gathered in intensity
alice comes up to the front door and looks out
bill comes up behind her
jack and marcie are gonna be drenched
not if theyre where i think they are
im not always this stupid
she turned back into the cabin
tight on jack and marcie as they make love under a camp blanket
their breathing and noises are heard just above the sounds of the rain outside
the camera becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have leaked from the ceiling hit the vertical member of the bed and dribbled down
as the bed shakes with its love making the camera pans up the bunks strut to trace the droplets course
as the camera pans upward it pulls back slightly and we see ned lying in the upper bunk
in a flash of lightning we realize he is dead his throat has been slashed
another angle jack and marcie lie completely still beneath their blanket
the camera pans along their quiet bodies
marcies face is contented
jack is ready to doze off
its never been likes waves before
youre lying on my bladder
she rolls over and grabs her underpants and t shirt
while still on the bottom bunk she puts herself into her limited clothing
jack gives her room
dressing i know this aint very romantic but what can i say
i dont want to explode
she grabs a flashlight scoots to the door and is gone
jack lies back and puts his hands under his hand
marcie runs across the now wet central area towards the bathroom facility
she tries to skip between the raindrops but she knows shell get a drenching
jack rolls to his side picks up a small hand rolled cigarette and lights it
he inhales deeply rolls on his back
something overhead catches his eye
across the way from the row of toilet stalls is a row of shower stalls and further down is a row of several sinks and mirrors
we hear the toilet flush
we cut inside the toilet booth as marcie stands reading the graffiti to herself
we can only see her from the chest up
reading forty yards to the outhouse by willie makit
the yellow stream by i
not the most original stuff kids
there is a noise outside the stall
she hears no response and assumes that her imagination is playing tricks with her
marcie picks up the flashlight and exits the stall
marcie crosses to the row of sinks stops puts the flashlight down and turns on the water faucet
there is no water
prowlers pov of marcie
from the end of the row of showers we watch marcie bend under the sink and turn on one of the spigots
water rushes into the sink
mcu marcie she rinses her hands shakes them dry and turns off the water
again she hears a noise
she looks to the row of showers and smiles
the screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut
marcie looks over smiles
she thinks someone is trying to scare her
dont put me on
there is a dripping sound
marcie stops at the first shower hesitates
throws back the first curtain
there is no one there
she reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off
she goes to the second shower looks over her shoulder to the empty toilet
then reaches in to the shower curtain
continuing allee allee infree
she throws back the curtain
again no one is there
she breathes a sigh of disappointment
continuing must be my imagination
in cu she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the track explodes with a musical stinger
it happens in a flash
a shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first shower
a hatchet glints
the hatchet strikes
the flashlight clatters to the floor
the sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an establishing shot of the diner
through the window which are being pelted with rain we can see a waitress and some customers seated on stools at the counter
the waitress is different from the morning woman slightly older but still attractive
she says good night to her customer who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the counter
seated there is steve christy finishing his cup of coffee
the waitress sandy picks up his empty pie plate and tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes
anything else you want
you cant go back there tonight
not in that stuff
less you wanta get drownded
drinking quickly i got to
sandy likes steve and enjoys flirting with him
i have six new counsellor up there
theyre all babes in the woods in every sense of the word
theyll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain
how much do i owe you
one night on the town
i know what you mean
two and a quarter
plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone
steve pays up and walks to the cash register
continuing you got a roof for that jeep
she rings up the money
gives him his change
he hands her a tip
i got it on before this indicates the storm outside all started
thats thirty percent
for two lonely nights
she smiles and is really kind of pretty underneath all that extra makeup
drive careful and dont drownd your dumb self
steve smiles and leaves
she watches then counts her changes and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day
the rain continues as steve exits the diner gets in his jeep and starts it up
he roars off through a big puddle splashing water towards the camera
the jeep pulls a small equipment trailer
the jeep plows through the rain leaving the town lights behind
a sign off to the side reads crystal lake mi
prowlers pov from outside the cabin we can see some activity in the big meeting room
the camera moves slightly from left to right as the shot is established
then an unseen hand releases a branch which partially blocks the shot
alice enters from the kitchen carrying two cups of coffee
she hands one to brenda who is curled up on the couch in front of the fire
bill stands to the left of the hearth picks up a couple of pieces of dry woods and puts them on to burn
you think they fell asleep
my parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone
it wouldnt matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon
it wouldnt look so great if he fell over them
well it hasnt been that long
long enough for me
i think we should go wake them up
just in case
give them a little while longer
its still early anyway
the rain is very heavy
steves jeep drives past the camera
the tires squish in the muddy roadway
lighted by dash panel steve tries to concentrate on seeing the road
he leans forward rubs a cloth on the windshield to get rid of the condensation
from his pov we watch the windshield wipers struggle to stay ahead of the rain
beyond them the headlights make a slight dent in the night
in the bg we hear a country station on the radio but it is bringing in more static than music owing to the electrical storm
steves hand reaches in and shuts off the radio
alice has finished her coffee
bill enters shakes the rain off his poncho and stamps his feet
got to it just in time
the generator was running on fumes
i filled it up
that should keep it humming until steve gets back
brenda gets up
good night alice
good night brenda
brenda takes her lantern and throwing the slicker over her head like a portable tent she races off into the night
alice watches her go
a glimmer of lightning outlines her as she heads off
bill walks back into the big room followed by alice
help you clean up
she walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups into the kitchen
the door opens and brenda comes in with her lantern and slicker
her actions are direct and business like
brenda goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror holding up a propane coleman lantern like an examination lamp
she takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles
she flips on both faucets and nothing comes out
she put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves
she stands up and washes her hands and face
she turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that marcie had heard
brenda looks off at the shower stalls shrugs picks up her lantern and makes her exit
steves jeep coughs sputters stalls
over we can hear him trying to re start his dead engine
r r r r
steve angrily steps on the gas again and hits the starter
r r r r rrr
he looks up to see headlights coming at him in his rear view mirror
steve wearing a yellow slicker gets out of the jeep to try to flag down the oncoming car
steve smiles to see that the oncoming car is the local police car driven by a middle aged cop named tierney
tierney has the window down already
i told you not to buy that hunk of junk
i think water got into the electrical system
you ride me back to camp
ill get one of my counsellors to drive me back tomorrow morning
steve is around the car and hopping in almost before tierney can answer
continuing to serve and protect dont mean to chauffeur
he puts the car in gear and roars into the night
under a single hanging lightbulb brenda finishes writing at a small table
the weather howls outside
theres a tapping sound
brenda looks up
listens yawns then gets up and starts to take off her clothes
through her window we can see brenda changing into her soft yellow pajamas
the tapping returns
that could drive a person bug city
the sound is apparently coming from the front of the cabin perhaps she can fix it without getting too wet
brenda grabs her slicker and heads out
the camera follows brenda through the darkened cabin to the front door
there is a small roof overhang like a porch affording some protection from the wind and wet
another angle closer as brenda hears the tapping sound closer by
she looks and sees
we see what she sees somebody has ties a kitchen knife to a string and left it dangling from the eaves
the wind blows making the knife tap against the building
cut the screwing around neddy
she grabs the knife breaking the string
continuing this isnt even half funny
angry brenda turns and goes back inside the cabin
brenda comes in shaking off her slicker carrying the knife
christ what a jerk
the single bulb goes out
brenda crosses to the table puts down her knife and strikes a match
she fires up the propane lantern
continuing looks like i turn in early
she moves the lamp and gets ready to climb into her bed
she reaches down and takes the coverlet and tugs it clear revealing something that has been left there
reaction shot fear spreads across her face
reverse pov we see what she sees a camp hatchet lies across her pillow
the shiny blade is marked with blood
brenda turns and runs from her room
brenda runs through the rain her flimsy pajamas drenched
her bare feet slip in the mud
she heads for a small rise that leads to the softball field
wide shot of brenda running across the softball diamond
close up a hand reaches in and slams on a circuit breaker
close up two large spot lights on a telephone pole light up
the softball field is now lit
brenda is confused
she looks off behind the backstop
then to center field
confused she runs out of the light into the darkness and underbrush behind third base
the camera slowly zooms in on the darkness where brenda exited
we hold on that spot for several seconds
finally the silence is broken by a terrified scream
alice is at one of the windows
i dont here it anymore
cant hear anything through that wind and rain
it sounded like brenda
ill go take a look
did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field
we are looking over at her shoulder
the distant glimmer suddenly goes dark
bill joins her and looks
theyre off now
bill heads for the door
ill go check on brenda
bill is halfway out the door
continuing ill go with you
if itll make you feel better
the rain continues as they drive along
bad enough we got a full moon its friday the th
they keep statistics
we get more accidents more robberies more rapes more homicides more of everything when theres a full moon
it affects people
makes em nuts
youve made a science out of coincidence
the police radio which has been on squelch comes on
filtered need a clear frequency
tierney car niner
tierney takes the mike
this is tierney
filtered rescue squad with jaws of life
near mile marker
three maybe more
at least one trapped
tierney theres a bad accident
one fatality known several possibles near mile marker on the interstate
bus tractor trailer
estimate arrival time fifteen minutes
tierney has jammed on his brakes and swung the car around
ill tell em youll be there in fifteen minutes
tierney bangs the mike down on the holder
he stops the car
have to drop you here steve
steve gets out quickly
continuing good luck
steve turns as the cops car door slams
tierney peels out on the wet road
cu as steve watches the lights grow dim in the distance
another angle as steve turns and jogs the other way
low thunder rolls in the distance
bill and alice have made their way to brendas cabin
from the outside they can see the coleman lantern burning on the table within
there is no response
the camera stays in a mcu of alice as she and bill cross up the stairs and into the cabin
the shot continues on alice as she looks about the empty cabin
finally she stops looking down
the camera continues to hold on her face
bill crosses over to alice
they are both looking down past the camera lens
another angle we see what they see the bloody hatchet left on brendas pillow
angle on bill and alice as before
their faces are serious
continuing what the fuck is going on here
the rain slants down as bill and alice make their way towards jacks cabin
they go to the door
bill opens the door to the cabin
the door opens at us
we see the silhouetted figures of bill and alice
bill flips on the light switch
the cabin is empty
jacks backpack lies on the bed the contents neatly laid out
it is dark inside
the door slams open at us as bill and alice make their way inside
bill walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers
continuing i think we should call the police bill
bill who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls nods and turns back to alice
there is a beat
and then a slickered shape passes between us and the night sky light which comes through the windows
the shape is dragging something
alice and bill are on the porch of one of the cabins
to the left of the door is a small sign that reads office
bill tries the door but cannot open it
whos got the key
alice ignores the question bends down beside the cabin and comes up with a short x
she crosses to the door and smashes through one of the window panes
she puts her arm through the broken glass unlocks the door and enters
the camera continues to watch them from outside the cabin
they turn on a light and cross to a phone on steve christys desk
bill picks up the receiver listens clicks the switch on the desk set several times
continuing its dead
try the pay phone
do you have a dime
there must be some in the desk somewhere
they fumble through the desk to find some change
bill finds some in the postage drawer
he then crosses over to a pay phone mounted on the wall
the camera moves to the cornice of the building where the phone line exits
it follows the link up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and phone lines come in from the pole
here we see a dangling phone cable which has been recently cut
over we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead telephone
this damn things dead too
bill and alice comes out into the rain heading for the camper van
they hop in
bill slides behind the wheel
the keys are in the ignition
alice hops in on the passenger side
bill turns over the engine
it grinds away but does not catch
from an angle behind the outside mirror we hear the engine fail to catch
we look in the mirror and see someone standing in the distance watching
bill gets out of the drivers side
slams the door
the camera trucks with him as he opens the door to the engine
alice joins him as he shines his light on the engine
whats the matter with it
i dont know
he tries a few more times
why dont we run
just run now
its over twenty miles to the crossroads
stevell be back in an hour
things will straighten out then
well take his jeep and get help
he goes to her and cradles her face in his hands
continuing dont worry
there is probably some really stupid explanation for all this
when the sun comes up tomorrow youll smile
in the fg we see a camp sign
in the bg we see a figure running towards us
the figure reaches our vantage point and is revealed as steve christy
just as hes about to make the turn into the driveway he looks up and smiles
he stops and catches his breath as the other person catches him in the light of a flashlight
what are you doing out in this mess
he shields his eyes from the light
from across the lake the lights from the camp twinkle through the rain drops
the camera as prowler moves to the shed
the noise of the generator grows louder as the door is opened
bill sits on the chair a rifle across his lap
in the bg alice sits on the couch dozing
on the coffee table in front of her is a large machete
bills eyes are closing
he jerks himself awake then starts to doze again
the bulb overhead grows yellow orange and then goes out
bill snaps awake
he grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks it on
he goes to the ping pong table where he has placed some lanterns
he fires up a coleman and places it on the pong table
bill checks on alice makes sure shes asleep then exits carrying his rifle and a battery operated fluorescent lamp
hold on alices peaceful face as she slumbers
the rain has lessened a bit
bill approaches the shed with his fluorescent lamp and rifle
he has the rifle at the ready
cu on his hand on the door handle
he pulls it open
the generator stands there quietly
bill comes into view spraying the interior with lamplight
in the fg a broken sparkplug which bill does not see immediately
it has been smashed by the blow of a hammer
bill goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top
he looks in there is enough gas
he puts the cap back on
then his eye catches something
he looks at the broken plug
he shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it
he puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed
alice sits up into the camera startled and afraid
she gets her bearings and looks around
she looks at the bulb overhead
pulls its string
she sees the lanterns which have been placed around
continuing the generator
now that she has figured out where bill must be she relaxes a little
she goes to the mantelpiece takes the lantern and walks into the kitchen
alice puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea kettle with water
she puts it on the stove and pops on a burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee
impatient and curious she walks to the front door of the cabin and looks out
the calm which she had grasped a few moments before is beginning to desert her
insert whistling tea kettle on the kitchen stove
alice takes the kettle off the flame
the whistling stops abruptly
alice pours water into the two cups
she stirs the coffee
unable to contain her impatience any longer alice picks up her lantern grabs a slicker and heads out the door
alice walks very quickly around the side of the cabin headed for the generator shed
the door to the shed is closed
alice looks around and then puts a hand on the hand
in cu we see the hand pull
the door doesnt budge
reaction shot alice decides to pull harder
she puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs
she pulls until she finally wrenches the door open
the lamp casts long shadows upwards
the generator sits silent
alice leans into the shed to look
the camera tracks very slowly around behind her so that we can see behind the right hand corner of the building
as we clear the edge we see something hanging from a rope which runs down from a branch above
the something turns slowly in the wind
it is bill dead in a travesty of the martyrdom of st
sebastian shot with arrows
alice comes out of the shed distraught
she closes the door and turns in the direction of the body
reaction shot alice
she is riveted with horror unable to move or turn or run
the soundtrack screams with the theme the insistent stinger a shriek and a thunderclap
alice finally gives voice to her terror again and again
she turns leaving the lantern and runs back towards the main cabin
alice bursts through the front door into camera
alice races to the coffee table looking for bills machete
it is not there
she gets down on her hands and knees to look for it
low angle as she scrabbles on all fours
nothing under the couch
alice gets back up and rushes to the ping pong table to get the lamp
just as she reaches the table which is more or less against a window a figure swings pendulum like into the glass shattering the pane in the window opposite alice
it is brenda long since dead dripping wet white faced
alice sees her turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door
alice flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain suited figure
the figure holds alice in a strong grasp
when alice focuses she sees a kindly woman in her early forties
she is strong fairly tall and very nice looking
this is mrs
she wants alice to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is
alice sobs incoherently pointing back to the rear window
there now my dear
i cant help you if you cant talk to me
there there now
alice allows the woman to lead her back into the room
voorhees leads alice to the couch
in the bg we can see the broken window but brenda is not visible
please save me
oh my god oh my god
it will be all right
ill take care of you
voorhees comforts her with a strong arm
its just this place
thats why youre all upset
no no theyre all dead
alice points over her shoulder towards the ping pong table without looking
voorhees looks shrugs
ill go look
alices face registers the new terror
theyll kill you
dont leave me
voorhees smiles warmly
im not afraid
alice waits by the couch as mrs
voorhees crosses the room to the back window
alice stands close to the fireplace
voorhees reaches the window and looks out
brendas body sways just out of reach
voorhees is shocked
oh my lord
voorhees turns back and as she passes the ping pong table she picks up the lantern
alice waits at the fireplace
continuing so young so pretty
what monster could have done such a thing
bill bill bill is out there
she lets mrs
voorhees take her in her arms
we shall go straight to the police
alice backs up
the killer is still out there
i will protect you
voorhees looks around the room
continuing oh this place
it should never have been a camp
not for children
they had so much trouble here
the fire glimmers slightly in the fireplace
a log burns through and rolls off throwing up a small shower of sparks
continuing camp blood
voorhees has almost completely calmed the girl down
strokes her soft hair
continuing you know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed
it was inadequate supervision
the counsellors were not paying enough attention
they were making love when that boy drowned
alice looks up as the woman strokes her hair
another angle mcu as the older womans hand strokes the younger womans hair
the hand is missing its little finger
the theme enters upon the track in a lyrical child like version echoing back to another era pretty and light
continuing we should go now
maybe we should wait for mr
voorhees shakes her head gently
that wont be necessary
as she speaks mrs
voorhees reaches into her slicker in a surreptitious manner and very slowly slips out a long hunting knife
i dont understand
mixed on the track filtered echoed and distant is the sound of a ten year old boy jason crying for help in a fantasy version of what might have happened
when he drowned in
filtered help me mommy
help me mommy
cocking her hand to listen i am jason
a little confused why shouldnt we wait for mr
voorhees has gone through some subtle changes
while her voice remains warm and comforting her face has started to slip into her other manifestation
all of this is in concert with the visibility of her weapon
it was my son they killed
they said he drowned but i know it was inadequate supervision
alice starts to become increasingly anxious
she cant see the knife rise behind her
christy will be back soon
voorhees shakes her head from side to side
no he wont
i killed him as well
the shock of recognition hits alice
in cu her eyes look up and see the knife which mrs
voorhees now has poised and ready to strike
alice bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the fireplace scattering ashes and sparks
voorhees stands and steps forward
continuing i couldnt let them start this camp again could i
alice in panic looks for an escape
she grabs the fireplace poker
i wont let you
alice swings the poker back and forth
voorhees raises her arm to slash downward with the knife
alice swings the poker hard to mrs
voorhees other arm and rib cage
voorhees is in pain her face a mask of rage
alice drops the poker to run for the door
voorhees hesitates for a moment then follows alice deliberately
lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder
alice gets to the door and stops
she fiddles with the side of the screen
somebody has latched it
closer on alice taking one look over her shoulder kicks at the door snapping the latch
another angle as alice runs out into the rain the mud the thunder and the lightning
the theme is going full tilt as alice makes a quick turn to run towards the road
two shot as alice bumps into an object which swings from above
a slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of steve christy hanging from the tree
a rope is looped under his arms his head is down on his chest and a long blade protrudes from his heart
reaction shot alice in terror
another angle alice runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree
strobe shot of jack dead
another angle alice runs for the arts crafts
in the bg we see can the yellow slickered mrs
voorhees closing the distance between herself and alice
alice runs for the door slams through it
the camera waits for mrs
voorhees but she does not appear
voorhees runs to the door and opens it quickly
alice is hiding in the shadows behind a table
we hear the sounds of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on
alice looks across the room to the light switch afraid to reveal her hiding place
she looks for an escape
theres a window
she starts for it then stops and turns and dives under an arts crafts table
another angle mrs
voorhees opens the door and walks in a few feet
she carries a machete in her hand
we see this instrument in cu as we hear over the sound of her son jason calling to her
help mommy im drowning
oh mommy please
the camera pans up to her face and we see that the voice of jason is coming from within her in lip sync
she is both characters though the childs voice is authentically dubbed
alice can just make out what is happening and can hear the alice is very still
her eyes widen as she listens to mrs
jason lipsync dont let me die mommy
i cant breathe
help me breathe
voorhees is having trouble catching her own breath
she strokes her throat with her free hand and the voice of the child stops
in her own voice i cant let them kill any more children
come out now
she wades through table after table pushing them out of her way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the when mrs
voorhees is too quick for her shoving a table across her path like a barred door
before alice can think twice mrs
voorhees has shoved a second table in behind her so that now alice is sandwiched between them
she can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end the end where mrs
voorhees is standing
alice looks behind her and sees a shelf
on the shelf is a box
voorhees is coming down the aisle between the two tables
her machete is coming up in an attack
alice reaches into the box in cu and pulls out a handful of leather working tools
she hurls them at mrs
voorhees as hard as she can
voorhees has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning knives
one cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low animal bellow
alice leaps up climbs over the table and runs for the door
voorhees shoves the tables over and hurries after her
alice gets to the door shuts off the light switch and runs out
we can hear jasons voice
kill her mommy
the central area is bathed in light
the rain has stopped
voorhees has turned on all the flood lights
alice runs to the corner of one of the cabins
she stops to look back
voorhees is gaining on her
alice runs to the equipment shed
another angle the door is thrown back
alice goes in
looks for a weapon
nothing is available
alice sobs with fear
voorhees passes the equipment shed
a single bulb outside the building shows alice as she bursts through the door
it is a small cabin
on the walls are five
alice runs into the dimly lit cabin and takes one of the rifles from the wall
she rummages in a drawer
she tries another
where are the goddamned bullets
the next drawer has a lock and hasp on it
alice looks around
voorhees is on her way charging through the night
angle on alice she whacks the hasp with the butt of the rifle
the hasp doesnt give
she gives it another butt stroke
it wont give
a shadow covers alices back
another angle mrs
voorhees is standing in the doorway blocking the light
still carrying the machete mrs
voorhees steps slowly toward alice
alice with an almost useless
in her hands does the only thing she can
she takes the weapon by the barrel and swinging it like a baseball bat whacks mrs
voorhees on the arm shoulder knocking the killer off balance and into the wall
voorhees slams through a flimsy table crushing it and drops to the floor
alice runs out the door
alice huffs past the dead camper van through the mud to the front door of the main cabin
she runs in quickly
there is no sign of mrs
she turns off the lights and runs into the kitchen
alice looks from side to side hoping to find a place to hide
she spots the half open door to the larder looks inside and then hides there closing the door behind her
there is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices
alices hands fasten onto the inside lock the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side
alice relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside
as soon as she relaxes we hear the front screen door slam
then we hear some shuffling around outside
the lights are turned on
please kill her mommy
help me please
kill her mommy
there is the sound of pots being rustled through
then the sound of another door being slammed
alice relaxes again
then there is a silence
alice thinks about unlocking the door now
she reaches out for the lock
then thinks better of the idea
she cases down the door frame to the floor
on all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements
there is a large skillet some bags of flour etc
alice covers her head with her arms
the doorknob above her head a few inches away turns very slowly
we see it but she does not
voorhees hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently
there is almost no give but we see that the door is being tested
the voice on the other side is very young very sing song
come out come out wherever you are
alice jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room
fists bang in a rage on the floor
alice folds her hands at the side of her face
the fist banging gives way to a short silence
the silence is interrupted by a new sound mrs
voorhees has begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the door to the larder
reaction shot alice
oh my god
at first we see nothing on our side
then gradually we see little slivers of lights admitted by the blades chops
alices eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon a defense anything
larger holes are now made
voorhees stops just long enough to take a peck inside
we can see her eye at the largest hole
she goes back to whacking away at the door
the hole is near the lock
it is soon big enough for mrs
voorhees to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet
alice realizes she must defend herself
she reaches down and picks up a heavy skillet and as the door opens alice raises her weapon and screaming charges the woman who is trying to come through the
voorhees chops down with the machete
alice fends off the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her head
as the machete blade bounces off the skillet alice is able to swing the skillet downward and hit mrs
voorhees with a solid blow on top of her head
voorhees sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the floor
alice raises the skillet again to strike
she crosses carefully to mrs
voorhees and pushes her gently with her foot the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway
another angle mrs
voorhees lies totally inert
there is a small puddle of blood under her head
angle on alice she relaxes puts down her weapon and crosses slowly out of the room
the moon comes out from behind a cloud
alice pushes a canoe into the water and paddles as rapidly as her tired body will permit out in the lake to safety
exhausted alice puts her paddle across her lap and falls forward slumped across a thwart
the first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the horizon promising a hot and sunny summers day
the birds are up foraging for food
as the camera scans the peaceful scene we see the sky reflected in the calm waters of crystal lake
the canoe holding alice is drifting in big slow circles across the surface of the lake
alice lies in mcu in the canoe sleeping
she has not changed her position since collapsing a few hours before
the water laps gently against the side of the canoe
very slowly she wakes
she opens her eyes
the canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree boughs that overhang the edge of the lake
they shade alice from the bright rays of the sun
the canoe rocks gently
alice is still listening to the sound of the lapping water
suddenly there is a blood curdling scream a musical stinger and the screen is filled with the flying whirling form of mrs
voorhees who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe barely missing alices slumped form
the canoe immediately overturns and both mrs
voorhees and alice try to find their footing in the shallow water
voorhees is covered in mud and blood
she sees alice struggling to get up and move toward her brandishing her blood spattered machete
alice turns sees mrs
alice grabs a paddle floating near her
voorhees pushes the canoe to one side wading through the waist high water as fast as she can
she screams with rage
her face goes through a horrifying transformation
from her mouth comes the voice of jason
jason lipsync mommy
alice cant move fast enough to get away from mrs
voorhees who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit alice
alice slips falls in the water gets her footing back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle using it like a staff to
ward off the blow
the machete cuts the paddle nearly in half
voorhees raises the knife for another blow and alice lunges for her knees and succeeds in throwing mrs
voorhees into the water
the machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water
the two women roll in the water
voorhees is trying to strangle alice her hands stretching to reach around her throat
they roll over and under the water
we cannot see who is winning
voorhees finds her footing and stands up looking for alice
she is screeching madly
jason lipsync continuing kill her mommy
kill her mommy
alice shoots up out of the water holding the machete and in one wild swing decapitates mrs
voorhees whose head flies off into the water
the body stands for a minute then falls heavily into the lake
alice drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to shore
alice walks slowly down the road away from the camp
we hear the sound of a car approaching
now it comes into view
it is a state vehicle black and white with an emblem on the door that says state department of health and safety
there are two middle aged bureaucrats inside
alice waves down the car which pulls up beside her
st inspector good morning miss
nd inspector leaning across the front seat are you all right maam
the camera pans back while the two men get out of their vehicle and come around to help alice
long shot of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of crystal lake
the canoe lies half sunken in the shallows
one paddle drifts in the current
the lake has swallowed its secret
