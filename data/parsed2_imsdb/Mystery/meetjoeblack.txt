screenplay by bo goldman a patch of water
pull back to reveal more water
back farther to reveal an expanse of river up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great classic hudson river manor house the country estate of william parrish
move through french doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room down wide corridors lined with bierstadt and cole paintings the hudson river school mists and
trees and small boats and distant humans
move through the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish ed with exquisite simplicity revelatory of its sleeping occupant william parrish a warm but commanding face a man of maturity
yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm
although asleep there is an uncommon restlessness to him
parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain
now the severity of the pain wakes him he squeezes his arm
the wind comes up through the wind a voice is heard distantly or is it the wind itself yes
parrish blinks has he heard something has he not he is not sure he releases his arm his grimace of pain fades the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided
he rises now crosses to the bathroom
as he pees a breeze outside the window the wind again but then the voice comes up yes
it is unmistakably a voice it is not the wind parrish has heard something he looks around but no one is there
he cant finish peeing turns back to his bedroom
all beweild ered parrish looks around once more climbs back into bed trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasnt heard he is not sure
he pulls the covers up now not a sound tries to close his eyes
parrish sits up again frightened but still there is no one there he seems fraught with indecision should he get up should he not what is happening
he looks out absolute stillness and silence crickets chirp down by the river a light flickers from a shadboat parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open he glances
up at the ceiling and finally exhausted falls back asleep
the great lawn infested with workmen planting stakes un rolling a huge canvas tent gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own crews setting up platforms speakers lights
ubiquitous is allison parrishs older daughter foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment
a painter approaches
the big tent miss allison paint is rust and moss green
medieval colors daddys like an old knight
a florist stops her
the head table
what about it
the flowers maam
freesia freesia everywhere
daddy loves freesia and you over there lights
not too bright
im looking for a saffron glow sort of tea dance twenties
parrish groomed for the day trots down the stairs observ ing the activity outside through the windows
he checks his watch strides down the hall encounters may a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as parrish passes
what do you think of all this may
its going to be beautiful
and miss allison says the president may come
oh the presidents got better things to do than come to my birthday party
parrish grins continues on is intercepted by allison who on catching sight of him bounces in from the terrace
hi allison have you got a minute
not much more
big day in the big city
whats on your mind
update were con structing the number on the barge archers from the state college at new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it when it catches fire it will give
us the effect of a viking funeral with none of the morbidity
the hudson river authority says for you theyll make a special dispensation of course therell be an overtime bill for the poughkeepsie fire dept
allison i trust you

but its your birthday
parrish smiles complaisantly they continue on into a break fast room where susan parrishs younger daughter is grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee
good morning dad

smiling drew called from the astar theyre still two minutes away
he wanted to ride back down with you
now sit and relax get some thing in that flat tummy of yours but parrish only pours coffee
susan contd to allison you coming

id better drive down
parrish gazes at the going on outside which are increasing in intensity
unconsciously i hate parties calm down daddy youll see youre going to love it
isnt it enough to be on this earth sixty five years without having to be reminded of it
allison goes susan observes parrish fidgeting
will you relax
i know it is a big deal day how did you know
drew told me
does drew tell you everything
i hope so

i guess so
i dont like to interfere
the helicopter chops in overhead
susan contd here comes our boy now shall we
a butler and may carry the overnight bags for the family as led by parrish they hurry towards the helicopter
en route they pass quince allisons husband who is perched at a portable bar with ambrose the head caterer tasting wines
this shits not bad
the late harvest riesling mr
quince a possibility for dessert
pointing to another bottle and that
were considering it for the appetizer
ambrose takes a sip swishes the wine in his mouth spits it in a bucket
what do you do that for
well sir its in the morning
where i come from the suns over the yardarm mboy and the cocktail lamp is lit
quince drains his wine presents it for a refill when he is hailed by allison
quince downs this glass too runs for the helicopter as drew a young man going places emerges from it approaches parrish and susan
to susan hello beautiful
drew kisses her over her shoulder he glances at parrish
good morning drew

well its a big day
wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff

weve still got some loose ends not my birthday again
youre only six five once
now could we go
lets get this day started
drew ushers everybody on first parrish then susan and quince drew the last to climb on shuts the door behind him as allison hurries away from the whirling rotors
the configuration of seats has drew beside parrish in front of them quince and susan opposite each other in single seats
just as drew removes color coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for parrish on his tray table the pilot waves to drew indicating phone call
drew gets up and heads for the cockpit parrish scans the folders glances over at susan who is making some notes on a file of her own
he motions to her to please come sit beside him she checks that drew is still busy in the cockpit tucks her papers into her carryall and crosses over to
parrish who folds away the work that drew set before him into his tray table locks it
i thought you were in a meeting
he peers up ahead at drew on the telephone and gesticulat ing intensely right at home in the cockpit despite the chop of the blades and the pilot pressed up
parrish contd do you love drew
theres a start for a meeting
i know its none of my business susan doesnt answer for a moment then impulsively kisses her father on the cheek
no its none of your business
do you love drew
you mean like you loved mom
forget about me and mom are you going to marry him
smiles dont get carried away
uh oh susan youre a hell of a woman
youve got a great career youre beautiful and im your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me
well i wasnt going to say that what were you going to say
listen im crazy about the guy hes smart hes aggressive he could carry parrish communications into the st century and me along with it
so whats wrong with that
thats for me
im talking about you
its not so much what you say about drew its what you dont say
youre not listening oh yes i am
not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice
dont get dirty dad well it worries me
i want you to get swept away
i want you to levitate
i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish
be deliriously happy
or at least leave yourself open to be
be deliriously happy
im going to do my upmost he smiles
i know its a cornball thing but love is passion obsession someone you cant live without
if you dont start with that what are you going to end up with
i say fall head over heels
find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back
and how do you find him
forget your head and listen to your heart
im not hearing any heart
a moment run the risk if you get hurt youll come back
because the truth is there is no sense living your life without this
to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you havent lived a life at all
you have to try
because if you havent tried you havent lived
aw youre tough
but give it to me again
the short version
lightning could strike
parrish contd forgive the lecture i wont
and when i tell drew about it he wont either
you wont tell him and even if you did hed clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the
commencement speech at wharton
but im the only father youve got
she kisses him on the cheek
he doesnt care
but thanks anyway
the astar lands an attendant waiting with a luggage cart rushes to open the door and unload the bags
the passengers parrish paired with quince drew with susan file off the rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator
parrish susan drew and quince face forward as they ride downwards
hey this is it the hour approach es im getting all excited
so what do you think is it indicates drew and parrish just the executive committee or could you guys use me
quince mman thanks for the offer but its all set for just me and bill
more people might i know
gum up the works
parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to quince when the voice suddenly intrudes
i know its none of my business
i was saying to quince we wont need did you just hear something
why yes bill i was saying to quince no no not you
daddy whats the matter
a respectful silence the elevator continues downwards suddenly the voice intrudes again
i want you to levitate
i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish
parrish grunts bizarrely susan notices and reacts what is it daddy
parrishs eyes dart about confirming no one has heard a thing but him
parrish contd just talking to myself again
you know me the elevator door opens
well here we are parrish leads the group out
they exit the building
to parrish are you okay
got my gloves on my ears pricked
im ready for action
well go get em pops
yer damn right
parrish followed by drew steps into a waiting limousine quince looks longingly after them
susan blowing a kiss goodbye to her father steps out into the street to hustle a cab
tomorrow we sign off photo opportunity you and big john itll lead network news
okay so far
its going to be great do you think i need a haircut
bill after this deal youll be able to afford one
parrish smiles they step into the elevator
parrish and drew emerge from the elevator parrish observing the overkill decor
their pr guy asked me what did i think parrish communications stood for thats principle and ethics wise
i came up with something but then it occurred to me why dont i ask bill
what do you think
a moment parrish shrugs
our first annual report must be thirty five years ago now i owned two stations i wrote down a state ment of purpose that one day you would wake up
to a parrish radio station read a parrish paper at breakfast catch our news on tele vision during the day and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain have a good time
wait til i show it to bontecou
drew opens a door a conference room a circle of top exec utives now stepping out from the group is a huge white haired man john bontecou
bill thanks for coming over
to drew and howre you doing today drew
to parrish youve got a firecracker here the kids really set the table
glad to hear it
weve met before yknow that white house function the president had you on his right and you know where i was
im sorry i dont recall left field somewhere
well bill i want to come in from the outfield bat cleanup like you have learn the plush ropes i thought you were buying my company
parrish i could never buy parrish communications
i could pay for it of course but it would always have your imprint
parrish looks around at the circle of suits bontecou holding away
well thats very nice to hear
drew nods excitedly
the busy medical community at th street and new york avenue
a thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospitals entrance customers cheek by jowl as a pair of waiters juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors residents and interns
susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner
a counterman with a smile and a greeting places a cup of coffee in front of her
a sense this is a daily ritual arming herself for the day immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her speaking into the pay phone
an attractive young man early s a pair of suitcase at his feet a raincoat slung over his shoulder
honey youve got to go on
theres a time to sow and a time to reap you sow now and forget about him
yeah i liked him i dont like him anymore
because youre my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me im on a plane in a minute
as soon as i get my phone in youre my first call thats a promise
where you going now
good hit the books get that degree one day well hang out a shingle together
you bet honey
the young man hangs up turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat potatoes and toast the counterman refills his cup and the young man
ties into the breakfast eating it with such relish that susan cant take her eyes off him
he senses her eyes glances over his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food swallows embarrassedly
good morning i was talking kind of loud there sorry
not at all
it was fascinating
what was fascinating about it
you and honey
my kid sister
she just broke up with her boyfriend and shes thinking about dropping out of law school
im sorry nothing to be sorry about
thats the way with men and women isnt it
whats the way
i agree why
i was just being agreeable now ive got to explain why
im not trying to sharpshoot you but that nothing lasts stuff thats what was the trouble with honeys guy
he was fooling around and honey caught him at it
one girlfriend wasnt enough for him
so youre a one girl guy
looking for her right now
you might be her
young man contd well dont laugh
i just arrived in town got a new job im trying to get into this apartment

howd you know
everybodys a doctor around here
this apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers
the guy im waiting for to vacate is a doctor
what kind of doctor
the young man smiles
so if i needed a doctor you could be it
i could be her
yes i could
a moment i have an office in the hospital
this is my lucky day
i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor a beautiful woman as well
susan looks into her coffee
young man contd im sorry you mind my saying that
not at all
how bout another cup of coffee
ive got patients coming in and i want to get into my apartment and go to work
please what do you say another cup of coffee
two pots are warming behind the counter he reaches over and refills her cup and his
pushes a container and pitcher to wards her
young man contd i see you use lots of sugar and cream
they smile at each other fix up their coffee
a magnificent granite building a monument to good taste in the midtown sea of glass and aluminum
parrish and drew enter no particular fanfare but an aware ness the chief has arrived everyone giving parrish the appropriate wide berth drew right beside him
im all excited me too
i thought it was great i thought you and big john would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop faltering instead it was like a marriage made
you have a way with words
they stride to the main bank of elevators
parrish drew beside him proceeds through a high tech but tasteful maze spiffy executive secretaries at burnished desks
neither looking right or left somehow parrish man ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods despite his swift entrance
he passes through an open set of doors and he is into his own suite commanded by jennifer his assistant
good morning mr
drew is still at parrishs heels but now parrish stops at the open door turns back to him reminding drew that this is as far as he goes without being
board convenes tomorrow youll recommend we close and its a deal right
as close as a deal could be
parrish disappears into his office
drew on his way out glides past jennifers desk
drew contd this is our lucky day
jennifer acknowledges drew with a smile rises and moves to parrishs doorway waiting for the days instructions but parrish only nods to the door and jennifer quickly closes it returns
to her desk
alone in his office parrishs ebullient mood immediately changes
leaning against the back of the couch he stares out through floor to ceiling windows surveying the manhattan skyline cogitates
he takes a seat on the couch opens a folder suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder
it is sharp but brief he notices it but what it does not continue he ignores it
parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again
he reaches for his shoulder tries to massage the pain it does not subside
parrish stands trying to shake it off but it refuses to go away some thing is unmistakably wrong
now a sound which he has come to recognize makes itself heard yes
frozen with surprise parrishs eyes search the room for the source of the sound it comes from no particular direction yet surrounds him
suddenly parrishs symptoms sharply intensify he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk holds on with one hand with the other clutches at his
shoulder and arm the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body
he breaks out in a sweat his pallor now waxen as the voice repeats itself voice v
parrish grips the edge of the desk the pain assaulting him on the one hand the voice coming at him from the outer each aberration feeds on the other he
is beside himself consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not
parrish is possessed
he angles his face in every direction arbi trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly unconsciously enrage responds to the voice
yes is the answer to your question
i didnt ask any question
i believe you did
parrish is absolutely confounded seized up with pain and consternation at this unseen voice which has such presence and reality
who are you
parrish contd goddammit what is going on
i think you know i dont
because if you havent tried you havent lived
what are you talking about
what you were talking about
what is this
who is this fucking guy
he holds on tight to the corner of the desk sweat dripping his skin ashen
now he addresses the voice again searching for it in another direction parrish contd tell me who you are
are you giving me orders
im sorry i no youre not
youre trying to handle the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle
a spasm the worst one yet finally it subsides and there is an eerie silence in the room a void almost more disturbing than the voice that has filled it
where are you
are you there
its enough now
talk to me theres going to be plenty of time for that
what do you mean
i think you know know what
a moment know what goddammit
the voice is gone
parrish searches the corner but the room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by the voice it is now just parrishs office
faint squeals of traffic from the street then a knock at the door
parrish touches his shoulder the pain is gone but he is still wet with sweat the knock again
parrish straightens himself up adjusts his tie runs his fingers through his hair blinks as he addresses the door
carefully come in
ive been buzzing you mr
are you all right
lunch is in today have you given it any thought interrupting no
parrish is within himself doesnt answer
jenifer contd why dont i think of something
parrish still doesnt answer however jennifer is satisfied correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative
she has her hand on the door open or closed
he nods and she closes it
utter silence again
parrishs eyes search the room nothing there
the place has cleared out now the counterman busy bussing tables laden with dishes and cups susan and the young man are still at the counter but about to leave
its kind of a pro bono job
that means doing good going to be doing good all your life
i know what youre saying
doesnt pay very well
depends on the woman i marry
maybe shed like a bigger house a better car lotsa kids college doesnt come cheap youd give up what you want for the woman you marry
susan rises now the young man with her leaving money for their checks they head for the door
young man contd if i married you id want to give you what you wanted i know its old fashioned and all that but whats wrong with taking care of
she takes care of you
youll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days you never know
lightning could strike
susan at the door now pauses abruptly her eyes on the young man
the young man holds the door for susan as they step out onto the street
susan is staring at him now he smiles all open and vulnerable
ive got to go did i say something wrong
no it was so right it scares me
ive been thinking
i dont want you to be my doctor
because i dont want you to examine me
because i like you so much
a moment you have coffee here every morning dont you
if i came by could you give me the name of a doctor
sure ill give you the name of a doctor
a moment and i dont want to examine you
because i like you so much
now ive got to go
she hurries away down the sidewalk the young man watching her
now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction
she looks back at the young man then turns and walks on
he looks back at susan as the distance between them widens now he turns and walks on
she looks around once more but the young man is still headed in the opposite direction his back to her
she turns the corner and continues on
approaching the corner he looks back for susan yet again but she is gone still turned he steps off into the street and a hospital supplies truck speeding down the
curb lane hits him broadside a horrific impact the thud echoes as his body arcs through the air
another sickening thud as it lands the young man lies crumpled still
a beautiful space adjacent to the dining room it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the manhattan sky line
the hour is before dinner gathered on one side of the room are allison and parrish on the other side drew and quince
coyle a butler and luisa the housekeeper pass hors doeuvres and drinks
music i know how you love music daddy and i want to have music that pleases you and of course doesnt put a thousand other people to sleep ive agonized
over this and finally settled on sidney brown twenty four men very eclectic plus im feathering in a latin sextet on their breaks tito puente trini lopez zy i forget their names parrish has tuned allison out he tried to stay with it but his mind has wandered the event of the day too much with him
allison contd you havent heard a word have you
i keep talking and all you do is nod like mr
himmelfass in the nutcracker
parrish still doesnt answer
allison contd you dont care do you
i lay awake nights in a cold sweat i want this party to be like some thing mom would have made for you i want it to be perfect attentive
now i know you do darling
and you could care less oh you couldnt be more wrong sweetheart
i can tell you how much i appreciate it and how im looking forward to it
what songs should sidney pancho and his six men we can forget about what songs do you think he should play
a stab of pain parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on allison
tell it to me again
suddenly the voice cuts in yes
parrishs head snaps startled by the sound
contd to parrish did you miss me
parrish reacts once more aware again he is the only one who has heard the voice as an oblivious allison continues to parrish never mind
leave it to me
parrish ignores her his attention has been taken by the voice
his eyelids flutter nonplused edgy and fearful
parrish dinner is served
to quince and drew across the room chow time you guys
parrish is confounded
blindly and disconcerted he follows allison and drew and quince
as a disturbed parrish approaches the table he hears the voice once more what are you looking so provoked about
did you miss me
its a normal question
i missed you
but what do i get back
not an ounce of excitement not a whisper of a thrill parrish sits
contd this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice
parrish is on the edge of his seat struggling to hide his panic
contd im waiting outside
the conversation swirls on around parrish he is deaf to it to drew did you speak to the governor
i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit it was better than seconal
im waiting outside
wont someone come to the door
parrish is in shock still striving to gain control of himself
as coyle serves him parrish turns to luisa is somebody waiting outside luisa
i didnt hear a ring sir
please have a look luisa goes as coyle continues serving
to quince what about the mayor
he said he would be there with bells on
good maybe theyll drown him out
parrish is still not hearing a word preoccupied with the return of luisa
please dont be negative drew we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud the secretary general of the un the chairman of the fcc nine senators
i dont know how many congressmen and at least twelve of the fortune
a twenty game winner or a masters champion
someone i could talk to
a moment or would talk to me
luisa returns to parrish as the others conversation drones on youre right mr
there was a gentleman at the door
hes waiting for you in the foyer
parrish is stunned
after a moment show him into the library tell him ill be right there
parrish spinning with anxiety tries to summon up his courage to go as allison continues ive arranged for favors silver charm bracelets for the women platinum keychains for the men
all engraved w
but now im thinking of scrubbing them they seem so ordinary
finally parrish rises from the table starts out
allison contd are they ordinary
do they seem that way to you daddy
uh i dont know
no uh i dont
allison is about to press the point but then drifts into disappointed silence as parrish leaves the room
to allison youre overthinking it i dont think theyre ordinary
i love keychains
parrish moves deliberately down the hall slows as he nears the doorway to the library
the door is open
he hesitates before he crosses the threshold taking in as much as his eye can see now tentatively he enters
a beautiful classic room areas of dim warm light club chairs books reaching to the ceiling a rolling library ladder a weathered dictionary on a stand a model boat carved
of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven foot high partition of obscured glass
parrish poised in the doorway looks around nothing in sight
parrish contd anyone here
parrish contd i said is anyone here
parrish is startled he shrinks backward for a moment his eyes searching the room for the voice the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before
there is the sense that someone is there but parrish cannot see him and he does not dare look
quietly where are you
now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass the section of the room most distant from parrish there is a shape
something is there
what is this a joke right
some kind of elaborate practical joke
at my th reunion we delivered a casket to the class presidents hotel room and quiet
parrish falls silent something in the sound and tone of the voice muting him
he takes a step backwards
voice contd where are you going
i i uh the shape moves makes itself more visible
although still diffused by the glass the shape has definition a person a man his features are not yet distinguishable but he is there all right
the great bill parrish at a loss for words
the man from whose lips fall rapture and passion and obses sion
all those admonitions about being deliberately happy what there is no sense living your life without
all the sparks and energy you give off the rosy advice you dispense in round pear shaped tones what the hell is this
who are you
just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity ive been around that long but its only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest
call it boredom the natural curiosity of me the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you
parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing
i want to have a look around before i take you
it requires competence wisdom experience all those things they say about you in testimonials and youre the one
the one to do what
show me around
be my guide
and in return you get
breathless get what
what the hell are you talking about
im sorry in return youll receive minuets days weeks im not going to go into details what matters is that i stay interested
parrish squints trying to make sense of what is happening
voice contd yes
yes is the answer to your ques tion
the question youve been asking yourself with increased regularity at odd moments panting through the extra game of handball when you ran for the plane in delhi when you sat
up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning
the question that is in the back of your throat choking the blood to your brain ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself the
question urging yes bill
after a moment
am i going to die
the figure who is the voice takes a step forward now no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light re vealing himself to be the young man
seen previously in the coffee shop but there is a change he seems odd off center not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful
a moment parrish beside himself
he cannot bring himself to speak finally am i dreaming this
another moment are you a dream
i am not a dream
youre coming to take me
what is that
who the hell are you
the young man steps closer to parrish his face is inches from a shaking sweating parrishs face the young man daring parrish to identify him you are
yes parrish turns away
but the young man spectacularly is in front of him again
young man contd gently who am i
parrish is shocked stunned terrified at the word by what he has comprehended
he surveys the young man who at this moment actually seems bewildered by his effect
parrish contd youre death
youre not death
youre just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants
the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took
let me ask your opinion
do i blend in
a hopelessly confused parrish does not respond for a moment
you want me to be your guide
you fill the bill bill
a moment how long will you be staying
you should hope quite a while
the young man nods gently
parrish contd its
a long silence
parrish and the young man take each other in the sense that now they understand each other
a sound at the door
parrish does not hear her for the moment luisa steps inside the library
luisa contd will the gentleman be staying for dinner sir
parrish ignores her at first finally he looks at luisa then at the young man then once more at both of them as if to verify the young mans presence
has been acknowledged by luisa
the young man interjects to luisa yes
a polite afterthought thank you
luisa nods perfunctorily and exits
parrish is frozen dumbfounded
young man contd to parrish where is dinner
parrish does not answer at first
this is crazy youre not going to eat dinner with us
bill i am eating dinner with you
and your family
and thats what were doing
its not open for discussion
dont you understand
parrish is frightened by the response
young man contd good
now lead the way
parrish hesitates then obediently leads the young man out of the library down a long hallway and across the foyer
could i say something
quietly it just occurred to me speak up please
louder when i introduce you if i say who you are i dont think anyone will stay for dinner
as parrish and the young man enter allison is heard in the background
well heres another possibility
its a little last minute but how does this strike you
little gold kaleidoscopes
some german firm went kerplunkt tiffanys picked these things up theyre perfect party favors however theyre not personal theyre winter scene or something snow flakes and dachshunds
parrish and the young man appear at the table an awkward pause ensues the unannounced guests presence at a family dinner being noted and the guest himself carefully survey ed
finally allison breaks the ice allison contd to the young man hi there hello
parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the young man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face of the first time
uh sorry to have stepped away for so long uh this is a friend of mine i asked to drop by we got to talking and stuff uh hes going
to join us for dinner um parrish drifts into another awkward pause
to the young man hello how nice to meet you
and wouldnt it be nicer if my father would introduce you
how nice to meet you
oh im sorry
this is my daughter allison and her husband quince drew my number one works with me
parrish drifts off as the young man awkwardly shakes hands with each person
does your friend have a name
pleasantly going along with the joke yeah something he goes by oh excuse me
this is uh this is daddy
come on a name
yeah bill the suspense is killing me
um you you know its gone right out of my head what
parrish contd im sorry
this is uh uh
the group waits patiently
parrish contd joe
parrish once more drifts into silence
the young man is now identified as joe
just plain joe
love that name
joe turned on by quinces broad smile reacts to it as drew squints observingly at joe
is there any more to it
alarmed what do you mean
like smith or jones parrishs face reveals a desperate searching for a last name a furtive glance at joe
parrishs brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips black
whew at last
nice to meet you mr
won fifteen and lost two for the brooklyn dodgers in
to joe you bet
im kind of my rotisserie league
lets sit down luisa has set a plate in front of joe and parrishs which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed has been returned
joe looks over at the other guests then picks up his uten sils gingerly strives to copy the others stops staring at his foot
to joe paillarde of veal
yeah they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then luisa hits it again in the kitchen
you know what im saying joe
no laughing emptily joe knows what youre saying just being polite drew is studying joe
to joe have we met
uh hes from out of town how long you here joe
as long as it takes
drew is provoked by the response but remains polite you and bill old friends
parrish jumps in no to joe i get the feeling youve done some business before
we have an arrangement now
what side of the industry did you say you were on
i didnt say
to parrish joe sounds like a ringer bill
i have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already
need any help with the details
parrish falls silent again looking for an answer
drew contd im sorry business at dinner
to joe forgive me for being so rude
the doors to the dining room open susan appears
sorry to be late had to have dinner with my depart ment chief you ate
im here arent i
wouldnt miss a loose end meeting
whats on the table for discussion
party favors flowers hi dad hi drew she kisses drew in some light humorous way they have ob viously done before their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their
lips meeting mid air
at the kisss conclusion susan suddenly notices joe is present and has been watching
she is shocked embarrassed pleased conflicted an instant and wide spectrum of emotions
susan contd what are you doing here
stunned you know each other
lightly weve met
the corinth coffee shop
he was looking for a doctor
well i guess hes found one
joe you do get around
joe is happily confounded by all the interaction
thats your name
and isnt it a lovely one
so sturdy so straight joe has heard susans question but as he studies her doesnt answer
incidentally joe wherere you staying
in this house
parrish pushes his plate away
uh will that hold you joe
incidentally joe what
hey this is fun
so what are you doing here
parrish tenses but joe doesnt answer
susan contd cat got your tongue
you werent so silent this morning
drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy
now im getting interested
i want to know more to joe weve got some things to discuss
parrish stands motions for joe to rise
to joe did i hear business
dont bother asking we already tried
its so very nice to see you again
funny i dont get that feeling
maybe its because you found out im bill parrishs daughter
cut it out susan
to joe you and ive got to talk
big day tomorrow everybody
joe lets go
joe rises follows parrish to the door stops to susan susan
to allison allison
to quince quince
to drew drew
to parrish bill
to the group thank you
he makes an awkward little bow then heads for the nearest door
joe thats the kitchen
joe pivots and he follows parrish out the proper door
that was joe
susans eyes are still on the door where joe exited her face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment as well as a tinge of excitement
parrish leads the way joe beside him as they progress through the huge house
im sorry im a little discon certed that stuff between you and susan uh threw me
shook me up
i mean that you knew her and everything i didnt know her
the body i took knew her
the man she met in the coffee shop this morning
i uh took him
so theres nothing between you and susan
i wish you had said something to me about staying here it hadnt occurred to me until then
i was just having such a wonderful time besides isnt this what im here for
parrish suddenly looks very anxious joe stops
joe contd you seem uncomfortable bill
no im okay with this uh i think
so he opens a door
to joe bathroom
towels sauna parrish turns back to the bedroom
parrish contd chair lamp bed parrish is in a stunned state chatters on unconsciously parrish contd box springs theyre assembled in jakarta
had to stay in a station managers house there unexpectedly best nights sleep i ever had
ordered twenty they filled a con tainer and shipped them right over ive put one in every bedroom here and in the country
joe tests the springs
what a good idea
would you like the mans name
parrish glances around a room in which the occupant could not want for anything
if there is anything else dont hesitate i wont
how long have i got
youre putting me on the spot bill
joe contd lets put it this way
when i go you go
when you go i go
thats the best i can do
a moment but minute by minute i find myself lingering
i just saw my doctor he told me everything was fine
icily did your doctor say anything about a tiny undetectable hole in your aorta
did he mention an irreparab ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain
were they any prognostications about the possibil ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in gstaad
no i hope you realize bill
in your office this morning that was your time
closer than that
parrish keeps still trying to cool the heat of joes temper
joe contd but meanwhile you are still here
count your blessings
call it gravy frosting on the cake whatever it is you say
well thank you for letting me know
not at all
and uh i guess goodnight
good night to you bill
parrish gently closes the door
joe looks around checks out his surroundings curious attentive
parrish unsteady starts back down the hall luisa appears
miss allison asked if you would like to have your dinner kept warm
very good sir
luisa turns luisa she stops
parrish contd mr
blacks luggage was misplaced by the airlines
would you mind get ting a few things together for him
a couple of suits some shirts ties underwear shoes
have coyle take his measurements off what he is wearing tonight
luisa nods and heads back downstairs
parrish enters his den takes a seat in his chair stares into the middle distance ruminates
joe has been examining his room full of curiosity and wonderment at the oddest things the handle on a casement window the hem and weight of the fabric of a
drape hinges on the bedroom door
in the process he opens this door steps out into the hallway
joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional dufy or miro a venetian tapestry cheek by jowl with a miniature ming vae and even a bonsai garden with a trickling
vein of water
in the back of the house now utilitarian paint and decor the sound of laughter and a glare of light
the staff is at ease some smoking remains of food around
coyle the butler has his back to joe and does not see him for a moment
in front of coyle an open jar of peanut but ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of wonder bread
joe is fascinated by the process
coyle suddenly hears the silence looks up and see joe standing up embarrassedly
im joe black
nice to meet you
yes sir mr
black a pleasure
the staff all mumble expansive good evening sir s to joe
he motions to them to sit they do but coyle does not
coyle shifts from foot to foot the staff is not used to having parrish family or guests in this part of the house
to coyle what are you eating
you mean this sir
coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly
coyle contd laura scudders peanut butter
carefully laura scudders peanut butter
a moment you like it
i would say sir it is right up there with jif and skippy
but miles ahead of peter pan
another moment like a taste
joe nods coyle fashions a spoonful offers it to joe
joe swallows it
but he has not yet found a comfortable way of masticating his mouth and tongue go every which way the staff observes him fascinated
coyle contd youre a peanut butter man now eh sir
yes i am
i thoroughly enjoyed this uh peanut butter
to the staff and i thoroughly enjoyed meeting you
joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff
joe contd ill be moseying on
he heads out with the spoonful of peanut butter to cheer ful goodnight mr
black s his tongue again licking the edges of the spoon
a spectacular indoor olympic pool window commanding views of the skyline
susan is swimming laps looking very professional in a black speedo suit joe wanders in still licking his peanut butter
he observes her but she is unaware of him however now as she makes a barrel turn his shadow falls over a reflection from a window she aborts her lap
looks up to see who it is
what are you doing here
cant seem to escape you today
susan climbs out of the pool gets halfway up the ladder points to a stack of towels
hand me one of those will you
joe turns to the towels but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter he shifts it to the other hand cant manage the huge turkish towel one
handed now implants the spoon in his mouth lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to susan
susan contd you must have something really big going on with my father big
you appear at his side out of the blue stay at his house eat dinner with his family its practically a first
youre in the red hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe
i am joe
not the one i met this morning hit ting on me in as nice a way as ive been hit on in a long time but the moment you find
out im my dads daughter you act like a stranger
that is not my intention
joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter
what are your intentions
to make little dreams in coffee shops turn a womans head and i dont mind admitting it was turned i liked it but ten hours later i feel like a
i dont get it
you my father here in this house the cof fee shop its making me upset and i dont like being upset
who are you anyway
and what are you eating
mumbles peanut butter
he finishes the spoonful
joe contd but its gone now
he shifts the spoon from hand to hand starts to stick it in his pocket realizes this is inappropriate
susan holds her hand out to him he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels
she watches fascinat ed as joe licks his gums enjoying every last bit of his spoonful
you act like you never had peanut butter before i havent
what kind of childhood did you have
do you love drew
when you put your mouth to his susan it seems a frequent thing
drew is none of your damn business
nor is where i put my mouth
do you live here
no joe im swimming here
then im going home
i guess what im trying to say is id like us to be friends
ive got plenty of friends
i dont have any
i can see why
she finishes drying herself drops the towel on a chair and prepares to leave
i didnt mean to offend you at dinner
im not quite at home some times with people
i get busy doing uh what i do and i dont seem to have developed he drifts off
i have a certain function to per form and that seems to take all of my time
bu sometimes uh i speculate uh i havent left room for uh anything else
im sorry to say i know what youre saying
did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder
she glances at her shoulder he grabs a towel touches the drops of water pats them dry hands her the towel
she flashes a nervous smile
goodnight to you susan
susan steps towards a door joe takes a step in the wrong direction they almost walk into each other
now she takes a step in another direction as does joe again they almost collide
shall we dance
joe is completely puzzled finally susan heads for one door joe for another
susan contd joe yes
i think you want to go to the west wing
susan indicates yet another door
after a moment thank you
joe redirects himself goes to the door
as they both are about to exit joe and susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool smile at catching each others glances
for a moment susans eyes remain on the door through which he has gone
now she grips the towel over her shoulders the one joe gave her pats the same spot he did
parrish dressed for the day passes servants busy with their morning tasks polishing doorknobs putting away linen dusting picture frames
he nods and greets them as he strides down the hall brisk good morning s to coyle and luisa
parrish knocks waits a courteous moment opens the door finds joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his tie
good morning bill
how are you
howre you feeling
i feel fine
how do you feel
um well i didnt sleep too well
this is crazy
this is the left field thing of all time
what do i do
what do i tell my family
oh i wouldnt tell them anything bill
youll ruin the good start we had last night
i felt as if i were being treated like a person
joe this and joe that a nice smile quince passed me the rolls no rapture or passion or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting but
i am cer tain should you uh say uh who i am our adventure would end abruptly
parrish regards joe the tie is a sorry mess now a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone
joe contd but i did so enjoy your family
parrish is startled he regards joe carefully
what about my family
this adven ture involved only me right
silence as joe considers the point parrish quickly crosses to him undoes the tie and now begins tying it for him
parrish contd tell you what you promised that its going to be only me and and what
and i wont tell anyone who you are
sounds fair enough
it is a deal
you give your word i give mine that well do what we say
its a truth exchanged between two people
youve got a deal
parrish seems relieved
he has now with some difficulty completed the tying of joes tie adjusts it beautifully on joes collar then spins him around in front of a mirror
joe catching sight of his own appearance rises to the balls of his feet quite taken
joe contd this is great
a moment now what do we do
joe immediately extends his hand toward parrish but parrish freezes on seeing the hand stares at it now takes it
joe pumps parrishs hand vigorously then breaks into a broad smile
parrish and joe striding downtown joes jacket fits per fectly he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart fifth avenue crowd on the way to
parrish senses joes pleasure his slight preening his eyes check ing out the good looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high rises
you know i got to thinking last night with you here and seem ingly occupied hows your work going uh elsewhere
a flicker from joe
he has heard what parrish has said his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the avenue but he is concentrating on parrishs words
when you were shaving this morning you werent just shaving right
what do you mean
you were hatching ideas making plans arriving at decisions right
i guess so
so you understand the concept then
when youre busy here your work what your task is is being executed elsewhere
so youve grasped the idea
now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about
parrish falls silent chewing over joes admonition
how about giving a guy a break
make an exception
theres one to every rule
they stride on cutting through the crowd joe all at home in his new surrounding but parrish just the opposite un characteristically uncomfortable phrases forming on his lips but unspoken
then suddenly he blurts out i dont deserve this
im still young this is not my time thats what everybody says
im not everybody
thats what everybody says
parrish is trying to control himself glances at joe
i want to live
joe contd but you cant
a sudden silence between them
parrishs shoulders appear to have stopped slightly the courage he displayed at rais ing these issues has vanished
whats it like
what do you mean
whats it like where im going
can you keep a secret
so can i
they turn into parrishs office building
as parrish and joe enter parrish is hailed by jaime the elevator starter
good morning mr
good morning jaime
knights reward in the th at calder a bemused parrish walks on joe beside him jaime pursuing them
jaime contd a closer in today with cheap speed
the colt will come from the clouds and boom
fifty eight dollar horse
i get you down mr
parrish just say the word
smiles im sorry not today jaime
parrish and joe arrive at the bank of elevators
jaime back at his post hits a button
parrish contd to joe you know everyday ive walked into this building jaime gives me a horse
a moment i wonder if any of them won
the elevator materializes parrish and joe step on
parrish and joe emerge from the executive elevator jennifer is waiting as usual with her pad good morning s etc
as parrish strides down the hall joe right beside him he passes instructions back to jennifer who scribbling hurries along behind them
and call my family id like them to come over for dinner tonight
didnt the family get together last night
remonstrating gently jennifer
of course mr
jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as parrish arrives at the door to the board room
to joe perhaps you would like to wait in my office
what im trying to say is this is a board meeting and you are not a mem ber of the board
im sure youll see to it that it wont be a problem
parrish hesitates nods conceding the point reaches for the doorknob
parrish enters joe following right behind him
a euphony of good morning s from the various members of the board including quince
everyone sits when parrish does but joe right at home spots a tray of refreshments coffee pas tries he heads for them
to the board this is joe black a personal associate of mine uh hell be joining us today
i know its uh unusual and my apologies and drew uh carry on
immediately indications of surprise on board members faces at parrish bringing in an observer drews reaction guarded but intense
after a moment to joe nice to see you
i didnt expect you but certainly you cant get enough of a good thing
to the board the board of parrish communications is hereby called to order
our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecous generous offer and to drew do you have any more of these deli cious cookies
a hushed silence at the inappropriateness of joes inter ruption
joe contd and a cup of tea
with milk i think
id like to try it english style
yes a cup of tea with milk
anything else mr
how about some water
why yes thank you
hot or cold
and a glass
drew indicates to the boards stenographer to arrange joes refreshments
quietly indicating a chair would you like to sit down joe
to review were really crossing the ts and dotting the is here
bill had a great and conclusive meeting with john bontecou yester day all that remains for us is to put it to a vote
smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the board at drews news
emptily thank you drew
parrish takes a moment draws himself up to say something official then stops himself what follows is spontaneous reflective deeply felt
parrish contd umm i did enjoy or rather i was interested in meeting john yes terday impressive
but it did get me to thinking
i started in this business because this is what i wanted to do
i knew i wasnt going to write the great american novel but i also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for
i wanted to give the news to the world and i wanted to give it unvarnished
the more we all know about each other the greater the chance we will survive
sure i want to make a profit you cant exist without one but john bontecou is all profit
if we give him license to absorb parrish communications and he has his eye on a few others after us well be appointing him to the position he craves gatekeeper
in order to reach the world you will have to go through john bontecou
and not only will you have to pay him to do this far more expensive youll have to agree with him
reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable
parrish communications has earned this priv ilege john bontecou wants to buy it
as your chairman i urge you to agree this company is not for sale
a silence everybody shifts the board is in shock drew is trying to maintain his balance
carefully sounds like youre not leaving much room for discussion
to the board sorry
i know it looks like im reversing my field
thats your privilege bill
but given our needs given the absolute necessity for growth given the fu ture the truth is
joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes
joe interjects death and taxes
after a moment
death and taxes
what an odd pairing
its just a saying mr
black of whom
it doesnt matter
then why did you bring it up
drew regards joe
youre not familiar with the phrase in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes
i am now
glad i could be of some help
the board is provoked and mystified by joe and even more by his presence they cast meaningful glances at parrish drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members
parrish breaks the silence
shall we adjourn
but the matters still on the table bill edward sloane a contemporary of parrishs has been warily silent but extremely observant
protective of parrish and sensing his burgeoning difficulty he interrupts why dont we let it rest for the moment
give it some air
well said eddie
black shall we
to drew those cookies were excellent
he exits with parrish the door closes behind them
a babble of disturbed reactions from the board
who is that guy
drew grabs a telephone drew contd felicia
get me a field background check on joe black
drew hangs up
parrish enters joe right on his heels
they booth stop parrish regards him
whats the deal here
are you going to be breathing down my neck right til the very end
i dont understand
parrish tries to gather himself
id like to be alone for a while
are you sad bill
yes i am
theres a research lib rary on the fourth floor
why dont you go down and read some magazines
youre not thinking of going some where are you bill
joe could i ask you to take a walk
buy a tie or something
i know ill be seeing you
but joe doesnt move
prompting now id like to be alone
parrish reaches into his pocket and hands joe some cash
here this will hold you for a while
joe stares at the money as parrish shows him the door
parrish contd you know about money dont you
it cant buy happiness
parrish opens the door
jennifer give mr
black a map of the city
no thank you bill
i can manage
susan is busy giving instructions to a nurse a patient on an examining table beside them
as she finishes she suddenly notices joe down the corridor in the reception area
she is startled for the moment quickly makes a last notation hands a chart to the nurse and heads down the corridor
joe how nice you look
is that your uniform
susan regards him
why did you come here
joe doesnt have an answer
susan contd are you ill
oh goodness no
then why are you here joe
i came to see you
i dont have any time to see you now
im doing grand rounds and then im examining back to back patients until dinner and then very well ill watch

im a doctor im and ill be a visitor
patients have visitors not doctors
i dont mind visible now behind them are a caribbean woman in her mid thirties teena an arm around her mother easter who is holding her stomach and rocking back
and forth in her seat in great pain
gently just a minute please
my mommas sickern he is
easter looks up and sees joe
she abruptly becomes still eyes wide as if sudden recognition
but easter just stares at joe fearful
i gonna die
momma stop it

joe looks at easter curiously
to teena whats obeah
she just all fever she don mean nothin

teena shakes her hand anxiously
joe leans forward to easter and speaks softly in perfect lilting west indian dialect
no obeah sister
no duppy no jumbie

susan and teena both look at him astonished
easters fearful gaze remains locked on him
joe contd go wi de doctor lady

easter is riveted on joe
with certainty obeah

adamant pleading can mistah

joe regards easter a long moment

joe shakes his head a firm no
but when he looks and speaks to easter again it is with concern and even regret
cant feel wi de way tings gotta be easter
susan and teena return with an orderly and a wheelchair for easter
to joe please
come now momma
easter is helped into the wheelchair
she looks pleadingly at joe
the orderly starts to wheel her away
joe stays him putting his hand on easters arm
close your eyes easter
she does her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile
joe contd soon
he takes his hand away and the orderly wheels easter off
to teena go with her
ill be right there
joe remains his normal voice
shes in a great deal of pain
susan regards joe puzzled
susan contd have you spent a lot of time in the islands
joe contd i uh i realize now uh my being here um your patient this is not really appropriate and i uh dont apologize
theres nothing to be sorry for every hospital should have someone like you
susan contd well
im glad you came
im so very glad to be here
another awkward silence
joe contd i guess youre busy yes
she doesnt move they search for words
well i could come again some other time
susan regards him
joe im with drew
sincerely not now
susan smiles gently
joe contd dont you want me to come again
i have to go im sorry to say be sorry for nothing
thank you joe
susan turns to go hesitates
good bye susan
susan waves softly to him heads down the hall glances back once to see joe has not moved is watching her depart
jennifer shows joe in parrish is deep in thought beside him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and silver but untouched
joe is more abstracted than usual he is starting at parrishs food
are you going to eat your lunch its all yours
joe starts eating parrish watches him somewhat fascinated joes chewing has improved
parrish contd good
what is it
cold lamb sandwich with cilantro
a little colemans mustard
joe takes another big bite
truly uh splendid
glad you like it
my wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches
joan that was my wife familiarly uh huh
cold lamb sandwiches not as chewy as roast beef not as boring as chicken
she knew stuff like that
silence parrish getting lost in his memories
parrish contd everything reminds me of her there isnt a day that goes by that i dont think about her one day she was here
the next day she was gone
what are you going to do
i guess youve heard all this a trillion times before
why didnt you stop me
i dont know
joe contd how was it the first time you met her
i thought youd heard a trillion times this part im interested in
she had on this little blue suit with a little white collar that had little red piping on it joe is riveted on parrish ow parrish aware of him has
parrish contd you could have put her under glass and i would have just stood and looked at her
but when she spoke i loved the sound of her voice and her laugh a moment i couldnt get enough of her and gradually or maybe it wasnt gradually i
realized i couldnt live without her
a knock the door opens and drew enters looks at parrish then at joe stands poised in the doorway
may i interrupting
to joe just kidding
sit down drew
before i do glances at joe i was hoping we might be alone bill
joe and i have no secrets from each other
to joe how nice for you both
drew takes a moment then plunges in
drew contd bill pardon my candor but i was confounded by your decision this morning
i was hired you told me to help bring parrish communications into the st century
this merger is the vehicle joe interrupts perhaps a merger is a way to bring bills company into the st cen tury
and perhaps it isnt
and perhaps cheating on your french philosophers exam at the groton school was an expedient way to get your diploma and perhaps it wasnt
be that as it may drew a question can often be argued both ways
drew is stunned
joe cut it out
and you too drew
to parrish i thought this was practically a done deal well now its undone okay
im tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer
im not going for it
drew heads for the door turns around
drew contd to parrish can i invite myself to dinner tonight
a moment susan and i had ticket for the knicks game
but she said you guys were getting together dinner
to joe damn decent of you
why at this juncture are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters
i dont want anybody buying up my lifes work and turning it into something it wasnt meant to be
a man wants to leave something behind
and he wants it left behind the way he made it
and he wants it to be run the way he run it with a sense of honor of dedication of truth
and i dont need your goddamn permis sion either
i dont need anyone to tell me how to run my life
youll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation
the skyline glitters through the terrace windows
the hour is before dinner coyle and luisa weave seamlessly among the family offering hors doeuvres and drinks on a tray
allison and susan together by a piano parrish quince and a distracted joe are gathered near the terrace
joes eyes are on susan across the room
her eyes flicker towards him aware of his gaze
to susan were never all together two nights in a row
maybe christmas thanksgiving thats it
whats going on
nothings going on
maybe he doesnt want to be alone
hes go ing to be sixty five in a minute i dont know daddy seems funny to me
ever since joe showed
its like he dropped from the clouds
he nuzzles susans neck out of the corner of her eye she sees joe still observing them
allison contd when daddy walked in with him he couldnt even remember his name
now hes his house guest
and you know how he hates house guests
what is going on
drew whose eyes have also been on joe across the room turns back
to susan and allison good question
allison sees susans eyes flicker over towards joe
but he does seem very nice
you think so
over at the terrace quince buttonholes parrish joe stand ing by
to parrish i read you all the way on the bontecou thing and i know where youre coming from
and im with you a hundred and one percent
thank you quince
but ive got to tell you if mergers are in the wild ive got some great prospects ive developed
i want to talk to you about them next week
or the week after
quince sees parrish hesitate
quince contd no good
no anything is possible
lightly its up to joe
joe you dont know how glad i am youre aboard
anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man im in his corner
thats very gracious of you quince
ill leave you two alone
i can tell you guys have something on the fire an excited quince drains his drink and heads for drew as allison appears
to parrish did you know twenty six members of your rifle company are coming
from the korean war
whatever it was theyll be here
we sent out invitations to everyone plane tickets included the rsvps are amazing
a few of them we didnt hear from and some of them are dead of course of course
a moment you know were going to give this party for you whether you like it or not
i like it
i like it
im sorry i dont seem more appreciative
resignedly thats okay daddy
across the room quince has pulled drew aside i know youre down but you know when youre down drew theres no place to go but up
never mind bontecou
ive got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve and im putting them to see old man
well do it together
ill clue you in
timings got to be right
the old man says its up to joe
its up to joe
those were his words
its up to joe huh
yeah thats what he said
well thats very interesting
drew gazes intently over at joe who is crossing to susan for the moment by herself near the piano
i thought so too
joes a neat guy
joe approaches susan
i wanted to apologize susan i thought you said be sorry for nothing
well now i am sorry
for intruding on you this afternoon
it wasnt an intrusion
and if it was it turned out to be welcome
i appreciate you excuse me
i mean i appreciate that
and i appreciate you too
a moment between them
delighted you do
well thank you very much
drew crosses over to parrish
i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon drew
i want you to know i value your advice
as much as joes
parrish doesnt answer
drew contd who is this man
hes giving ubiquitous a bad name
youre competitive soul drew
thats what makes you a great addi tion to the money
joe is just
for how long
dont worry about him
and above all dont antagonize him
drew glances over at joe
bosss orders huh

allison calls out from the other side of the room dinners ready everybody
a buzz as coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in drew lingering behind with joe
i have a confession to make to you joe
joe just smiles in response
drew contd do you want to hear it

but can i tell you something else itd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him

do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak

everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged glances averted allison notices susan and joe looking at each other drew observes parrish watching joe quince on the other hand just eats
breaking the silence parrish chinks his glass stands
i uh want to thank you all for coming uh my family everyone at the table is all attention
parrish contd allison and quince susan and the other members he glances at joe stops
parrish contd im so happy when we can get together i mean i know you all have busy lives look whos talking

quince chooses to fill the silence
i love little girls allison elbows him
and now youre all grown up and im uh um parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check drew clocking his behavior very carefully
parrish contd i had some words all prepared but now ive forgotten them uh um wait a minute
silence everyone waiting for parrish to proceed
parrish contd uh its gone
um it was on the tip of my tongue
itll come back daddy
parrish looking around searching for words he will not find
parrish contd anyway id like to go on but
he hesitates drifts into silence
tentatively daddy you could sit down if you wanted to
there is so much i would like to say but i cant another moment so i better sit down
carry on everybody
he sits then immediately stands up again
parrish contd one other thing why dont we all have dinner again tomorrow night
havent you had enough of us dad
with great sincerity no
the word lands with effect susan and allison have heard it well
well be here
with bells on
the guests try to return to their food susan is the most concerned about parrishs lapse she does not say anything but drew next to her senses her empathy and
in something of a display gives her a pro forma hug
joe has observed every instant of drews performance his anxiety is palpable when coyle leans over to serve him offering a tray of a roast that has been carved
to coyle i would prefer some peanut butter
how would you like that sir
on some kind of toast
just the butter
coyle heads for the kitchen
why do you love peanut butter so much
intimately i dont know
i adore things like that
food i cant do without
joe is locked on susan it is as if there is nobody else in the room
it comforts you doesnt it
ive found that it does
mind if i throw up
admonishing gently please drew
to susan im very concerned about the woman you attended to today
i am too
has her pain abated
were doing what we can for her
but it doesnt look good
im sorry to hear that
who are we talking about
to susan but i know shes grateful for the care youre giving her
is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it
to drew susans patient is whom we are talking about
joe visited the hospital today
parrishs head swivels to joe
thats more than we get to do
well maybe next time joe goes hell take us along
perhaps you could remind me
ill make a note of it
id like to come too
see susan strut her stuff
youre on quin cee
joe youll be the tour guide
hows that sound to you
parrish regards joe then susan his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship
susan is a wonderful doctor
after dinner the family and guests file back in from the dining room drew alongside parrish
i have to go bill its been a helluva day
need a few minutes to sort everything out
okay well see you tomorrow
drew peels off heads for the foyer and front door susan follows him
parrish corners joe
why did you go to the hospital
i dont know
you were just curious
i wouldnt put it that way
what way would you put it
you tell me bill
how about you telling me
when i ask a simple question i expect a straight answer
thats what im used to
anybody who doesnt give it to me i fire
are you going to fire me bill
silence parrish is at a loss
drew is putting on his coat susan with him a tension between them a heavy silence finally broken
see you tomorrow night
include me out
ive had enough of the conversations
you dont mean that
you wouldnt disappoint daddy daddyll do fine
besides hes got joe
a moment and so do you
drew youre out of line
that may be
but i dont like the fucker
i dont like the way he looks at you and talks to you
and vice versa
sorry but i like the way he looks and talks to me
and vice versa
no not okay
i thought we had a good thing going here
a moment it shows you never know
silence neither knows how to continue
drew goes susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer hes been observing them
she walks up to him
how long have you been standing there
i dont like the way drew spoken to you
but i feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back
tell me about yourself joe
who you are
what youre doing with my father
susans directness has caught him by surprise joe blinks
susan contd so youre not going to tell me
joe remains silent rendered extremely anxious by susans inquiries
susan contd youre married arent you
because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married
joe doesnt respond
susan contd so you are married
no im not
susan comes closer to joe
then tell me joe how come a man as attractive intelligent well spoken diffident in the most sed uctive way and yet powerful is all alone in this world
joe tries to respond but he cant his stammer interrupted by susan
susan contd im sorry i dont want to pry and you dont want to tell me
so lets leave it a mystery
thats the way you want it isnt it
susan takes another step closer to joe
thank you i appreciate that
they are inches apart now the smell of each other surrounds them a heaviness to the moment now joe turns to head up the stairs
where are you going
softly to bed
suddenly fragile to bed
he excuses himself with an ineffable gesture now climbs the stairs susan watches him disappear
she turns back into the salon just as allison and quince are exiting good byes all around
susan is left alone now with parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar
that was wonderful
yeah its good to get together
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag
what is the nature of your interest in joe
well remember how you told me about lightning striking
the nature of its in there somewhere
parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink takes his time before answering
i wont say you may be getting onto shaken ground then what will you say
i dont think this is the lightning you are looking for
drews a good man
i know i didnt seem to be completely in his corner before but ive come to appreciate now we love drew and joe in verbo ten
whats going on
when you say nothing that way its not nothing
then what is it
she kisses him
susan contd gnight daddy
see you tomorrow
this is getting interesting
a large suite room service carts creaking with pots of coffee and half eaten pastries
the board of parrish communications is gathered absent are parrish and quince
felicia drews secretary takes notes
i know youre all as uncomfor table as i am to be meeting without bill but i got a call last night from john bontecou
not only is he still interested he is sweetening his offer
a moment although it pains me to say it in my opinion bill parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with bontecou
therefore im sorry to say that if we are to exam ine this new offer responsibly as the board of directors of parrish communications we must do so with out
another moment oh yes there is one additional element bontecou is so anxious to get us he said hed take parrish communications with our chairman or without
the board falls silent
sloane a peer of parrishs fidgets
drew milks the moment
drew contd its no surprise if i suggest to you that the bill parrish we know is not the bill parrish you saw yesterday
you heard that speech some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee jerk rejection of a legitimate offer
does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this mans judgement
more specifically his judgement to make a critical business decision
silence the board clocking drews argument
drew contd its not pleasant to say the follow ing but i would be remiss in this crisis if i did not
when we pre sent bill with the improved bontecou offer and if he refuses to let us consider it once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection we will have
no choice but to seek an alternative
and what would that be
bills birthday is the day after tomorrow
there is a provisory by law in our charter
per the discre tion of the board corporate off icers can be retired at age sixty five
youre taking this too far drew
am i not obligated to
drew leans over to felicia speaks quietly and she leaves the room
drew contd how did this all come about
crisis bill parrish crisis his com pany crisis for us
i came about with the arrival on the scene of mr
he attends our board meet int he sleeps at bills house re sides in his office
never leaves his side
and in my opinion is always in his ear
telling him what to do and bill is listening
who is joe black
what is his relationship to bill parrish
and most important what is behind his influence on our chairman
youre building this thing up too much drew
hes had advisors be fore
nobody tells bill what to do
the door opens and felicia enters followed by quince sur prised at seeing a convened board but still he is all smiles
thank you for coming
hi ed hi folks i didnt know everybody was going to be here what a nice surprise
whats the big confab
acidly this is a secret meeting
to quince i hope youll respect its nature what were trying to do here is gather our thoughts in light of bills rejection of bontecous offer and make an appropriate
presenta tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed
wont you share with our board the information you gave me last night
quince hesitates then realizes what drew has on his mind
he nods confidently to drew then turns importantly to the board
well im happy to tell you ive got good news
as i was telling drew ive been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining two possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger
how did bill react to the leads youve developed
he was interested
prompting but he was concerned about the timing
the timing yes
he says its up to joe
its up to joe
thats what he said
quince having dispensed his information looks proudly around at the board members
they are stunned sloane in shock
drew is absolutely still letting quinces words sink in
parrish joe susan allison and quince are seated at the table dessert plates in front of them coffee cups beside
allison and susans eyes are on parrish looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again
parrish is somewhat within himself but he peeks over his demi tasse cup at joe parrish aware of joes heightened interest in susan and susans reciprocation
coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with cakes on them luisa follows with one other
they set them down in front of parrish
what is this
annie made them
from la rosette only the greatest pastry chef in america
pointing this is orange from real seville oranges
lemon on a mille feuille crust a little on the fanciful
and a while nothing like a good old white cake vanilla with angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in
i dont like cake
its for the party dad oh the goddam party goddam party
allison bursts into tears
allison contd to quince did you hear that
quince quickly slashes a piece takes a huge bite
this is great honey
has it got a little vodka in it
like that finnish stuff orange vodka to parrish put your lips around this one bill
its out of this world
no thank you quince
to allison im sorry honey
im no good at this
why dont you choose whatever cake you like
i knew you were going to say that
the old platoon
now the cake
you just dont care
why did i do this
i should have my head examined
im trying to throw the party for the century for my father and you know what he doesnt give a shit
she bursts into tears all over again
but he does give a shit
dont you bill
yeah i give a shit
whatd i tell you
joe watches as quince dabs at allisons tears with a napkin
quince contd feel better
yeah but but what
what will i tell annie
parrish forks a bit of a cake
whatd i tell you
quince puts a reassuring arm around allison she seems to relax now joe has been a keen observer of what has trans pired between husband and wife between man and
woman a sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation ship
after dinner parrish allison and susan are gathered to gether
at the bar on the other side of the room joe watches as quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy
to quince cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult western males
i didnt know that
on the other hand winston churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety one
after a moment
youre an original joe
a little hard to figure maybe
and youre a nice man quince
drew appears unannounced in the doorway exchanges a tense glance with susan then heads straight for parrish who seems surprised to see him
to parrish sorry to intrude bill but weve got a bit of a crisis downtown its not something we could talk about on the phone
parrish takes drew aside
drew contd the boards real unhappy pappy they felt you dealt with them pre emptorily you never gave them a chance to speak what is there to say
they know what john bontecou is and if they didnt they know now
yes you made your feeling abun dantly clear
now they want to do the same with theirs
what are their feelings
if i read this board right now they want you to accept bontecous offer
over my dead body
parrishs burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of joe susan quince and allison
what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that
i dont care
with all due respect you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again therell be blood on the floor
silence parrish carefully calibrating drews remark
im feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me
im just giving you the truth
there was a time when william parrish liked the truth
joe although across the room is all attention
i think its time you went home drew
drew goes everybody is in shock susan pursues him out into the hallway
susan contd never talk to my father like that again
dont worry about it
theres a beginning and a middle and an end to everything
and i think ive come to the end of my chapter with the parrishes
joe has followed them into the hallway
drew contd and the end began with this guy
drew looks down towards joe
drew contd mr
we ran a check on you and you know what we came up with
no i dont not good not bad you know what we got
no credit no cars no mortgages no wives
drew contd all of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora tions of the world the boss makes him
privy to all the companys secrets he attends the board meet ings and us working stiffs with mbas up the ass and years and years and years of experience were left outside with our noses pressed against the window
joe doesnt respond
drew contd this is a big time operation deal ing in big time issues demanding big time executives who make big time decisions
so joe why dont you tell me exactly what it is thats big time about you
after a moment
to drew why dont you get off his case
oh youre the great joes attorney now
are we going to go to court
or are we going to go to bed
and i dont mean you and me
i mean you and him
so i guess a blowjobs out of the question
joe clears his throat
drew contd did you say something
joe considers him evenly
to drew i said get out
now drew wheels heads right for the front door and exits with a slam
what an angry fellow
a moment passes before susan realizes she and joe are alone and joe does as well
im sorry about please
we dont need to talk about drew
she regards joe
they drift osmotically into the library in awkward silence
susan contd brave you had a chance to look at dads rare books
jeffersons parliamentary manual a first edition bleak house joe comes closer takes a deep breath
i love your smell
i guess you havent
now susan close to joe leans closer her nose in joes neck
joe holds himself very still
susan contd i like your smell too
it was everything
silence the ticking of the clock
susan contd when i was little my mother used to say darling you could set your heart by this clock
never tried til now
suddenly joe may i kiss you
susan reaches out for joe they kiss he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing
susan pulls him closer they linger now mouths on each others then separate
susan contd thank you
the clock ticks on
a sense of foreboding falls over joes face his fear that he is passing through some barrier a point of no return
the apprehensive expression on joes face fades away
i dont know who you are
im uh joe
and youre susan
and i uh have this weak feeling in my knees and is your heart beating strangely
and i want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me forever
an intake of breath
she is about to speak
joe contd and you dont even have to say a word
their faces inches from each others
i have to go home
but neither susan nor joe moves
susan contd dont i
her question makes joe almost involuntarily smile
susan takes the opportunity to step back from him
the sound of someone at the door it is parrish susan turns comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him
she drifts right past him exits
joe and parrish are left alone now eyes on each others
would you like to join me quince and allison for a nightcap
um not right now
an awkward moment
parrish turns and exits joes head inclines he breathes in the scent of his collar
parrish followed by joe emerges from his private elevator is greeted as usual good morning mr
good morning jennifer
the board is waiting
didnt you call a board meeting
jennifer sees parrish is trying to right his balance she knows better than to press the point
jenifer contd yes the members are waiting
they are in the board room now
jennifer nods respectfully as parrish doesnt cast a flicker of any further surprise heads straight for the board room joe right beside him
parrish and joe enter the entire board is assembled includ ing drew quince and sloane
an odd mixture of responses the board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting its sudden convening clearly a problem for parrish a
prob lem which he does not attempt to hide only control
did you want to have a cup of coffee or something bill
i dont think so
drew gets the message at the same time joe is checking out all the attendees his eyes come to rest on drew
to parrish to get to the point we have re ceived new information from john bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his and we wanted to
set the details before you
a moment as parrish looks around the moment extends it appears he may not ever answer
bontecou wants a quick response and the answer is no quick enough for you
dont you want to hear the details
im not interested in the details
and im not interested in the big picture either
what i am inter ersted in is how my board got conven ed behind my back is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do
business with moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish and i am expected to clap for it like a performing seal
no thank you
so i am to understand from your re sponse that you do not want to hear the details of bontecous offer
yes you are to understand that and now may i ask you a question
are you running this board or am i
sloane leans in
were not getting anywhere here
why dont we take some of the best out of this thing lets consider it coolly lets take a week bontecou wants a speedier response than that
hell wait doesnt need to
today tomorrow a week from now a week from now who can think about a week from now the answer is going to be the same a loud unmistakable all
inclusive airtight no
a buzz amongst the board they finally rustle into silence under parrishs withering glance
parrish contd thats it
ive got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind
shall we adjourn
before we do while were here there is a second question the board would like a response to a far simpler one
drew contd who is the man sitting to the right of you
everybodys eyes are on joe
ive already introduced mr
black to you all
but who is he
what are his creden tials
what is his relationship to you
no response from parrish
drew contd the feeling of the board is this we fear mr
black is not only influenc ing your decisions in regard to this company but that you are relying on him to make them for you
quince flinches at these words his hands clasped in front of him his knuckles white as parrish regards drew but still does not answer
drew contd the lack of response bill is not appropriate
we are your board we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company and most importantly that you have not delegated someone to do
it for you
parrish squirms desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak
drew contd okay one more time
drew regards joe
drew contd who is joe black
parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as quinces head sinks into his hands
drew contd to the board a motion has been brought before the board to invoke article of the corporate charter
in english please
mandatory retirement upon our chairmans sixty fifth birthday
parrish is expressionless
drew contd at which time the chairman will be named emeritus he will be welcome to attend all meetings and will serve as international spokesman for the corporation plus of
course a settlement a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground
drew contd please indicate your vote by a yes or no
a yes is heard now another yes now more yes es all reluctant no from sloane no from quince who realizes he is the instrument of parrishs dismissal
drew contd the motion is passed
we will of course delay the announcement out of respect for our former chairman until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend
thank you for allowing me to save face drew
joes eyes are riveted on drew
to the board the other motion before us is the acceptance of john bontecous offer to merge this corporation with bontecou international parrish stands drew stops speaking
silence then joe rises
to the board who i am and my relationship to bill will be divulged in our own good time
joe follows parrish out of the room
sloane has pursued parrish and joe
to parrish its not over til its over
please eddie no fat lady sings shit
i still sense some doubt in this group we could turn it around
youll be up in the country
yes the big celebration of my mandatory retirement birthday
youre an honored guest eddie
im going to stick it out here
we still have a shot
the elevator door opens parrish and joe step inside and the door closes leaving sloane behind
the board meeting has broken up clusters of members have lingered exchanging post mortems
and enraged quince has cornered drew out of earshot of the others
what have you done
youve gotten the old man fired
that we did
thanks to you
he was wobbling mind you but you stupid the coup de grace
quince falls silent aquiver with this reality
im going to put a stop to this
quince you cant unscramble scrambled eggs
but i didnt mean to do it
the trains left the station pal and youre aboard
would you like to hear the silver lining
check that gold
ive been working with john bontecou all along
we had a game plan acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piece by piece to the highest bidder
i set it up for him he smacks it out of the park
quince is struck dumb
drew contd dont you know what thisll mean
youll be rich
youll sell your stock you can stop kissing ass whatll it feel like to be a man
i dont want to get rich this way im going to expose you
go right ahead
tell william parrish how you betrayed him at a secret board meeting
and tell allison how you got her father fired and he lost his company
quince goes ashen
drew contd its just life quin cee
drew hails an employee across the hall
drew contd to quince wake up and smell the thorns
drew joins the employee as quince slumps against the wall
parrish enters joe right behind him coyle takes their coats disappears
parrish hesitates for a moment shrugs as if he has a thought he doesnt want to share then heads upstairs with joe
he is trudging a bit joe senses his mood
im sorry bill thats okay
just a manner of speaking
joe seems puzzled
contd what okay is its okay its over
weve got bigger fish to fry dont we joe
im going to take a nap
parrish contd are you hungry
coyle will have luisa fix you something to eat
im not hungry
then i cant help you
parrish turns into his bedroom closing the door gently behind him
joe continues down the hall enters the guest wing
midday sunlight streams into the sitting room joe passes through to his bedroom sits tentatively on the bed feels the edge of the silk spread touches the pillow then rises
again crosses back to the sitting room
susan appears in the doorway joe suddenly senses her turns around
he stands they regard each other for the moment
joe contd may i take your coat
she doesnt answer starts to take off the coat herself joe comes around her to help susan senses him breathing in the scent at the back of her neck
i just thought id drop by scrounge a little lunch i was in the neigh borhood how beautiful
he starts to hang susans coat up
just throw it on the chair
joe holds her coat carefully on the chair
an awkward moment the two of them shifting from foot to foot
susan contd when i called they said that you and daddy had just left the office
hes taking a nap
he must be tired this bontecou thing yes hes tired
i believe so
joe contd you must be hungry
susan sits on the couch
no not anymore
joe hears the question but doesnt answer sits down on the couch beside her
susan contd after a moment are you cold
maybe its the draft through the door
she gets up closes the door sits back down again next to joe
a warm awkward silence they move closer to each other now they fall into a foreplay which susan recognizes as such joe on the other hand participates hungrily but has
no knowledge where it is leading
his movements are instinctive the smell of her hair the shape of her fin gers odd things about her seem to interest him
this excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous even though joe has no
know ledge of how to make love to a woman ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question has he done it before
strange territory for joe not to be in control and exert ing his power but his inventions and responses in lovemak ing are so real that an emotional exchange between
he and susan builds
joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion he loves what is happening and yet at the same time is terrified by it
he feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of but is deeply dangerous to partake of he knows what he is doing is
putting who he is at great risk yet he goes right on
the powerful contradiction is transmitted to susan and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey they both have been swept away in a stream
of events they have created and they dont care about the consequences
spent they lie in silence
finally susan speaks its so wonderful to make love to you
its like making love to some one who has never made love before
joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said but to tell her more even the truth about himself
he weighs then resists the impulse
her head nestles underneath his arm she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so
did you like making love to me
i loved it
more than you love peanut butter
she laughs at the earnestness with which he answers
joe seems to drift away now they lie together as one but for the first time she feels separate from him sensing him gone to some distant distant land
where are you going
for how long
oh i hope a long long time
what do we do now
it will come to us
joe and susan are at the front door he has helped her on with her coat she turns around they kiss
the kiss lingers susan breaks away reaches for the door looks back longingly at joe and then she is gone joe closing the door softly after her
he turns back into the foyer looks up parrish is on the balcony it is clear he has observed joe and susan
parrish in a state of shock doesnt answer for a moment
joe contd did you have a nice nap
i couldnt sleep
im sorry to hear that
he starts up the stairs
no ill come down joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as parrish descends
parrish contd whats going on
joe senses parrishs tone doesnt answer
parrish contd i saw you kiss susan
yes i saw you see me
well youre at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman
ill be the judge of that
im her father
with all due respect bill im not asking your permission
well you goddam well should
you walk into my life give me the worst news a guy can get have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi ness and with my family
and now youre spooning with my daughter
yes and stop repeating everything i sai and turning it into a question
spooning fooling around god knows what
you arrive on the scene why you picked me i still dont under stand i picked you for your verve your excellence and for your ability to how shall i
youve lived a first rate life
and i find it eminently usable
parrish measures joe
what do you want
joe doesnt answer riveted now on parrish
parrish contd everybody wants something joe
youve been taking me from pillar to post here
i thought i knew who you were and it wasnt a whole lot of fun however it was almost bear able
now im getting something else from you something very very strange what is it that you want joe
im only following the parrish bywords
looking for that ounce of excitement that whisper of a thrill what there is no sense living your life without
you know what i mean bill
parrishs jaw sets
youre violating the laws of the universe
any universe that exists or ever existed
you may be the pro joe
but i know who you are
and youre all fucked up
i dont like your tone and i dont like your references
and i dont give a shit
may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor this is me
so watch it
cut the bill crap out you sonofabitch
i told you watch it
now joe turns on his heel heads right out the front door
parrish is left solitary confounded staring at the closed door
joe walks down a hallway a bouquet of flowers in hand looks around the usual feverish activity he seems lost for the moment but a receptionist catches his eye
can i help you
she comes on at
he looks at the flowers regards them for a moment then heads for an elevator
easter is sitting up in bed hooked up to an tv and moni tors
she glances over at the doorway joe is standing there observing her
an awkward silence he looks at his flowers again now sets them respectfully on easters bedstand
mistah bad news
bout time you show up
joe speaks to her in the dialect
don be facety woman
none facety mistah
you come for me
dats good news
no i come to see doctor
what could be wrong wit you
silence then easter smiles
oh you come to see doctor lady
my doctor lady
she thinks about this for the moment joe grows uncomfort able

joe seems slightly tormented by the question easter senses him trying to frame a respect
you loved back
she knows you real self
she knows how she feel
irritably don need you okayin
schoolboy tings is you head
badness for you badness for her badness for me lyin here tumor big as breadfruit poison my inners an waiting

stubbornly only flowers i wan sees ones over my peaceful self restin in the dutty

silence easter waits watching joe
you not in you right place mistah
easters response stops joe cold he looks away and then back at her she had clearly reached him
easter contd i ain either

but i not lonely here
somebody want me here
easter considers joe she smiles sympathetically

easter drifts into silence her eyes and joes meet a sense they understand each other
easter shifts trying hard to ease her discomfort
gently got enough nice pictured easter
she looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes
joe watches her now his eyes close
easter exhales raspingly falls still
the monitors flatline
a beeping alarm sound somewhere down the hall
joe opens his eyes takes a deep breath he seems troubled
joe contd gbye sistah
she slips out of the room
parrish is playing solitaire
the sound of the front door closing heels crossing the foyer he looks up at the foyer door is susan
he starts to get up she motions to him to stay looks around now
parrish contd joes not around
where is he
i dont know
susan seems distracted
parrish contd why are you looking for joe
because i was sitting in a staff meeting incredibly bored my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was joe
i dont understand
obsession all those things you told me to wait for
well theyve arrived
parrish blinks stares down at his cards
this is crazy why
a man appears at your side almost never leaves it you clearly trust him depend on him i sense you value him deeply why arent those things good enough for
you dont know anything about joe what are you afraid of dad
that ill fall head over heels for joe well i have as you did with mom
a moment thats always been standard whether you like or not
parrish tries to get hold of himself changes gear now
susan i dont think joe is going to be with us long
wheres he going
i dont know i cant say cmon
the guys working with you
you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works in this case i cant
i uh i just cant help you
i only would tell you that with joe you are on very very dangerous ground
susan doesnt answer for a moment
i love him
i dont care if you love him
im telling you hes no good for you
of course not daddy
there is something in susans tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in
susan contd i love you too
she kisses parrish rearranges one of his ranks of cards shuffles through the deck turns over the top card lays down a card parrish needs
susan contd lightning does strike
parrish watches as susan turns disappears out the door
joe walking disconcertedly up the street bumping shoulders with the rush hour crowd trapped in the life of the city he peers intently at faces cars into store windows
he stops now at the window of a korean grocery something has caught his eye he steps inside
through the window joe can be seen making a purchase he hands the korean clerk some money walks out
joe back on the street now unscrews the top of a jar of peanut butter dips a wad out with his fingers
the korean clerk runs out after him
joe stops uncomprehending
the clerk hands joe bills and coins
why are you giving me money
i am who i am
i cannot change
joe tries to hand the money back but the baffled clerk refuses it
youre wasting your money
i couldnt change even if i wanted to
the clerk exasperated murmurs something in his language and returns to the store
joe continues on down the street
parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire
joe appears in the doorway parrish doesnt notice him
joe waits finally parrish looks up
they regard each other
i have the feeling that all in all what i made this voyage for has served its purpose
what are you saying that its time to go
joe doesnt respond parrish and joe measure each other for the moment
parrish contd im ready
tomorrow after the party
parrish nods joe nods back
a birds eye view of the hudson over the george washington bridge past the widest expanse of the river at the tappan zee coming in now over the great lawns
and old estates of the upper hudson valley down towards annadale on hudson and the parrish country estate which commands a beehive of activity tents and workmen and vehicles
the parrish astar sets down in its roped off landing area
the butler runs towards it to open the door parrish and joe disembark
following the butler they make their way through the maelstrom tents being raised platforms for music groups portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily
parrish and joe move solemnly observing the activity not speaking to one another
although they are shoulder to shoulder there is a distance between them
they walk on past chan deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven through their branches
adding to the confusion the astar lifts off the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors
may the housekeeper appears
to parrish telephone call sir
sloane from new york
parrish nods starts up for a wing off the main house joe right at his side
joe not knowing whether to be affronted or not hesitates and parrish strides away
joe does not follow
a low slung but well appointed room with a writing table a working fireplace expensive and appropriate hudson valley prints
parrish enters clicks on the speakerphone observes the party activity through a wide bow window
speakerphone yeah bill how are you
big doing up here
why are you still down here
speakerphone the boards working through the weekend trying up the loose ends this damn thing
but i want to give it one more try im still holding out some hope
eddie hold out all the hope you want but i promise you its hope less its over
come on up lets get drunk if i had your shoulder to lean on i might actually enjoy this speakerphone no im going to stay down here keep my finger
in the dike and maybe by monday the waters could recede
if youre trying to show me lay down in front of the bus loyalty forget it
speakerphone sorry bill have a drink eat your cake blow out the candles and make a wish
talk to you monday
okay eddie anyway thanks for the memory
parrish clicks off the speakerphone turns around and looks out the window again the party preparations in full swing colored lights are tested they flicker on and off
allison is everywhere parrish emerges from his wing she catches his eye immediately the calm director of a demille like epic politely giving workers instructions making lightning decisions
parrish turns his attention now to an ice filled fountain encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux cyrillic a b and a p as rubber booted delivery men carefully
arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each letter
a smile creases parrishs face as in an unexpected lull allison backs into him at the fountain
hi daddy what do you think
its starting to grow on me
but what do the b and p mean
the fountain is the caspian sea and the sea is serving up caviar
the bs for beluga the p for petrossian
of course they also stand for bill and for parrish
do they mdear
plus weve got a baritone with a balalaika coming from the russian tea room
ive dressed him in a cossack shirt and hell sing nelson eddy songs
parrish shakes his head
you are amazing
why oh why allison are you doing all this
but before she can answer a workman is tugging at allisons sleeve she turns away from parrish to give him instructions out of parrishs earshot and then turns back they
step away now daughter and father alone
i do it because i love you
because everybody i loved you
mommy wher ever she is susan quince the people who work for you everybody whos ever known you
and what about my enemies
they respect you
isnt that a kind of love
unexpectedly allison brushes a lock away from parrishs forehead with a flick she has rearranged his hair he blinks a little embarrassed but having liked it
allison contd above all youve been a wonderful father
i havent been the father to you that that youve been to susan
i wasnt going to say but thats what you were thinking
and thats okay
because i know you love me
not like it is with susan the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you as
opposed to me when i walk in a room and that look comes over your face what does she want now
a weather beaten military parade ground pennant passes th infantry regiment c charlie company
allison contd i already feel ive had everything i could have wanted for my birthday hey theres lots to come
gesturing to me activity a little excess like you love
the preparations are building to a climax all the elaborate plans coming to fruition
you know darling this is going to be a wonderful party
gently yes it is
allison wades into the maelstrom now parrish watches her go swarms of purveyors and caterers following her
ambrose the head caterer is making a last minute check of the bars stock quince ambles up in the background the activity has built to a pitch waiters adjusting their
uni forms purveyors trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust
give me a seagrams and
ambrose looks at him blankly
quicnce contd no got
okay a double v
im afraid this is a wine bar mr
okay give me a bottle of wine
red or white
joe appears looking bewildered jostled by caterers setting up last minute tables a drummer from the band rolls his traps past on a little cart
joe doesnt seem to know where he is when his eyes alight on quince he heads for this oasis
ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs
quince contd to joe red or white
no thank you
quince sips the red now the white now he pours some of each into one glass
cmon have a drink
you look like you need one bad as me
im a little confused
oh man ive got troubles of my own
you love allison dont you
oh yes i do
how did you meet
i was a world class loser and she was a happy little rich girl and for some reason she took me in
but she loves you
quince smiles nods embarrassedly
joe contd how do you know
because theres nothing we dont know about each other and its okay
i mean the deeper darkest secrets they dont matter
the deepest darkest secrets
yeah its like you know every inch of each others souls and then youre free
what do you mean free
free to love each other
quince seems uncharacteristically within himself
quince contd all that hoopla up there reminds me how i will never measure up to a man like bill parrish or his daughter
he drains his wine
quince contd do you like me joe
oh yes you are one of my favorites
what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish
a moment i told drew and the board that bill depended on you
drew led me on but i had no business telling him in the first place
he was setting up bill from day one
drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts
bontecou was outside drew was mr
and i was the fool who made it all happen
oh god what do i do
joe regards quince
go to bill parrish and tell him everything
hell forgive you
quince drains one more glass of wine
you think so
how do you know
because thats the kind of man bill parrish is
i guess you know him better than anybody
the orchestra behind them plays a few riffs sound checks getting close
do you think i should wait to tell him till after the party
quince nods anxiously then smiles gratefully
they look on as the pre party activities swirl on around them
the moment just before sunset the last pre party minutes a procession of guests cars winding up to the guest house being directed into adjacent fields
susan cuts past a re ceiving line that files up the stairs she skirts the house and heads straight for the action the party on the lawns in the rear
climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the event on which the curtain is just about to rise
guests milling emerging from the crowd susan sees isolated by a fountain joe
he looks up towards her he knows she has seen him they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been prearranged but which they intuit
susan slants through the guests stopping here and there excited greetings and cha tter float on the wind he susie
what a party you look great she keeps moving a shimmering wraith
joe is on the right coordinate to meet her his graceful unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is not certain of but where he knows he will
the very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river the light catching susan and joe as they enter the garden the party forming behind them
the river flowing in front of them
i like you in a black tie
i love you in an evening gown
it beats a surgical doesnt it
susan contd daddy told me you might be leaving
your father and i our time together has come to an end
where are you going
joe attempts to answer but nothing comes out
susan contd you wont tell me
well i and you cant tell me who you are
again the same indescribable gesture from joe
susan contd im in love with a man i dont know who he is where hes going or when
i can tell you the when part
it gets worse
no worse than it gets for me
im in love with a woman whom i dont want to leave
we know so little about each other we know all that we need to know but theres so much to tell you dont
that will come later
we caught it in a bottle
dont let it out
i want to be with you joe another moment
what will we do
love will find out the way
love will find out the way
its a saying
i believe that dont you
yes thats why i said it
they are on the brink of some decision joe is about to make some declaration when allison is heard there you are
allison contd whats going on here
tete a tetes on my big night
to susan cmon honey youre needed
to joe can it wait
but before he can answer allison contd glad to hear it
to susan lets go
she takes susans arm and marches her off joe in thrall watches them go as the music erupts behind them as up dance tune a lilting catchy melody envelops them
the curtain has risen on william parrishs th birthday party
quince is on the carpet sweating through a confession parrish moroses but philosophical at his desk
what can i say after i say that im sorry
i zipped when i shouldve zagged i opened my big mouth one too many times everything got all twisted its okay quince
youve always meant well and i appreciate that
sometimes things just turn out wrong
a knock on the door it opens joe appears
excuse me he starts to step out
come in joe i want to thank you okay bill
as joe enters quince flashes a warm smile at him
to parrish joe knew the whole story
i told him
it was his idea that i come clean
i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls you know what i mean
yes i believe i do
quince now drifts off
yeah well i can tell you guys got business no im out of business right quince
however i do have some unfinished business with drew
get him out here
get him on the chopper and get him out here to night
i want to tell this guy how i feel about him face to face
oh that could be a tall order b
i doubt that drews anxious to see you face to face
joe steps in
to quince tell drew that bill acknowledges that this was a contest and hes lost
the race is to the swift but could drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow bill to save face
tell him bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company and the executive continuity is unbroken
tonights the night to do it
hell introduce drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from washington and drew can tell them that everythings sailing along just fine
parrish is impressed by joes acumen a look of grudging admiration
he nods to joe summarizes to quince all in all what bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to drew with no hard feelings
you think drew will go for it
quince ive got confidence in you
sir ill deliver the package
he heads out parrish and joe fall silent
not at all
joe contd how are you doing
what the hell do you care
i was just asking bill
you want to know ill tell you
youre looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the valley of the shadow of death hes galloping into it
and the same time the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates
and oh yes i almost forgot my daughters fallen in love with death
and im in love with your daughter
im in love with your daughter and im taking her with me tonight
parrish is stunned
i think you heard me bill
youre not taking susan anywhere
and what the hell does that mean anyway
joe doesnt answer for a moment
parrish contd i thought we had a deal
im sorry bill susan is my daughter she has a wonderful life ahead of her and youre going to deprive her of it and youre telling me youre sorry
well im sorry apology not accepted
i love her bill
she is all that i ever wanted and ive never wanted for anything because ive never wanted anything before if you can understand
how perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you
its not love then what is it
some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in dulging
its missing everything that matters
which is what
trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them
and above all not hurting the object of your love
so thats what love is
multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about
those were my words bill
well theyre mine now
joe is silent for a moment cogitating
susan wants to come
she says shes in love with me
who is you
did you tell her who you are
does she know where shes going
joe doesnt answer
parrish contd susan went in whatever way she did for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took and everything else since has been aftermath
you say you love her but you dont know what love is
she loves you but she doesnt know who you are
you make a deal youre breaking it the bottom line is joe youre conducting a great romance under false pretenses
i dont like what youre saying
i dont expect you to
are you threatening me
i certainly hope so i loved susan from the moment she was born and i love her now and every minute in between and what i dream of is a
man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her who is worthy of her who is of this world of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life
parrish is beginning to reach joe
are you telling me i cant be part of it
a pause parrishs posture changes
why did you come in here and tell me joe
you are the biggest shot of all you dont have to ask my permission but thats what youre doing
you know why
because youve somewhere somehow developed into a good guy and you know this is all wrong
i dont know what youre going to do how can this be love
she doesnt know who you are
why dont you tell her
try it out on her
see what happens
reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may
joe has received what parrish has said
parrish contd okay
ive given it my best shot
i wish i could tell you to sleep on it but
parrish lets his words drift into silence he shrugs joe regards him
joe makes his way down the path from parrishs study a weight on his shoulders his step measured within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and
music of the party
he drifts into the center and runs right into susan couples swirl about them the eye of a storm of gaiety
whatd you know
susan contd theres something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd
i could make love to you right here
he hesitates reaches out to take her hand studies it
susan contd if youre going to tell my future youre on the wrong side
there is something i do want to tell you he stammers into silence
but you cant
joe is about to respond but doesnt
susan contd just then when you hesitated the way you shift from foot to foot ive always found endearing but just now i got a chill
but he drifts again now she takes his hand
susan contd remember that morning in the coffee shop
you said whats wrong with taking care of a woman she takes care of you did i say that
and i said youd have a hard time finding a woman like that
joe shifts she smiles at his embarrasement
susan contd well youve found one joe
the coffee shop that was the place
and you were the guy
joe seems resigned now the air gone out of him
susan contd and you said you didnt want me to be your doctor because you didnt want me to examine you
a moment well i got to examine you after all joe blinks at a loss
susan contd i could come with you i uh you want me to wait for you youll be back joe doesnt answer susan is suddenly anxious
susan contd why do i want this night to last forever
dont you know thats what i want more than anything
he touches her face
you said before you couldnt tell me who or where only the when is when now
may i kiss you
he kisses her they fall into a deep embrace
that felt like a goodbye
joes silence is heavy
susan contd whats going on joe
i feel like were lifting off im still here
but youre not
youre somewhere else
a moment youre someone else joe is struggling with a response finally inevitably he drifts into a long silence
susan is beside herself her emotions tossed in every direction joe steadies her
tell me you love me tell me you love me now i love you now ill love you always hold me he holds on tight to her
they are desperately entwined until finally she releases him
thank you for loving me
she smiles wanly joe leaves her
parrish is seated by the window lights from the party flashing past the music and laughter audible but muted the fever of the celebration lost on him within himself
joe enters parrish looks up
we should think about getting started bill
joe contd itll just be us
the tension in parrishs body releases he takes a breath
joe nods an acknowledgement but his face reflects his pain
parrish regards him sympathetically
the silence is broken by a knock on the door
parrish out of politeness to joe does not respond
after a moment
quince appears flushed with excitement
i got him
the choppers two minutes away
parrish weighs the information for a moment
to joe how are we on time
joe shrugs nods gently
to quince get him in here
quince exits parrish presses the button for the speaker phone
parrish contd may
i know youre busy but i want you to put in a call to eddie sloane for me at home sir
no hes at the office
an area on the fringe of the party the helicopter blades stop spinning
quince hurries to the aircraft door opens it and drew steps out
quince leads the way through the lights and music
drew fashioning an imperial entrance for himself hails partygoers as he passes quince enjoying the irony
this is damn big of bill i also think its smart
he had no choice
youre a formidable adversary
he said that
well youve got him by the short hairs
yeah the short gray hairs
he flashes a pleased as punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to parrishs study
parrish is at his desk joe in a distant corner of the room
speakerphone were all here bill i appreciate this eddie members of the board this will just take a minute of your time
as the custo dians of the company you may re ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you a moment or not
either way thanks
speakerphone were all ears
drew enters with quince quince nods excusing himself and closes the door behind him
hi bill happy birthday a moment
drew contd i just wanted to say how appre ciative i am of this uh grand gesture and shut up and sit down
drew takes a seat
parrish contd youre a worthless sack of shit you fucked me over played footsie with john bontecou sold my company out to line your own pockets
i dont know where you get that idea the board agreed the board didnt know youre a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all
is this mr
another one of his whoppers
arent you sick of this asshole lurking around
no one knows who he is but one thing everyone does know he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since
joe can no longer control himself
youre the poison drew
youve operated behind the scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature
ive seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time but bill parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so machiavellian that it has rarely been my
experience to encounter
and yet he has combatted them stoically and selflessly without revealing my identity
had he violated the vow of secrecy he took his task would have been far easier he could have turned defeat into victory but he is too honorable a man
to have done that
and now i must release him from that vow
because of me he has lost his work his company his reputation and now hes going to tell you who i am
parrish is struck dumb
he looks at joe pleadingly shaking his head imperceptibly but joe nods to him blithely and then commandingly
to parrish so tell me tell me im peeing in my pants
and now youre going to pee some more
joe dont do this its time to put this person where he belongs
its not necessary joe
drews going to step aside im not stepping anywhere i appreciate your gentlemanliness bill but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home the dagger
i told you to shut up
to drew prepare yourself drew i am he is ill take it from here to drew i am an irs man
drew is stunned joe glances at parrish hesitates
parrish contd yes he is
hes an irs man
arent you joe
joe is at a loss parrishs eyes are glued to his joe gets the hint
yes i am
to drew irs man
drews head swivels from joe to parrish and back again
the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou
they were convinced that bontecou on past deals had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable
the irs wanted to go after him and this deal offered them the opportunity
a moment i agreed to cooperate
to parrish and were very grateful
moreover agent joe black here of course thats not his real name smelled out your involvement drew
he developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence
unfortunately thats known as a conflict of interest undisclosed conflict of interest an offense an indictable offense
i think id like to talk to my lawyer no lawyers drew
were going to offer you a deal
drew is all attention
parrish contd confess to the board every details of your participation and then submit your resignation
and what do i get
you get not to go to jail
youre talking through your hat
youre offering a deal because youve got no proof
weve got plenty of proof
to drew and hes talking through his lips
joe steps forward
joe contd make no mistake drew if you choose to test my resolve in this matter youll be looking at an outcome that will have a finality that is beyond
your comprehension and youll not be counting the days or the months or the years but millenniums in the house with no doors
all right you win
as soon as i get back to the city ill meet with the board
sloanes voice erupts over the speakerphone
youre meeting with the board right now drew
moreover i propose a motion to re confirm william parrish as chairman of the board of parrish communica tions as well as a rejection of the merger with bontecou international
how say you board
a chorus of thunderous yes es resounds through the sloane o
contd the motion is passed
well thank you thats great but its more than i bargained for
i just wanted to set the record straight
but we want you back bill
mean while enjoy your party celebrate well attend to the nasty details
black may we say thank you
this is an irs agents dream
ill be promoted to chief of section off of this
parrish clicks the speakerphone off
drew is staring at joe shaking his head
who wouldve ever believed it
you an irs agent silence
joe shrugs smiles
death and taxes
the door flies open an anxious allison appears
weve been looking all over for you this is your party what are you doing in here
she pulls him out of his chair hustles him out of the room joe right behind them
the guests have formed themselves into a huge audience the orchestra strikes up happy birthday as parrish appears with allison
an enormous cake is unveiled with one great lit candle parrish beams then laughs
he pauses over the cake now blows the candle out
applause cries of speech
parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic he holds up his hand nods quiets the crowd
joe observes from the fringe
to the guests i thought i was going to sneak away tonight
yells of no
parrish contd what a glorious night every face i see is a memory
it may not be a perfectly perfect memory sometimes we had our ups and downs but were all together and youre mine for a night
a moment and im going to break precedent and tell you my one candle wish that you would have a life as lucky as mine where you can wake up
one morning and say i dont want anything more
another moment sixty five years dont they go by in a blink
parrish hesitates waves and steps away applause that grows into cheers the music resumes another dance tune
quince grabs him pumps his hand and claps him on the back
now parrish spots allison he wraps her in a tight embrace they hold each other close for a moment but then are separated by a surge of guests
parrish sees susan she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her
he heads towards her they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd
what a night
im having a helluva time
you were right about joe he is going somewhere gently im sorry
susan is examining parrish very closely
are you relieved
yes but parrish hesitates
i want you to know how much i love you
that youve given a meaning to my life that i had no right to expect and that no one can ever take from me
daddy no i love you so much and i want you to promise me something
i dont want you to ever worry about me
if anything should happen im going to be fine and everythings going to be all right
a moment and i have no regrets
susan is in pain now she cant summon an answer
parrish contd and i want you to feel that way too
i love you daddy thats why its okay
they drift into silence
parrish contd no regrets
after a moment
a long silence susan smiles
its a good feeling isnt it
everybodys saying goodbye
they regard each other a long pause they have reached an understanding
im still here
a moment would you like to dance with me susan
oh yes he starts to lead her to the floor immediately stops
if you dont mind dancing with an old fogey like me
oh dad youre not old
youll never be old
he takes her in his arms and they dance away
on a distant fringe of the party a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor is joe
his eyes are on parrish and susan he watches them admiringly yet ruefully
a waiter passes catches sight of joe stops
can i get you anything sir
joe regards the waiter for a moment
do you have any peanut butter
the waiter hesitates
i dont think so sir
thank you anyway
the waiter moves off
joes attention returns to parrish and susan the dance number ends a boom
on the dance floor
what was that
the fireworks are about to start
parrish looks up sees joe up on the terrace waiting
susan contd to parrish shall we
you go ahead honey im going to catch my breath
suddenly he hugs her holds her very close
she looks at him he smiles nods but doesnt release her until she smiles back
now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks
when parrish senses she is on her way he turns and heads up towards joe
joe rises to meet parrish as he approaches
happy birthday bill
they watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks
joes gaze lingers
parrish contd did you say goodbye
i guess you have your reasons
now that we have a moment would you mind if i expressed my gratitude for what you did for susan
parrish contd i never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you it was always what i wanted for her but what happens to her now
i wouldnt worry about it bill
these things have a way of working out
joe regards parrish waits until he has a sense that parrish has accepted what joe has said then joe continues joe contd and would you mind if i expressed my
joe contd for you
for the time youve given me
for the person you are
dont blow smoke up my ass youll ruin my autopsy
joe barely manages a smile now looks back longingly at the crowd below searching
parrish contd its hard to let go isnt it
what can i tell you
a silence an understanding there is another more to say
joe looks inquiringly at parrish as if to say shall we
parrish nods and joe turns with him
they set off now away from the party up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river
down below the party guests faces are lit by the initial fireworks display
among them is susan but her interest isnt there
not something pulls her attention an over powering feeling that compels her to turn and see at a distance parrish and joe walking away up the meadow
some thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her she turns back to the party dazed tracing on the fireworks
up the hill parrishs step slows joe slowing with him
im getting a little dizzy i can feel my heart pumping but parrish doesnt wait for a response just continues on up the meadow towards the rise of the hill
joe in step with him
parrish contd should i be afraid
joe stops parrish stops with him
not a man like you
parrish smiles faintly takes a deep breath he strides out again joe right with him
in tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill
a barrage of fireworks lights up the sky
down below susan in a pained reflex again turns and looks up towards the hill
there is nobody there
she hesitates now glides away from the party her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill
susan halts in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where joe and parrish disappeared
he is heading straight for her she tries to make him out seems to recognize him starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet
now she stops again
it is a man he keeps coming and now that he is close and recognizes him
he smiles quizzically hasnt quite heard her stands right in front of her loose smiling disoriented and yet so appealing
they are riveted on each other uneasy and yet close
susan contd youre here
he is trying to get his bearings
something about him makes susan slightly tentative
where did you go
joe shrugs scratches his head endearingly uncertain of time and place
i dont know yknow i dont know its all blurred up and hazy
and would yknow what i mean if i said i dont think its worth figuring out
some realization is dawning on susan it renders her lightheaded
joe contd but now im back
susan regards joe intently searching his face for an answer
gently thats it
well i dont know what else to say
its a helluva party you think so
and youre the prettier thing here
susan blinks a long silence she touches the sleeve of his jacket now her hand traces the outline of his face she regards him intently and the dilemma she has
been struggling with the last moments fades away
susan slowly realizes this is the young man
she is shaken a sudden intake of breath
hey you all right
his hand politely touches her elbow courteously lending her support
the coffee shop the young man nods pleased with her recognition
i asked you if i said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you
susan holds herself very still
young man contd and forgive me for saying this but then you said and its been with me ever since what has
you said you liked me
i said i liked you so much
she falls silent now overcome by the last moments revelations
the young man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain
hey everythings going great dont ythink
she doesnt answer for a moment
young man contd dont you feel that way
we know so little about each other
but weve got time
she searches the young mans eyes his face is open completely vulnerable waiting for her response
a long silence the words come out haltingly i wish you couldve known my father
susan signs the young man smiles gently they are completely intent on each other
what do we do now
a long silence
it will come to us
susan smiles the fireworks finale goes off the music comes up from below the night fills with light
the young man searches susans face now takes her hand and together they start back towards the party
