written by nathan atkins second draft samantha darko opens her eyes
she squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size
she sits up slowly looks around
and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field
sam is pretty and demure
her coppery hair flows past her shoulders
disoriented she stands and gazes at the infinite golden shimmer
amber waves of grain
patches of forest in the distance
she smiles and starts walking
she emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in arkansas
adjacent to her position on the other side of the deserted lanes is a truck stop
amongst the tractor trailers parked in the back lot is a white late s model chevrolet celebrity
sam makes her way across the asphalt toward the vehicle
corey richardson is asleep curled up in the reclined drivers seat of the car
she awakens when sam gets in on the passenger side and slams the door shut
corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen dyed hair piercings a little grungy
she rubs the sleep from her eyes greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm
she finds a soft pack of cigarettes and lights one
what time is it
corey adjusts her seat
she takes a long drag and chokes then spits out the window
she starts the car
coreys car cruises along the flat open road
she cranks up the volume on the cars cassette deck nodding her head to early s alt
rock suggestion into dust by mazzy star
sam looks out the window at the passing scenery farmers at work in the fields a billboard advertising a local restaurant roadside ditches filled with trash
she fixates on a minivan travelling in the slow lane
it contains the all american nuclear family mother father and three siblings one of them being a youngster
the youngster makes a face at sam as they pass by
corey glances at the control panel when she hears the engine start to rattle
she sees that the temperature gauge has hit the red and her check engine light is on
by the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway steam billows out from under the hood
sam gets out of the car to check on it while corey remains behind the wheel
sam peeks under the hood trying to clear the air of the steam
it sounds like someone is rhythmically tapping the inside of the engine with a hammer
turn it off
poking her head out the what
turn off the car
corey does so
doesnt look too good
how do you know
it smells funny
sam looks up when she hears a pick up truck coming toward them
corey watches as she steps out to wave it down
the pick up pulls over ahead of them
chris holt a brawny attractive young man gets out
when corey sees him she gets out too
thanks for stopping
our cars messed up
my check engine light came on then it just started smoking and ticking and shit
as chris pokes around under the hood sam and corey exchange looks
chris pops opens the coolant cap and burns his hand on the steam explosion
shaking it off blew your water pump
cant drive it
el renos just a couple miles up ahead
can call for a tow there
cmon ill give you a lift
all three crammed into the cab of the pick up they drive through the center of el reno oklahoma population and see some of the locals out and about music
montage fueled by early to mid s era grunge rock suggestion come as you are by nirvana reminiscent of the middlesex middle school montage in donnie darko agatha dowdy an employee of the local diner sits on a bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette
the manager ted moncton calls her back inside
randy evans ruth gibbens and jeff and mike jimenez loiter in the parking lot of a liquor store
trudy potter flirts with father homeijer a catholic priest outside the bank
a bank sign shows the time pm then flashes to the date june
officer ryan odell has pulled over a pretty lady and uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate
they come up on vietnam tom who ambles along the side of the road against traffic and he waves to them as they pass
he wears old weather beaten clothes and a multi colored ski mask over his head and face
sam swivels her head to watch tom
another car passes and he waves to it as well
chris picks up on her curiosity
he waves to everybody
just kinda walks up and down
people call him vietnam tom
he was in the war
he thinks he was
kind of a joke ya know
sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight
pan down to a puddle by the side of the road
as a car tire splashes through it pan up to find dustys auto repair shop which is nothing more than a big garage attached to his old two story house
coreys car has been towed there and dusty gibbens father of ruth gibbens the lone mechanic tinkers around under the hood
sam and corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting bored as hell
a pit bull laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway
the girls are forced to get up when ruth from outside the liquor store comes to the door
can i get out
sam and corey move so that she can exit the house
ruths look is hardened rough around the edges she appears older than her years
the girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father
she whispers something in his ear and dusty hands her some cash which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek
after this dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes outside to address corey and sam
its the water pump
so what do we do
i can order you up a new one
probably be a couple days
this the only show in town
cheapest and the best
but you want me to call the tow guy back here no problem
probably charge you another hundred bucks but hell get ya wherever you wanna go
just go ahead and fix it
phil coulter the proprietor of a dingy little roadside motel looks up from a hardcover copy of stephen kings geralds game when the girls enter
they each have a small suitcase and a backpack in tow
what can i do for you
we need a room
he gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter
corey finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form
a news bulletin about the o
simpson trial plays at a low volume on a television in the b
how much is it
how many you stayin
just a couple we hope
he takes the key to room off the rack
welcome to el reno
sam and corey arrive at the liquor store which is down the street from the motel
ruth randy evans and jeff and mike jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion to how they were earlier in the day
you get checked into the motel alright
randy seems surprised that ruth has already made their acquaintance
he wastes no time in introducing himself
my names randy
this is mike and jeff
guess you already know ruth
they shake and corey seems at ease mingling with the strangers
sam hangs back a little
one of you guys mind pickin us up a bottle of something
i think i can manage that
what do you want
i dont know
vodka whiskey whatever
corey looks to sam who produces some cash
randy takes the money and heads for the store
be right back
after hes gone theres an uncomfortable moment of silence in which mike and jeff ogle the girls mischievously
ruth stares at them in a different way
she seems somewhat resentful of their presence
from virginia huh
i saw your plates
corey and sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment
another beat of uncomfortable silence
your obviously just passin through here
were on the way to vegas
you need anything besides booze you just lemme know
randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag
he passes it off to corey along with some change
thanks a lot man
you guys wanna come back to my place for bit
bring your bottle we got some weed
corey looks like shes considering it but im really tired
she takes sams signal
yeah i think well just head back
been a long day ya know
the clock on the bank sign shows am then flashes to june
it changes again this time to a countdown to the july th fireworks celebration days hours sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare
she lies atop the blankets wearing a t shirt and boxer shorts
she looks over and sees corey passed out on the other full size bed
two plastic cups empty soda cans and the bottle are on the nightstand between them the liquor partially consumed
theres a digital clock radio that reads am
the tv is on and a late night infomercial for the george foreman grill plays
sam stares at the screen as the images warp and ripple in a way that coincides with an increasingly loud rumbling tremor from outside
in a daze she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television
she reaches out with her right hand about to touch it
a strange abrupt hard cut to sam is in a grassy field behind the motel moving away from the building
she wears a hooded sweatshirt jeans and her right hand is wrapped in some sort of makeshift bandage
theres a gash in the side of her forehead by her temple with what looks to be a shard of metal partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the
she is without expression and her movements are rhythmic and fluid
a tall aermotor windmill towers in the distance
a glimpse of the field through sams eyes shows a phosphorescent plane of destiny an intricate grid in which objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions and move according
to a framework of set paths
a jackrabbit follows a silvery vector spear like prophetic life gel to its burrow
cosmic energy burns around a cluster of stones
miniature vector spears lead a swarm of insects around in a circle and then buzzing right past sams field of vision
its infinitely complex but sam sees through it clearly
she has no vector spear of her own to guide her but she is cognizant of her path
she moves toward the windmill
sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower
a giant water tank squats beside it
remaining stoic she looks up and sees vietnam tom sitting atop the windmill platform more than feet up staring back down at her through the eyes holes of his ski
tom peers over the edge of the small platform the surface of which is littered with tattered clothing a water bottle cans of food and scraps of a tarp
he cradles a rifle in his arms
his focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to what is sitting right beside him reveal sam
her legs dangle over the side of the platform and she stares off into distance
the skys so beautiful here
tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at her
sam turns to meet his gaze
but we cant stay
sam sees through to the core of his physical being the dynamic center of which lingers pulsating in a translucent circle around his chest
magnified neurons in toms brain send electric impulses that release neurotransmitters which excite other neurons
tom slowly reaches out to touch sam but an invisible force field makes contact impossible
ripples swell throughout the clear plasma like barrier from where he touched it and his hand remains glued to the spot
sam extends her bandaged right hand and presses it to vietnam toms as if she were touching a mirrored image of herself
the contact generates more ripples and as tremors begin to shake the windmill a distorted voice echoes throughout the days
that is when the world will end
a cylindrical portal opens up below them gaping and swirling like gods eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado
as sam and tom stand in unison to peer into it a hexagonal plate of white light emanates from within they appear near the foot of the windmill sprinting away
from it together
tom has his rifle and he looks up to the sky as he runs
theres a brilliant flash of green light deafening thunder a blinding explosion sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her
she struggles to peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that stands over her
her eyes adjust to discover that its a policeman officer odell
fraid you cant sleep here miss
sam sits up and realizes shes on a bench at a bus stop near the side of the road
odells tone is innocuous and when she looks up at him again she sees that hes grinning
got anyplace to be
sam manages to find her voice
she takes his hand and rises
odells cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot which is uncharacteristically full
a fire truck is parked by the side of the road
just then a call comes in on the police radio we got some kinda situation at frank haleys farm
im here now
where the towering windmill once stood is now only a crater about feet deep and feet in diameter with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere
ground water spurts from the broken well seal
and a cantaloupe sized meteorite sits in the center of the crater
two firemen haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as sam and odell arrive on the scene
corey is already there looking on as well as chris holt who gave them a ride into town phil coulter from the motel and other local citizens
frank haley the farmer who owns the land is fuming
un fuckin believable
the firemen drop the porous misshapen clod by his feet
its still warm
you know how much its gonna cost me to replace this goddamn windmill
officer odell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite with his boot
sell this thing off to some meteorologist nerd club i bet you could do okay
sam looks down at a can of food on the ground amidst some scorched clothing
odell takes note of some other canned goods and scraps of tarp
whats all that stuff frank
that whack job toms been squattin up there the last couple a months
thinks hes the goddamn town watchman
you think he got blown up
everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until phil pipes up i saw him out in front of the motel early this morning alive and well
oh well thank heavens
sam turns and peers up at the water tank
its marred by burn marks and dents from the explosion
as she tilts her head and looks closer she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage a negative image like the shroud of turin
in the form of a bizarre toothy grinned face of a giant
sam and corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that chris has followed them
so you guys stayed here last night
one of us did
sam gives corey a look
chris decides to ignore the comment
whats up with your car
its gonna take a couple days
for a water pump
sam and corey shrug
none of my business but
hes distracted when a brand new bmw pulls up and parks nearby
jeremy frame a thin pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site
chris regains his train of thought i was just gonna say if you wanted i could give you a ride back
he looks right at sam when he says this
he then glances over at corey as if just remembering she was there
i mean i could give you both a ride
to middlesex virginia
do you have any clue how far that is
i got some time
sam looks as though shes about to say something but corey overpowers her
were not goin back
even el renos better than there
chris makes eye contact with sam again
she maintains it for a moment and then looks away
vietnam tom explores a cluttered junkyard gathering materials
he scours amongst the piles of refuse rusty machines and crumbling storage shacks
he bends to pick up a scrap of metal and adds it to a collection hes making in a worn satchel
as sam and corey are about to enter the diner trudy potter a bank teller is on her way out
the girls move to the side so she can exit and take notice of a missing persons sign posted next to the door billy moorcrofts dark empty eyes stare at
them from the isnt that just awful
trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders
his poor mother
the girls sit at a booth sipping cokes
how much money do we have left
not a whole lot
i cant believe your fucking parents wouldnt give you anything
they totally flipped out that i was even going
they werent about to give me money for the big trip
we shouldve waited till the end of the month when my mom gets her check
she wouldnt have given you anything
i know where she keeps her cash
whats she gonna do send her boyfriend after me
corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw
as soon as we get to vegas well be set
my cousin said sometimes she makes two grand in a week
sam is impressed but something about her subdued reaction exhibits reservations
just then agatha dowdy arrives with plates of burgers and fries
here you go
whered you two say you were from again
you hear that ted
she calls to ted moncton who is busy behind the counter
these girls are from virginia
ill be damned
im from reedville if you know where abouts that is
neither sam nor corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no
well have yourself some ice cream when youre done on the house
anything else you need give a holler
agatha moves off and sam and corey start to dig into their food
momentarily someone else enters and takes a seat at the counter by their booth
its jeremy frame the driver of the bmw
he raises a finger to alert ted of his presence
just a coffee please
ted nods and pours him a cup
after he receives his coffee jeremy turns and stares at the girls
they both notice him doing it but corey is the first to speak
can we help you
its just that i recognize you
i saw you by the motel
pretty amazing huh
i just made a deal with frank haley to buy it for seven hundred fifty dollars
whoop dee doo
what the hell are you gonna do with a friggin meteor
corey rolls her eyes at being corrected
sam smirks and munches on a french fry shes enjoying their conversation
im gonna study it
im a grad student at redlands
weve actually got a pretty cool geology lab there
corey focuses on her lunch ignoring him but jeremy goes on
ive gotta do some tests but if i had to guess id say its a siderite
theyre composed primarily of iron and nickel
my names jeremy
sam glances up at jeremy expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by coreys snub
but hes not
hes smiling at her and she cant help but smile back
each licking an ice cream cone corey and sam walk past the home of father homeijer
the priest is outside working in his flower garden wearing his clerical collar
an old catholic church rests on the same lot as his house looming behind it
when father homeijer sees the girls walking by he rises from his work takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his forehead
sam and corey both notice him eyeballing them
whats his problem
just keep walking
corey waves to him in a sarcastic exaggerated manner
the priest doesnt wave back but continues to gawk at them until they go around the corner
vietnam tom crouches in a decrepit shack covered by a piece of corrugated roofing
he works with great focus arranging various bits of metal into some sort of small sculpture
having finished their ice creams the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel
they find randy ruth jeff and mike at their usual post
hey whats up
just getting stared down by creepy priest boy back there
dont worry youre a little old for his taste
yeah hes a fuckin perv
to randy you got an extra cigarette
randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one
im throwin a big party at my house tonight you guys should come by
no excuses this time
sam and corey look at each other considering
youre gonna be stuck in el reno you might as well have some fun right
the party at randys teems with locals ages ranging from early teens to late s
on the back deck is a keg of beer and a boombox blasting music
theres a slimy looking pool and a few people swim in the greenish water
randy and ruth make their rounds as a pair
they stop off so ruth can sell a bag of weed to some eager kids
corey and sam hang with mike and jeff drinking beer
you guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up
well give you the vip treatment man
mike and jeff are both excited about this proposition
sounds good to me
give us a little time me and samll be runnin that place no doubt
corey is relaxed enjoying their newfound friends while sam appears more out of place
she drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage
randy and ruth converge back on the group just as officer odell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes
ruth notices him first
that pig odell
dont worry about ryan
he might be a cop but he still likes to party
randys theory is proven when odell takes a flask from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of teenage girls
but ruth is still not satisfied
i think that asshole knows i deal
you know how fucked that is
from what i hear hes got a little somethin goin on the side himself
fucking pigs a pig
theyre all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into the pool and splashes them
what the hell
sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants
ruth watches her smirking
we might as well all go in now were already wet
without warning ruth shoves sam backwards into the pool she sinks into the murky water in slow motion
all sounds are drowned out and everything is tranquil completely detached
through her blurred vision sam can see randys porch lights glimmering beyond the surface of the water
the spot lights are blinding from the perspective of the stage
through the white blur an auditorium full of people can been seen
in slow motion and perfect synchronicity young samantha and the sparkle motion girls are in the midst of their dance performance
back to a hand reaches into the pool grabs onto sams arm and pulls her up she breaches the surface of the water gasping for breath back to reality
she sees that randy is the one responsible for pulling her out
you fall asleep down there
he ruth and the others are looking down at her laughing
sam is lost in thought struck by her vision
she snaps out of it when she sees corey tear off her top and jump into the pool beside her
many of the partygoers hoot in approval and randy mike and jeff strip down and leap in right behind her
sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps are and fewer people
when she arrives there shes surprised to find chris holt waiting for her with a towel
thought you could maybe use this
as chris hands her the towel he notices a wide scar on the inside of sams right wrist
but doesnt mention it
sam wraps the towel around her sopping wet body
corey looks over and sees her getting out
chris and sam stand by the keg with fresh beers
so whats so wrong at home that you had to take off
the question takes sam by surprise
id love to get outta here someday too
just dont know quite where id go
sam decides to open up a little
i hate it there
its like everyone knows everything about me but im invisible at the same time
its like the worst of both worlds
how bout your family
they didnt want me to leave
well they did but they wanted me to go away to harvard or something like that like my sister
sam takes a big sip of her beer showing signs of tipsiness
sometimes i think it wouldve been easier if
i just after my sam stops herself
changing gears thats why i love corey she just doesnt give a shit
she does what she wants and she doesnt care what people think
you just gotta be yourself thats all
what is it you wanna do exactly
i always thought id be a dancer like in a troupe or something
sam is self conscious after admitting this
that sounds kinda stupid probably
when i was younger my dance team was on star search
but i didnt go
i didnt end up dancing in the talent show where they got discovered
i didnt really feel like it at the time anyway
but thats why were going to vegas
theres lots of opportunities there
chris glances over to the pool where corey is topless splashing and goofing around with some boys
yeah good place for it
gettin some practice on the way too
sam takes offense getting drunk and sensitive
is that supposed to be like some kind of judgement or something
no i was just she takes her beer and storms away from him
hey come on
sam finds a stoop at the side of the house where she can be alone
she can hear the party going on in the backyard but no one else is in sight
still soaking wet she plants herself on the stoop and starts to pound the rest of her drink
a strange abrupt hard cut to sam lies in the middle of the street in front of randys
a lone flickering street light intermittently bathes her in an orange glow
she is completely dry wearing her hooded sweatshirt and jeans with the makeshift bandage wrapped around her right hand
the shard of metal protrudes from the gash in her forehead
a car suddenly screams right past her prostrate form missing her by inches
she sits up slowly and looks toward the front of randys house which is about yards away
two drunk guys exit the house and enter the complex phosphorescent grid that is sams field of vision
vector spears jut from their chests and precede all their movements as they open the gas tank of a parked car insert a siphon and begin to drain the gas
into another vehicle
although she is close by they take no notice of sam whatsoever
another car speeds by again nearly crushing her but she doesnt flinch
she stands and turns deliberately to face the opposite side of the road where unlike the drunk guys there is someone who is completely focused on her vietnam tom crouches
in a ditch near a culvert sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch
tom stares at her wide eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask
from one end of the broad open culvert they can see straight through to the other side
a portal starts to take shape within swirling around the circumference
soft blue light touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow and a gust of wind is nearly strong enough to make them falter
on the opposite end of the culvert a plate of white light flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of tom and sam stand outside the church
the steeple reigns over them
sam is stoic as she watches tom climb the stone steps and approach the great wood doors
sam sits like a statue in one of the pews
tom strides past her in a daze moving toward the pulpit
beside the altar stand three bare crosses in imitation of calvary each standing over feet tall
sam looks up to a high corner above the pulpit to the right where two walls and the ceiling meet
the three planes come together at an irregular angle with the wall on the right side slanting inward and the ceiling phosphorescence burns in the three queerly pitches lines with
a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture
a vector spear bulges from vietnam toms chest where he stands below it reaching higher and higher
as toms spear gets closer to the convergence point the bizarre angling becomes more exaggerated because the planes start to dip and swell with impossible elasticity sam and tom find
themselves squeezed between the inner and outer walls
claustrophobic dusty and obscure
dilapidated wiring snakes around them and tom barely has enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger
cosmic energy jolts through the wire
a blue heat and pressure build
the old dry wood begins to creak and the sharp sounds echo and fade away
then become present again
louder now and different
sam pulls back the curtain of white a sheet over her face
shes lying on the floor of the motel room in between the beds
shes alone and naked except for the sheet
her wet clothes are in a heap beside her
her head is throbbing
she scrambles to put something on so she can get the door
having thrown on some wrinkled clothes sam opens the door to find phil the motel owner
he does not look pleased
you plannin on checkin out today
i i dont know yet
well its already way past checkout time so youd better figure it out quick
ive just gotta find corey
and check on the car
you do whatever you have to but if youre stayin another night i wanna see some money up front
sam approaches the bank and when she sees the tall sign with the digital clock she stops and stares up at it
it strikes a chord but she doesnt know why
the sign reads pm and then june
it changes to the fireworks countdown days hours sam enters the small bank and as she approaches the counter she sees that trudy potter is in tears
some of her female co workers are consoling her
i dont believe it
i still just dont believe it
its gonna be alright
trudy looks up and sees sam waiting uncomfortably
dabbing at her eyes with a tissue can i help you
is everything okay
no its not
mount calvary burned to the ground last night
father homeijers church
how did it happen
the police are looking into it but
i know it was arson
trudy leans in to talk quietly to sam
its no secret to me how people in this town feel about father homeijer
the horrible accusations that have been made against him
but its just a lot of nonsense
el renos changed so much since i was a kid growing up here
the young people nowadays
she places her hand on top of sams
but with all the drugs and the crime
i just dont know what this worlds coming to anymore
sam tries to redirect her focus
are you able to get money wired here from my bank back home
we dont usually work with other banks like that
i need to check my balance and get my money out
how do i do that
youll have to call and arrange it
you could always use western union
wheres your bank
cause theyre gonna need to have a signature
disappointed sam turns to leave
as shes on her way out she notices a bulletin board with another missing persons sign for billy moorcroft
she stands before the picture staring into the young boys dark empty eyes
though its just a low quality black white photo billys face emotes profound hopelessness and despair
as sam comes out of the bank jeremy rolls up in his bmw and parks in the lot
he gets out and approaches her
i didnt get your name at the diner
they shake and jeremy holds her hand for a little longer than what is generally comfortable
so what are you up to
trying to get money
not very successfully
ive gotta pick up some cash too
need some supplies for the lab
i dont think ive even slept since i got my hands on that meteorite
you should come by the lab with me and check it out
sam starts to walk away from him
i could let you borrow some money
if you need some
i dont even know you
i trust you
youre sure you dont want to check out the lab
ive gotta find corey
sam turns to leave
maybe some other time
corey rides shotgun in randys car chewing on some greasy fast food looking quite content
randy is behind the wheel with a beer in his hand and mike jeff and ruth are packed into the back passing around a joint
how many cheeseburgers did we get
mike passes the joint up to corey and she takes a big hit chases it with some beer
wait did we get smokes
everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see whats left of the church
police and firemen swarm
father homeijer stands with officer odell gazing at the soggy ruins
the only things standing amid the charred mess are the three bare crosses of mount calvary
but they arent completely intact all three are bent drastically forward sagging down toward the murky ground
musta melted from the heat
father homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis beside himself with bitterness and sorrow
theyre made of silver plated steel
a simple fire couldnt do that
what are you sayin
this is an extension of satans own hand
ive seen it coming
rolling his eyes odell walks away leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private
vietnam tom continues to toil over his sculpture but progress has been made
it has begun to take on a recognizable form a grotesque countenance with two long ears bulging eyes and a devilish sam is walking in front of a department store
when randys car pulls up beside her
corey sticks her head out the passenger side window
what happened to you
what happened to me
where the hellve you been
i crashed at randys
we just got food
want a burger
my stomachs fucked up
jeff and mike taunt her from the back
we gotta talk about what were gonna do
dont worry about it so much
the motel guy came to the room this morning all pissed off
were probably not even gonna have enough money to pay for the car
corey sighs debating weather or not to get out
before she can reach a decision something in the department stores parking lot catches her eye a little boy with dark hair wearing a birthday hat
but she blinks and hes gone having disappeared between two parked vehicles
confused corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car
should i wait a minute
we gotta get some smokes
just go ahead
ill catch up with you later on
corey gets out and shuts the door
randy speeds off toward an intersection about yards ahead
chris is at work stocking shelves inside the department store
he checks his watch stops what hes doing and grabs a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket time for a smoke break
sam and corey meander toward the intersection where randys car is stopped at a red light
we just gotta figure out what were gonna do
i dont think lemme guess you wanna go home
you wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college
well thats real big of you sam but i dont have that option
taken aback what are you talking about
ill go home and get the shit kicked out of me and get my ass grabbed by my moms boyfriend
theyre almost to the light which is still red and coming up on randys car
jeff mike and ruth stare out at them from the backseat smelling the drama
i knew youd bail on me eventually but not this quick
im not bailing on you
you can fucking sleepwalk back to middlesex for all i care
im not driving you
youre a fucking drag
the light turns green and randys car peels across the intersection making a left
fuck you corey
sam wheels on her and steps out into the street storming straight across
corey starts to follow
but something stops her in her tracks billy moorcroft
he stands on the opposite side of the intersection in the trajectory that sam is walking but sam doesnt see him
billy wears a birthday hat slacks and collared shirt
he looks pale and weak and is covered with bruises
he stares right back at corey as transfixed as she is
time slows down
note sams position is in the middle of the road
randys car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of the intersection
bewildered corey tries to step out into the street but something blocks her an invisible force field makes forward progress impossible
ripples swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit it
she looks up following the ripples with her eyes and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision into infinite space
she reaches forth with her hand wanting to feel the barrier once again
just as she touches it
real time resumes randys car
he jerks the wheel and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side completely smashing it in sam spins when she hears the deafening crunch
randy careens into the opposite lane and an oncoming car smacks him dead on
the inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a fire hydrant by the side of the road
the hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet
the world goes silent
corey signs her statement on officer odells desk the expression of shock still glued to her face
odell sits facing her
youre sure you didnt see a driver
he takes the statement from her
well youre one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did
front passenger side was wiped right out
coulda been two dead girls today instead of one
corey nods taking this in
i talked to randy and sent him home a little while ago
hes pretty shook up
corey doesnt respond
odell leans in to speak to her in confidence
both of us know hed been doin some drinkin today
but we also know hes not at fault here
that old beater cut right in front him
cant you just look up the license plates
no plates on the vehicle
were investigating the vin but that could take a little more time depending on the history of ownership
well find him
corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject what about the missing boy
odell shifts in his chair
you really think it was him huh
he was on the side of the road right before the accident
im no psychiatrist but i do know sometimes shock does funny things
you think i was hallucinating
we were on the scene five minutes after the accident
i think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around
he sees how troubled corey is
why dont you stop in and see dr
peters on your way out
right down the hall there
shell give you somethin to make you feel better
corey nods and gets up to leave
as shes on her way out odells voice stops her
is there anything you wanted to say to samanthas parents
coreys expression is blank
corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot
she holds a prescription for anti depressants
she is frightened when she notices a pair of eyes staring at her from the bushes close by its vietnam tom
hes wearing his ski mask and hes got his rifle
corey backs away as tom slowly creeps toward her
shes about to scream for help when chris holt comes out of the police station behind her
get the hell outta here
grateful for his presence corey moves to stand behind chris
tom shuffles away
should know better than to be carrying his rifle around town like that
corey takes a breath recovering from her scare
whatre you doing here
i had to put in a statement too
can i give you a lift
chris and corey pull up to the motel in his pick up
theyve gotten coreys prescription filled and she has the bottle of pills in her hand
im real sorry about sam
its such a waste
just a horrible freak thing
i said some pretty shitty things to her right before it happened
im sure she knew you didnt mean it
corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room
corey swallows two of her pills with some liquor from a plastic cup
she sits down on one of the full size beds where sams belongings are spread out
she opens sams backpack and discovers the philosophy of time travel book by roberta sparrow
as corey studies the cover her image is reflected by the closet door mirrors
the angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room
strangely coreys reflection is only present in one of the panes
the digital clock radio shows pm
there are pictures of sams family tucked away inside the book between the pages sam with her mother and father rose and eddie darko young sam with elizabeth and donnie
an old photo of the whole darko family together young sam holds ariel a stuffed toy unicorn
corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand
she then looks down and notices that the book is open to fragmentary universe
she pours over the text some of which reads when the fabric of the fourth dimension within a tangent universe becomes corrupted a highly unstable and volatile fragmentary universe can
occur sustaining itself for no longer than several days
fade to black
corey awakens to the sound of a little boy crying
she sits up in bed
the clock radio reads am
the crying is faint but steady and sorrowful and sounds as though its coming from outside
corey follows the distinctive crying toward the vending machines on the side of the building
until billy moorcroft emerges from behind them
corey freezes a few feet away from the boy who wears the birthday hat slacks and collared shirt
he is pale and bruised
corey sees that he is not crying its coming from elsewhere in the cosmos far away
the wails taper off to a faint distorted whisper as billy speaks you need to save me corey
corey stares at him in disbelief
you need to save me
and save the world
why cant anyone see you
if you tell them about me theyll think youre a dummy
i didnt pick you
just like you didnt pick me either
corey stands before him in awe transfixed
we shouldnt even be here
corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him
where the prices should be numbers flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant crying
you dont have much time
corey is about to respond when the sound of a door opening stops her
the flashing numbers on the vending machines go back to normal prices the crying sound ceases and billy disappears
whats goin on out here
corey looks over and sees phil dressed in nightclothes having come out of a room near the lobby
i i dont know
go back to your room and get some sleep
youve had a tough day
phil goes back inside leaving her alone
corey wanders through the aisles of the department store looking peaked and jittery
she comes upon chris stocking some shelves near the back of the store
how ya feelin
not so good
is there anything i can do
i need some cigarettes
and maybe some food
but i dont really have any money right now
im off at
meet me out behind the store
corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock
she shoots up when chris comes out the back entrance with a
corey takes it from him and looks inside candy bars a bag of chips some peanuts a pack of cigarettes
she tears open the cigarettes and lights one
chris lights up one of his own and notices coreys hands are shaking
shouldnt you go back home
theres nothing for me to go home to
what about sams funeral
corey looks conflicted but she takes a harsh stance whats the point
shes gone thats it
nothings gonna change that
chris lets it go
is there a library around here
you need a book
is it walking distance
i can take you
i think id rather walk
corey and chris stroll together along a quiet street
so you guys were real close huh
when i moved to virginia sam was like the only person i could even stand to talk to
how long had you been plannin your trip together
not too long
kind of a last minute thing
it was good timing cause i dont like to stay in one place for too long ya know
i was really surprised when sam wanted to come actually
i just kinda brought it up one day and she was down
corey reflects for a beat
if it wasnt for me shed still be alive right now
you cant think like that
its true isnt it
chris doesnt respond
corey and chris sit before a screen in a cramped dim booth near the back of the library
they stare at a microfilm article from about donnie darkos death
that was sams brother
on the screen is a photograph of the darko house with many people gathered in front of it
a jet engine is being lifted away by a crane
her parents must be going through hell
sam said once she wished it landed on her room instead of donnies
chris thinks on this
i saw something on sams wrist the other night
it looked like a scar
she told me it was from some accident
put her hand through a window or something
did you believe her
corey doesnt answer
she pulls up another article one that chronicles a man who was impaled by a metal pipe with no known origin
a third article is about a little girl who was decapitated by a manhole cover that was inexplicably flying through the air
chris is horrified
corey is totally engrossed
she brings up a final article that tells the story of a boy who was crushed by a dumpster that fell from the sky
a picture shows his legs sticking out from under it like the wicked witch of the east when dorothys house fell on her in munchkinland
i dont understand why were lookin at this stuff
they still never found a driver to that car that hit randy
i was standing right there
i didnt see anyone
i was pretty close too but everything was all crazy
whoever it was mustve jumped out and took off
i found this book in sams backpack last night
theres a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening
like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadnt made yet
unexplainable things but it says theres a reason why they happen
i dont get what your talkin about
what was the reason
it didnt say
corey thinks trying to figure out the right way to express something
last night and right before the accident i saw
corey sighs and turns back to the screen
you already think im a freak show
as chris and corey are on the way out they notice jeremy frame at the counter checking out a stack of books
in putting them down he accidentally drops half of them onto the floor
he looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up and he scratches compulsively at his left forearm
chris and corey pull up to dustys auto repair shop in chris truck
they get out and start to walk up to the garage but theyre cut off by the unchained pit bull its growling and barking in a frenzy darielle
the dog heels at the sound of the voice and ruth bolts out of the house and takes her by the collar
shes got a bandage over a cut on her forehead
come to check on your car
hearts still thumping in their chests they follow ruth into the garage
coreys chevrolet is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day
the hood is propped open
randys been a wreck since the accident
he should be
he was driving around shit faced and somebody got killed
you can just fuck off
she gets right up in his face with such intensity that chris retreats a step or two
prima donna motherfucker think your shit dont stink
corey steps in shes right
chris gives her a look
i mean theres nothing randy couldve done
ruth turns and goes into the house through a garage entrance
ill get my dad
the door slams shut behind her and corey and chris glance at each other
momentarily dusty comes out a partially eaten sandwich in hand
got some bad news for you
he walks them over to the car finishing off his sandwich and wiping his hands on his greasy jeans
your engine seized up when your water pump blew
i need a new engine now
i can get one in there for you
cost you about fifteen hundred
coreys face drops
i dont have anywhere near that much money
thats probably as much as the cars worth
but i already ordered the water pump and ill have to get paid for my time
that comes to about three hundred total
i dont have that much either
dusty is perturbed
you think i do this for charity
you didnt do anything
whats she want a water pump for if she doesnt have an engine
i see how it is
couple a punks
you dont plan to pay what you owe you can get the hell off my property right now
corey glares at him furious but chris takes her by the arm
under her breath asshole
chris truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks
at the same time father homeijer and trudy come out of the front office carrying a collections jar
as they approach the truck chris slowly rolls down the window
were taking collections to help rebuild mount calvary after the tragic fire
any small amount you could manage would really help
father homeijer and trudy look over to corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them
god bless you
they turn and walk away and chris rolls his window back up
everybody wants somethin
what about you
what do you mean
you wouldnt give me stuff and drive me around if you didnt want something in return
cause thats just not how it works
maybe youre wrong about that
corey nods but still doesnt believe him
she gets out and chris eyes her as she walks to her room
corey lays on her stomach in bed her head buried in the philosophy of time travel book
the television is on in the b
out of focus playing a repeat of the foreman grill suddenly there is a slight tremor from outside and ripple runs over the tv screen
corey looks around taking no notice of the odd change on the television instead of george foremans voice hulk hogan is heard promoting the brand new hulkster grill
just then there is a knock at the door
she gets up to answer it and finds randy he looks distraught
do you hate me
you think its my fault shes dead
you mean it
it wasnt your fault
randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted
corey looks down and realizes that shes still holding the philosophy of time travel book in her hand
oh its just
something of sams
corey tosses the book onto the bed
you wanna get outta here for a while
i got my dads car
randys dads car navigates a dirt road up a wooded hill to a vantage point where the whole of el reno can be seen
sparse lights flicker over about square miles of civilization
there are a few other vehicles parked at the lookout most containing couples with music playing low
randy pulls into a more secluded clearing away from the other cars but still with a nice view
ive been comin up here since i was a kid
good place when you wanna just get away from everything
randy pushes in a tape suggestion river of deceit by mad season then takes a joint from his pocket and sparks it up
is ruth your girlfriend
randy passes the joint to corey and she hits it
naw were just friends
shes pretty weird sometimes
intense or something
seems like you guys are pretty close
dont worry about ruth
randy takes another hit and holds it in
do you ever have a hard time telling whats real and whats not real
randy exhales and looks over at her perplexed
sometimes something can feel really real but its just your mind playing tricks on you
ive got so much shit in my head right now
ive never felt so outta control
i think im really goin psycho
he passes her the joint
i got some acid from my buddy one time
this like flying eagle pyramid shit
i took two hits and man
next thing i knew i was on the floor curled up in ball and mike and jeff were just standing there lookin down at me
i could see this like glowing grid cutting through my brain and i knew when it got all the way through id be this sketched out vegetable
i could picture my dad staring down at me in the hospital in my straightjacket crying and shit
corey blows out a hit captivated
the whole time my esophagus was like twisting and turning in my throat and cutting off my air supply
it was terrible
i can still slip back into it sometimes but i know now that my brain is whats making it real
and thats like a blessing and a curse man cause that means you have to decide whats real and whats not
the things that feel the most real right now are
more like a dream
corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the cars ashtray
i know what you mean
the scariest part is thinking youre not the same person anymore
like your identity
what if the change is for the better
randy finds an inhaler in his pocket and takes a puff
thats fucked up
i dont think i even care if im crazy
corey turns and looks into his eyes
randy leans forward
theyre about to kiss when what the fuck
a dark shape scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the forest where theres a tarp some water bottles cans of food and a rifle
its vietnam tom and hes brought some supplies to his new that fucking guy again
randy and corey both laugh relieving the tension
but toms proximity has spoiled the mood
lets get outta here
mike jeff and ruth sit on a ratty couch in randys living room watching beavis and butt head on mtv
some empty beer cans and a homeade bong litter a coffee table
when the front door opens and corey and randy enter none of them budge
as corey and randy walk to randys bedroom ruth follows them with her eyes
randy shuts the door to his messy room
a tapestry hangs from the ceiling
corey is drawn to a desk next to the bed
above it is a death shrine to kurt cobain magazine cutouts posters and ticket stubs arranged decoratively
a large black white poster showing a close up of cobains face is the centerpiece and a sloppy bullet hole drawn in red marker marks the center of his forehead
the words im not afraid of dying are scrawled across the bottom of the poster in the same bright red
this is cool
randy puts his hands on her hips running them up her torso
corey turns to face him
and fall back onto the bed
a digital clock on randys desk shows am
theres a slight tremor and the numbers shift changing briefly to then back again to
corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare
she sits up and looks around remembering where she is
she discovers randy asleep by her side
she finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside the bed and grabs her shirt
after she pulls it on over her head she freezes because billy moorcroft is standing right there in his birthday hat staring at her
only one day left
corey turns and looks down to randy
hes still fast asleep
what am i supposed to do
as soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery liquid vector spear protruding from the center of her chest
billy is now gone but her spear beckons her out of the room elongating to illustrate her path
corey is in awe
her spear leads her through the living room and past the sleeping bodies of mike jeff and ruth
following her path leads her to step on ruths foot as she goes by
corey doesnt even notice but one of ruths eyes pop open as she treads out the door
corey follows billy who walks in the middle of the road about yards ahead of her
the residential street is guarded by great old trees on either side
the dark sky above starts to bend and warp and a buckle in space time materializes
theres a simultaneous flash of lighting and sharp crack of thunder and corey looks up to the vortex a massive swirling maelstrom gapes open like a tunnel to the inter
dimensional realm of darkest night
the void brightens and ominous storm clouds and torrential rains are visible within
corey peers up into the mouth of it and sees dustys house and auto repair shop being doused and beaten by the storm in contrast to the street all is
nearly silent in dustys garage
corey watches as billy moves along the perimeter without sound ghostly
jump cuts and time cuts
her chevrolet sits in the bay
some of the parts have already been harvested the catalytic converter sits next to it on the floor
corey approaches a utility sink next to a shower in the corner
you can do it
corey focuses on the sink and it begins to tremble
the pipes beneath it creak and moan
water starts to bubble up from the sink drain also in the shower
billy stands atop her car watching her
his perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile
the sink basin suddenly cracks from pressure
as corey stares into the drain
we plunge down into the pipe we travel through meters and meters of dank piping until we hit the water main
theres a sound like a tidal wave water pours out from under the garage door down to the street
pull back to reveal
the entire driveway and the street in front of the house are covered with water
fire trucks police cars and an ambulance are gathered in front of the property
ruth runs toward her house
when she turns a corner and it comes into view she stops dead in her tracks
her face shows sheer terror because her father dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by officer odell and another policeman officer hines
the pit bull struggles against its chain growling and barking frantically
and billy moorcroft half naked soaking wet and shivering is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by lucky i heard him screamin else he woulda drowned down there
ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a back door
she sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the stairs
without turning on the lights ruth desperately rifles through her closet until she finds a shoebox
inside it are several plastic bags some filled with marijuana others with cocaine
hands shaking ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and flushes it
the white powder disappears down the swirling but the bowl doesnt refill
she begins to stuff the other bags down her pants
having deposited dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut the door odells attention turns to an upstairs window of the house when he sees movement
randy rolls over in bed opening his eyes to the new day
he looks around for corey disappointed to find her gone
corey walks down an aisle of the department store
she finds chris assisting a customer
i just checked aisle three
at the front by the trapper keepers
the customer moves off and chris turns to find corey standing beside him
im outta cigarettes
corey waits behind the store until chris comes out
she eagerly accepts two packs
dya hear the news
they found that billy moorcroft kid
he was at dustys house
corey is floored
sick bastard had him locked up in the basement
i cant believe we were just over there yesterday
corey cant help it
a grin spreads across her face
i guess hes gonna be okay everythings gonna be okay
corey cuts him off and chris looks at her strangely
im not crazy
i think everythings gonna be okay
corey lays on her stomach in bed studying the philosophy of time travel
the book is open to chapter six the living receiver
the living receiver is chosen to guide the artifact into position for its journey back to the primary universe
no one knows how or why a receiver will be chosen
she flips through the onion skin pages to chapter ten the manipulated dead
the manipulated dead are more powerful than the living receiver
if a person dies within the tangent dimension they are able to contact the living receiver through the fourth dimensional construct
corey glances over at the closet mirror and sees billys image reflected
she flips over and finds him standing at the foot of the bed clad in the same garb as all her visions
i already saved you
its not over
he points to the closet mirror
she stares into her own reflection as billys disappears
her image starts to fade as well and then the surface of the mirror transforms into a three dimensional vision of a park
the focus is a swing set
and one of the swings in particular which rocks slowly back and forth
void of life
inside billy moorcrofts quaint sanitary looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return
streamers hang over a table supporting a partially eaten cake
a banner that reads welcome home billy
is draped across the archway connecting the dining room to the den
billys mother with her fair complexion and dark hair is an older female version of billy himself
as she brings a pot of coffee and a stack of cups into billys father billys aunt and uncle and a child psychologist who is moderating s male in the
den she looks as though shes barely keeping it together
between bites of cake the place for billy to be right now is at home with his family
billys mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down
oh thank you
the psychologist accepts a cup
itll take years for him to work through what happened but the best way to open those doors is to surround him with things that are familiar
billys mother passes her husband a cup and they hold a long painful moment of eye contact
billy sits at a table in the sunny hexagonal room
he wears the birthday hat slacks and collared shirt
he appears clean and groomed but his face and neck are marred by bruises and other abrasions
before him is a packet of colored pencils and some sheets of paper
his mother walks up behind him and peeks over his shoulder at the drawing that hes working on
are you sure you dont want some more cake
his mother caresses his head as she watches him color
after a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention
i before she can go on shes interrupted by the doorbell
billy never looks up
billys father answers the door and finds corey
only family and close friends are welcome here today
billys mother hovers behind her husband curious about and wary of the stranger
i just wanted to say that im sorry about everything that happened to billy
and i know it doesnt seem like it but everything happens for a reason
and itll all work out in the end
billys father stares her down until she turns to leave uncomfortably
billys mother starts to cry
cut back to the breakfast nook
billy is gone
left on the table is his completed drawing
its a neatly executed rendition of a swing set identical to the one from coreys vision in the closet door mirror
billy walks through the empty park still wearing his birthday hat
he makes his way past a sand pit with a jungle balanced on one of the jungle gyms bars is a prescription billy picks it up
the name on the prescription is corey the swing set
billy leans back as far as he can as momentum propels his body forward and back through space
he looks up to the sky where supernatural black clouds are forming
he swings back and forth
back and forth
corey sits nearby on a park bench watching billy
he looks back at her showing no signs of recognition
jump cut to the swing
no longer a little boy sitting in it
it dangles erratically from the ropes still gripped by inertia
pan down to the sandy ground below find the bottle of pills now empty
billys unmoving open hand
a tractor trailer truck gets off the highway and heads into el reno
its load is a batch of beat up old cars
the jalopy is on the top rack closest to the end
randy peeks in the window of coreys motel room but sees nothing
he pounds on the door and calls for her corey
corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took place
the black clouds overhead have become more vast and oppressive
a cold wind blows
the tractor trailer truck breaches the crest of a hill and comes into view descending on the intersection
above it the clouds begin to transform and take the shape of an astronomical wormhole that reaches down toward the earth
chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky
as the tractor trailer truck approaches the intersection corey fixates on the jalopy on the back
the chains that hold the junker in place shake and rattle
we plunge through the portal as it twists through the ether
the wormhole extends down to the jalopy
like an eel moving through water confidently pursuing its prey
mouth widening to swallow
corey is riveted
as it passes through the intersection the tractor trailer hits a pothole cut to
sam is walking in front of the department store when randys car pulls up beside her
corey sticks her head out the passenger side window
what happened to you
what happened to me
where the hellve you been
i crashed at randys
we just got food
want a burger
my stomachs fucked up
jeff and mike taunt her from the back
we gotta talk about what were gonna do
dont worry about it so much
the motel guy came to the room this i dont give a fuck
i said i
she annunciates every word like a true bitch
im tired of listening to you whine about everything
giggles from the peanut gallery in the car
corey youre still drunk
dont be a fuck ass
did she just call her a fuck ass
whats a fuck ass
everyone cracks up including corey
sam is humiliated
she backs away from the car anger burning in her eyes
randy revs the engine expressing his will to take off
see ya later sam
sam says nothing but watches as randys car peels off toward the intersection
shes confused and hurt frozen to the spot where shes standing
as corey stares back at sam from the car her smile fades
corey turns to face the approaching intersection
chris is at work stocking shelves inside the department store
he checks his watch stops what hes doing and grabs a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket time for a smoke break
randys car is stopped at the red light
sam strolls toward it ever so slowly
jeff mike and ruth gawk at her from the backseat
she slows down even more having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery
the light turns green and randys car peels across the intersection making a left
sams still or feet away from stepping into the street
she quickens her pace almost there when randys car
he jerks the wheel and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side completely smashing it in sam spins when she hears the deafening crunch
randy careens into the opposite lane and an oncoming car smacks him dead on
the inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a fire hydrant by the side of the road
the hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and skitters harmlessly across the intersection the world goes silent
sam signs her statement on officer odells desk her eyes red and puffy from crying
odell sits facing her
i just gotta ask you one more time
youre sure you didnt see a driver
sam shakes her head no and he takes the statement from her
well well find him one way or another
sam nods in acknowledgement
odell sees how much this has traumatized her
why dont you stop in and see dr
peters on your way out
right down the hall there
shell give you somethin to make you feel better
sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the secluded back parking lot
she holds a prescription for anti depressants
a pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by its vietnam tom
hes wearing his ski mask and hes got his rifle
he sees sam but she doesnt see him
sam wells up with emotion about to breakdown and tom watches her with empathy
it looks as though hes about to go to her when something stops him chris comes out the door
sam is still too choked up to speak
tom sneaks away unnoticed
sam sits in the passenger side of chris truck and cries and cries
major emotional release
chris looks like he wants to say something but doesnt have the words
chris and sam pull up to the motel in his pick up
theyve gone to get her prescription filled and sam has the bottle of pills in her hand
im really sorry sam
she doesnt respond
but sometimes these things can happen for a reason
sometimes good can come of it
growth ya know
what the fuck are you talking about
sams benumbed expression doesnt change but her tone is caustic
all i meant was sometimes i know what you meant and its bullshit
when someone dies for no reason you cant just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better
it sucks and it fucks everything up but it doesnt mean shit beyond that
im sorry i youve obviously never lost anybody like i have cause if you did youd already know that
chris doesnt try anymore
sam immediately feels bad
thanks for the ride
she gets out of the car and slogs toward her room
sam swallows her pills with some water and sits down on one of the full size beds by her backpack
she reaches inside and pulls out the philosophy of time travel book by roberta sparrow
as she studies the cover her image is reflected by the closet door mirrors
the angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room
and sams reflection is present in both of the panes
the digital clock radio shows pm
she looks at the pictures of her family tucked away inside the book sam with her mother and father sam as a child with her sister and brother an old
photo of the whole darko family together
tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of donnie and she puts them all down
she touches the scar on the inner part of her right wrist
she then glances down and notices that the book is open to remnants
a portion of the text includes like dreams that the manipulated can have after journeys into tangent or fragmentary universes sounds and images may be transferred from one tangent or
fragmentary universe to another as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes
sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her hooded sweatshirt and jeans with the makeshift bandage wrapped around her right hand
the shard of metal protrudes from the gash by her temple
she sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent destiny plane
dead cars machinery and piles of scrap metal glow as stationary objects within the complex grid
a pair of rats follow their vector spears as they shimmy up the side of a sam treads effortlessly through the darkness past the heaps of junk toward the decrepit
storage shack marked by the she stands before the shack having discovered vietnam tom
he squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask
he wears on his face the sculpture made of scrap metal which has been formed into the countenance of the monster bunny
i like your new mask
tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as sam runs her fingers down one of the long metallic ears down to one of the sharpened incisors of the evil
are you scared
as this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent and the neurons in toms brain can be seen sending electric impulses in turn releasing neurotransmitters and exciting other neurons
i know you can hear me
a portal forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder enclosing them
tom rises afraid
sam takes his hand
the portal shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend inward then begin to creak and rumble sam awakens to a fierce rumbling overhead
it happens again and when she looks around she realizes that shes underneath a highway overpass in boxer shorts and a t shirt barefoot lying on a flat area atop
the cement slope that leads down to the road below
alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current position she shifts her body and starts to slide down the once on even ground she notices a brand new
bmw coming toward her
jeremy pulls up next to her and rolls down his window
are you okay
what are doing
yeah im okay
jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder
you shouldnt be out here like this
cmon get in
she allows herself to be led to the passenger side
sam leans her head back against the headrest as jeremy drives
you do that a lot
i think its genetic or something
ive never heard of a specific genetic marker for sleepwalking
its just that my brother used to do it too
he doesnt anymore
i think its more common in children
when did your brother stop
when he died
some workers are in the process of rebuilding the windmill
a man with a hose sprays the side of the water tank in an attempt to wash off the burn marks resembling the nearly imperceptible image of the monster bunnys
jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot
sam hesitates for a moment before getting out
i heard about your friend
sam doesnt say anything so he goes on
i wasnt gonna say anything
but then i thought i probably should because if i didnt it might be inconsiderate
what are you gonna do
i dont know yet
sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face still not wanting to go inside the motel room
do you believe that everything happens for a reason
i know that for every action theres an equal and opposite reaction
i learned that in science
and everything in the universe is in constant motion as the universe is constantly expanding
yeah but do you believe that everything happens for a reason like in life
you mean like destiny
jeremy thinks on this for a moment
i think everyone has a purpose
something theyre meant to do
like potential but more clear cut
for instance i was destined to get my hands on the meteorite
im making amazing discoveries every day practically sleeping at the lab
while he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm
it draws sams attention away from what hes saying
im still doing some tests but theres a metallic substance thats not showing up on the elemental what happened to your arm
jeremy stops scratching
a small area on the inner part of his wrist is raw and red partially scabbed over
its just a rash
sam starts to get out of the car
he offers her a wad of cash
i know you need it
its no big deal
she accepts the money
sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial dryer
she plugs in some quarters presses the button and sits back in a chair in front of the machine
as she stares into the whirling cylinder her eyes defocus and she goes into a daze
transition to ariel the stuffed toy unicorn spins on a rotating chair
the last unicorn by samantha darko
give it back
there was once a unicorn named ariel
the sound of crinkling paper
you wrinkled it
its not wrinkled sam
just ya know flatten it in a book or something
the chair is re spun by an o
and the unicorn topples off onto the floor
back to sam snaps out of her vision when she hears trudy and father homeijer going around asking for change
any small amount you could manage would really help
they hover over a fat man holding out the collections jar
god bless you
as they move down the line and approach sam she tenses up
trudy is about to go into her spiel when she recognizes her
she smiles at sam politely trying not to be too awkward
it doesnt work
aware of sams financial situation she gives father homeijer the hint to move on
he follows her lead
to sam god bless you
sam watches as they move on to the next person suddenly filled with sadness
sam stands outside at a payphone listening to it ring
someone on the other end finally picks up hello
when sam hears her mothers voice it brings tears to her eyes
as if feeling her emotion over the phone line rose can be heard starting to whimper
in the background who is it rose
is that you
if its you please come home
although it looks like she wants to sam doesnt speak
vietnam tom sits at his new squatting ground looking out over all of el reno
he peers at the twinkling lights through his scrap metal bunny mask and cradles his rifle in his arms like a soldier at rest
he slowly turns and sees that sam is sitting right next to him facing the landscape
she wears her hooded sweatshirt jeans and the bandage
the shard of metal is lodged in her forehead
you wanna know what happens when you die
tom shakes his head no
i wish it was me
she looks at tom
i really want
tom aims his gun at her face
he realizes that a force field has formed in between them because when the barrel of the gun touches it the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque
sam is expressionless
toms finger trembles as he places it on the trigger
he aims down the guns sights directly at sams right eye and sees a phosphorescent grid take shape like a coordinate system on the force field
sams eye is in the central tom pulls the trigger
time slows down
a liquid vector spear shoots out of the gun barrel
immediately after a bullet is discharged and follows it
the vector spear passes cleanly through the grid but when the bullet reaches it the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force
the spear juts out until it nearly touches sams eye
but then it stops
the bullet catches up and freezes at the same spot centimeters from her face
a hand bangs on the door to room
after a beat sam opens it
shes got some makeup on and has spent more time on her hair than usual
chris lingers in front of the door looking slightly uncomfortable
i just stopped by to see how you were holdin up
sorry about the other night
i i was just upset
i shouldnt have snapped at you like that
chris nods grateful for her forgiveness
so what are you still doin here
i figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now
im gonna be taking off soon i think
i just gotta figure some stuff out
its quiet here
i dont know if youre doin anything later on but
he trails off when he hears a car pull up and park by his truck
he turns and sees that its jeremy in his bmw
i was just on my way out
what were you gonna say
ill see you later
he steps out of the way so sam can shut and lock the door
chris stares down jeremy as sam gets into his car and they drive off together
jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab
there are rows of desks with microscopes and some precision as he walks to a desk near the back he can barely contain his excitement
sam follows taking note of a large rabbit in an extremely small cage
heres my station
he unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a box containing a tiny slice of rock with a grid like pattern of metallic crystals embedded
the rest is locked away somewhere else
everyones gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon
he takes it over to an scanning electron microscope and turns it on
he places the meteorite slice in the microscopes vacuum column through an airtight door
you ever seen one of these
its a scanning electron microscope
it uses electrons instead of light to scan the image
a black white image appears on the microscopes monitor its a geometric collage of all shapes and shades
at first i thought it was a siderite but then i saw it was more than that
it does have a percentage of nickel and iron in it as i first suspected
but it also has something else
he waits for sam to take the bait
and whats that
he points to cluster of bright whites on the monitor
their shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding them
an unrecognizable element
ive done all the tests
it doesnt exist on the periodic table
jeremy is practically beaming
so this is pretty major
this is history
im thinking of calling it framium
for my last name
what if its like
proof of some alien life form from another galaxy or something
jeremys tone becomes serious and he starts to scratch at his left forearm as he talks
its very important you promise me you wont tell anyone else what ive showed you
i have to wait till just the right moment
nasa or some secret government organization could come in here and take it away from me
as jeremy gets more worked up he scratches harder
and then later on years from now take credit for the discovery themselves
i wont say anything
sam stares at him for a long beat as if examining him
theres this book i think youd like
i got it from my physics teacher in high school
the study of physics has unraveled some of the most profound mysteries of the universe
its called the philosophy of time travel
yeah but its not really that
its more like one scenario or one type of scenario
i dont completely understand it
sam gazes at the cluster of white shapes on the monitor
what do you mean
my life seems to be full of them
mysteries are what make life interesting
sam doesnt agree or disagree
shes become tense because jeremys face is now in close proximity to hers
youre a mystery to me samantha
he goes in for a kiss but sam gently pushes him away
jeremy retreats shielding his left arm
sam looks down and sees that the red raw area has turned into a much bigger rash covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto his forearm
that doesnt look good
i should get some hydrocortisone
he looks pathetic and sam feels sorry for him
regarding the attempted sorry about that
i shouldve know better
you barely know me right
and nobody really calls my samantha
just my mom and dad
jeremy manages a smile and sam smiles back
chris is at work stocking shelves inside the department store
he checks his watch stops what hes doing and grabs a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket time for a smoke break
the tractor trailer truck carrying the jalopy breaches the crest of the hill descending on the intersection
chris lights up a cigarette
he watches as the tractor trailer hits the pothole but passes safely through the intersection making a right
something about the sight of this strikes chris so much that his cigarette falls out of his mouth
father homeijer and trudy stroll down a quiet street with their collections jar and arrive at a fork in the road
you take this street ill take that one
without warning trudy kisses him on the cheek
father homeijer blushes but trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner
they move off in separate directions
father homeijer raps on the door of dustys house
the priest lets himself into the garage which is open but deserted
he notices coreys chevrolet
he steps up to the garage entrance and knocks
no one comes to the door but he notices that its slightly ajar
he can hear country music playing low within
are you home son
he lets himself inside
father homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen
the sink is full of dirty dishes
a coating of grime over everything
the sleeping pit bull stirs
the priest sees that the country song is coming from a stereo that sits on the kitchen counter
calling out dusty
id like to trouble you for a small donation
the country song comes to a close and the tape runs out
with the music gone the priest cocks his head to a new sound soft distant crying
he looks curiously toward the cellar door
note the crying sound should be identical to the one that drew corey out of the motel room
father homeijer slowly descends the rickety basement steps
at the bottom he finds a string that connects to a bare overhead bulb
he creeps along the dusty cement floor past an old washer dryer continuing toward the source of the crying which has become more pronounced
he wrinkles his nose at a foul smell
he rounds a corner and when he sees billy moorcroft hes nearly frozen in shock the boy is locked inside a large metal dogs cage
he sits on the floor of the cage rocking back and forth
he is pale bruised and slick with sweat clothed only in a pair of soiled briefs
beside him is an aluminum water bowl and some scraps of white bread
the floor beneath him is soaked with urine and scattered feces
father homeijer makes the sign of the cross
dustys place is surrounded by fire trucks police cars and an ambulance
billy moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by paramedics
father homeijer stands near the boy being interviewed by a dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by officer odell and another policeman officer get
in there you sick fuck
dusty says nothing as odell shoves him in and slams the door
the two officers turn when they see randys dads car pull up next to the property
randy is in the drivers seat looking confused
ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts toward the house but she is cut off and grabbed by a policeman
another officer goes to talk to randy in the car
wheels turning odell addresses hines regarding dusty let him rot in there for a few minutes maybe till the news guys show up
im gonna go finish checkin upstairs
odell lets himself into ruths bedroom
its a mess her clothes are all over the floor and crinkled rock posters litter the walls
next to her bed is a framed picture of she and randy
odell starts to rifle through her desk drawers one after another he tosses the closet throwing out clothes and shoes
until he finds the shoebox
he opens it up satisfied
officer hines stands by the door looking in at odell covertly
sam lies in bed in front of the television
a news bulletin comes on about billys moorcrofts rescue we have an update this morning on our breaking news of billy moorcroft the el reno youth who was kidnapped over
months ago and rescued yesterday afternoon by father homeijer of mount calvary church
billys condition at this time is considered stable
sam stares at the television dumbfounded
the news cuts to the scene of the rescue where father homeijer is being father what led you to this particular house on this particular day
i was out collecting donations in order to help rebuild my church mount calvary which recently burned down
clearly the lord works in mysterious ways
this is nothing less than divine intervention
as sams walking away from the motel she looks up to the sky at a passing jet
no matter how well you think you know somebody you just never really know
sam sits at the booth where she and corey sat before and agatha sets down a glass of orange juice
dusty gibbens has been comin in here for coffee ever since i can remember
gives me the shivers
ted pipes up from behind the counter they should hang guys like that
only thing bothers me is how many of em are still out there
chris enters the diner and catches the end of teds rant
hang em all
to sam ill be right back with your breakfast
as agatha moves off chris sees sam and approaches her table
i guess you heard
its so messed up
i feel bad that i recommended him now
agatha notices that chris has sat down with sam
what can i get you honey
sausage eggs coffee please
white or wheat
wheat toast please
he refocuses his attention back on sam
if i had kids id be worried sick about em in a world like this
im sure your parents must be
hey you couldve been some crazy rapist serial killer
agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this last part
she gives chris and sam each an odd look before setting the coffee down and leaving
you turned out okay
yeah but everybody doesnt
i can take care of myself
im sure you can
but i wouldnt feel right if i didnt tell you about jeremy
what about him
i dont know what you have goin with him
but you shouldnt be hangin around him
lets just leave it at that
what makes you think you can tell me who i can and cant hang around with
its just that i know him better than you do
he lived in my neighborhood when we were kids
so he used to do weird stuff
sam waits for him to go on
my sister lost her pet rabbit once and we went all over the neighborhood lookin for it
we were just about to call it quits when we heard something comin from jeremys garage
hed stuck it in a trash can and put the lid on
sam looks shocked and a little disgusted
it was half starved by the time we got it home
died just a few days later
how old was he
i dont know just a couple years
cute little black and white no
he was like nine probably
he was just a kid he didnt know what he was doing
when you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there
sams had enough
youre a nice guy but you dont have to be looking out for me
youre not my dad youre not my big brother
chris hangs his head frustrated
odell stands at the bars of dustys jail cell
dusty lies on his cot and stares up at the ceiling
you know what they do to faggot ass perverts like you in maximum security dontcha
odell chuckles enjoying this immensely
disgusting fuckin piece a shit like you
odell now dressed in plainclothes is on the way to his car in the far corner of the back lot
he hears someone come out the door behind him but doesnt turn until he hears his hey odell
im on my way out
what do you need
hines catches up with him and they walk and talk
im not gonna bullshit ya
i saw you snatch the drugs outta that house
odells face grows cold but he doesnt slow his pace
i dont think i know what the hell youre talkin about
dont bullshit me either
hines grabs his shoulder to stop him
odell eyes his hand
i dont wanna turn you in
then what do you want
how much you think youll get when you unload it
odell keeps cool but resents being muscled
ill take forty percent this time but from now on its fifty fifty
what do you mean from now on
i got a pretty good idea this aint the first time you done this
wont be the last will it
hines extends his hand and smiles
odell shakes it
after hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house odell kicks the ground angrily
when he looks up hes startled by a pair of eyes that peer from the bushes nearby
upon closer inspection he sees that its vietnam tom in his ski mask
nervous about how much hes heard odell takes an aggressive stance
come on outta there
he becomes tense when tom emerges because he sees that hes got his rifle
what the fuck you doin carryin that around in the town proper
odell realizes that hes not holding it in a threatening manner but cradling it in his arms
hand it over
tom steps toward him ever so slowly
odell reaches out and tom hands him the gun stock first
i should arrest you and throw you in jail you know that
tom looks at the ground hunched over meekly
get the fuck outta my sight
odell looks around as tom shuffles off making sure no one witnessed the transaction
sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point carrying the philosophy of time travel book
its quiet and peaceful and everythings bathed in golden light
she comes upon toms new squatting ground in a secluded area near the lookout and looks around before approaching
when she sees the handmade bunny mask lying among his things she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up
she runs her fingers down the long shiny ears nose and jagged teeth
she doesnt realize that tom is standing close behind her
when she senses his presence shes startled
she sets the bunny mask down where she found it
tom says nothing
he seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her there
he walks up beside her and sits facing the view
after a long beat sam sits down beside him
to her surprise tom begins to speak my mom told me someday everybody would understand
she said it was my job to look out for the town
so thats what i do
thats what i always do
sam listens to him intently
they dont know why
they dont even want me here but i still have to protect them
theyre lucky to have someone to protect them
im used to it
im lucky to have a job to do
some people dont have any reason to be here at all
i know what you mean
tom turns and looks at her strangely
youre more important than all of us
sam peers into toms pale blue eyes through his ski mask
without knowing why she reaches out and touches the mask
when she starts to pull it off tom grabs her hand stopping her not too rough but forceful
sams scared for a moment but tom lets her go
his eyes drift down to the philosophy of time travel book by her side
sam sees him staring so she picks it up and hands it to him
when tom sees the cover his cold eyes are filled with emotion
sam sees how struck he is but doesnt understand
do you like to read
tom says nothing
you can borrow it
again tom does not speak
after a beat sam gets up slowly and walks away leaving tom with the book
jeremy is at the department store in the first aid section picking out some gauze and disinfectant
when he looks down the aisle and sees sam he moves toward her quickly
he disturbs her while shes looking at some feminine hygiene sam
when he sees the items that shes shopping for he seems much more embarrassed than she does
oh hi jeremy
thats okay whats up
just that i havent see you around for the past few days
i was worried
i thought you mightve taken off
ive been around
going for lots of walks
i stopped by the motel
sam finds his manner a bit odd
like i said ive been in and out
well theres something i wanted to ask you
you know that book you mentioned
id really love to check it out
sams face darkens and jeremy picks up on it
you said youd show it to me sometime and ive got a hunch it could really help me in some of my studies related to i dont have it anymore
i kind of
gave it to someone
forgot that i said you could borrow it and this what guy
that vietnam tom guy
jeremy is furious
you gave away the book to vietnam tom
sam backs away from him
hes getting louder and out of control
i dont fucking believe what youre telling me
its just a book
hes a fucking bum
and you chose him over me
i just suddenly a hand comes down on jeremys shoulder
he turns and finds chris standing behind him
sam is relieved
jeremy glares at chris
this is none of your business
it is actually
youre disturbing my customers
jeremy brushes past sam as he leaves and she and chris are left alone
theres a definite i told you so aura
you didnt have to do that
just doin my job
sam starts to walk away at first forgetting the products she needed
she comes back to get them slightly flustered
chris turns and leaves her in peace
as hes walking away youre welcome
father homeijer and trudy are sitting on the couch in the living room of his quaint house sharing a bottle of i never had any doubts in you or in
i know that
and we both truly appreciate all your faith and hard work
they sip their champagne
we needed a miracle but we got two instead
trudy grabs the bottle and tries to refill his glass but the priest puts his hand over it
i think ive had enough
one more glass wont hurt you
you deserve it father
odells car pulls up to an old warehouse and parks
where the hell are they
hines is nervous
he lights a cigarette
theyll be here
just take it easy
tom wears his metal bunny mask
sam wears her hooded sweatshirt and jeans and her right hand is bandaged
the metal shard is embedded under the skin of her forehead
they move slowly and methodically until they reach the center of the empty lot
there are lights on in the closed department store but the parking lot is mostly dark
why do you talk to me
toms voice is muffled behind his mask
same reason you talk to me
tom cocks his head unsure of the answer
because i can see how special you are
why cant other people
only one day left
they both turn toward an area in the lot where the shopping carts are stored
the metal storage rack starts to tremble and burn with cosmic energy
father homeijer finishes his glass of champagne
trudy is already done with hers and she takes his glass and sets it on the coffee table
she moves closer to him on the couch
she puts her hand on his leg
i see the way you look at me father
she moves in closer
he looks uncomfortable
i want you too
shes about to kiss him but father homeijer stops her
i cant do this
im a man of the cloth
and youd regret it
he takes her by the hand reminding her of the wedding band on her finger
shopping carts start to roll out of the rack by themselves following their own liquid vector spears
tom stands staring at them
he is flanked by sam
officer hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the warehouse and unzips his pants
with gloved hands odell grabs vietnam toms rifle out of the trunk
trudys head is buried in her hands and she bawls
i feel like such an idiot
father homeijer doesnt know what to say
hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open from the side of the building
odell is waiting for him
what the fuck odell shoots him in the chest
he is cool and calm
he throws the rifle down on the ground
the shopping carts whirl in an circle of ever increasing speed around vietnam tom and sam
the rubber wheels squeal on the cement until they start to melt
the vector spears lead the carts in a spiral that hones in closer and closer to the two of them
sam is stoic
tom is in awe
we travel at breath taking speed through a portal as it weaves through millions of stars then an atmospheric when it looks like theyll be crushed by the scudding metal
or combusted by the cosmic energy the worm like portal from the sky reaches down and encloses tom and sam like a vacuum
theres a brilliant flash of light transition to chris truck pulls into the lot early in the morning and he gets out wearing his work uniform
still groggy hes about to walk into the store when something catches his eye
crane up to find a structure made of all the shopping carts as chilling and impressive as a crop circle in the shape of an immense fibonacci spiral
the metal of the carts has been fused together and theyre stacked in an ascending manner that reaches an apex in the center like a cone
chris is mystified
cut to two police cruisers speed down a street in town
cops including officer odell converge on vietnam tom in the park where he sits on the swing in his ski mask
get down on the ground
tom looks up at them calmly without fear
get down on the ground now
he obeys them and two cops jump on him and put him in cuffs
one of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask toms face is a mass of scars
both his cheeks forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long deep gashes
odell looks into his sad blue eyes
tom is slammed against a table
an officer takes his hand roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his prints jump cut to name
tom stands for his booking photos jump cut to getting angry whats your name
the policeman stands over vietnam tom who sits defeated in a chair
a young officer approaches
we found this on him
he passes the policeman a set of dog tags on a chain
the name on the tags is thomas ward sparrow
sam walks toward the motel wearing jeans and a t shirt
when she sees jeremys bmw parked in the lot she stops short
but its too late hes already seen her and is getting out of the car
hes got a bouquet of flowers
he passes her the flowers
i hope you can forgive the way i acted
that was pretty weird
jeremy is awkward and shy
ive been so wrapped up with the meteorite
i havent been eating or sleeping much
i think im just drained
but thats no excuse
i was wondering if youd let me make it up to you
you dont need to please
let me take you to watch the fireworks tonight
i dont think so
its gonna be spectacular
theres gonna be a meteor shower that coincides with the show
i mean how often does that happen
sam still isnt sure
i just wanna be your friend
i was supposed to see em with chris but
hes stuck at work
so what do you say
will you go with me
gimme a sec
lemme grab my sweatshirt
chris is in the department store parking lot with a crew of employees
they work together to pry apart the numerous shopping carts with crowbars
theyve made some progress but still a long way to go
chris is distracted by jeremys bmw as it cruises through the nearby intersection
after it passes chris looks up at some ominous clouds congregating in the darkening sky
from the clouds above the store pan down to find the lookout and jeremys car riding up the hill
there are other cars parked to watch the upcoming display but jeremy drives to a more secluded area
music suggestion th of july by soundgarden
jeremy spreads a blanket on the ground of a private grove
he wears a light jacket and sets down a grocery bag
sam has her hooded sweatshirt tied around her waist
shouldnt we go back out there where we can see
no thisll be perfect
see right there
he points to an area near the tops of the trees
thats right where the fireworksll come up
and we can see the meteors better without all the lights from the town
sam sits down on the blanket and checks her watch
jeremy pokes around in the grocery bag
so whats in the bag
sam takes her hooded sweatshirt from around her waist and puts it on to fight the cold
sam spots a meteor as it streaks across the sky jeremys hand holds a flaring roman candle here it goes
a sparkling green ball shoots out of the stick into the air
sam looks up at it and smiles
jeremy shoots off colorful ball after ball aiming in different directions
after his stick fizzles out you wanna try one
he grabs another out of the grocery bag and sam gets up slowly
he passes her the roman candle and she accepts it with her right hand
just hold it straight up
sam holds it and jeremy flicks his lighter
the wick catches
sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as possible
she closes her eyes
but the wick burns down extremely fast
the first ball gets stuck at the top and implodes causing the whole thing to catch fire
he runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can
fucking faulty one
sam nurses her burned hand
are you okay
i think so
jeremy inspects her hand theres a large blister
you need to get that covered
jeremy takes off his jacket
he then removes his t shirt and starts to tear off a piece
what are you doing
the bank sign shows pm
the display flashes to july
it changes to the countdown days hours jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his t shirt around sams hand creating the makeshift bandage
hows it feel
a little better
the fireworks suddenly begin and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright multi colored lights
sporadic meteors rain down at the same time
after a beat sam looks over at jeremy
the fireworks illuminate his torso and she is appalled to see that the raw reddish rash has spread to cover the greater part of it
jeremy looks down as if hed forgotten then quickly picks up his jacket and puts it back on
is that from the meteorite
i barely even notice it anymore
im sure itll go away soon
he zips up his jacket tight
are you fucking kidding me
do you think im disgusting
the question takes sam by surprise
i just think you should get it looked at before sam can finish jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss
sam shoves him away sharply
what the hell are you doing
so you do find me disgusting
which is it sam i cant take much more of this shit
he tries to grab her but sam turns and runs come here
sam tears through the woods jeremy close behind her
the fireworks crack and pop in the sky above
sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark
jeremy hits it dead on with his shins and goes head over heels he picks himself up and charges even faster tom sits alone in his jail cell morose staring
at the floor
he looks up when he senses someone approaching
sam sprints by the area of vietnam toms squatting ground
fireworks continue to explode and shower overhead and some people can be heard laughing and shouting from the main parking area not far away
sam runs toward the voices but jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around
why are you doing this
i just wanna talk to you
she struggles against his grip
the explosions and the ruckus from crowd mask their noise
sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin
he starts to double over but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face fucking bitch
sam is stunned and jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard sam stumbles backwards and falls cracking her head on the metal bunny mask
she rolls over onto her back revealing the shard of metal that protrudes from the gash by her temple
she struggles no more
tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches
chris and the other employees stop working and look up at the sky now roiling with sinister supernatural clouds
jeremy slowly creeps to where sam lies
her eyes are open and she is completely still
jeremy crouches beside her and when he puts two fingers to her neck to feel for a pulse he starts to tremble
the raining meteors and fireworks illuminate the smoke and the black clouds overhead
vietnam tom walks up to the cell bars
he comes face to face with sam
she stares back at him through the bars from the other side
she wears her hooded sweatshirt and the bandage
light glints off the metal lodged in her head wound
jeremy speeds frantically down the hill away from the parking area and the continuing fireworks display
tears stream down his cheeks
he cuts the wheel when a pair of headlights blind him and a vehicle cuts him off
his car skids out and he sees its chris truck that has almost hit him
chris jumps out yanks open jeremys door and grabs him by the shirt collar
he yells over the fireworks where the hell is sam
i dont know
i dont know
jeremy stomps on the gas pedal and chris is forced to unhand him as his bmw navigates around the truck and barrels down the hill
as chris approaches vietnam toms squatting ground the fireworks display is in the midst of the grande finale
showers of light burst and crackle in steady succession
people scream in approval from the parking area nearby
chris comes upon sams lifeless form
he stoops by her picks her up and hugs her limp body close
as he does this vietnam tom approaches from behind him
chris turns to face him but says nothing still holding sam
the wind picks up and blows in gusts around them
tom looks down at the two of them for a moment then reaches down and picks up his bunny mask
the evil grin is red with sams blood and one of the teeth is missing
the last of the fireworks display occurs leaving the night full of smoke hellish clouds and an increasing number of bright tailed meteors the apocalypse
amongst the churning clouds a tornado like portal cuts through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town
its swirling and vast stretching down from limitless space
tom puts on the bunny mask
and focuses on a single meteor that plummets toward the yawning vortex using telekinetic power to guide it
the meteor blazes through the wormhole the clock on the bank sign shows am then flashes to june
it changes again this time to a countdown to the july th fireworks celebration days hours
sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare
she lies atop the blankets wearing a t shirt and boxer shorts
she looks over and sees corey passed out on the other full size bed
two plastic cups empty soda cans and the bottle are on the nightstand between them the liquor partially consumed
the clock radio reads am
vietnam tom sits atop the platform more than feet up wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle
the surface of the platform is littered with tattered clothing a water bottle cans of food and scraps of a tarp
relaxed and at peace tom looks up to the clear night sky
as a tremor starts to build he takes off his ski mask and gazes out over his town
suddenly theres a brilliant flash of green light deafening thunder a blinding explosion cut to dusty sits and stares at his cellar door
trudy holds a picture of father homeijer and cries
ruth snorts some coke in her room
jeremy scratches his left forearm in his sleep
billy moorcroft shivers from the chill in his cage
officer odell sits alone in his patrol car fingering the trigger of his pistol
transition to where the towering windmill once stood is now only a crater about feet deep and feet in diameter with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere
ground water spurts from the broken well seal
a cantaloupe sized meteorite sits in the center of the crater
two firemen haul out the meteorite as sam and odell arrive on the scene
there are paramedics a coroner and other policemen there as well and a large area has been cordoned off with police tape
corey is there looking on as well as chris holt phil coulter and other local citizens
toms remains are carried off in a black bag
oh my god
sam moves to stand by corey
the overall mood is grim and frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face
i dont believe it
the firemen drop the porous misshapen clod by his feet
this is just a tragedy
officer odell steps up beside him and kicks the meteorite with his boot
sell that thing off to some meteorologist nerd club i bet you could do okay
do i look like the type of guy thats gonna try and profit off another mans death
you should be ashamed of yourself
i was just sayin
sam looks down on the ground and sees toms multi colored ski she picks it up
what are you doing
as she caresses the fibers with her fingers she is filled with unwarranted emotion
sam and corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that chris has followed them
so you guys stayed here last night
one of us did
sam gives corey a look
chris decides to ignore the comment
whats up with your car
its gonna take a couple days
for a water pump
sam and corey shrug
its none of my business but
hes distracted when jeremys bmw pulls up and parks
he hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site
chris regains his train of thought i was just gonna say if you wanted i could give you a ride back
he looks right at sam when he says this
he then glances over at corey as if just remembering that she were there
i mean i could give you both a ride
to middlesex virginia
do you ill go
i think i wanna go
things get a little tough youre just gonna give up
its not like that
you should come too
ill wait for my car and stick to the plan
do whatever the fuck you want
corey turns and goes inside the room
sam looks back to chris who is uncomfortable for causing the conflict
sorry to screw you guys up
she can take care of herself
shes good at it
ive gotta go home
the meteorite sits in a dark corner of the barn collecting dust
sam leans her head against the window of chris truck as they cruise along the highway
she gazes up at the bright open sky
