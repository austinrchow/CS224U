href b b by john sayles two men in shorts and hawaiian shirts are poking around a sandy section in the middle of scrub flats
sergeant cliff potts is in the f
a plant and tree guidebook in hand as sergeant mikey hogan works a metal detector over a large sandy bank in the b
both are army career men with a morning off to pursue their hobbies
we got ocotillo devils walking stick whats this stuff its that whattayoucallit horse crippler
mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand putting it in a canvas bag slung on his hip
this place is a gold mine
mikey sees that cliff is talking pulls his headset off
its a lead mine
i dont know why im talking to you youve got that thing on your head
you finding lots of cactus and shit
its not just cactus
theres the nopals the yuccas puts headset on looks like a lot of cactus to me
grumbles man knows a hundred fifty varieties of beer he cant tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear
troubled cliff you live in a place you should know something about it
explore cliff mikey in the f
now looking down at something as he pulls his headset off again cliff you gotta look at this cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b
dont tell me spanish treasure right
pieces of eight from the coronado expedition he stops by mikey and looks down his expression changing jesus sticking out from the sand bank are the skeletal bones of a
there is a ring on one finger
was coronado in the masons
a distant cloud of dust appears on the horizon music underscores that we are in texas and we superimpose the opening credits as the dust takes form around an approaching
the car comes close enough to see it has a county sheriffs insignia on the side
we see sam deeds the sheriff driving
sam is quietly competent to the point of seeming a bit moody
he sees something up ahead
music credits end as sam pulls off the road and we see the sergeants standing in the scrub
the hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are visible now
cliff stands looking at the arm with sam
mikey is a few yards behind them playing with his metal detector
beyond him we see the sheriffs car parked
i was driving back from apache wells when they got me on the radio
this was a rifle range way back when
but we figured it isnt army land anymore its your jurisdiction
nods ive got the forensics fella coming down from the rangers
no way to know how old the body is without some lab work
that ring masons been around a long while
mikey has come up to them still sweeping with the metal detector
apologetic old bullets
he uhm makes art with them
sam just nods
mikey frowns goes down on one knee and scratches something out of the dirt at their feet the sheriff says we shouldnt touch anything to sam he cant hear with
that rig on mikey
mikey comes up with something holds it before them
an encrusted piece of metal whatve we got here
sam takes the thing lays it back down where mikey found it
sposed to leave everything right where we found it
theyre real particular about that
the scene of the crime
no telling yet if theres been a crime
sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of it
sams thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal
it is roughly star shaped
but this countrys seen a good number of disagreements over the years
we look at a beautiful old pull down map of texas
we do the best we can here a teacher in her late s pilar cruz steps in front of the map and we follow her across the room carrying a
poster but hey public education these days is a bit of a battleground
posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from texas history sam houston stephen austin juan seguin
a new parent celie payne stands in the middle of the otherwise empty classroom
he went to school on base when we were in okinawa
its all you know kids in the same boat army brats
his record shows that hes a good student
im more worried about the social thing
are therelike gangs or
pilar starts to put the poster up
celie moves to hold it in place for her
we havent had any serious violence if thats what you mean
weve got a pretty lively mix though you walk into the cafeteria and the anglo kids are in one section the mexican kids in another and the black kids have
a table in the back thanks so blacks are theyre the smallest group except for a couple kickapoo kids
look youre obviously a concerned parent
chet has no history of getting into trouble im happy to have him in my class
she steps back to see if the poster an old photo of geronimo looks straight
another teacher molly sticks her head in the door uncomfortable pilar is uhm is amado okay
hes not here
is he sick
mutters hes going to wish he was dead
on the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture of a pancho villa looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing his chest and a gun blazing in each hand
we hear loud music luis
give me that phillips head back a small group of teenage chicano boys hang around the truck in the bed on the hood leaning against it
a boombox placed on top of the cab blasts rancha music out at the neighborhood
somebodys legs are hanging out the open passenger side door
the kids suddenly look as a sheriffs department car slides into the f
a deputy sheriff travis gets out
trying to look tough and unworried as we track across the street toward them
traviss hand reaches out from behind the camera to flick the music off
amado cruz pilars year old son lies on the front seat installing a compact disc player into the dash slot
he reaches up to the dash cant find what he wants
somebody hand me the cd player damelo pendejos he looks up and we tilt to see travis leaning in the window examining the new radio they come a long way
from those old track jobs havent they
waves radio this is stolen property
alla you fellas are coming down to the station
sweat beads the forehead of a thin tired looking recent immigrant enrique as he delivers platters of chile rellenos to a booth
mexican music plays on a jukebox in the b
we hold on the booth where hollis pogue in his s entertains two good old boys so buddy walks up to the porch and theres old fishbait mchenry cleanin the
dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife he was the most hygienic of all the mchenrys the breakfast companions are laughing already fishbait says buddy in that quiet way of his what you know about them tires that went missing from markets
fishbait thinks for a minute then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it cmon out pooter they caught us
laughing buddy deeds
he had a way
he known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up
old fishbait he says never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it
more laughter wont be another like him
that boy of his doesnt come near it
you ask me hes all hat and no cattle fellas we widen to see sam standing by their booth
no telling how long hes been listening fenton is embarrassed
i was just telling a few about your old man
he was a unique individual
yeah he was that
we sense a little strain when sam has to talk about his father big day coming up i wish wed have thought of it while he was still living
but he went so unexpected
better late than never
korean war hero sheriff for near thirty years buddy deeds memorial p i heard there was a bit of a fuss
oh you know the usual troublemakers
danny padilla from the sentinel that crowd
every other damn thing in the country is called after martin luther king they cant let our side have one measly park
king wasnt mexican fenton bad enough all the street names are in spanish they were here first
then name it after big chief shitinabucket
whoever that tonkawa fella was
he had the mexes beat by centuries
there was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the gulf war ruben santiago
but nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news they just wanted it to be one of theirs thats not the whole story
the mexicans that know that remember understand what buddy was for their people
hell it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him
sam looks to the register where pilars mother mercedes cruz whacks rolls of change apart on the counter
she seems to be avoiding looking toward him
she put it even at three to three so as the mayor i get to cast the tiebreaker
the older generation wont have any problem with it
they remember how buddy come to be sheriff that it was all cause he took their part
tell that one hollis hell everybody heard that story a million times
id like to hear it
your version of it
something about the way sam says it puts hollis on guard
go ahead hollis
hollis is hooked into it now the two of us were the only deputies back then me and buddy its what believe and the sheriff at the time was big
charley was one of your old fashioned bribe or bullets kind of sheriffs he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county
he looks down at the table it was in here one night back when jimmy herrera run the place
started right here in this booth
we pan down to the table the food has changed
the tortillas are in a straw basket instead of plastic
the jukebox changes to another song and the light dims slightly
a hand with a big masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla underneath it lie three ten dollar bills
the hand lifts them up and we tilt to see the face of sheriff charley wade a big mean redneck with shrewd eyes
it is grins this beaner fare doesnt agree with me but the price sure is right
wade sits across from his young deputies young hollis s and buddy deeds s
a chicken fried steak sits untouched in front of buddy
hollis has the anxious look of an errand boy while buddy is self contained and quietly forceful for his age
whats that for
jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks most of em relatives
people breed like chickens
i roust some muchacho on the street doesnt have his papers all he got to say is yo trabajo para jimmy herrera
wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket you got to keep the wheels greased son
sheriff does his job right everybody makes out
now this is gonna be one of your pickups buddy
first of the month just like the rent
get the car hollis
wade and hollis slide out of the booth to stand
im not doing it
hollis stops a few feet away shocked
wade just stares down at buddy
buddy looks wade in the eye seemingly unafraid
its your deal
you sweated it out of him you pick it up
theres gonna be some left over for you buddy
i take care of my boys
thats not the point
you feeling bad for jimmy
have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side
those old boys in ciudad leon im not picking it up
you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail son
the customers are all watching now nervous
buddy thinks for a moment not taking his eyes off wade
how bout this how bout you put that shield on this table and vanish before you end up dead or in jail
wade rests his hand on his pistol
it is dead silent but for the music on the box
you ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye
who said anything about shootin anybody
buddy has his gun out under the table
he slowly brings it up and lays it flat on the table not taking his hand off it or his eyes off wade
whole different story isnt it
youre outta the department
theres not a soul in this county isnt sick to death of your bullshit charley
you made yourself scarce you could make a lot of people happy
you little pissant now or later charley
you wont have any trouble finding me
wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction
he leans close to buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper
youre a dead man
he turns and nearly bumps into hollis
he gives the deputy a shove
get the goddamn car
were going to rodericks
he watches till the screen door shuts behind them then holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing had happened
he calls softly muchacho mas cerveza por favor
he looks up at somebody and we pan till we see sam still standing over the booth listening
we are back in mas cerveza por favor
that buddy was a cool breeze
we pull back to see hollis and his buddies at the table eating their lunches as they listen
charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him
we made our collection at rodericks place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him
he went missing the next day along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail
never heard from him again
not a peep
buddy run the man out of town
buddy deeds said a thing he damn well backed it up
wont be another like him
so he arrested all of jimmy herreras people and sent em back to the other side
hollis sees what sam is getting at grins oh he come to an accommodation
money doesnt always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning
look i know you had some problems with your father and he and muriel well your mother was a saint
but buddy deeds was my salvation
sam nods speaks softly wont be another like him
colonel delmore payne del a very direct by the book black officer addresses them
artillery pieces angle toward the sky behind him its an honor for me to assume command of this unit and i look forward to working with all of you
officers cliff and mikey in uniform now flank sergeant priscilla worth a black woman in her early s as they stand in formation im sure youre all aware of the
armys decision to close this installation under the reduction in force plan
that does not mean however we look over the shoulders of assembled officers and ncos toward del
that weve been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by another unit
you may have heard rumors that i run a very tight operation
these rumors are not exaggerated
we are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo
buddys face is slightly distorted by the glass
i got danny padilla from the paper for you sam sits at his desk in the sheriffs office looking down at the photo tell him ill catch him later
an old photo of the sheriffs department officers on the courthouse steps
wade hollis buddy a few others all in uniform
he says he needs to talk to you before the ceremony sam
sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close to look
tell him to try me tomorrow
magnified pov of the badge on wades chest swims into view
a metal star
we hear the secretary getting rid of the caller
he thinks youre trying to duck him
looking at the photo troubled mutters hes right
we start on a blinking sign big os then pan to see a full parking lot outside the low neon lit roadhouse
r b music blasts from inside
chet a black kid around stands nervously at the door building up his courage
he takes a deep breath plunges in
we track with chet very nervous as he makes his way through the crowded roadhouse
the customers are all black many from the nearby army post shouting and laughing over the loud music
chet edgy is looking for somebody
seen through the crush is otis big o payne a large man in his early s laughing as he stands behind the bar
he nervously puts his hand under his jacket
he pushes forward to get a better view
moving in on him
otis looks over sees the boy frowns reaching under his jacket he pulls out a photograph
he looks at it suddenly there is a scream from behind then gunshots patrons diving for the floor
chet whirls around and we whip pan to see a young man shadow emptying his pistol into richie a young soldier as a young woman athena screams and tries to
pull the gun away
with the last shot shadow turns and heads for the door but is tackled and swarmed by angry men shouting
we pan to athena kneeling over the bleeding twitching body of richie chet backs up horrified
a large hand grasps him on the shoulder from behind
he turns to see otis standing over him strangely calm amid the chaos you werent in here tonight were you
points go out through the back
chet hurries away
otis watches him for a moment then turns to the mess in his club
an angry woman stands from her auditorium chair youre just tearin everything down
tearin down our heritage tearin down the memory of people that fought and died for this land
we fought and died for this land too
we whip pan to see another standing parent we fought the u
army the texas rangers yeah but you lost buddy
we whip pan to a man in the rear winners get the bragging rights thats how it goes
people people we are in the high school auditorium a hot and heavy teachers and parents meeting in progress
pilar sits at the end of a long table facing the agitated parents taking some heat
danny padilla a young long haired reporter sits in the front taking notes enjoying the show
i think it would be best not to put things in terms of winners and losers points at pilar well the way shes teachin it has got everything switched around
i was on the textbook committee and her version is not we think of the textbook as kind of a guide not an absolute it is not what we set
as the standard
now you people can believe what you want but when it comes to teaching our children theyre our children too
the men who founded this state have a right to have their story the men who founded this state broke from mexico because they needed slavery to be legal to
make a fortune in the cotton business
i think thats a bit of an oversimplification are you reporting this meeting or runnin it danny
just adding a little historical perspective paloma cruz pilars teenage daughter peeks into the room then moves down the side toward the stage
you may call it history but i call it propaganda
im sure they got their own account of the alamo on the other side but were not on the other side so were not about to have it taught in
theres no reason to be so threatened by this pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger
ive only been trying to get across some of the complexity of our situation down here cultures coming together in both negative and positive ways
if you mean like music and food and all i have no problem with that
we shoot past pilar toward the parents in their seats
paloma steps up to whisper to her
but when you start changing who did what to who
were not changing anything were presenting a more complete picture
and thats whats got to stop
pilar looks troubled by what shes heard
she shoots a look toward the others at the table then slips away with paloma theres enough ignorance in the world without us encouraging it in the classroom now who
are you calling ignorant
folks i know this is a very emotional issue for some of you but we do have other business to attend to were not going to get some resolution on
weary would you people like to form another committee
groans from the parents shadow face bruised hands cuffed behind him is pushed in through the door to be booked
i hope the sucker does die man
mess with me thats what you get
sam steps in behind him and meets his chief deputy ray hernandez coming from the other direction
hospital says the other kid is in bad shape glances ahead the shooter local
shakes his bead down from houston
i think he knew the girl before
okay well take a statement from all the gis before they go back to post
you can get the story from otis over at the club
any poop on the john doe you found out there today
the rangers put ben wetzel on it
catch you later
as ray steps out pilar looking distraught walks into the station passing right by sam without seeing him
wonders what shes doing there she stands by an unoccupied reception desk very upset unable to attract anyones attention because of the activity around the shooting
she looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light
pilar looks around
sam is standing by her
we can tell there is some history between these two
theyve got my amado
got him here
somebody called something about an electronics store
ill see whats going on
he starts away stops comes back i was i was real sorry about nando
he was a good fella
we havent talked since
we havent talked since high school
ill go check on your boy
pilar watches sam go travis sits typing away at a word processor as athena in tears gives testimony
so richie just didnt say nothin cause he didnt want to get into it see and the next thing i know theres shots and richie is down
it happened so fast excuse me we widen to see sam standing over the desk we got some boys you run in earlier today
i pulled the bunch that hangs at pico bernals place
we finally caught them with something
you got a juvenile with ern amado cruz
travis looks at his booking sheets yeah lets see the other ones say he wasnt in on the theft he just knows how to hook things up
weve been trying to contact a parent
sam walks with amado who is trying to look defiant they tell me youre good at fixing things
nothin your father was a hell of a mechanic
still nothing you know if you figure minimum wage on the time most thieves spend in jail they could have bought most everything they stole
i didnt steal anything
i didnt say you did
my name is sam by the way
amado just gives him a look sam and amado step out into the office where pilar stands waiting
hes all yours
are you okay
i dont know what the big deal is
youll find out when i get you home
pilar yanks amado outside by his arm
she turns to shoot a look back at sam then steps out through the glass door
watching her go any time
we shoot up from a pit in the ground
three men leap over landing on the far side and running away from us
del payne runs with cliff and mikey on a pathway along a security fence the two sergeants struggling to keep up occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle
theres not that much down here colonel
big os is the only place in the county that our african american soldiers are uhm that they feel comfortable in
have we had trouble there before
since ive been stationed here
a fistfight now and then we had a kid pass out in the mens room
the town isnt much
they didnt come for a vacation
you know how it is colonel first time away from home dealing with new people i remember my first hitch substance abuse
well yeah but i went through the program
i havent had a drink since i meant on the post

random numbers maybe a hundred people at a time why dont we make it once a week for a while
no problem sir
del notices bow hard they are breathing i sprint the last quarter mile
you gentlemen dont have to keep up if you dont care to
appreciate it sir
del accelerates and we hold with the sergeants slowing to a near walk
guy cracks walnuts with his asshole
grins you get the feeling he doesnt want to be here
we hear hank williams gospel song ill have a new body ill have a new life as we see the gathered bones of the skeleton tagged and photographed and measured
impressions made of the dental work in the skull photographs of the excavation of the body at various stages marked with red grease pencil the piece of metal laid in a de tarnishing dish the ring put under a microscope
music continues as we tighten on the piece of metal a pair of tongs pulling it from the de tarnishing solution
it is a star shaped badge bearing the words sheriff rio county
c w music playing the regulars starting to show up
sam makes his way to a table where ben wetzel a texas ranger sits with a file of forensic reports
sam the man
thanks for coming down
they shake sam sits
business is booming

yeah well have folks swimming over to mexico to work in the sweatshops
sam looks at the folder of reports
that the word on our boy
yeah this is skinny
we find a body its either skinny or stinky depending on how much meat there is on the bones
opens folder male to years old five foot eleven chewed tobacco then we get into the dental records charley wade
nods that badge it didnt come out of a cereal box
you know the popular version of how he left town
everybody on the border knows that story
you got a cause of death
skull was intact no soft tissue left not much to go on
so he could have gone out to the base hopped the fence dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack
ben smiles closes the folder you uhm you remember what old buddy carried for a side arm
he swore by it
ben frowns what
so is buddy on your short list
if it was some poor mojado swam across at night got lost in the scrub and starved out there we wouldnt go any further
but this is a formerly prominent citizen
you got to investigate
no question about it
what i will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end
you know how the press is with a murder story even if its forty years old
yeah its a pretty cold trail
they sit in awkward silence for a moment
ben feels bad about it
i remember charley wade come to my fathers hardware store once when i was a little boy
id heard stories how he shot this one how he shot that one man winked at me and i peed in my pants
shakes his head winked at me
pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of th century texas history
okay we have the fight against the spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till theyre finally defeated in and mexican independence is declared
anglo settlers are invited somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a sheet of lined notebook paper
a bald muscular shotputter after releasing the shot his hand large in the f
to colonize the area and by the time they begin the movement against santa anna they outnumber the mexicans here by four to one
the war between mexico drawing intently
he takes the notebook and lays his thumb over the corner
and the anglo forces ends in with the formation of the texas republic
texas joins the united states as a state where slavery is legal in chet flips the corner of the notebook and the series of drawings hes made form a brief
cartoon of the shot putter blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us
extremely well drawn after the so called mexican war and then secedes to join the confederacy in
the confederacy is beaten and the reformation period here is marked by range wars and race wars looking out at the class and all this paralleled by constant battles between
both the mexican and anglo settlers and the various indian nations in the area
what are we seeing here
startled he hides the notebook under his hands uhm everybody is killing everybody else
a nasty looking thing
only a bass would want to eat this
hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his face
hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a dock at the lake going through his box of lures
sam appears on the dock and steps down
i always wondered what you mayors do when youre not cutting ribbons
you caught me playing hooky looks across lake floating around out here playin hell with them bass play a little cards play a little golf drink some beer sounds great
where do i sign up
i havent been out here for a while
you go by your old house
just as well
the new people just painted it some god awful color we found a body out by the army base yesterday
been there for a long time
hollis squints at a rubber lure rejects it was it davy crockett or jim bowie
smiles you recall if charley wade was a mason
i believe he was
used to go for lodge meetings over to laredo
whats he got to do with your body
all it was wearing was a big old masonic ring and a rio county sheriffs badge
sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat
you dont remember anything else from that last night you saw him do you
i told the story enough times hell we were just in the car he was stewing about the fight with buddy while we drove over to roderick bledsoes bledso he
owned the colored roadhouse before big o he still living
i think his widows still in their place in darktown though
shakes his bead you think its charley wade huh
forensics people are sure of it
you have any idea who might have put him there
hollis makes a great show of considering besides my father i mean
theres no call for that sam
fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years
and buddy was one of them
we got that dedication tomorrow
this is a hell of a time to be draggin up old business
people have worked this whole big thing up around my father
if its built on a crime they deserve to know
now i understand why you might want to believe he couldnt do it
and i understand why you might want to think he could
this is a low blow but accurate enough to shake sam
thanks for your time hollis
hollis holds up a double handful of lures dozens of rubber and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners look at all this would you
my tackle the boat all to catch a little old fish just minding its business on the bottom of the lake
he gives sam a look hardly seems worth the effort does it sam
sam walks away athena stands at attention trying to keep her composure so you knew this young man before
from back in houston
we both come up on fifth street
did you know he was going to be there last night
if i had i wouldnt have gone in
and you and private graves we were just dancing cliff leans against a desk a blackboard covered with radar diagrams behind him
priscilla sits nearby both of them focused on athena
were not running a dating service here
i know that sergeant
we were just dancing
there was a bunch of us there
shadow just come down looking for trouble
its not our job to get involved in your personal life but when it interferes with the training here im sorry sergeant major
there wasnt anything i could do
shadow gets crazy a silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment
she works up her courage sergeant major
how is richie doing
hell be transferred to a military hospital as soon as hes stabilized hell probably be getting a medical discharge out of the army
hes going to lose a lung
this is not good news for athena will this go on my record
cliff considers for a long moment if the incident happened the way you say it did there hasnt been an infraction
thank you sergeant major
thank you sergeant major
athena steps out of the room
cliff sits on the desk you spoil em cliff
hey shes in a tough situation
i cut her some slack but im the one in charge of her sorry ass
shes pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood
crossing to the door and if she isnt careful shes gonna slide right back into it
we start on a cu of a rocker creaking back and forth on an old wooden porch
a woman hums
minnie bledsoe in her s sits on her porch in the old black section of town playing with a gameboy
she has very thick glasses on
sam walks up to her from his car mrs
im sheriff deeds sheriff deeds dead honey you just sheriff junior
smiles yeah thats the story of my life
you ever play one of these
ive seen em
well dont ever start up on em cause once you do you cant stop
i tell myself im gonna play just three little games after breakfast and here i sit with half the day gone
you mind if i ask a few questions about your husband
i wont say nothing bad about the man but you can ask away
he had the club out on the old trail road we run that twenty odd years
give it over to otis payne in
so you must remember sheriff wade
not if i can help it
you had to deal with him in running the club
them days you deal with sheriff wade or you didnt deal at all
first of the month every month he remind you of who you really workin for
he squeezed money out of you
wasnt legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club see
roderick used to say buy yourself a drink you get a free membership
but sheriff wade he could shut you down anytime
and my father
sheriff buddy was a different story
long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day make sure all the colored get out to vote we was called colored back then if you was
polite maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then things was peaceful
that sheriff wade though he took an awful big bite
people didnt complain
not if they was colored or meskin
not if they wanted to keep breathin
do you remember the last time you saw him
minnie thinks puts down the gameboy i seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin
we track in to a close up of her
r b music fades up slowly he used to come in whilst we was in full swing make people nervous
had him a smile like the grim reaper the joint is crowded people drinking talking laughing a few dancing all trying to avoid locking eyes with sheriff wade who sits
with his legs stretched out at a table
young hollis sits by him smiling uncomfortably
sax wailing r b blasts from the jukebox
young otis a slick confident character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on in his early s stops to talk with a man on his way to bring a
tray with a couple beers and glasses over
just sit back with his hand on that big ol gun and act the kingfish with everybody
otis payne had come to work for us by then and that boy had him some attitude watching young otis with narrowed eyes a man puts a slip of paper
in otiss pocket pats his back
otis winks to acknowledge the bet turns makes eyes at a pretty woman sitting at the bar who is eyeing him back
he lays the beers and glasses on the table starts away
expressionless he starts to pour the beer into wades glass
the sheriff looks up into his face i know you
one of cleroe paynes boys
i sent your daddy to the farm once
i know that
why you think that was
otis feels people watching
he doesnt want to lose face some crop needed pickin and the man was shorthanded
a very insolent answer for the time and place as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him
must run in the family you wouldnt be runnin numbers out of this club now would you son
runnin numbers illegal
runnin numbers without i know about it is both illegal and unhealthy
you remember that
the beer is poured
otis starts away whoah son
youre not finished
i prefer it in the bottle shut up hollis
otis meets wades look now pours the other beer how come you dont took familiar
up to houston
i hear they let you boys run wild up there
wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer splashes on the table and drips into holliss lap aw look what you done now
better get something to wipe it up son
half the people in the room are watching now the other half moving away to relative safety
otis tries to keep a lid on his temper looks around the room you spilt it you wipe it up
wade stands steely eyed and looks at otis nose to nose i told you to do something
are you gonna hop to it or are we gonna have a problem
otis is starting to shake but holds his ground dont want to turn tail in front of your people
he starts to turn away then whap
brings the butt of his pistol up under otiss chin knocking him to the floor
a woman screams and otis enraged grabs the chair he has fallen over starts to get up but wade has the pistol levelled at his face come on houston give
it a try
come to poppa roderick is out on the floor now hands held out in a gesture of peace as young minnie watches from behind the bar petrified dont mind him
boys just a bit slow is all
he dont mean nothin by it that the problem son
otis apologize to the sheriff otis eases the chair down but doesnt say anything you got him too scared to peep sheriff
maybe if you put that gun up you telling me what to do roderick
no sheriff im just wade looks around widens his eyes in mock surprise whats this i see
is that whiskey in them glasses on the bar
roderick im gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law this is a club sheriff you been in here and people better clear out of here
a few people start for the exit
wade swivels and blam sends a bullet past minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind the bar
people run for the door
wade squats down to look otis in the face you learn how to act your place son
this idnt houston
he stands and we follow him toward the bar course i was young and full of beans then the camera passes wade and instead of minnie there stands otis present
we are back in i didnt understand the spot i was putting roderick in
and that was the last time you saw him
we shift to see sam sitting where wade was headed oh i think he came in one more time with hollis and naw your daddy wasnt with them
made their monthly pickup
roderick wasnt in so i just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope
that was the night he disappeared
shakes his head could of been
that was white peoples business
and when my father was sheriff
what about it
what was your deal with him
otis smiles chooses his words carefully buddy was more a part of the big picture county political machine chamber of commerce zoning board if i kept those people happy he
was pretty much on my side
smiles whenever somebody thought they start up another bar for the black folks theyd be how should i put this
theyd be officially discouraged
he ever accept cash for a favor
otis smiles looks away to ponder his response i dont recall a prisoner ever died in your fathers custody
i dont recall a man in this town black white mexican whod hesitate a minute before theyd call on buddy deeds to solve a problem
more than that i wouldnt like to say
pilar drives amado and her daughter paloma home if you had your way i wouldnt have any friends
oh come on amado just cause im not like little miss honor roll here leave your sister out of it
you and all of the teachers in this dump your storys over so you dont want anybody else to have fun
we see on pilars face that he has scored you jerk im not talking to you
you dont have any friends
pilar eases the car down san jacinto street seeing something on the street and shes tuning her kids conversation out whod want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco
i dont pretend i came over on the mayflower and those stupid girls who hang out with them just shut up
sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them talking with three other men joanie orozcos telling the whole school shes like desperately in love with santo guerra
you cant be desperately in love when youre years old
pilar is still looking fixedly out the window not if you have half a brain in your head
of course you can
it doesnt have anything to do with being smart
danny padilla is arguing with h
briggs a construction company big shot and jorge guerra a council member in his s and sam as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street what im saying
is i dont see the point
you had your chance when the dedication committee was meeting ive got new information its ancient goddarn history danny they dam up the north branch to make lake pescadero
a whole little town disappears squatter town people had been living in perdido for over a hundred years
mexicans and chicanos are deported evicted moved forcibly out of their houses by our local hero buddy deeds and his department there was a bill from the state legislature families
were split apart a whole community was destroyed they were trespassing danny and who ends up with lakefront property bought for a fraction of the market price
buddy deeds sheriff of rio county and his chief deputy hollis pogue
they all look at sam who has been listening patiently the whole while
theyve reached his office
look im not after you sam
i just think people in town ought to know the full story on buddy deeds
nods that makes two of us
sam steps into his office leaving h
shaking his head you best be thankful thats the son and not the father
buddy woulda kicked your ass from here to sundown
we track down a hallway as celie walks toward us calling ahead
chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her
i dont see what the big deal is
go back over talk to the man and bury the hatchet del celie passes us and del crosses back in the other direction from behind the camera carrying boxes of
we continue our slow track forward otis payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life
dad you were years old when he left he didnt leave he moved three houses down with one of my mothers best friends
hey delmore wheres your daddy
del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall everybody elses business
and everybody loved big o del comes back out empty handed big o was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink
dad can i talk to you about track
not that much
dad i talked to the track coach i thought we already had this out
next year if your grades are high enough i have a b average
how many b average students do you think they take at west point

del steps away past us leaving chet defeated we start on enrique talking surreptitiously on the pay phone on the way to the kitchen
sabado por la noche is es el mas seguero a cruzar por la manana y pues tendremos que esperar friday night yes thats the safest ill cross in the morning
and then well have to wait mercedes bustles by snapping her fingers off the phone by weve got people waiting
we follow mercedes back into the kitchen where she moves through kibbitzing the operation mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be cooked
she isnt wearing gloves
donde estan sus guantes
quiere matar a mis clientes
where are your gloves
you want to kill my customers
she continues past shaking her bead bringing us to pilar who is trying to stay out of the way these ones coming up are getting stupider every year
maybe youre just getting less patient
if theyre going to survive here they have to know how to work elalco
los clientes esperan
well you hire illegals indignant nobody is illegal in my cafe
theyve got green cards theyve got relatives who were born here if they only had a little common sense id be very happy
if you spent a little more time training them did you come here to tell me how to run my business
i was wondering if youd like to take a trip down south with us
maybe see where you grew up why would i want to go there
oh come on you must be curious how its changed
amado is into this big tejano roots thing and ive never been further than ciudad leon you want to see mexicans open your eyes and look around you
were up to our ears in them
pilar gives up on the trip
she watches her mother poking at the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out mami how old were you when my father he was killed
when he was killed
a little older than paloma is now
how come you never got married again
mercedes just glares at her there must have been somebody
mutters i was too busy
nobodys too busy
it was different back then
i had this place i was doing all the shopping all the cooking
what do i need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit
pissed off thank you
i dont mean fernando
mami the first time i brought him home those were your exact words some chulo with grease under his nails
i never said that
you made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody
i felt that you could do better for yourself what
become a nun
you didnt want me going out with anglos i never said that
it was just that boy that boy mami say his name for chrissakes
the employees are staring
mercedes wont look at her daughter as she steps out of the kitchen banging into enrique on his way back in you people are stealing my money entiende
mercedes is gone
the young girl pulling plastic gloves on looks to pilar
the girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy lo siento my condolences
a crowded room c w music plays on the box
sam sits behind a bottle of beer as the bartender cody in his early s philosophizes
now im just as liberal as the next guy if the next guys a redneck
but i gotta say i think theres something to this cold climate business
i mean you go to the beach what do you do
drink a few beers wait for a fish to flop up on the sand
cant build no civilization that way
you got a hard winter coming though you got to plan ahead and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout
good deal you were born down here then
you joke about it sam but we are in a state of crisis
the lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong between this one and that one your
daddy understood that
he was like the whatchacallit the referee for this damn menudo we got down here
he understood how most people dont want their sugar and salt in the same jar
you mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors you be out of a job
take that pair over in the corner sam swivels to look where cody points place like this twenty years ago buddy woulda been on them two cliff and priscilla talk
across a table warning
not cause he had it in for the colored but just as a kind of safety tip
i bet he would
old sam stood for somethin you know
the day that man died they broke the goddamn mold
things are obviously more than professional between these two so where does that put us
well i dont see whats changed
no pdas no necking on the obstacle course
seriously i think we should get married
we been through this before we should just do it
and if i get a shot at a promotion somewhere you could take it its up or out these days cliff
say i get transferred to a different post id quit the army for you if it came to that
grins mans gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit
big goddamn deal
excuse me they look up to see sam standing over them sheriff hi this is sergeant this is priscilla worth
pleased to meet you
sheriff deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday
it true they gonna build a shopping mall out there
if certain people have their way its going to be a new jail
maybe we got in the wrong business
they closin down military bases left and right puttin up jails like stores
do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range
they stopped training infantry there in the late s
it was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year
you know who it was they dug up
not for sure yet
but i kind of wish they hadnt
enrique steps out of the darkened cafe followed by mercedes who locks up
mercedes steps over to an expensive looking car es muy lindo su coche en ingles enrique
this is the united states
we speak english
is very beautiful your car
good night enrique
she slides into the car buenas noches senora cruz
enrique walks in the opposite direction del in uniform approaches the front door of big os not open for business yet
we tighten as he stops to read a handlettered sign next to it black seminole exhibit rear entrance
he steps in late s r b plays on the jukebox
otis stands behind the counter hooking the beer taps up
del steps in and sits on a stool at the far end of the bar tense looking around the place
when otis sees him he stops dead
they lock eyes for a moment then otis turns to call
carolyn knock that off for a minute
carolyn sykes an attractive woman maybe ten years younger than otis pulls the plug from the jukebox near where shes scrubbing bloodstains off the floor
she turns to look at the newcomer del doesnt move to come closer black seminoles
shrugs hobby of mine
got some artifacts couple pieces one of your men out at the base made
del nods toward where carolyn is mopping that where he was shot
thats where he fell
you get much of that in here
its a bar
people come together drink fall in love fall out of love air their grudges out deal drugs in the bathroom if i thought it would help id put up a
sign telling them not to
right under the one about the employees washing their hands
carolyn has come over by otis lugging the bucket and mop this heres carolyn
honey this is my son delmore
nice to meet you maam
carolyn nods shoots a look to otis ill be in back waiting for that delivery
they wail till she is gone to start again so
so tell me why i shouldnt make this place off limits
this is an official visit then i assume a lot of your business is from our people
otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer
your boys out there cooped up together need somewhere they can let the steam out
if theyre black theres not but one place in this town they feel welcome
been that way since before you were born
we have an enlisted mans club at the post
well youre the man out there now arent you

smiles i been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now
boys say they heard hes a real hard case
spit and polish man
full bird colonel name of payne they say bet you never figured you end up back here
the army hands you a command you go wherever it is
i hear things too
people call you the mayor of darktown
shrugs over the years this is the one place thats always been there
i loan a little money out settle some arguments
got a cot in the back people get afraid to go home they can spend the night
theres not enough of us to run anything in this town the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the mexicans hire each other
theres the holiness church and theres big os place
and people make their choice smiles a lot of em choose both
theres not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people youre not either on one side or the other del looks away not wanting to believe this
softly i gonna meet that family of yours
why would you want to do that
because im your father
del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between them
he gets up and heads for the door youll get official notification when i make my decision
he is out the door otis pulls himself a beer as carolyn steps back out so thats him yeah thats him
got two three thousand people under him out there you count the civilians
that must be a laugh a minute
sam walks down the main street of town
a crowd is gathering at the other end for the ceremony sheriff
we widen as h
and jorge catch up to him
slaps sam on the back historic occasion isnt it
seems like we have another one every week
jorge and his chamber of commerce boys got to keep things hummin were building up tourism sam people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boys
town in cuidad leon sam you ought to put up a banner frontera texas gateway to cut rate pussy that kind of talk doesnt help sam
rather have that than the ten foot high catfish statue i got eddie richter at the sentinel to kill that story
the perdido thing
he agreed it wasnt exactly news dannys gonna be out for blood the next time
which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail just so were all on the same page
we dont need a new jail
thats a matter of interpretation were already renting cells to the feds for their overflow there was a mandate in the last election it wouldnt happen to be your construction
company gonna get the bid on building this thing would it h
and jorge you wouldnt be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters dammit sam the people are concerned about crime we need a
drug rehab program we need a new elementary school there isnt money allocated for that
but a jail look im not gonna campaign against your deal here but if anybody asks me i got to tell them the truth
we dont need a new jail
when we backed you when you backed me you needed somebody named deeds to bump the other fella out of office
hey folks sam and the others smile as they reach the crowd of townspeople mostly small business owners and retired people
photographers from the paper and a local tv news crew wait by a veiled statue roped off in a little traffic island
mercedes dressed to kill stands waiting next to hollis with a huge pair of scissors in her hand
slowly working the blades of the scissors she looks coldly at sam he nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him
lets get this thing over with
we start on a two foot high statue of a cowboy made from old bullets and shell casings
we pan past a few others the poses lifted from frederic remington paintings till we see mikey gluing together a work in progress a remington book propped open in front
cliff sits at the worktable playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from mikeys bag never thought id see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman
with three up and three down on her shoulder
i think its beyond what youd call dating
you going to get married
you met her family
they gonna be cool about you being a white guy
priscilla says they think any woman over who isnt married must be a lesbian
she figures theyll be so relieved im a man always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice
but marriage man i did two tours in southeast asia and i was married for five years i couldnt tell you which experience was worse
cliff picks up a slug hey mikey i knew she was japanese going into it but she didnt tell me the ninja assassin part mikey her parents acted like i
was gonna blow my nose on their curtains mikey if i stayed out past ten with the guys shed go into her madame butterfly routine mikey look at this what its a bullet
im lousy with bullets here
this is the stuff we picked up the other day right
the rest of this is all
caliber they were using m s yeah whats it doing on a rifle range
mikey holds the slug in front of his face we better call that sheriff
hollis is finishing his oration having put the crowd in a good mood
sometime in the early s a reporter from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our lone star state and he asked him governor whats your ideal of
what a real texan ought to be
governor said thats easy son you just go down to rio county and get a look at sheriff buddy deeds
applause watching the crowd we pan with his gaze across smiling faces till he comes to danny and a couple of chicano friends looking grim
we rack focus beyond them to see pilar watching the ceremony from a few yards back thank you
weve got one more person to hear from and hes somebody who probably knew buddy better than any of us sam would you say a few words
not thrilled to be called on
he steps forward reluctantly to applause you folks who remember my father knew him as sheriff
but at home he was also judge jury he looks to hollis and executioner
sam holds holliss eyes for a moment before continuing this is a real honor youre doing him today and if buddy was around im sure his hat size would be
gettin bigger every minute
watching i used to come to this park to hide from him
now that youre putting his name on it ill have to find someplace new to duck out
more laughter i do appreciate it and wherever he is buddys puttin the beer on ice for the bunch of you
sam steps back and mercedes steps forward with her scissors without looking at him and now my fellow council member and one of fronteras most respected businesswomen mrs
mercedes cruz will do the honors for us
she freezes smiling till the still photographers have gotten their shots then snips the cord to a pulley system that lets the cloth drop the cloth drops to reveal a
bas relief in brass set in a block of smooth limestone
a decent likeness of buddy in uniform his hand on the shoulder of a small chicano looking boy who stands beside him eyes raised worshipfully
applause from the gathering watching a bit removed as mercedes shakes hands with jorge and h
and hollis for the cameras
he overhears a pair of bystanders who are checking out the statue it does look like old buddy
runnin that kid in for loiterin the bystanders laugh sam steps away intercepting mercedes as she steps away nice to see you mrs
mercedes just looks at him keeps going
his gaze brings him to pilar standing on the sidewalk watching
steps over from the dispersing crowd field trip
my next class isnt till nine thirty
want to take a walk
sam and pilar walk together alongside the rio your mother still doesnt like me
i cant name anybody she does like these days
i see she built a place up here by the river
a real palace
she rattles around alone in that thing shes done well for herself on her own and all so she tells me three times a week
she looks at him i thought you got through that pretty well
they cooked the whole thing up without asking me
people liked him
most people did yeah
i remember him watching me once
when i was little before you and i she shrugs
i was on the playground with all the other kids but i thought he was only looking at me
i was afraid he was going to arrest me he had those eyes you know yeah
weird what you remember
they walk in silence a moment your boy there amado
nice looking kid
he hates me
no with paloma its more like she pities and tolerates me totally age appropriate
but amado hes hes never been book smart
had a hard time learning to read
me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment like a betrayal
fernando did okay and he dropped out fernando wasnt pissed off at everybody
he just wanted to fix their cars
it might just be the age
i spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack
she looks at him so why did you come back here sam
got divorced i wasnt gonna work for my father in law anymore
the fellas down here said theyd back me you dont want to be sheriff
i got to admit its not what i thought itd be
back when buddy had it hell im just a jailer
run a room hotel with bars on the windows
it can happen so sudden cant it
being left out on your own
youve got your mother your kids theyve got me
they stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank remember this
pilar looks at the spot
she isnt ready to deal with whatever memory it brings back i should get back
pilar looks real bad if the teachers late for class
its really nice to talk with you sam
she waves and walks away feeling awkward
sam watches for a minute then turns and steps down to the bank he looks at the water
a little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and drifts away with the current
we tilt up to see young pilar tossing bark into the river as young sam sits on the bank beside her
they are and years old it is you going to tell her
you going to tell him
he doesnt need to know all my business
hes gonna find out
whats he gonna do arrest us
young pilar frowns tosses more bark its supposed to be some big sin even if you love each other
you believe that
she turns to look at him no
we pan with her gaze to see sam present day sitting on the bank lost in thought me neither
athena walking between buildings looking a bit out of it
sergeant worth cuts into her private johnson

ray smiles pushes him out andale amigo we hold on sam at his desk tightening as he holds the
slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes lupe
get me the rangers up in austin we hear old mexican music
ice cubes plunk into a glass
mercedes exhausted from a day at the cafe pours herself a scotch and soda the back light is flicked on and mercedes steps out with her drink in hand the
music audible from inside
she sinks into a recliner
we tighten as she closes her eyes
something rustles out in the dark
mercedes opens her eyes
there is whispering
mercedes sits up and suddenly two men run past the edge of the patio toward the front of the house
mercedes sighs otra vez los mojados wetbacks again mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table punches a number in hello
sam out of uniform stands behind his little house chucking fallen pecans out into the dark thinking listening to the night sounds
working something out in his head
he looks off into the dark and we pan with his gaze a man steps toward us barely visible in the darkness
it is charley wade were in sams reverie in who is that
come out here where i can see you
a gunshot and wade falls to his knees you sonofabitch wade falls on his face
a flashlight beam flicks on and plays over his body

sam shakes the pecans still in his band goes back to chucking them older chicano couples dance to mexican music playing from speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard
we tilt up to see enrique watching from his window music still blasting
enrique steps away from the window and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment
he goes back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it to another
on the bed beside him are new flashlights and the batteries still in their packaging
he begins to coil the rope it is hundreds of feet long
pilar sits on her front porch listening to the music in the distance
a woman singing a mexican love ballad
after a while we hear paloma open the screen door behind her mom
you gonna stay out here
for a while
they listen to the record whats she singing about
smiles what do you think
sam has been up since dawn searching through piles of old department records
papers cover his desk and the chairs hes dragged over next to it
he reads out loud himself from a report in front of him first bullet entered beneath the left eye severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull

pilar sits with amado on the football field bleachers before school starts im only going to have you for two more years
if you decide not to go on to college i cant take any more school
youre going to be on your own

i can fix cars
you can fix old cars
washburn told me that the cars theyre making now are all computerized you think i cant learn that
i think you can learn whatever you want to
i just dont see you doing it

i like cars its just not a move up the ladder to you so you think its a waste
that isnt true
oh come on you and grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant
when dad if you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was i would be happy
i would be thrilled

and what did she do
two years at hard labor our lady of perpetual help
catholic school nasty
pilar is nearly in tears
honey i think youre smart and youre good and i love you
so dont act like an idiot all right
we see sams car roll through the express lane as other cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths
sam drives across the bridge over the rio sam drives slowly through the sprawling more populous town on the other side
lots of the streets are unpaved
we pan with the car till we hold on anselma a country girl of aimlessly walking the streets we watch a kid about amados age pulling a tire off its
rim to put a patch on it over here we dont throw everything away like you gringos do
chucho montoya in his mid s stands by sam drinking a coke as they watch the kid work
we invented that
the government doesnt have to tell people to do it
you own this place
this place the one across the street four other ones around ciudad leon soy el rey de las llantas
king of the tires
lots of your people rollin back over that bridge on my rubber
nods you lived in the states for a while
fifteen years in el paso

you ever know a fella named eladio cruz
chucho smiles draws a line in the dirt with his heel you the sheriff of rio county right
un jefe muy respetado
step over this line
sam obliges ay que milagro
youre not the sheriff of nothing anymore just some tejano with a lot of questions i dont have to answer
sam smiles plays with the line with his toe bird flying south you think he sees that line
rattlesnake javelina whatever you got halfway across that line they dont start thinking different
so why should a man
your government always been pretty happy to have that line
the questions just been where to draw it my government can go fuck itself and so can yours
im talking about people here men
mi amigo eladio cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day we pan from chucho to the flat tire on a battered old pickup
truck but because hes on one side of this invisible line and not the other they got to hide in the back like criminals eladio cruz young and good looking squats into the shot to examine the tire jack in hand
it is and because over there hes just another mex bracero any man with a badge is his jefe conjunto music comes from the truck radio
young chucho steps past eladio donde vas chucho tienes que quedar escondido
shit chucho you got to stay hidden
voy a romper las rinones si no hago pipi im gonna bust my kidneys if i dont pee we track back with young chucho to see we are at the
side of a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border
eladios battered pickup truck has wood slat sides and a canvas top
eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as young chucho climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself los demas son tan espantados que prefieran
mojar sus pantalones
the other guys are so scared theyd rather wet their pants
chucho tightens as he sees something ducks down mira eladio look
we pan to see the sheriffs car approaching in a cloud of calling from where he lies changing the tire muchachos
eight illegal workers hear this and lie down pulling a canvas tarp over themselves
we hear the car stop behind them he makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against the dirt of the arroyo sheriff wade and deputy hollis
get out of their car and start toward eladio he stands takes a deep breath wade steps up to him with his hard eyed smile hola amgio
problemas de llanta
no hay de que
no problem ive got another
whats in the back
young hollis strolls around the truck as if hes considering buying it
he reaches in and flicks the radio off not much jefe
i heard somebody been haulin wets on this road
i havent seen anybody doing that
this same person been bragging all over the county how he dont have to cut that big gringo sheriff in on it he can run his own operation thout any
como se llama amigo
you know this road got a bad reputation eladio young chucho pecks over the edge to see whats happening
bandidos injuns hollis wanders over to stand by wade theres many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch
hope youre carrying some protection
you carryin a firearm son
dont lie to me now
si tengo escopeto just a shotgun just a shotgun huh
better let me take a look at that
eladio opens the truck door and digs under the seat
wade winks to hollis then turns and blam
shoots eladio through the head
hollis jumps back startled and horrified oh no oh jesus oh my lord little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service
think he can make a fool out of charley wade
get them wets outta the back hollis see what weve got squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible eyes covered with his hands
you killed him you got a talent for statin the obvious son muchachos
come on out
young chucho hears footsteps approaching
we pan as he looks a mans boots appear at the top of the arroyo
we tilt up to see a sheriff backlit then crane to see it is sam back in the present looking over the site troubled
his car sits on the empty road behind him
he frowns turns to go somebody has spray painted perdido
over the plaque of buddy and the little boy hooligans hollis and a couple of men from the public work department look at the damage
it happens again we build a fence around it
enrique steels himself trying to cover his nerves
we cross with him to a booth
podemos ganar muchas batallas pero la guerra ya es perdido we can win a lot of battles but the wars already been lost zack and another border patrolman look up
at him eyes glued to his notepad you wan something to drink
a georgia okeefe looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal against the western sky the longhorns go for ten times the price we widen as the skull is lifted by
wesley birdsong a native american man in his s who wears extremely thick glasses
sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of texas curios laid out in front of his trailer
empty scrubland surrounds them
but longhorns are hard to come by these days
you sell much out here
how am i gonna sell things if nobody comes by
this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin much
hell of a spot to put a business
but you dont see much competition do you
he winks at sam picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble the alamo these things used to sell like hotcakes
now if it cant play those discs they wont look at it
he puts the radio on looks out at the emptiness around i like it here
once i tried going onto that reservation to live
couldnt take the politics
damn indianll drive you crazy with that now your father this wasnt what he had in mind at all
he come out of korea he had this chevy with too much engine in it
hed come roarin up and down this road all hours of the day and night looking for somebody to race
he lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it buffalo chips
fella in santa fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze em out
so when did buddy leave
hell i cant remember dates no more
i do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him
he almost took some poor fellas head off at the legion in arroyo grande and figured it was time to move on
you think he killed anybody in korea
they dont hand those medals out for hidinin your foxhole
would you buy this
no me neither
he searches for something among the curios if he hadnt found that deputy job i believe buddy mightve gone down the other path got into some serious trouble
settled him right down
that and your mother
course he had that other one later
your mother wasnt one to get chased off her patch
half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein it through
you know who it was
the other one
hell at my age every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one
your heads all crowded up here it is wesley stretches out a four foot rattlesnake skin rattles still attached this big fella was sleepin in a crate at ciscos junkyard
right when i looked to see what was in it
jumped up at my face scared me so bad i killed him without thinkin

pilar takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and turns to go mutters nobody stays in love for twenty three years
an early s cheezy action picture filipino women in chains or biker flick is playing
we tilt down to a mans boots crunching across the gravel of the parking area
now and then the man turns a flashlight beam on a license plate
the cars are all pre lots of pickups and the patrons are almost all teenagers
some have turned their pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch while others have set lawn furniture out to sit on
we tilt up slightly to see the glint of a rio county sheriffs badge pinned on the mans shirt
he meets a deputy coming in the other direction
both train their flashlights on the license of the car we see in the b
we tilt and rack to see that nobody is visible through the window lets go
we follow buddy up to the drivers side of the car as the deputy goes to the passenger side
we pan with buddys hand down to the door handle he grabs it flings it open the overhead light flicks on and there lie young sam and pilar teenagers half
their clothes off and just about to close the deal
pilar screams and the deputy throws the door open by their heads goddammit
buddy grabs sams ankles and yanks him out of the car onto the ground as the deputy awkwardly pulls pilar out the other side what the hell are you doing
you fucking asshole
how old is that girl
goddammit wheres your goddam sense
let me go
come on now missy get your clothes in order sam is trying to kick and punch at his father pausing in between to pull his pants up
people are booing and honking their horns all around you got no fuckin right

gimme the keys gimme the goddamn car keys son what am i sposed to do with her buddy
you drive her home and tell her mother where we found her sam
the kids are dragged forward into the headlights that are being turned on to see what the ruckus is
both are crying struggling you leave her the fuck alone
you just shut that filthy mouth son
ill deal with you when we get home please dont tell my mother
shes gonna kill me
they step closer into the glaring headlights which white out the scene then fade
it is dusk present day
our eyes readjust to see sam standing by his car in the lot of the long abandoned drive in
the ruined screen rises in the b
music begins as he gets back into the car pulls away
music continues as the car cruises out past the old marquee a few letters still jumbled on it several bullet holes around them
music continues as sam drives thinking music continues as the car crosses the scrubland back toward town
dusk turns to night music continues as sam cruises past pilars house
the car is not in the driveway paloma hangs out with a couple friends under the porch light laughing music continues as sams car pulls into the high school lot
he looks up toward the school music continues
we can see pilar through the lighted window of her classroom preparing something on the blackboard music ends as sam leans back to wait pilar digs in her bag for
her car keys as she makes her way across the lot
she sees something slows reacting then brings us to sam in his car
he has parked head to foot next to hers
they look at each other for a long moment softly follow me
pilars car appears closely followed by sams
the cafe has closed for the night
sam and pilar sit on chairs next to each other facing the window talking softly
the streetlight shining through the letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces we thought we were something didnt we
i look at my kids in school tenth eleventh graders
thats who we were
i mean what did we know about anything
pilar looks at him when nando died it was so sudden i was kind of in shock for awhile
then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i didnt have any idea what to do with it
you know the other day you asked why i came back
i came back cause you were here
she gets up and we follow her across the dark room to the jukebox
she looks at the selections my mother hasnt changed the songs since i was
she puts in a quarter punches some numbers
a mexican ballad comes on
she crosses back to sam holds her hand out
he stands to greet her
they slow dance in the empty cafe sam and pilar finish making love
they lie beside each other shaking a little wow
how come it feels the same
i dont know
it just feels good
so what are we gonna do about this
more i hope
pilar smiles looks around the room how long have you lived here
theres nothing on the walls
no pictures dont have kids
other pictures i dont know its nothing i want to look back on
like your story is over
ive felt that way yeah
sbe puts her head on his cbest it isnt
not by a long shot
he holds her and they lie silently for a moment pilar yeah
what was your fathers name
paloma sits on the top step of the porch reading teen magazines
pilar steps out behind her dressed casually and squints at the day she finally got in its saturday
you got in late last night
i had uhm school business
paloma gives her a look then holds a fashion page up for her to see can i get this
nobody really wears that stuff paloma
i could name five girls at school who have one just like it enough with the clothes just cause you went to catholic school and wore a uniform
i only went for my last two years
oh my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys
pilar steps out into the sun did it work
hollis is sitting alone in a booth working on some heuvos rancheros
sam slides in across from him morning hollis
quite a do the other day
it meant a lot to folks that you said something
you thought any more about our murder
we have a murder
i wish i could tell you i remembered something new but i cant
i got an idea what happened
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoes club and his house wade ran into buddy deeds
i think buddy put a bullet in him waited for him to die threw him in the trunk of the sheriffs car and drove him out by the army post
i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back
hollis sits back to look sam in the eye you lived in the mans house what seventeen eighteen years
and you didnt get to know him any better than that
i got to go see somebody in san antonio today
your memory gets any better ill be back tonight
sam stands and walks away
we hold on hollis his appetite gone chet steps around to the side entrance we start on a statue of a buffalo soldier made from spent bullets and shell casings
then pan to another then widen to see chet as he pokes his head in the bell of the door ringing
he steps in cautiously looking around the room
on the walls there are photo blowups some artifacts handlettered information on cardboard
chet stops to look up at a picture of a barechested black man with a couple of feathers stuck in his headband thats john horse
chet turns to see otis standing back by the door from the bar spanish in florida called him juan caballo
looks at picture he a black man or an indian
steps in both
otis crosses to the poker table begins to clean up he was part of the seminole nation got pushed down into the everglades in pioneer days
african people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them married up had children
when the spanish give up florida the u
army come down to move all them indian peoples off to oklahoma the trail of tears
smiles they teaching that now
only a couple of em held out this man john horse and his friend wild cat and a fella name of osceola
army put all of them in prison and osceola died but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten fifteen years
beat zach taylor and a thousand troops at lake okeechobee
so they stayed in florida
they got tired of fighting went to the indian territories for a while
but the slave raiders were on em even there and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to mexico
crossed at eagle pass
they move on to some photos of very african looking people dressed in beautiful seminole clothing men worked for santa anna down there waited out the civil war
the land wasnt much to feed people on so in they come north and put up at fort duncan and the men joined up what was called the seminole negro
best trackers either side of the border
bandits rustlers texas rednecks kiowa comanche they fought against the indians
same as they done in mexico
but they were indians themselves
they were in the army
like your father
surprised you know who i am
i got a pretty good guess
that guy who got shot you didnt go telling your father you were here
are you kidding
and face a court martial
smiles hes a pretty tough old man huh
no sports if i dont keep a b average no tv on school nights no pdas public display of affection
every time he moves up a rank its like hes got to tighten the screws a little more well i mean just cause he didnt you know didnt have a
shrugs hes still pissed off about it
when youre his age youll still be pissed off about him
chet nods looks around so how come you got into all this
these are our people
there were paynes in florida oklahoma piedras negras couple of em won the whatsit congressional medal of honor so im part indian
by blood you are
but blood only means what you let it
my father says the day youre born you start from scratch no breaks and no excuses and you got to pull yourself up on your own
sad well hes living proof of that son
athena stands at attention as del sits at his desk reviewing her record
he lets her stand for a long time before speaking private johnson are you unhappy in the army
no sir then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested youre the only one who came up positive for drugs
im sorry sir
when you were given the opportunity to enlist a kind of contract was agreed upon
i think the army has honored its part of that agreement
yes sir do you believe in what were doing here private johnson
i i can do the job sir
you dont sound too enthusiastic
i am sir
what exactly do you think your job is private
do whatever they say
the the officers
and thats the job
nothing about serving your country
athena is confused hesitates to speak these arent trick questions private
youll be given an article and be going into the adcap program one way or the other
what happens after that is up to you
im just trying to understand how somebody like you thinks
hesitant you really want to know sir
its their country
this is one of the best deals they offer
del knows he asked for it but doesnt like the answer how do you think i got to be a colonel
work hard be good at your job
do whatever they tell you
do whatever they tell you i mean follow orders sir
with your attitude private im surprised you want to stay in the service
i do sir
because its a job
struggling outside its its such a mess its chaos
athena is sure shes overstepped her rank why do you think they let us in on the deal
they got people to fight
arabs yellow people whatever
might as well use us
do you think youve been discriminated against on this post
not at all
any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers
they all been real straight with me
del stands thinking trying not to bullshit her it works like this private every soldier in a war doesnt have to believe in what hes fighting for
most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad you try not to get them killed try not to get them extra duty try not to
embarrass yourself in front of them
he is right in her face now why dont you start with that
youre dismissed private
thank you sir
athena salutes steps out
del looks out the window troubled by the encounter
a battered car full of mexican day workers rolls toward the mexican side checkpoint enrique sits squeezed between workers in the back
the driver never stops talking as the officer waves them through
julia es demasiado flaca para mime gusto mas mujeres con algo en frente o muy altas como cindy crofor
quisiera montar esa caballa julias too skinny for me i like women with something up front or really tall like cindy crawford
id like to ride that horse sams car is parked on the street in front of an expensive looking house in a tree lined neighborhood sams ex wife bunny kincaid
shuffles across her living room in slippers crossing to turn off a big screen tv playing football highlights
bunny wears shorts a houston oilers sweatshirt and a dallas cowboys cap
the living room is like a sports museum signed footballs team posters a bookcase filled with tapes of texas pro and college football games the longhorns gonna kick some serious

daddy hired a pinhead to take your job
he says so himself
says even my son in law was better than this pinhead i got now
bunny is that stuff i left in the garage still there

my bunny might have done something with her life she wasnt so high strung
or tightly wound that was another one

daddy rounds em up
you arent talking about money their beady little eyes go dead
you didnt uhm you didnt have one of your fires did you
the stuff i left in the garage some of it was my fathers you watch the draft this year
course you didnt idiot question
they try to make it dramatic like theres some big surprise who picks who in the first round
only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months
doctors reports highlight reels coaches evaluations psychological profiles hell i wouldnt be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys have em analyzed
all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad
compared to that what you know about the person you get married to dont amount to diddly does it
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke didnt you sam
all that time we were first seeing each other you didnt know i was tightly wound it wasnt just you bunny
no it wasnt was it
you didnt exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul did you
she looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment your shits still in the garage if thats what you came for
sam nods stands
bunny is in tears pounds
this boy from west side plays tackle both ways
bench presses pounds
you imagine having that much weight on top of you
be hard to breathe
hard to swallow
i think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest
i only got my little girl now he says shes my lifeline
then he tells me i cant be in the box anymore if i cant control myself
sonofabitch dont even watch the damn game just sits there drinking with his bidness friends look up at the tv now and then
i do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people
edging out you look good bunny
its nice to see you
i like it when you say that sam
enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping into a funky apartment building
we tilt up to the second floor balcony where a little boy is watching the street there are eight people not including the little boy on the balcony
all are securing their possessions rolling things in blankets filling shopping bags and grain sacks
enrique steps in todos estamos
anselma reaches up from the floor to take his hand van a disparar a nosotros

he examines an envelope no stamp or postmark pulls a letter out reads dearest buddy he puts the letter down for a moment thinks

enrique turns as he hears a womans cry
the line goes slack then nestor steps out of the darkness to join him que paso

moonlight kicks off the surface of the water
we hear splashing the frightened voice of a young woman donde esta

mercedes starts the car in english enrique
in english del steps in
chet sits at the table drawing a cartoon in panels
del looks over his shoulder for a moment a tank rolling over barbed wire cannon and machine gun blasting away homework
i finished that
im just messing around
you got to be in the army you might as well have something slick to drive
so youre going into the army
chet looks at him not in a good mood then goes back to his drawing thats the general plan isnt it
del watches for a long moment thinking softly thats up to you
chet looks at his father again
all this is news to him the army isnt for everybody
chet cant quite believe he is hearing this
del crosses to the refrigerator not that i dont think youd be good at it but you know i wouldnt be disappointed if you decided to do something else with
chet nods begins to play again considering the possibilities
del is making an effort and he doesnt have much practice hows your room shaping up
im pretty much moved in
an awkward silence tentative are we going to ever see your father
he lives here right
del pulls some food out watching chet as he draws maybe well clean that thing out back up have a barbecue next weekend
we could invite him and his wife over
chet flips the page of his sketchbook he makes his own sauce
the neons off but there are a couple cars in the lot and a light within
sam pulls into the lot steps out approaches the door the door opens
the place is empty now except for otis standing behind the bar deep in conversation with hollis sitting on a stool
both swivel to look around guiltily as they hear sam step in sam walks in slowly crossing the floor to bring us back to the two men fellas
im not open
we were just talking
hollis probably told you we found charley wade
how about that
people start digging holes in this county theres no telling whatll come up
he sits a few stools away from hollis you two saw it didnt you
you two saw it when buddy killed him
hollis and tis look at each other imonna find out one way or the other
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met yeah and my mother was a saint

he looks at the two older men for a long moment that night in the cafe he didnt stay long after you left did he hollis
maybe he decided hed gone too far with wade maybe he figured he better not wait for the sheriff to get behind him
so he stepped out to see if he could catch up and you were here at the club that night werent you o
otis sighs begins to speak softly i was here
he turns to look toward the door as he reminisces and we pan away with his gaze id been running a game on the side after hours craps draw poker
on the weekends
roderick didnt know about it
more important charley wade didnt know about it cause i didnt want to cut him in
i suppose id been drinking some and i was pretty full of myself in those days but hell i just didnt expect the man so early sheriff wade and young
hollis step in the door and we are back in
blues harmonica fades up wailing from the jukebox
they stop and look at the place music continues
the club is empty dark
a light shines from the back room
smoke fills the air and young otis sits back laughing a large pile of money on the table in front of him
the other four black men at the table arent doing so well
one by one they all look up past the camera to the door music continues
young otis doesnt see at first engaged in dealing the cards
finally he senses the presence looks up music continues
wade stands over the table in the f
young hollis hanging back in the doorway
wade is smiling his cold smile cursing music continues
trying to look unimpressed cold and unblinking
music continues twisted in a snarl as he curses
music continues music continues
we shoot past wades body as the other men step away from the table grab their hats and hurry out the side door
young otis is left sitting at the table
wade starts walking toward him music continues
his eyes following as wade comes to stand over him music continues
wade grabs the table and violently jerks it over onto young otis cards and money flying music continues
watching squeamishly as wade goes to work on young otis the overhead light swinging wildly music continues
young otis is hurled out of the back room face bruised and bleeding
wade follows then young hollis wade puts his gun next to young otiss ear cursing at him
young otis gets to his feet goes behind the bar music continues
young otis slaps an envelope full of cash onto the counter music continues
he waves his pistol indicating something behind otis music continues
we shoot past wade at the counter as otis turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind music continues
lying open an old pistol inside of it
young otis reaches music continues
frowning as he senses something wrong music continues
wade levels his gun at young otiss back then turns to wink at hollis like he did before he shot eladio music continues
finger closing around the trigger of the music continues
mouth open in horror music continues
eyes burning as he aims music continues
stepping in the door seeing calls out music continues
turning to see buddy blam
a bullet plows through his neck knocking him back against the bar
his gun falls from his hand horrified splattered with the sheriffs blood
music music continues
twenty dollar bills have spilled out of the envelope and are soaking up blood calm and hard eyed
as he steps forward we see his pistol is still in its holster
he reaches out and takes the
from young holliss shaking hand looks him in the eye till hollis looks back then looks toward young otis we pan with his gaze to a close up of otis
back in the present
the music fades sheriff charley had some real big friends in politics then and if the truth come out it wasnt going to go easy on hollis
he shrugs i dont know why i trusted buddy with it dont know why he trusted me
the first time i ever talked with him was right there and then with a dead white man leakin blood on the floor between us
he could charm the scales off a rattler buddy deeds
this isnt what sam was expecting
hollis watches his face the three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under
cant say i was much help
and the ten thousand
he figured it would make the disappearance look better and that mexican gal was just scrapin by after charley killed her man
they didnt get hooked up till late time went on people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been
sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where charley fell
he has a lot of information to deal with whats the call sam
sam rolls it over in his mind before answering dont think the rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have
word gets out who that body was people are gonna think buddy done it
sam gets up buddys a goddamn legend
he can handle it
he heads for the door night fellas
hollis and otis watch him go we see sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the deserted drive in lot staring up at the ruined screen
pilars car rolls in parks beside him pilar gets out kisses sam sits by him on the hood whens the picture start
sam looks at her for a moment you gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other
shell figure it out sooner or later
i dont have to ask permission anymore if thats what you mean

shrugs couple months before i was born try a year and a half
he bands her an old snapshot
pilar looks at it buddy and young mercedes on the lake
buddy with his shirt off on one end of a sailboat mercedes in a bathing suit both smiling for the camera pilar hands the photo back to him tries to
be calm ive never seen my mother in a bathing suit before

buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county
pilar looks away struggling not to cry they cant pull this on me
it isnt fair i dont believe this he paid the hospital bill when you were born
your mom always calls you our beautiful daughter in the letters she wrote to him
from the first time i saw you at school all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected
i remember thinking you were the one part of my life buddy didnt have a piece of a silence both of them wondering what the next move should be so
youre not going to want to be with me anymore
sam knows what he feels but doesnt have the words im not having any more children
