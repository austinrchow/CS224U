scuffing of feet
approximately sixty four hundred hours before desert storm we were on a routine recon inside iraqi controlled terrain assessing troop strength for what saddam hussein promised to be the mother
of all wars
but turned out to be just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later
prowling across undulating land dotted with burning oil wells that give the vague impression of well hell
the inky sky is awash with stars
army bradley fighting vehicle and matching hummer sit waiting
muffled thump of rap music thrums from the bradley and low voices stray from the open doors of the hummer
why cant we go directly in
a topographical map glows on the lcd screen of a laptop portable faintly lighting the faces of capt
ben marco and his big gentle french guide laurent tokar
pointing this way
yes well i see the captain enjoys the road less travelled
marco is seemingly unflappable completely engaged by life
the captain enjoys not dragging his ass down the highway for every tom dick and qadhafi to take a whack at
laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach
of course it is very bad here
and here here here here mines
he refers to some satellite surveillance maps nobody at command said anything about exxon and global petroleum hired private contractors to do the work in as part of their asset
beat hired an iraqi firm in fact who now well only they know where the little nordic fuckers are planted
turns away sgt
and we rush toward a soldier in a lawn chair face lifted to the heavens sitting directly between the two armored vehicles
this is sgt
raymond prentiss shaw late twenties haunted and aloof
suddenly behind him sergeant
rolling in two minutes
standing up ill rally the troops
music blares around eight soldiers including wiseguy pfc
ed mavole crowded into space designed for four yo melvin
you gonna play that hand or hatch it
al melvin grunts then they all look up almost in unison at raymond when he swings open the back door
bobby baker a slender man barely eighteen a driver ejects a cd from the onboard stereo
were moving out
he shuts the door again
then some laughter from inside the vehicle
he shifts his shoulders walks back into the darkness
marco bug like in night goggles drives the infamous highway of death a macabre landscape of abandoned cars trucks minivans shopping baskets broken wooden pushcarts and festering fires pots and
pans and clothes and personal belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side of the road
laurent rides shotgun
raymond is in the back facing forward rifle at ease
why dont i ever ride in the bradley with the other enlisted personnel
hesitates maybe i enjoy your company sergeant
sir i dont want to be singled out for special treatment because of my mothers position too late for that shaw
as a charter member of the lucky sperm club your benefits include unlimited suck up from high ranking officers hoping to curry congressional favor for their future career moves
if you want to ride in the bradley hey i got no objections
worried trust me sir i dont wish to ride in the bradley with the others im just
beat the men dont care for me very much
no they dont
on the plus side you dont really like them either
thats absolutely correct captain
it you know
marco follows laurents gaze out the side window soldiers on camels slip along like ghosts pacing the hummer parallel at maybe fifty yards through the drivers side window more of
the camel cavalry tracks with them camels
you gotta be kidding me
glancing to his rear view mirror
two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness on either side of the bradley fighting vehicle they slam together in a pincer wedge just in front of it and
the bradley crashes into them climbs over them off balance and smashes down onto the roof of one of the trucks and is effectively low bridged tracks spinning unable to move dark figures scurry from the trucks
the hummer skids around in a tight stops facing back at the helpless bradley
automatic weapons fire in bursts bright and ricochet harmlessly away in the hummer marco scrambles up out of his seat pops the roof hatch and screams at raymond take the
as marco emerges to take the handles of the roof mounted machine gun drops his nvgs back over his eyes and fires at the dispersing enemy figures around the bradley
marcos cover fire rattles insanely off the armor screaming overlapping quarter million dollars of u
army hardware rat fucked by a coupla used toyotas
he grabs a fire extinguisher and aims it at flames flaring from a console of instruments
a lone enemy soldier runs forward lugging a personal rocket launcher disappears behind a dune marco coming off the machine gun grabbing raymonds rifle and rolling toward the back of
the hummer as he kicks out of the rear door
sniper with an rpg
marco is firing before his feet touch the ground
rocket launcher man does a face plant in the sand
the bradley its rear door heaves open and our guys spill out coughing hacking guns ready
the hummer same time careens suddenly away exposing a surprised marco raymond has lost control fishtails into a deep trough the hummer lurches onto its side engine racing wheels spinning
uselessly in air stalling oh shit shaw another enemy with a rocket launcher slides around an overturned trailer and fires the rocket hits the bradley fighting vehicle at a slant into its exposed belly and the truck explodes marcos team scattering pressing themselves into the sand covering their heads amplified were you scared
thick dark smoke momentarily blankets the road
waiting for an answer stares earnestly upward at behind a podium in his crisp dress uniform
his current self older tired
lost for a moment
long beat you dont really have time to be scared
uneasy rustling of an o
an air conditioner kicks in rumbling becoming
raises his head
sees the bradley in flames
the hummer on its side in the ditch headlights aglow shadows of enemy soldiers retreating across the dunes
military helicopters materializing out of the smoke and darkness
no sound i couldnt hear anything as i was temporarily deaf from the explosion of the bradley
soldiers with gas masks lean out of the open doors of the helicopters and drop gas canisters down on marcos team
marcos squad the effect of the gas is immediate mavole collapses in his tracks
melvin points a gun skyward and fires a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter
then he falls on his back
heavy luminous yellow orange vapor swirls across the battle with marco his shirt pulled up over his mouth and nose he wheels to get away from the drifting gas feet
grabs a dazed bobby baker by the collar i got your back baker
and tries to pull him to safety
he looks up marcos p
the hummer is no longer stalled on its side in the ditch but improbably is righted again back on four wheels and attacking
a vision of raymond behind the machine gun firing at the advancing enemy with marco trying to process this
behind the podium
takes a sip of water then and with complete disregard for his own life and safety sgt
shaw single handedly engaged an entire company of the enemy
behind the podium repeating himself of the enemy the hummer weaves through the wreckage one of its tires whirling in flames raymond has the machine gun spitting bullets recklessly at
the helicopters like a cartoon hero rote sgt
shaw repeatedly attacked from a mobile position confounding the enemy one of the helicopters explodes the other spins away trailing smoke and flames
neutralizing his aerial support behind the podium
and finally dividing and defeating an overwhelmingly superior force
a boy scout luncheon banquet
a full chicken buffet table banners flags and over one hundred scouts leaders and dads all looking somewhat attentively up at the guest speaker u
army major ben marco
like edmonds in korea holderman in viet nam raymond shaw was awarded the congressional medal of honor
i signed the recommendation myself
a hand shoots up
marco nods toward it
were you wounded
i was turning away from the overturned humvee and right into a head high rifle butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas mask wearing figure
i fell had a uh concussion lost focus sgt
shaw took command a disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily as did your unit sustain any casualties
two of my people were killed
no more questions
the disheveled man melvin coughs
marco pointedly ignores him
the medal of honor is the highest award to which any soldier can aspire
from the jungles of iwo jima to the desert of kuwait what these brave men ive talked about today did will never be forgotten
since only medals have been given to a total of more than million americans in arms
only three have been awarded in the last years
maybe someday one of you fine boys will earn one yourself in defense of this great nation
a scoutmaster thin bearded stands up major marco on behalf of troops and just like to thank you for coming to talk to us about the medal of honor and
your interesting experiences in the armed services
thanks for listening
my family has claimed the army as a trade ever since a young gunnery officer who grew up with hernando de soto left spain for a look at the upper
beat my life is in service to my country
you ever wish itd been you
won the medal
been the hero
something causes marco to hesitate
then as if hed rehearsed it no im just proud to have been there
he sits down
spattering of polite applause
the luncheon is breaking up
a couple of scouts chase each other through the clusters of men
men stop him to shake his hand and thank him for coming
marco turns stares blankly into the eyes of the bedraggled looking man who half salutes
its al melvin sir
from your unit
marco stares hard
melvin looks like a homeless guy his clothes rumpled his fingernails stained and broken his eyes wild with fatigue and paranoia
jesus how are you intense i have these dreams major
you and me
mavole and baker
beat see i remember it happened the way you just said
and then i dont
well we had a pretty rough time over there al it was hairy and it was a long time ago now
do you have dreams sir
everybody has dreams corporal not these
marco stares at him
no i dont
melvins face falls disappointed
fumbling in his clothes he finds a spiral notebook dog eared and fat with newspaper clippings tries to press it into marcos hands
its bad sir
its making me crazy
i write it down every night after i wake up i try to get it all it doesnt always go together all of what i can remember and gentle al
you know maybe you should be going to the va and talking to a doctor i mean if these dreams are really ive been to doctors
the notebook drops between them and pages scatter on the floor
both men go down to collect them im so stuck sir
i mean i remember shaw saving us but it does not make sense it should have been you
and shaw he
well thats its over and done
weve got to move on marco rocks back on his heels as he stares down at a sketchy portrait of an arabic woman whose face is covered with intricate designs
marco stares curiously as if he recognizes her i cant get my hand around it
i thought maybe if you had the dreams
shaken you need money
self conscious people are staring melvin shoves the notebook back inside his jacket
here marco already digging for a crumpled twenty
melvin waves it off backing away suddenly pissed
i dont need your money
well look al i gotta go
awkward it was great seeing you
and good luck to you
melvin just scowls sadly at marco
flash of glass a door opens and closes and marco is gone
marco is motionless in his car head resting against the steering wheel
he straightens up with a thousand yard stare
his hands are trembling
slowly he grips the steering wheel
tighter and tighter
until the trembling stops
a pretty cashier rosie empties marcos basket bottled water three romance novels a bottle of no doz a bag of tomatoes and two dozen boxes of instant noodles
marco comes up the stairs with his groceries
an elderly woman sticks her head out from her apartment door thirty seven
marco stops looks at her blankly
from the landing
every week it gets longer
im worried about you
he takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her
from the landing
every week it gets longer
im worried about you
he takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her
none of these involve slave traders or sheiks abby
blushes what do i owe you
sad a smile
he enters and a visible exhaustion overtakes him
he turns on the t
and sags to the sofa bed drained
yellowing newspaper clippings and wire photographs of raymond shaw
senators son saves unit in kuwait
lost marcos not letting anything go
news coverage the crowded floor of a political convention
with public anxiety rekindled by the events of bloody friday with the war on terror marching into yet another year no end in sight yawns his eyelids flutter he shudders
awake digs in his grocery bag for the no doz and shakes out half a dozen
which he swallows dry
the american people are looking for a new agenda but because this party remains deeply divided on so many issues the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the
key unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way johnson helped kennedy in
then hes up on his feet moving to the kitchen through the small cramped space overflowing with books unopened boxes from amazon
com and barnes and noble
marco sits at a clearing on the tiny kitchen table eating instant noodles and trying to read prizzis honor
on the t
we need to look inward attend to our own house the danger to our country is not from some terrorists at large terrorists weve helped engender with twenty years of
failed foreign policy an open cabinet door behind marco reveals rows and rows of instant noodles in the cupboard
news coverage the crowded floor of a political convention
a poised silvery avuncular man senator thomas jordan according to the title on the screen on the podium no the real danger is from suspending civil liberties gutting the bill
of rights allowing our fear to destroy our democratic ideals the same speech continues largely ignored by congressman raymond prentiss shaw
still intense and moody the new
raymond shaws suit is expensive and crisp his hair perfect
hes playing solitaire
murmurs i am not a professional politician
i am not a professional politician
because once we start overturning our constitutional protections our enemies have won
a professional politician
knocking on his door it opens and secret service agent evan anderson removes his key while sen
eleanor shaw pretty and ageless sweeps in closing the door on her aide gillespie raymond
darling what were you going to do make me stand out there like room service
soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone she kisses her son on the lips straightens his collar his tie lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for
a little too long and never stops talking i asked downstairs and miss freeman your wrangler helpful ms
freeman said you were up here practicing your speech
honestly i dont understand why you insist upon isolating yourself people adore you raymond they crave your company and yet here you are holed up as if you were some
kind of emotionally challenged individual like your father instead of raymond prentiss shaw a handsome intelligent people loving war hero with a great deal to offer to his party and his country
baby i havent even asked you a question
your hair is too flat
and that tie
the tie is wrong
no to the question youre going to ask
no to all the questions you pretend to want to ask the tie something a little less busy
and no you may not engage in your usual back door political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket
youre not interested
i thought you were
did i miss my cue
of course im interested i wouldnt be here if i wasnt but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like thomas jordan which im sure was your
let democracy run its course mother
let the people decide
now ellie stares at him mouth agape
im sorry for a second there i thought it was your father speaking that dreaded shaw blood rising and the stink of defeat made me nauseous
mother and excuse me when have i ever attacked the honorable mr
jordan despite the shameful way his daughter misled you that summer at the shore
mother you chased her away if thats how you want to remember it
you ruined everything
honey youre oversimplifying things somewhat but yes okay i promise promise i will stay out of it
you have my word
raymond stares at her
after all youre young and you have plenty of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover as your father did that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science
and the meek do not happily inherit the earth but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs chewed up digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of american politics
raymond rolls his eyes
she ruffles his hair again heads into the bedroom
one day you will im sure tearfully memorialize me in your acceptance speech
dont you have a different tie in here
your grandfather always let me pick his ties
raymond smooths his hair back down
im wearing the one i have on
raymond is speaking
his tie is different
so is he now he exudes a telegenic warmth and vivacity his manner confident easy open
ive always said i am not a professional politician although i hold and have been held well hugged in elected office a winning smile you all know my mother senator
eleanor prentiss shaw
a chorus of cheers and appreciative laughter hes won them over already
marco on the sofa stares hard at the televised raymond shaw as and some of you no doubt remember my father
the late senator john shaw
he seems to want to say more but doesnt ive been honored to serve my two terms in congress
but i also grew up on the hill
ive seen how the game is played by professionals marco reaches for his steaming cup of coffee his eyes never leaving the screen he just doesnt get this at all
ellie in the f
intently watching a monitor while in the deep b
slightly out of focus we can see raymond speaking and his convention audience beyond
how deals are struck committees bullied agendas bought and sold and with apologies to my mother i wish to remain an amateur
i believe democracy is not negotiable
we need to secure tomorrow today
ellie shakes her head fondly and begins to move away as tracking with ellie and gillespie and his two aides and a posse of three other formidable looking politicians through
a hallway crowded with network camera crews stray delegates high school marching band members and a complete drill team in red white and blue sequined leotards as bluffing
that was the inference
raymonds speech echoes incoherently through the corridor
they should be down on their fat white knees thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku
you gave them every opportunity to do the right thing senator
glances at him no
i gave them one opportunity
and that was unusually generous of me
she pushes through a door and into raymonds speech plays low on a television and half a dozen delegates and power players with arthur for president buttons grimly watch ellie
party chairman vaughn utly anticipates her the decision is final senator
tom jordan is on the ticket
we dont need your blessing but wed like it
smiling before we get started im dying to know which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a sound bite from nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers
off our busses is unconstitutional
all the research indicates that an arthur jordan ticket sits quite well with the american public and sits quite well translates into how many votes
your son is largely unknown outside of new york
his public service his congressional record while commendable is my son is a war hero
cheerful governor arthur has agreed to consider raymond for a cabinet post
a cold silence
we didnt come here to have a discussion
senator to her posse did we come here to have a discussion
ellie you dont have the votes to block this or even push the nomination to a second ballot
ignores him even running against this cut and fold vice president with his partys record of abysmal failure at home and abroad arthur is still unelectable without help
cold hard logic consider
the governor is a corn belt candidate who scratch and sniff looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal labor intellectual dukakis was but without thank god the helmet
beat assume our intrepid arthur can carry the northeast plus his home ground and california
were still dead in the south and southwest where they win by landslides
the mid central is a toss up
tom jordan actually becomes a liability in florida because of his castro appeasement profile and in the carolinas where he fumbles the military vote over his terrorism isnt a war
its a social disease nonsense
the room is surreally silent
ellie spins and moves like a televangelist preaching to the frightened faithful
you know this
your own polls and surveys back me up
beat youre counting on jordan to help you get the black vote women college kids my gut instinct says he wont and arthur holding the center where hes soft at
and whos to say the president wont throw troops into another third world skirmish pushing his sidekicks approval ratings up into the eighties again and the campaign off the front
were confident this is a winning ticket ellie
whats your margin of error
beat i can swing that and you know it
i can swing seven away from you more than enough to split the party and over her and deny us the white house for four more years
not even you would do that senator
ellie stares at them
outside suddenly the marching band begins playing its a grand old flag and hurries out onto the roaring convention floor
america is facing the greatest test of its history gentlemen
not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the
only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them
am i the only one in this room paying attention to the nsa reports
we are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm on our own soil while our policies remain shackled by jordan style one worlders who insist that human beings are essentially good
and that power is something shameful and evil
then make no mistake the people of this great country are frightened
they know whats coming
they can feel it
and we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar or arm them with a young vibrant populist congressman a war hero with heart forged by enemy
fire in the desert in the dark when american lives hung in the balance
one of ellies back room adversaries at the microphone as balloons fall and the crowd cheers
proud to offer into nomination the name of the next vice president of these united states raymond shaaawwwwww
the images on the television flicker across marco who stares with apparent disbelief at the coverage a remarkable development hands held high linked with the presidential candidate robert arthur who
is clearly eclipsed by raymonds youth his heroic good looks his natural charisma
from the convention floor like a long shot catching the favorite on the back stretch of the derby
tv b a staccato flurry of images raymond and his mother newstv b clips still photos appear behind a major media icon raymond shaw bears the lineage of the fabled
prentiss family dynasty grandson of legendary industrialist and diplomat tyler prentiss son of controversial senator eleanor prentiss shaw who took over the seat vacated by her husband the esteemed john shaw when he died tragically over twenty years ago
marco taking it all in for many raymond prentiss shaw is an enigma millionaire harvard honors student who enlists in the military intercut news file footage of raymonds personal history
refusing the officers commission to which he was entitled
the medal of honor winner beloved by the men of the lost patrol he saved from an enemy ambush and then guided back across the open desert to safety

hell hes probably the kindest bravest warmest most selfless human being ive ever known
marco reacts to the image of melvin from ten years ago young engaging eyes alive marcos lips move in sync with words of melvins statement bravest warmest selfless ever known
as if he knows it by heart his mind shifting the war hero who dedicated himself to public service after desert storm
push in on marco
his eyes distant glazed tranced the revolutionary science of bio genetics which has literally now commands the screen plump and glistening in an olive skinned hand decorated with intricate henna
tattoos transformed the common garden tomato through genome level intervention from that fragile fickle vulnerable fruit one must struggle to simply nurture to maturity the supertomato slowly bisects itself opening oozing viscous red liquid revealing an inner structure far more suggestive of the human brain than any tomato weve ever seen before
into a resilient dependable categorically superior individual in every conceivable way moving through marcos dreamscape where the mysterious arabic woman from melvins drawings henna tattoos on her face as well
as her hands thick blood red pulp of the supertomato dripping between her fingers glides dreamily across intricate sun bleached tile work through a gathering of similarly clothed arabic women
a few older arabic men are off to one side expressionless hands in pockets
strappingly resistant to parasite disease over ripening and systemic failure while at the same time fiercely heat and water tolerant impressions of soldiers members of marcos squad flak jackets and
bdus rifles at ease some squatting some leaning against the wall

we hear a sandstorm raging outside causing long draperies to flutter and pop
strong impressions of pfcs ed mavole and bobby baker
yet note the complexity of the frontal lobe nevertheless retaining a sweet juicy plumpness reminiscent of the finest english beefsteak or italian plum
impressions of the american flag
impressions of sgt
raymond shaw he waits for the mysterious woman like an obedient schoolboy dutifully holding his service revolver in his hand
those of you with ties to the intelligence community may recall the cias misguided mk ultra program the kgbs novichok research and similar half assed ventures in great britain and
china under the lay term of mind control
the bedouin women begin to make a spooky trilling sound their zaghareet as the mysterious womans voice starts to morph into a mans voice street corner schizophrenics with tin foil
on their heads offer sad proof of the failure of those endeavors
she smiles creepy puts a hand on raymonds shoulder i can assure you this is a whole new ball game
marco is here too his head wrapped in a bandage hes wearing hospital greens
wires and tubes are rigged to his head chest arms and legs like some high tech marionette all coiling up into the shadows of the high ceiling into thicker cables
and tubes beneath which robotic bracket arms adjust whirring softly with his every movement
hes drugged to the gills jerking with spasms as low voltage electricity courses through his brain
and the womens shrill zaghareet peaks captain marco the mysterious arabic woman has become the sleek caucasian scientist atticus noyle whose oddly accented english is flawless when youre rescued and
returned with your patrol to command headquarters what will be among the first duties you will undertake
on marco all rigged up with his wires ill recommend sergeant shaw for the medal of honor maam
he saved our lives terminated the enemy and led us across the desert to safety
now the dreamscape visuals seem rear projected on luminous rippling white fabric
the bedouin people tomato brain images the mystery woman appear as two dimensional filmed images flickering across draperies
but there were casualties
there are always casualties maam
the dream sounds wind fabric women chanting emanate from audio speakers the sandstorms wind caused by huge moveable fans
impression of an old man shaking a percussive gourd mesmerizing
impressions of the squad all rigged up like marco with tubes and wires
laurent glides behind them lab coat surgical gloves on his hands
a collection of remote cameras on scaffolding and tripods buzz and whir as they swivel to follow him
here then are ten subject soldiers in a clinically induced functional fugue state
hyperdelusional that theyve been bivouacked in a small caravansary to wait out a sandstorm
marco blinks sees the mysterious arabic woman dressed in noyles simple suit
smiles a simple pavlovian parlor trick
snapping of fabric the wind gets louder
marco looks around no more tubes or wires and noyle is now a projected image on the fabric
the dreamscape is bending smearing
our candidates course of treatment will of course involve considerably more sophisticated intervention over a sustained time period to ensure that a stable mechanism is irrevocably in place
we employ a kind of neurocellular conversion
psychological abreaction through genomic repurposing

how did you feel when you heard the news from the convention
a shrug isnt a feeling

almost angry glad for him
he deserves it
raymond shaw is probably the kindest bravest warmest most selfless human being most selfless human being ive ever
youve ever known
half a beat youre fucking with me major
i wouldnt do that sir
what other conclusion can i draw
marco says nothing
holding back what hes thinking
look weve been over this a million times
until you forgive yourself for what happened that night in kuwait the loss of your men for what you did for what you didnt do
no reaction from marco
hows public affairs
it sucks sir
i want to get back to intelligence

or rig her with an air horn
distractedly staring at a pretty young woman jocelyn jordan near the entrance

the men banter on gentlemen hows business
business is good

any better youll be a monopoly
theres the challenge

off their shared collegial laughter watches raymond take his leave from the manchurian global guys while at the bar the generals have established their beachhead of bloody marys with a
couple of younger men in navy whites every great civilization has been anchored by a great navy
you guys are sea chum ripe for some raghead with a rocket launcher to put a hole in your bucket
marco laughs deliberately trying to diffuse the tension
low if you cant behave yourselves generals were gonna spend the rest of the day watching the orioles game back at the hotel
whereupon raymond parades past with his secret service handlers oblivious to ben until he calls out
congressman sergeant shaw raymond turning but not stopping
strange dreamy hello captain
its major and as if it surprises him i need to talk to you
but he keeps walking okay
marco frowns watches raymond weave through the crowd towards jocie at the entrance
marco follows passing locked in fierce low battle off to one side voices hard rising out of the din the political extortion you committed in order to destroy my vice
presidential bid so that tom
so that you might vicariously bask in reflected limelight from your son overlapping tom please just because the party felt a younger more dynamic man could help the ticket i
dont think its fair for you to single me out and you know i have such contempt for you eleanor that when i think of you i actually fear for this country
raymond is nothing
a wild card at worst
but you you are the smiler who wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag and waits for her chance to strike
which i pray will never come
he wheels away
has found raymond with jocie outside but hangs back overhearing raymonds earnest and intense conversation with jocie who is slightly uncomfortable with this but trying to make light of it
but raymond my god its been so many years ive been married and divorced ive changed too
thats not what i but yes its great really i see that you have congratulations but my feelings havent
changed i mean
jocie starts to say something is at a loss for words i guess ive never stopped feeling wondering how it might have turned out you know between us if overlapping
raymond people cant rewrite their lives jocie i havent even been with another girl since we
stopped seeing each other doesnt that say something to you
that you must be just about the loneliest person on earth and it breaks my heart
raymond is staggered doesnt know what to say ive got to go good luck with the campaign
she hurries to a waiting limo her fathers already inside raymond still wants to say something he wants to stop her but
sergeant raymond shaw raymond turns what
marco slides in front of him with a disarming grin
i want to talk to you too
i know youre busy i just have to ask you he starts to move away but marco grabs his arm i saw al melvin the other day remember corporal melvin
raymond yanks his arm away dont touch me
okay sorry but melvin hes extremely disturbed about what happened to us on the recon patrol back in kuwait dont ever touch me
marcos eyebrows go up
raymonds secret service agent anderson slips himself between him smiling politely easing marco away tried the pad thai major
im told it rules
tense and unsmiling
what were you hoping hed say
we are is in a more formal setting lt
howard is with colonel garret and an enlisted soldier a woman taking notes i dont know sir
cautious now it isnt so much what he said or didnt say but his demeanor his attitude
sir i overheard an exchange he talks over this i think you hoped congressman shaw would say yes major ive had those same dreams
tomatoes and sandstorms
youre not nuts theres some crazy shit going down here
marco says nothing
major weve been down this road with you before yes
no sir not this road sir
but i hear what youre saying and i want to do this through the proper channels
are you back on your meds
colonel howard with respect ive had a dozen years of experts telling me ive got gulf war syndrome or a stress disorder
twelve years being a good soldier denying what every nerve ending in my body tells me is more real than not
one dream over and over
not variations on a dream the same one night after night after night your guilt and your jealousy require you to construct this
elaborate fiction so that you
no can avoid the truth
something happened to us in the desert ten years ago
not what we thought it was
and it happened on my watch
have you contacted any other members of the unit besides shaw and melvin
asked them about the dreams
from notes hes made owens died of cancer in
villalobos a car crash
atkins committed suicide
jamison was at the pentagon body never recovered
wilson im still trying to track down
garret and howard trade looks
sir i know i cant ask you to talk to congressman shaw not yet but al melvin its a phone call a quick q a look at his notebooks hear
what hes been dreaming and either he will support the credibility of what im saying or he wont
and ill shut up
and what is it you are saying exactly major
that you misrepresented falsified what happened in kuwait
about the medal of honor
in effect committed perjury
if you just talk to melvin ignores no no im sorry youre saying an entire squad of u
army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that raymond shaw deserved the medal of honor
and somehow youre the only one who knows the truth
marco looks down at his hands
you will stay clear of congressman shaw
and you will resume your meds major
that is an order
marco stands up to leave but major do you ever take a step back and consider why youve remained at rank for all these years
missed bosnia afghanistan iraqi freedom
while men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you
every day sir
favor raymond at a podium his vice presidential opponent slightly out of focus at his identical podium in the near b
mid rebuttal there are still vrf terrorists in sierra leone new terrorist alliances forming in many parts of asia and south america we cant simply suddenly relinquish our commitment to
world leaders who have stood by us
congressman shaw your rebuttal
marco on his phone the t
blaring under on the phone hello victor
hows it goin
listens public affairs sucks my friend
i miss you guys
listen favor guy from my old unit melvin alfred r
i need an
address on him i think hes here in d
yeah go ahead
holding marco studies the image of raymond
but meanwhile somebodys grandmother in a small american town is standing in her kitchen shes got her medicine bottle in one hand shes opening the refrigerator with the other
and shes thinking i can pay for my medicine or i can pay for my dinner
i cant do both
in america our mothers and grandmothers shouldnt have to worry about that
voice on the other end of marcos call but hes slow to respond mesmerized by the new raymond on the phone yeah yeah
as he starts to write an address there are gaps in this country
ugly chasms that we need to bridge
the side of a bus with a huge skin of gov
arthur and raymond shaw and the arthur shaw secure tomorrow campaign icon it slides away revealing marco crosses the street walks along a row of dilapidated apartments the gap between
rich and poor between government and people the area is desolate depopulated an economic wasteland
under a crumbling awning and into marco checks a room number hes written under an address on a scrap of paper
between true security and the notion of feeling safe
a night clerk sits behind bullet proof glass watching the televised debates
between what is real and what is not
about raymond dontcha love this guy
at the far end of a long and gloomy hallway we can see marco arrive at the door to melvins room
he hesitates then knocks al
al melvin its marco
he looks at his watch turns walks back down the narrow high ceilinged corridor haunting sounds of radios and televisions and broken conversations he disappears down the stairs raymond comes
down the brightly lit elegant hallway tired trailing anderson and his secret service entourage
the enemy is among us
the wolf is at the door
the fox is in the henhouse
the weasel is
the weasel is
they take his room keycard from him open the door anderson and another agent move through the suite securing it raymond losing steam the weasel is a weasel
frog and toad are friends
returning to the door and handing raymond his keycard
the phone begins to ring sir well be right outside
he closes the door after them
glances at his watch
then crosses to answer the phone
you have thirty seconds mother
ellie behind her desk
am i this predictable
you have no idea
im calling to compliment you mr
i thought you were magnificent tonight
so do all the network campaign experts
presidential was a word they used
raymonds second line flashes with another call
this compassionate vigilance thing is working quite well for you
i might have to convert
i happen to believe in it
of course you do
now raymond goodnight mother
raymond raymond punches a button and puts his mother on hold
ellie listens to the dead air of the other end of her call
raymond stares mom on hold flashing red light
the second call light fluttering
punches the line lifts the receiver yes
british accent sergeant shaw
irritably who is this
close on raymonds ear sergeant raymond shaw
cocks his head eyes searching the corners of the room
sound a distant desert wind building
close on raymonds eye raymond prentiss shaw
raymonds senses appear to quicken now as the lighting in the room changes morphing somehow even as sounds of steady percussion and the zaghareet the wailing cry of the arab
women rise out of the wind eyes alight yes
everything is brighter sharper more luminous more etched than it was just moments ago listen then enter the bathroom and go to the closet there
raymond moves with tremendous assurance across the living room and down the hallway and into the bathroom
light flashing eleanor on hold stops double sinks walk in shower and a huge closet which raymond opens to reveal a thick panel in the back wall just being unmoored
the rushing roar of a sandstorm and steps through gloves and soft soled shoes
raymond just watching as he places a small clam shell video screen open on the counter we can see a b w surveillance view of the corridor outside raymonds room
with anderson sitting the night watch reading
the man gestures raymond through the closet passageway where raymond is met by technicians in sterile gear surgical gloves
hes entered some kind of portable surreal operating theater filled with monitoring device and computers
a one way video conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one corner surrounded by i
racks and more techno medical equipment
the man who is obviously in charge here starts a digital timer and turns to face raymond
do you remember me
to his group we have twenty minutes for our little check up from the neck up
marco on a public phone across the street from melvins residential hotel
im sorry to hear that
when did it
listens yeah i know
deep breath listen mrs
wilson can you tell me if nathan was ever preoccupied with his experience in kuwait
did he ever mention dreams or nightmares
about what happened
the firefight afterward
beat uh huh
no i understand
beat thank you for dial tone
he hangs up
marco listening to the phone on the other end of his call ring and ring and ring
dull hiss of the city
villalobos im just armys got me running statistics on stress disorders im trying to gather information on my old squad members
yes sir raymond sits in a chair rigged up with wires and tubes much like he was ten years ago a translucent box around his face overlaid with a metric
grid his head held motionless by a semi circular brace curved calibration offering precise positioning for a micro drill that noyle moves into place and then a long tiny drill bit whirs down through sterile latex stretched very tight across raymonds head and plunges precisely and effortlessly through raymonds skull then stops he has no reaction feels nothing lcd screens show a virtual map of raymonds brain in a full range of primary colors sections morphing as thoughts and memories race through his mind as miniscule interwoven wires are threaded down through the hollow core of the surgical drill deep into raymonds brain
noyle plays to one of the cameras
no decay no slippage
everything appears to be in flawless working condition
then raymond can you remember the deaths of mavole and baker
the lcd screens show activity in areas of raymonds brain
marco knocking at melvins door again
you in there
he checks the hallway takes an army utility knife from his pocket and forces the lock the light switch doesnt work
eerie shudder of neon from the sign on the building shapes crowd the room claustrophobic
marco has a penlight he turns it on sweeps in front of him with its weak beam the room stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers magazines and hundreds and
hundreds of notebooks covering nearly every available surface
marco picks up a notebook
moves to a desk and sits
opens the book beam of the penlight aimed down at pages filled with crude drawings of brains tomatoes number gibberish cross sections size and weight parameters and growth sequences in
the margins many attempts to capture likenesses of dr
noyle and the mysterious arabic woman repeatedly crossed out never right
noyle turning toward us eyes bright under the headline what happened extremely small cramped handwriting that goes on for pages the recon ends without incident and we are heading back
to forward command
fades up were heading back to forward command
the night is clear
stars but no moon marco closes the book opens another journal
same title page
same cramped writing that begins exactly the same way the video feed from noyles hidden hotel room cameras digital herky jerky were engaged unexpectedly by ground forces with helicopter support
in the ensuing firefight bobby baker gets himself separated to the left
mavole goes after him
marco reading these same words which melvin has scrawled in his journals an incoming mortar shell kills both of them instantly before i am able to marcos whole squad staring
at a digital screen animation of raymonds one man military fire fight a cgi hummer with a flaming tire raymond heroically spewing machine gun fire at the enemy exactly as weve seen it in marcos retelling reciting together instantly before sergeant shaw is able to locate and eliminate the source of the ordnance
strapped to a chair back in the dreamscape head back his mouth pried open and a hypodermic needle plunged deep up into his palette thin electrode wires splayed across his
face and neck noyles just behind him distant foreign precise locate and eliminate the source of flips compulsively ahead through the notebook lit by the harsh beam of the penlight
endless repetitive writing
feverishly rendered impressions of the dreamscape medical apparatus choppers guns more and more images of raymond shaw of raymond strangling mavole and a drawing of a man who might be
marco unfinished uncertain except for the eyes marco with a gun in his hand as a bullet hole is punched in his forehead falling away with a look of astonishment on his face blood just beginning to seep from the wound he drops the notebook like its on fire sketches of bobby baker with a bullet hole in his forehead topples the chair as he stands up and then shudders to life dies glows again brighter and are covered with drawings and scrawlings and newspaper clippings and patterns made with paper plates and empty noodle containers the crazy patterns of the tiles from noyles dream lab its as if marco has entered the mind of a mad man everything from the notebooks and more
much more dominated by tormented repeated images of raymond shaw marco is stunned pushing in as a painstakingly rendered drawing of raymond shaw fills the screen wild eyed with snakes
writhing out of his head medusa like evoking the wires and tubes from pixels blown out and distorted streaming insanely noyle stares right into camera intent questions
marco sits at a window eyes closed head pressed to the glass the world just a blur beyond him
he opens his eyes sitting down across from him
french accent is this seat taken
marco opens his eyes head pressed to a window the world a blur beyond him sees nothing
an empty seat opposite him
laurent was a dream
marco looks around self conscious and staring back at him
not enough to tell much more than shes pretty
marco looks away out the window
marylands a beautiful state
marco jumps looks
the pretty woman is sitting down opposite him folding and pushing aside a newspaper with the headline white house insists war on terror is still
below the fold angry mob kills muslim student at yale
this is delaware
but maryland its a beautiful state anyway
hes staring at her trying to figure out paper or plastic
from the grocery store
you were wondering where we you know and right at the check out stand paper or plastic thats me
i see you all the time
checks from the first national bank and you always put your spare change into the march of dimes thing
beat romance novels instant noodles no doz and tomatoes
marco frowns anyway im on vacation holiday in the city and so forth i saw you sitting here i thought okay girl its now or never
you headed to new york city
guy i knew
in the army
hes in politics now
weve kinda lost touch
awkward beat then whats your name
crazy french pronunciation and all
i guess your friends call you jenny
not yet they havent thank god
but you can call me jenny
what do your friends call you
my full name is eugenie rose
ive always liked the rosie part better
eugenie is well fragile
when i asked you your name you said it was eugenie
maybe cause i was feeling fragile
at the time
their eyes lock
marco blinks fb flash pfc
bobby baker stares back at him from where fb rosie was sitting
bullet hole in his forehead and a small lost smile
reaching out to him rosie as before
slight look of puzzlement because marco is on his feet rattled moving out to the aisle excuse me
and lurching toward the back of the train nearly losing his balance as he goes through the sliding doors
marco catches himself hands against the bulkhead wall near the bathroom
another passenger squeezes past him headed in the opposite direction
marco tries the bathroom door
marco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of medicine
tries to shake one of the tiny pills out but a burly passenger in the bathroom emerges and the door smacks marco hard across the back the pills scatter onto
the floor ow dammit sorry
i didnt know you its okay
were marcos down on his knees struggling to gather the pills together and put them back in the plastic vial
the big man goes
sinks down next to him
deftly plucking the pills from the floor
my mother would tell you to wash these
marco looks up at her blankly
she takes the vial caps it gives it back
i didnt mean to upset you
its not you its me
im not my head gestures uselessly nothings
stares at her i wish i smoked
its way overrated
they stare at each other
then rosie im gonna go in here wash my face take my pill and get myself together
marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door
marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face wiping it away with a paper towel
he comes up looking in the mirror avoiding his own gaze as and a man comes partway in now its dr
marco pivots no noyle
the door is shut locked
hes all alone
losing his mind
lost in thought
she puts her hand flat against the door then turns and heads back to her seat
turns to the mirror again
and again sees dr
noyle behind him smiling hello captain
do you remember me
knocking at the door a pass key rattling in it emerges from the bathroom to find an irritated conductor now awkwardly trying to extract his key from the door and
are you okay sir
youve been in here twenty minutes
i thought youd fallen off
marco stares at rosie
the train shudders to a halt marco comes up the escalator into a sea of commuters
rosie is behind him a moment later with her bag and im gonna get a cab you want me to drop you somewhere
im okay thanks
your friend gonna meet you here
off marcos frown my cell phone in case you you know
i like to say it the old way can you remember the number or should i write it on your chest with a sharpie
small smile ill remember
marco feels his shirt soaked
she reaches out and feels his forehead
sizing him up
you got a place to go and get freshened up
rosie lets marco in
its incredibly cramped everything in one room window facing a brick wall lots of play posters
its my cousins apartment
shes in cleveland with the road company of mamma mia
a view of the park
if you go out on the fire escape and kinda
tilt your head
marco puts down the suitcases and waits in the middle of the room while rosie takes off her coat turns on some lights
i yak when i get nervous
me i get quiet
another awkward beat
she stands there
dreams ive been having these catches himself
thats just how melvin said it
is that what happened on the train
i could be dreaming you
what if you are
youd be the best dream ive had in a long time rosie
rosie smiles at him
if thats a line ben marco it kinda worked
the water cascades down on him
he feels around on his back where the door on the train whacked him feels something on his shoulder a bump camera curls around as he twists contorts cant see
it but feels it and distant ben
turning off the shower hard
shes sitting watching the closed bathroom door
no noise from the shower
earth to ben howre you doing in there
hyper rummaging through the vanity searching for pair of cuticle scissors tweezers anything sharp a little basket of sample perfumes crashes into the sink knocking loudly ben whats going on
are you okay
marco finds a razor blade twisting it clumsily in his fingers to reach the slight bump on his back he can only barely see in the mirror rosies knocking harder
ben i need you to open this door
just for a sec
beat youre scaring me
he slashes at the lump
slashes again oblivious to pain
push in as ben presses the blade sharply down into his skin cutting a slit through which the blunt edge of appears like a grain of rice
it slides out into bens bloody fingers
rosies pushing against the door trying to force it open
puts his trembling hand under the faucet grips the thing between two fingers turns on the water
breaks in sees the blood smeared down marcos back oh jesus
and the razor in his hand she pushes him away loses his grip on the oblong thing before he can even get a good look at it and it goes
into the sink shit
oh no no
and down the drain marco twists the faucet off and where he puts both hands on the fittings of the u joint trap and struggles to get them loose succeeding
finally water spewing everywhere the trap falls to the floor disgorging soap chips slimy hairballs and pipe corrosion and water
but not the thing he wants
marco rests his head on the cool tile eyes far away
rosie crouches next to him
a little scared
she blots the blood from his back with the towel and then presses her ice pack against it
tell me you saw that
rosie just stares at him
hollow you didnt
you didnt see it
marco closes his eyes
stark building with a huge parking lot and only one car parked in it
a cab pulls through the open gate stops
marco gets out
number three on the paranoid top ten list
ben and richard delp ascend at a good clip
delp wears a lab coat trappings of a medical researcher this wasnt a delusion
thats what they all say marco
then some wicked shit got sprayed on you guys during desert storm
besides all the depleted uranium i mean
he stops unlocks a door and they go a narrow glassed in space with a cluster of monitoring equipment against the wall of darkened windows
fluorescent lights flicker on revealing a cavernous space below in which an intricate maze of cages contains unhappy screaming research monkeys with orwellian stainless steel hardware and antennae bolted to
their bisected skulls
strange sounds and various lighting effects emerge from the different sections
i personally know of a coupla rangers who swear that they see only in tertiary colors now delp
and can pick up sports talk radio in their cortical block if they get too close to a con ed transformer
its not gws
delp has known marco too long and too well not to take him seriously
a dozen years ago the army did this tiny implantable i
thing you could imbed it under the skin then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information blood type dna
pentagon ordered up half a million and stuck about five thousand experimentally into high risk soldiers and infantry
but the scanners proved skittish and field hospitals hated em so the whole deal got eighty sixed and forgotten
the army never put one in me
that you know of man
that you know of
then howd you find me
i looked under mad scientists in the yellow pages there was a full page ad
marco stares down into a big pit
among the racks of equipment are two primate sized stainless steel beds with restraints and i
you seriously believe somebodys messed with your mother board
what are you studying here delp
for the agency
nah cia cut me loose in during the macedonian debacle
now i got this little grant from wal mart
marco looks at the monkeys
doesnt want to know any more
he shifts his gaze back to delp
then look delp
my experiences during the war in kuwait
feel dreamlike to me
and my dreams
about what happened
feel as real as you and me here right now
delp just waits
i feel like somewhere along the line ive been
all scrambled up
weve all been brainwashed marco
religion advertising television
we accept whats normal because were told its normal and we crave normalcy
hell look at the germans under hitler
disco in the seventies
beat and if youre really worried about somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things its horseshit man
turns out pavlov had it right from the getgo
dogs and all
a little ect and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price
ask the uzbeks
and you would remember it
what about my dreams
shrugs what if all this is the fucking dream and youre still back in kuwait
youre not helping me
youre not helping yourself
reality is consensual man
you just gotta prove it up
or play it out
tv raymond emerges from a private jet waves to a crowd of tv supporters behind a chain link fence same
raymond his handlers his secret service escort walk a gauntlet of news cameras reporters lob questions from behind a barrier congressman shaw
why do you and gov
arthur oppose deploying troops in indonesia
we cant clean up the world with dirty hands
as he keeps pace with raymond walking moving behind the reporters weaving through the crowd
what about your mothers is your mother helping or allegation that a nuclear hurting your campaign
attack on this country from a secret alliance of rogue states is certain within two years
guys i gave up a long time ago trying to second guess my mother
im just surprised the rest of you havent
do you ever dream about kuwait
heads turning to find marco folder under his arm strange looks secret service poised to react but raymond slows looks sees marco
a cloud passing over his features i can never remember my dreams
more questions lobbed out overlapping but raymond ignores them
marco pushes through as raymond assures anderson its okay
i know him its okay
raymond and marco in the back seat facing forward
anderson and campaign handler mirella freeman sit facing them talking low on a cell phone as i saw mavoles mom and dad in st
i still visit them and bakers mom when i can
do you keep up with anybody from the unit besides al melvin
i dont keep up with al melvin
he found me
why did you ask me about kuwait
pleasantly i didnt
i asked you about your dreams
at the fundraiser why did you say you needed to talk to me
covers the phone mr
shaw excuse me they want to know if youll do an interview with larry king at six
to marco what do you want from me captain
forty minutes of your time
no to the interview or no to six
he wants to talk about my mother
he looks at marco private time
well weve got about five minutes right now
and this is as private as it gets for me anymore so
anderson staring at marco
there are these dreams that
some of the men in our unit have been having
its a question of what actually happened the night our patrol was attacked thats easy
almost automatic rpg incoming
mortar fire were ambushed
i cant locate baker or mavole
youre knocked unconscious i find you and pull you to safety and then cuts him off yeah thats how i remember it too
beat but i dream something else
the limo pulls to a curb through the windows see a crowded clutter of desks phone volunteers stacks of pamphlets
a giant secure tomorrow logo looms above flanked by beaming likenesses of robert arthur and raymond shaw
anderson comes out and opens the limo door for raymond
marco struggles out behind him am i in your dreams
evasive you know
raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office
pedestrians pass between them on the crowded sidewalk
its more complicated than that
marco reaches into his folder pulls out one of melvins notebooks people just dont have the same dreams accidentally holds out the notebook melvin made drawings he wrote down what
he dreamed this is one of his notebooks its all in here
and raymonds staring at the notebook without taking it the way marco once did with melvin
anderson and mirella the staffers in the office are all staring at marco the same way the boy scouts once stared at melvin
i dont have dreams captain
then gently maybe you should
see somebody talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing ive been to doctors
which is exactly what melvin said to him
okay im sorry
marco nods again numb makes a vague resigned gesture
im not crazy shaw
he jams the notebook back into his folder starts to walk away
calls after captain then major
marco stops turns
are you hungry
huge posters featuring raymonds face emblazoned with secure tomorrow stacked against the wall
a desk covered with papers and enough take out chinese food for ten people and raymond sits behind it nursing a glass of wine and pointedly ignoring melvins notebook while
i kill mavole
its a dream no
could mean something else
could be im just supposed to think you did
i killed the enemy
i didnt know them either
so it was okay
and anyway i remember what we did in kuwait i remember it perfectly
but now that you mention it i dont remember doing it exactly
maybe you didnt
what a thought
now he picks up the dream book
raymond flips through the pages for a moment dismissively
then stops at something melvin has drawn
raises his eyebrows
closes it sets it down life is so bizarre isnt it
this absurd campaign the sordid world of politics my whole public life and persona sometimes occasionally for an instant the fog clears and i look and i think what am
i mean what the fuck am i doing
posing and grinning like a goddamn sock puppet shaking hands with total strangers who must be blind if
they cant see what i am at the core
what my mother has made me
raymond looks steadily at marco
who nods interested a prentiss
ferociously a prentiss but not a shaw god forbid i was molded by cold hard hands every detail of my existence preordained
can you even imagine ben how it would feel never to have a say in what your life would be
i was twenty years old before i had a friend no worse a girlfriend well almost but yes a friend or i thought so outside my mothers circle of approved
encounters and it didnt she wouldnt precipitating my one act of rebellion storming off and enlisting grimaces in the army
which ironically only served ultimately to pad my gilded prentiss resume
you know fluent in five languages phi beta kappa congressional medal of honor blah blah blah
beat and after the war i came back to her
and the family legacy
mother calls it fulfilling my manifest prentiss destiny
why did you come back raymond
seeming startled raymonds reverie is broken
his eyes harden as he refocuses on marco
werent you listening
then you know the truth is i hate it
ive always despised it
the cloying adulation of the little people
your pitiful jealousy
who said i was jealous
i dont have the dreams ben
how can you not remember saving the unit
i said i did
you said you dont remember doing it
ha ha dont mix me up im tired and fine
its like this
its as if i know what will happen ben but i never get to the part where i feel that it actually did happen
but i think thats probably perfectly normal
did you ever talk to anybody about this little discrepancy
who would i ask
my old army buddies who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant present company excluded asses
you ask army intelligence
getting excited look we can go together tomorrow
you tell them what you just told me everything you do remember what you dont exactly remember about kuwait let em run some tests on you im sure the press
would have a field day with that
they put an implant in me
i found it yesterday
maybe they put one in you
horrified nobodys put anything in me
lets prove it
we can go get an x ray we can check it right now marco moves toward him raymond backs away i want to be supportive of you ben i do
but just check your back raymond this can wait until after the election
what are you afraid of
see if theres a bump
you should leave
this is not this is not just check without checking theres nothing there
marco lunges at raymond they fall together over the desk onto the floor chinese food scattering
somebody was in your head with big steel toe boots a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw and they went to town
neurons got wasted circuits rewired brain cells obliterated knocking at the door congressman shaw
you dont even know what they did
you dont you cant conceive what they did to you and youre worried about some lame ass reporters
where marco stronger better trained wraps raymond in a headlock rips raymonds shirt from the shoulder
if im wrong they can put me the fuck away are you okay
ben there theres something insistent knocking at the door
marco claws at the skin on raymonds back sinks his teeth in raymond shakes him off and marco slams into the wall
the office door bangs open anderson and other agents swarm marco theres blood smeared on marcos mouth his jaws are clenched disbelief he bit him
at raymond sir did he bite you
marco shoved to the floor twisted handcuffed blood smearing across the carpet his eyes wild with adrenaline and fear raymond his hand goes to his back his eyes lock with
marcos for an instant then marco is hustled out the door
sir horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside
mute with shock raymond pulls his hand away from his back
hides the blood
the giant lady is gilded by sunlight virgin and unapproachable
you want to help him
raymond and ellie
through the wavy glass we see a crowded dining room the ever present secret service
thatd be political suicide
of course not
i want you to help him
i cant even imagine why
because i feel sorry for him
because i said i would
what should we do
make him a general
my campaign people are getting a restraining order hes going on all the security watch lists but i wont lock him up
im not pressing charges
its complicated i dont know
its just complicated and i dont want to talk about it i want to get back to the campaign and focus on you dont actually believe his story
but he does
and hes a fine soldier and
and if his slim hold on sanity requires that i tolerate his delusions until he can get help ill do it
it doesnt diminish me
and im not afraid of him
this is why voters love you
your humanity and everything
ive never projected humanity
yes i think telling people you want to round up all the towelheads and throw
them in a deep pit probably tips your hand
laughs that was a joke you dreadful boy
a busboy delivers ellie her meal a thick steak stuffed with viscous grey off raymonds disgust carpetbag steak
she starts to cut meat into child like bite sized pieces and put them on a side plate for raymond
the steak part is mostly for you
doesnt it look yummy
in the worlds literature of food could there possibly be a more vulgar dish
and eating it is an absolute sexual experience
promise me that youll help him
ellie stops sighs puts her fork down and reaches for the oversized satchel that doubles as her briefcase and purse
oh raymond how much do you really know about your friend
ellie finds two thick files and plops them down as punctuation in front of raymond
establishing being pulled from the chilly waters of the potomac
some clinical autopsy glossies
marco stares troubled and sad at bleak photographs of al melvins bloated waterlogged corpse
i went to talk to him
but he wasnt there
across from him are three impatient fbi agents ramirez goldring and jonas
ramirez has the notebook marco took from melvins
goldring pushes a tiny digital tape recorder closer to marco talk about what
marco hesitates looks to lt
howard who sits grimly off the one side with col
a lone woman special agent volk sits in a distant corner on a folding chair
shes implacable staring intently at marco
ramirez holds up the notebook a page of crazy drawings and text
yeah there are hundreds more of those in his apartment
did your people check out his place
colonel garret kindly showed us the file on you marco youre the shit special forces
i wanted to talk to corporal melvin about some unanswered questions involving our reconnaissance mission in kuwait back in talks over him and he wasnt there so what you thought
itd be okay to break in and wait for him
marco carefully respectfully stacks the photographs of melvin and turns them over
exchanges a glance with the female agent
at howard i know this game
will you explain to them that i know this game
isnt that an oxymoron
kinda like special agent

if hes not looking for it he wont find it
the feds just stare at him
like hes nuts
i didnt have anything to do with corporal melvins death

lunges at jonas lt
howard and the other agents step between the two men pull them apart re jonas get this man out of here
taunting marco go ahead nutball
marco punches the agent so hard it knocks him down to the floor between the other two
he hit me

colonel garret shoves marco back into a chair stays in the middle of the fracas while okay okay
gentlemen i need a moment with major marco
the federal agents retreat with their bloodied nose cold cocked colleague door slamming behind them
evidently this has been going on for years
only agent volk remains unmoved by what just occurred
close on marco catching his breath
sad little tin soldier
ellie eats while raymond flips through marcos extensive file cross agency surveillance army psychological profiling fbi updates
repeated buzzwords like mentally unstable obsessed with raymond shaw delusional borderline functional acute stress disorder
isnt it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens
another failure of the hmos
im thinking of sponsoring a bill with senator friedman of rhode island i dont care
well imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when major marco showed up at the airport and you invited him my god invited him to tag along
knowing what they knew
i know him
i served under him
he was a good man
thats what the neighbors always say about serial killers
raymond stares at an old photograph of marco curled up in a fetal position on a v
sighs perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a less stressful posting
marco with howard whos visibly upset
he likes marco it breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this
agent volk remains in her chair on the other side of the room the door opens and col
garret comes in with agent goldring who gives marco back his personal effects and goodbye
to marco get out of here
hes free to go
shaw wont press charges and hes got juice with important friends
its todays daily double
agent volk closes her notebook and moves past goldring as he picks up the tape recorder
she glances at howard and leaves the room
someone from senator eleanor shaws office called and intervened on your behalf
marco trying to process all this major you have reached the terminal end of the armys patience
youre relieved of duty effective immediately
theres a young neurologist at walter reed
hes had considerable success with gws i want you to get your affairs in order and report to him
for evaluation and treatment first thing monday morning
sir i know all about dr

micro circuitry neat as a pin i thought you said you lost this
falls into focus smooth and etched with integrated circuits as intricate and beautiful as a henna tattoo
i found it again
delp looks up from the microscope at marco
these are not supposed to exist man
these are only theoretical
leaves the statement hanging delp freaked and hyper gathering wires and whatnot from shelves a veritable armload as you sure you want to do this man
because i dont
ill owe you one
delp rounds a corner monkeys scrambling around their cages as he comes to the clearing where sits on one of the experimental gurneys using a pen to write on his
ill still owe you for getting my sorry ass out of albania
talk to me about the implant
heard of em
off marco private equity fund specializes in military support services and weapons research
including a certain army implant project that went belly up in the early s
you said the army implants were for medical emergency data
the ones they publicized were
but oh man there was a parallel project of all kinds of scary implantable shit the clinton watchdogs finally freaked out over and closed down
how do you know all this
cuz they funded me to make some of their scary shit
what does it do
i dont know
i dont want to know
you dont want to know shit its out of you and youre still alive
thats the good news
off his arm what are you doing
hes scrawling words on his palm with a ballpoint pen
back up in case this makes me forget some stuff i want to remember
eases marco back on the gurney deftly puts some i
taps into his arms
marcos legs hang over the edge
these are built for monkeys so bear with me man
hes putting thread thin electrodes into marcos head just beneath the skin
im putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol to take the edge off
edge off what
or whatever you want to call it ect not being the precise science that say leeching is
wires snake across the floor to the ect electro convulsive therapy unit
you dont think this is going to work
its the desperation move man
there is a school of thought says a victim of induced abreaction or ultra paradoxical brain activity if youre at all correct about what happened to you can have it
effectively dispersed by electroshock
but the legions of naysayers will tell you that if the initial works done correctly if the brains been not just washed but dry cleaned takes out a bite guard
and puts it in marcos mouth
then try to relax okay

his head is in rosies lap he lies curled in the grass
a banana yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight circles overhead
rosies talking but ben cant hear her
just the buzzing
she stops looks at him
marco tries to say something his mouth is dry
he said this would happen
marco stares trying to orient himself
his arm comes up to shade his eyes nothing written on it
i dont remember a friend
kind of like a computer system crash your brain goes down then you boot up again but you lose all your ram
hesitates do you remember me
after a beat eugenie rose
marco closes his eyes again and silence
then the sound of a television fades up u

marco wakes up still in a bed
the room bathed in blue light from the small television where the news drones
rosie comes out of the bathroom wearing a long new york rangers jersey bare legged barefoot hair wet from a shower
central park was monday
i came home friday
smiles thats right
a long beat
marco stares at the t
as she sits on the edge of the bed rubs her hair with a towel
how did i get here
you called me
beat i remembered
beat i remember and i didnt dream
its been weird talking to you
knowing that you could fall asleep with your eyes open and wake up and have forgotten the whole conversation
i hope to god that parts over
whatd we talk about
then you said you loved me
not to scare you
out of nowhere but more than once
i remember that
she leans in kisses him lightly
what else did we talk about
rosie opens her mouth two beats of silence then marco wakes up
rosie is asleep beside him on the bed
the television is off
marco drinks water from the faucet wipes his mouth
stares at himself in the mirror he looks like death warmed over
starts to smile
but his eyes stray up to the half open mirror of the vanity reflecting behind him the bathroom wall towel racks wall paper a high vent
with a faint red led glowing inside
standing on the edge of the tub stretched out face pressed up to the vent trying to see inside looking back at marco peering in
slightly warped by the lens
he can just make out the shadow of a tiny video camera wires snaking back into the ducting micro lens adjusting automatically to focus
he slips off the tub nearly falls catches himself marco taping newspapers over all the heating vents marco going through cupboard drawers closets looking for what exactly
he doesnt know
his world is caving in
he pivots looks at rosie still sleeping
rosies purse is dumped out on the table and now marcos going through her suitcase
hes dressed now even has his coat on
pulling out her clothing discovering at the bottom much of the same material that eleanor shaw showed raymond
incriminating stuff about marco timetables surveillance photographs psychiatric evaluations and microcassettes neatly labelled with dates and hours
rosie rolling off the bed sleepy crossing to where marco is gathering the files what are you
sees the hard look on marcos face
newspapers over all the vents
opens her mouth to explain but marco swings hard and hits her she partially blocks it with her forearm backhands her onto the floor youre part of it
then hes moving out the door dont
she leaps at him shoves him hard into the wall and when he whirls to shake her off slips down and uses his weight and momentum to toss marco crashing
halfway back across the room
now shes between him and the door
dont do this ben
its not what you think
how can you know what i think
he tries to get past her again rosie cant beat him but shes extremely skilled marco gets stung twice by hard rights but whirls all defense an improvised rope a
dope that gives him the opening he needs he smacks rosie sharply stunning her and as she rocks backward he flies out the door marco bursts out of the doorway into the grey light of morning and runs the files fluttering under his arm
a caretaker rattling keys impatiently behind him marco stands looking down into the pit of the abandoned lab
delp and the monkeys are gone
empty cages and unplugged equipment are all that remain of delp and his fear project
the utter quiet is deafening
marco moving head down eyes everywhere anybody could be following him
anybody could be watching him
anybody could be part of this
prelap sound of a tape fast forwarding and
audio surveillance tape you said you loved me
scrolling old newspapers in a blur
not to scare you
out of nowhere but more than once
whir of rewinding audio marco deep in research at a small table covered with books and paper a crazy mans kind of chaos
the file he stole from rosies is disemboweled across the desktop
a library tape machine plays one of the surveillance tapes hes stolen from rosies bleeding through earphones what else did we talk about
stories flip past
and about what happened to you after you were captured
black helicopters secret laboratories mind drugs mad scientists shock torture
you dont believe any of it
it sounds crazy
maybe thats what they want
maybe thats what they want
marco pops out one tape pushes in another
whir of the tape rewinding again then
i watched raymond shaw kill someone
i watched him kill private eddie mavole
like it was nothing
marco on the bed numb
and i think they made me kill someone too
one of my people
kid named bobby baker
rosie puts her arms around him or they want you to think that you did
marco doesnt react whir of audio fast forward marco takes his thumb off the shuttle button and we were all hooked up to iv tubes and wires and equipment heart
monitors head monitors electroshock and a lot of stuff ive never seen before
finding finally an inside page of the science technology section of the times with the headline and a p
photo of managing director david r
donovan smiling flanked by a team of scientists
the caption only mentions donovan by name in the picture his hand is extended hes got a tiny implant device cupped in his palm
did he have a name
marco stares at the photograph
in the b
of the photograph
holding on one half hidden just slightly out of focus
the doctor ben what was his name
can you remember
a long beat
marco racks his memory
they called him dr
push in until noyle is just a mass of pixels a google search
marco types the name noyle
a government website thumbnail photos of scientists accused of human scrolling down
until a photo of atticus noyle is center screen
smiling out at us
click headlines capetown u
scientist expelled alleged cia ties genome researcher sought for questioning by the hague on marco energized by what hes seeing click slide over noyles face key words like genetic memory
enhancement behavioral modification
a quicktime video that marco activates and his sanitized early sales pitch all digitized and degraded an old web interview we really can reinvent ourselves you know by the remapping
of the human genome
strengthen character enhance personality not unlike tummy tucks and breast augmentation
generate extraordinary abilities in math music athletics
tweak the sympathy gene boost self confidence
staring excited the freak from his nightmares is real streaming audio broaden the very parameters of memory to offset the ravages of dementia or virtually liberate an individual from the
limitations imposed by damaging previous experiences literally freeing them from the burden of their past
marco hurrying toward the station entrance his research jammed under his arm and in a grocery bag hes found somewhere
collides with a guy in a suit
papers go everywhere marco yells at the guy and scrambles to pick up his documents shoving people out of the way marco scrambling to get his stuff back together
he looks like a crazy street person
a sun throws yellow across the mall and the senate office buildings are ribboned with shadows
jordan behind his desk staring at a white business card while a high strung aide leans in talking low i called the pentagon
they told me hes on medical leave
the calling card is marcos from army intelligence
jordan flips it over
marco has scrawled do you still want to be secret service theyve got him on a couple of their watch and observe lists
through a gap in the doorway jordan can see marco sitting in his outer office bag of evidence at his feet hunched forward staring at the floor
i guess theres been some trouble with this guy involving congressman shaw
at the mention of the shaw name jordan looks up jordan sits behind the table all of marcos documents and evidence arranged tidily in front of him in meager piles
marco pacing watching as jordan finishes examining a thick atticus noyle computer print out
nobody will believe this
nobody believed watergate
he sits down opposite jordan
or oklahoma city or the world trade center
you wouldnt have believed oswald before kennedy got shot
on the advisory board of manchurian global should they ever publish a list which they wont you would find former presidents deposed kings retired prime ministers ayatollahs african war lords
fallen communist dictators and an assortment of the fucking rich who are distinguished from the merely filthy rich by factors of billions
he puts the noyle file down pushes everything away
you bring me rumors and conjecture
i started with nightmares sir
rumors and conjecture are a giant leap forward
nightmares youve interpreted using as primary resources a your spotty memory b the internet sacred sanctuary of idiots and nutters and c random faces and coincidences and evidence you chewed
out of a mans back all neatly stitched together with the common thread of a powerful well connected private equity fund who will plead ignorance and be shocked shocked to learn what
some of their subsidiary partners are engaged in
sir i dont give a rats ass about manchurian global
thats not why im here
beat i cant touch them i get that im not stupid sir
a cold silence
marco stares at jordan
i just want to try and stop this one thing this raymond shaw bomb from going off
jordan nods again slightly
lost in thought
and id be lying if i told you i hadnt factored in huge that youve got a vested personal political and patriotic interest in how this shakes out
a limousine pulls up in front followed by a car full of secret service
anderson floats out and opens the door for raymond
an argument in progress as raymond shrugs off his overcoat into the hands of a servant
the low murmur of jordans voice then incredulous laughter lies
youve been waiting to do this to me for what twenty years
no ill wait until raymond gets here and we can all get out of my house
raymond proceeds down the hallway to
raymond entering closing the door behind him as ellie throws documents across the room at jordan the man is insane tom full blown schizophrenia hes been stalking raymond if you
dare to use this now they see raymond under the imposing andrew wyeth painting of tyler prentiss that dominates one whole wall of the study and ellie stops
to raymond your bipolar buddy has been sharing his dreams with senator jordan
raymond smiles its terrifying the fragile forced frigid smile of a man in pain
jordan picks up a picture of noyle and smoothes it onto the desk for raymond to see as can we please not go down that road
do you recognize this man
his name is atticus noyle
he is a south african physician neuropsychiatric scientist and mercenary someone our cia trained for covert mind warfare against the soviets in aghanistan someone who has sold technology to and
done research for terrorist groups and rogue states
major marco claims that this man brainwashed you in his dreams
sir ben marco is sick
nevertheless hes pulled from his mad hat some remarkably lucid connections between his dreams of your exploits in kuwait and this dr
noyle and the private equity fund manchurian global raymond frowns looks from jordan to ellie
your mothers primary political benefactor for the past fifteen years
they contribute to half the senate for gods sake
i dont understand
at the time of desert storm dr
atticus noyle was working under a research grant from manchurian global
your mothers friend
the color suddenly drains out of ellies face
connect the dots raymond
possibly your mothers blind to them because they pay their way possibly the senators motives are colored by his desperation to get himself back on the presidential ticket now that
the heavy lifting is done unraveling i dont i dont its not about me
as far as im concerned this should never come out it would shred what little remains of the fabric of our public trust think of the nation
i dont have the dreams
he cant prove anything
everything you stand for is upside down
if this were to come out true or no it would be catastrophic for the campaign
beat a threat
and it will come out
what are you saying
the question hangs there
what do i do
you bow out gracefully
an obscure illness
yield your spot on the ticket go into seclusion
he glances coolly at ellie and then surrender yourself to federal authorities who can help you address the damage that may have been inflicted on you
and walks out
raymond and eleanor have hardly moved
sound of the front door opening closing
i feel sick
what have you done to me
raymond remember when no never mind dont bother
dont say anything
no more lies
there are actual tears in ellies eyes
raymond just stares at her coldly
i can promise you that whatever youve done i will undo it
i know i know baby i never want to see you or speak to you again raymond i mean it this time
raymond heads for the door sergeant shaw raymond slows curious to be addressed like this sound of the desert wind rises sergeant raymond shaw hes turning the room coming alive
light shifting intensifying that terrible vividness and the wall of the zaghareet
raymond prentiss shaw sad listen marco jolts awake as if from a bad dream startled cramped on a bench just another rumpled weary traveler early morning commuters gliding past him
like a fog
a lacy fog rising from the reeds on the shoreline as the senator drags his kayak from under the pilings of a pristine clapboard cottage to the edge of the
the house is beautiful everything perfect
float through finding jocie in a back bedroom waking slowly in a huge bed rolling to look out the window and watch her father in his kayak paddling away
marco grabs a coffee from off a starbucks counter picks up his bag and heads toward the new york city line platform to catch his train the senator rows with
confidence his bow cuts the glassy surface of the bay fog ripples away from him dreamy
up ahead he can see the ghost of his house
and a figure on the shoreline
its me sir
stops paddling and lets the kayak drift in
hes breaking hard sweat glistening on his face
sloshes down into the water wades out waist deep wait
oh dont do that i can i came to apologize sir
the water must be freezing
what are you doing
dont bother i can raymond catches the bow of the kayak turns it
i am too
but your mother must with one motion raymond rips the two blade paddle out of jordans hand and flips the boat over im sorry sir
jordan goes under legs trapped in the kayak
flailing trying to get out of the kayak incapacitated by the cold water jocie wanders sleepy into the main room pulling on a hooded sweatshirt and sees through the bay
windows her fathers upended kayak
a figure in the water as if trying to save him jocie sprints down toward the water screaming raymond turns and sees her running toward him
for a moment time stands still jocie trying to process raymond shaw in the water with her father and raymond trying to process through the curtain of his fractured consciousness
leaps into the water thinking shell help with a rescue
the cold hits her like a sledgehammer followed by the realization raymonds trying to drown her father raymond what are you doing
she tries to shove raymond away from the boat but turns grabs her by the hood of her sweatshirt and whipsaws her out into the deeper water shoving her under
jocelyns hands claw at him but hes stronger and the water has no effect on him
she thrashes wildly
and he looks down at her through the water hair flowing utterly beautiful
as if in a dream
far away shhhhhhhh
her body floats away
tva cold tapestry of images behind the major media icon tva police paramedics bodies pulled from the water jordans empty house
the five term senator and recent front runner for his partys vice presidential nomination appears to have accidentally drowned when his kayak overturned near his chesapeake bay home
police say his daughter jocelyn may have been trying to rescue jordan when she was herself overcome by the icy water
an impromptu stand up with visibly shaken presidential candidate arthur outside arthur shaw campaign headquarters horrible horrible thing
senator jordan was a statesman of the highest integrity
fighting emotions tom jordan was a friend
a damn fine man
a great american
staring numbly at the news report on a little portable t
in a news kiosk slowing motion the world a blur around raymond as he walks a gauntlet of reporters shouting questions about policy about jordan
expressionless he just keeps walking but his lips move tragedy senseless great loss donovan walking beside senator eleanor prentiss shaw
whiting just behind them
you trusted us to bring your son back to you and we deliver
we trusted you with our technology and now you turn him into a common hit man
oh dont lecture me you didnt even ask us
you needed to ask
tom jordan was going to destroy everything weve worked toward and every one of us along with it and you want me to call a meeting
david if jordan had gone public in any endeavor there are key players and role players and raymond or you or me for that matter im sorry we are role
players with fixed values and fixed agendas that get weighed against other factors
ellie stops looks at him
then you can tell yourself that as you go to bed tonight david and i hope it helps you wake up tomorrow with a clean conscience but we are talking
about my son and the future of this country
beat my father tyler prentiss never asked
he just did what needed to be done
push in rapidly
then a hand comes down hard and efficiently against her throat she wakes up fighting for air a whisper how does the president die
he sits on top of her pinning her arms down
she struggles to say something
marco shakes his head
he releases her throat and she gasps for air im gonna stop this
well go to the feds
you and me
and tell them a story
wholl believe i dont know
i dont care any more
its all i have
rosie bucks gets a hand free slugs marco and they tumble off the bed in a tangle of blankets and limbs comes up holding a mm revolver to marcos forehead
i am the feds
marco stares at her dumbfounded
weve been watching you trying to sort this out
i mean its either youre telling it straight and weve all got something big time to worry about or youre crazy and dangerous either way weve had to keep you
on a short leash cuz if we lock you up well never know
beat and we cant tell anybody because we dont know how deep this river runs
beat if there is a river
off his expression you got away from me
raymond shaw murdered senator jordan and his daughter
shaking her head oh ben
the thing is
i want to believe you
god help me ben i do
hes a time bomb ticking
everybody else wants you junked up on thorazine and just not a problem any more
i am clearer on this than ive ever been
its rich guys funding bad science to put a sleeper in the white house listen to yourself
youre a poster boy for paranoid fantasies
silence broken only by their breathing
i screwed up
jordan was my trump card and i screwed it up
then either help me or shoot me rosie
theres no middle ground anymore
he gets up rosies not going to shoot him frowning raymond raymond raymond hands a service revolver past noyle to marco who primes it aims captain marco would you please
shoot private baker so we can move on
raymond awakens with a startled about face flushed sweating
raymond finds himself in the back seat of his limo his campaign aide mirella her assistant and anderson all startled and shouting too you okay
weve arrived congressman
raymond sits up
raymond emerges to cameras and fanfare its election day and hes going to vote
anderson and other agents clear a path up the steps into the elementary school voting site
reporters shout questions that raymond just answers with his professional smile
a temporary polling place
flags tables not too crowded
voters stepping out of the way
poll volunteers pressing in to shake hands and wish raymond shaw good luck
and on the edge
she badges anderson and talks to him
he nods moves over and talks quietly to raymond as raymond signs his name in the voter registration log
then lets rosie guide him to a booth on the end pulls the giant lever the curtains close finds a note folded taped to the machine
raymond opens it reads it
the curtain opens and raymond steps out smiling again
cameras flash video crews wave boom mikes expecting a sound bite i was on the fence when i walked in there but then i saw my name on the ballot
and i knew what i had to do
he whispers to a poll volunteer and she points him down a hallway raymond rosie and his secret service detail rosie leads them to a doorway holds it open for
raymond but puts her hand lightly on andersons chest when he starts to go in to sweep the room its clean
small and private
raymond turns on the light
marco is in the corner waiting
his noyle file in one hand
hows your back
raymond locks the door turns takes in the room tiny chairs and tables walls covered with kids drawings and nearly every object in the room named and labelled with x
ive been having the dreams ben
theyre inside my head
they got inside the way you said they would well get em out
twisted together and i dream things terrible things that cant possibly have happened
im gone ben im losing it no you could have had me locked up and you didnt
thats a sign
that they dont control everything
we can fight it
i mean im still out here because you decided i should be which means theres a part they cant get to deep inside the part where the truth is and
they cant touch us there
thats what we need to tap into raymond thats the part where you and me were gonna take them out
and the senator
did i do it
i think so yeah
i dont remember
i dont remember it
raymond looks up at ben
down the hallway standing sentinel
anderson checks his watch glances uncomfortably back at the door then at rosie who just stares him down
tears run down his face but his voice is normal he stays expressionless
he rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand
im all inside out
knocking on the door
just a minute
raymonds cell phone rings
all ive ever done is what i was supposed to do
what i was told to do raymond focus what others want me to do
did they tell you what they want you to do ray

yes it is senator
major bennett marco marco reacting quizzically sound of the distant windstorm building extreme close up marco his ear at the phone yeah
marcos eyes flicker to raymonds eyes bennett ezekiel marco marcos senses are quickening the light literally changing around him that terrible luminosity as sound of fabric in the wind the
sandstorm raging marcos eyes shining now hyper alert a warriors eyes yes
listen the happy chaos of screaming kids
raymond emerges smiling
surrounded immediately by anderson and his secret service detail and escorted out of the building
fights through the throng of students to the office door
now its locked
she bangs on it kicks it open empty
the noyle file lies open and empty on the floor
she rushes through a connecting door third grade students loud happy rehearsing a patriotic abe lincoln election day skit no marco here shes lost him
rosie comes back through out into the hallway and stands in the river of children shes lost ben tva news footage of raymond emerging from voting waving and tva heading
back to his car candidates made ritual trips to the voting booths today
tva similar footage of arthur emerging waving to the cameras
tva governor arthur casting his ballot in north platte will spend election night in the big apple with running mate raymond shaw
swooping across on an entrance jammed with cabs and limousines
then rise up to the window of a suite high above the street where sunlight still lingers on the glass shimmering gold and tv a beautiful suit laid out on
the king size bed
shoes tv the television on but silent network election night coverage
arthur shaw are exit poll winners in alabama florida maryland pennsylvania new york
the bullet will pass over your shoulder just missing your head on the way to its target
where raymond sits stripped to the waist watching the mirror as his mother looms over him in a beautiful chinese silk dress combing his damp hair
because of course the assassin the deranged obsessed tragically
paranoid lone gunman is trying to kill you
the major is an excellent marksman
she touches his bare shoulder leaves her hand there
but what will happen to him
gentle the assassin always dies baby
its necessary for the national healing
she takes his shirt off a hanger he stands up and she starts to dress him im sure you will never entirely comprehend this darling and i know the way
you are right now this is like trying to have a whimpered conversation with someone on a distant star
but it must be said raymond i did this for you so that you could have what i could not what your father didnt want what your grandfather dared to
dream possible she runs her hands through his hair
tears fill her eyes
when you ran away to join the army after that girl after jocie when you swore youd never speak to me again i felt your fathers shadow pass across us
and i couldnt let him run you the way he ruined himself
beat thats when mark whiting came to me with talk of extraordinary scientific breakthroughs
so i let them take you and change you
not too much
not so much that youd notice
just enough to bring you back to me
and look what you have now
look how far weve come
its working darling they think they own you but they are very very wrong
youre not something they can buy and sell raymond not for
any price were one and therell be no stopping us now will there
were going to save this country in the hour of its greatest need
raymond is dazzled by eddies radiance
she straightens his tie
her hands caress her sons shoulders
how much you look like my father now you have his hands and you hold your head in the same proud way
and when you smile its like im a little girl again and impulsively kisses him when you smile when you smile raymond moves to her their embrace is all consuming
a dizzying overhead shot slowly twisting campaign volunteers milling through empty chairs dozens of t

anderson emerges as another secret service agent comes down the hallway all clear
he closes the lighting room door
remote cam images of the empty stage and podium blink to life enormous finding focus and a director and a team of tech guys murmur in headsets commanding a matrix
of monitors control panels and mixing boards
on all the screens different views of the empty stage from various cameras
just like andersons
pan up marco resplendent in dress uniform hair trimmed a man reborn
he looks so rejuvenated for a moment even we dont recognize him
steps over television cables and power lines follows their drunken path to the end of a narrow corridor marco slips in and out of darkness
passing no one
noise echoing insanely from the ballroom
marco enters closes the door
takes his coat off and folds it neatly and puts it on the floor
follow him as he stoops to find a high tech metal case hidden in the air vent
he opens it revealing a disassembled sniper rifle stereo rangefinder eyepiece live rounds sandbag tripod and a sidearm
he turns toward the back of a massive wall grid of light fixtures facing outward to the auditorium hot with red white and blue radiance
he walks to the grid and peers through it walks out of the back of the stage a video a

confetti rains down the cheering overpowers even the rock and roll band as it strikes up a post punk rendition of yankee doodle
two dozen monitors show different angles of the entrance corridors security lanes but is off to one side with a couple other feds and a security guy reviewing the entry
tapes from earlier
people whoosh through gates in digitized triple time stop
the image slows
marco moves herky jerky through the security station stop action
rosie pretends shes interested in somebody else then no
the tape resumes triple time deliberately hand feeding live rounds of ammo into his rifle hes ready
arthur and shaw and their entourage explode victorious from the back just like in the rehearsal
iconic sampling of regular americans in full dress uniform accompany the winners a soldier a sailor a fireman a marine a policeman a fighter pilot everybody waving smiling
the crowd ecstatic
a tiny island of worry in a sea of celebration
the huge light grids ripple with patriotic bunting effects
she scans the crowd the perimeter the balconies
an enormous close up of arthur are alive with soaring imax style postcard footage of americana monument valley pikes peak columbia river golden waving fields of wheat city skylines perfect
beaches majestic off shore oil rigs galloping herds of buffalo the breathtaking grandeur of american nature american achievements
various angles on stage of arthur his wife his family close and loose crosshairs finding locking on arthur who is waving and slowing to shake on stage supports hands staring
up at the left side lighting grid
where she thinks she saw movement
as it blinks off and then on again in a different pattern theres the silhouette of something
a figure behind the grid
shes sure of it and shes moving pushing her way toward an exit pulling a tiny walkie talkie from her pocket and yelling into it rock steady on arthur and
his hundred watt smile as he now separates from the procession and moves to his center stage mark just like in the rehearsal
the crowd begins to chant
calm and focused
his mother leans close whispers something rosie joined in stride by feds from the command center sound of the celebration booms through the building rosie leads the way two steps
at a time pulling her gun from her holster and checking the clip clear and unwavering his pupil tightening as arthur turns to raymond and gestures
her eyes shining as raymond steps forward the roar of the crowd he slips his finger through the trigger guard cross hairs on arthur
but a dark blur suddenly passes in front of arthur momentarily eclipsing marcos view a few of the camera monitors have empty frames waiting for raymond to arrive but dammit
shaw missed his first position then find him go with him raymond has joined arthur center stage instead of moving to the rehearsed first mark his finger motionless inside the trigger guard but raymond is blocking arthur now frowning
raymond has made marcos shot impossible kill arthur and he kills raymond too
coming off the eyepiece of the scope
he wipes sweat out of his eyes
appalled at raymonds departure from the plan
a sprawling hero shot of mt
rushmore featuring the traditional quartet plus stony cgi additions of president elect arthur and raymond prentiss shaw
now music music starts that lush full orchestral rendition of here comes the sun that sweeps through the ballroom
change to rippling american flags music swelling the room exploding with color and celebration lights flaring side walls alive with iconic american images the raucous crowd starting to clap in
rhythm people crooning along with the songs chorus as people waving hugging dancing more super insiders joining the throng onstage shaking hands high fiving waving staring up into the lights
finds the spot hes been looking for raising his gun again
turns and smiles at his mother
moves toward her
ellie stunned painfully aware that the eyes of the world are on her and raymond moving taking his mothers hands inviting her to dance
places his eye to the scope marco finds him adjusts the crosshairs rosie and the feds sprint toward marcos projection booth as ellie surrenders to the moment and enters raymonds
arms what else can she do
this is her son her dream is halfway there
and the president can die another day
they swirl off to the music perfectly centered in marcos sights but then raymond and ellie glide in front of marcos target lingering in marcos eyeline raymond stares up into
the scope eyes trusting urging as if hes saying now then arthur is alone again in the center of the crosshairs waving and grinning at the roaring crowd like a man whos just been elected president but marcos crosshairs swing over finding raymond and ellie again looking into raymonds eyes
follows his gaze up into the dazzling glare of the stage lights first shadow of doubt crawling across her theyre right in marcos cross hairs
eyes wide realizing too late pulls the trigger
bam bam bam
raymond and his mother are kicked back into the horrified celebrants on the stage the same bullets ripping through both of them toppling together dead before they hit the ground
the feds kick the door in calmly putting a clip into the handgun from his kit starting to raise it she shoots him
balloons cascade down on a nearly black and white tableau of pandemonium and chaos against the soaring wall to wall images of americas greatness displayed on the imax screens
screaming and shouting
president elect arthur vanishing in a phalanx of secret service
video crews pressing in on the stage morbidly curious
and a strange clearing around the bodies of raymond and eleanor shaw crumpled and bloody
still locked in their embrace
tva crowds pressed to the regent rear entrance frantic copstva clearing the way for body bags emerging on stretchers one two
three this third one guided and fiercely attended by rosie through the confusion shoved into a waiting morgue truck
we are tv donovan stands in front of a massive flat screen televisiontv watching the mayhem at the regent wall street ballroom
pull back to reveal a numb collection of horrified manchurian global executive office employees watching in silence
a visibly shaken whiting ashen faced head in his hands eyes red with tears and johnston stunned pacing jesus
tighten on donovan
expressionless except for a cryptic frown
he raises his arm and uses a remote to kill the picture
the security footage of marco entering the regent wall street hotel
his face turned away
marco turning toward us
his face becoming artificially highlighted digitized morphed
zoom in as his features begin to change
new features emerging
clicking of a keyboard and rosies reflection becomes visible across the screen of the video monitor on which the security footage flickers
we are where an engineer works keyboard and mouse digitally altering the footage of marco is rosie watches intently from just behind him
further back in the same room
another senior federal agent special agent volk from marcos interrogation
and colonel garret leans against the far wall arms folded expressionless
fading up the fbi today released security footage of the assassin of raymond and eleanor prentiss shaw entering the hotel two hours before the fatal shooting
the engineer finishes what hes doing resets the tape and now it begins to play again in real time and we watch a white man in uniform go through security
as the footage weve just seen playing behind authorities say that they have no further information about the identity of the gunman except that he was a white male perhaps years of age and not a member of the armed forces
then the tragic deaths of the incumbent vice president and his senator mother mark the end of a family dynasty that has dominated american politics for more than fifty years
the mother and the son polar opposites on myriad issues nevertheless managed to promise a one plus one equals ten kind of equation to many americans the hopeful heady notion
that these two somehow comprised a united vision of stunning almost revolutionary breadth and depth
a combined potential far greater than its parts
push past her tighten in on the image of the lone gunman and the image explodes into pixels accompanied by the rising sound of the blades of a helicopter under
president elect arthur has vowed to bring to justice whatever nation or nations are responsible
still reeling from the recent tragic loss of senator thomas jordan congress has already announced a fresh investigation into jordans death in an effort to learn if it is in
any way related to
we are jetting low and impossibly fast across whitecapped azure water toward crumbled ruins of a long abandoned village on an empty beach we remember it vividly from marcos memory
arriving to slowly spin and hover over the remnants of an ancient caravansary high angle down on marco moving across the intricate sun bleached tile work we remember from noyles lab
dissipated trace of a scaffolding superstructure inside crumbling ruins
you dont develop a technology like that and waste it on two guys
he looks to rosie who stands in an archway
there are soldiers here with weapons could be here to guard marco
could be here to protect him
we know that
marco looks past her to the water which stretches out from here as if to forever
i remember running
his arm is in a simple sling
he moves like a man whos been shot and not quite recovered moves past rosie out of the broken down ruins
i had to get out where the sky was
rosie motions the soldiers to stay back follows him by herself
i had to get to the water
pull back as they walk down the beach to the sea
a few tumble down buildings are all that remains of an ancient seaside town
i thought if i can just get to the water everything will be okay
marco approaches the waters edge staring out at the uncertain horizon
nothing but water as far as the eye can see
