peter los angeles
whoever you see here whatever you hear here stays here
thats a notice on a wall
heres another notice no smoking
everyone is smok ing
this is an aa meeting
theres a lot of faces to look at
i dont know when well get to the one thats talking but when we do its like this
eyes like glue
years old with a face the color of a snuff users hanky
he says this after my third recovery my wife made me swear id never bring another bottle into the house
and i never did
i bur ied it under the lawn
cut out a turf stood it upright with a piece of tin foil instead of a cork
so here we are out in the yard and shes happy because im getting healthy in a pair of swim ing shorts no way near no booze
she decides to prune the roses
meanwhile im laying there with a straw stuck in to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red
curious thing about drunks
their disease often amuses them
thats how crazy i was i was sick for half a life till i finally found my san ity again in these rooms
dont take that drink and for the one or two new faces i see here i say this just do it by the day
you gotta do it by the day dont take that drink
and keep coming to these meetings
because here is where it works
thank you benny
we have a few more minutes
anyone else like to share
ash into an ashtray and now a face
hes around years old
intense eyes dark hair
probably good looking when the ang les right
but this is a bad angle
his name is john berlin
my names john
and im an alcoholic
i didnt intend to speak today
matter of fact i wasnt gonna come to the meeting
but i wanna say a couple of things i hope may be of use particularly as benny says to the new faces here
i first came into this fellowship ten months ago
i came to a meeting i was convinced was gonna be my last how could a buncha drunks help me
then someone got up i think it was micky and described himself as the shit around which the universe revolved
i dont know if that was original to him it doesnt matter it was the first time id heard it and i still cant think of a better way to
describe how i felt we all have our own place in the darkness and i was in such a mess i could hardly fucken see id lost someone very dear to me she hadnt died i had i dont know whether she left coza the drinking or whether i drank coz i knew she was gonna leave either way the booze won i replaced her with alcohol anger i was angry with her myself everyone and everything where i was i wanted to be someplace else any place but here any moment but now but here i am and it is now and theres a big change about to hap pen in my life and im going for it coz this time i know im not running away im actually two miles into a mile journey and i feel good about myself going there so i stopped off to share that with you and to thank everyone of you and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here free
high above the golden gate
too high for specifics
but there is something down there of interest to the camera
descending with the music it seems to isolate a particular car
too many and too distant to know which it is
but the camera is follow ing and already a mile up the interstate travelling north
maybe via a dissolve
and maybe not
but red and white either way as the headlights are coming on
the camera is closing on the highway
and a car has definitely been selected
there is nothing much of interest about it
its a blue mercedes sedan
mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts
the first puts the frame directly in front of the car
in a few moments its brights snap up
and titles continue in a dazzle of light
nobody in the car except berlin
and a lot of cigarette smoke
just time to wedge in a p
theres an intersection coming up
he hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind ow down
takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt
an instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway
a heavy sky of red and black cloud
the mercedes turns off head ing east
this time the camera doesnt follow
remains static over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear
bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds
this house hasnt been lived in for years
no furniture other than a new mattress in the middle of the floor
still in polythene wraps
berlin just about awake on top of it
ten seconds of disorien tation while he puts this together
a stone fireplace
stairs leading to whats got to be a tiny room above
with enough ef fort this place could be charming
but right now its a wreck
this kitchen was out of date by
a huge china sink and a fat fridge
but the cooker works and a battered old kettle is already on the gas
t shirt and instant coffee
berlin checks cupboards out
crockery includes a cup and thatll do for now
his lips articulate a silent expletive
the gas has just gone out
tries to relight it without success
on hands knees he explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door
in the garage he finds the gas cylinder
empty and so is the bastard with it
he drags fingers through hair in frustration
looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out
the view beyond he hardly cares to look at
but if he does it is as follows
clouds massing on the horizon
fields getting re ady for rain
his nearest neighbor is around yards away
his nearest cow about
this house is remote and rural look ing with a veranda out back
but berlin has no inclination for sight seeing
as he walks away a dreary female voice seeps in
the voice comes via a police scanner
most of this dialogues bullshit
illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about
berlin sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum and milk
he unwraps another juicy fruit and regrets it
goes round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine
a reluctant decision is taken
spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the kitchen
starts unloading his leather bag
a flotsam of stuff is excavated including a mm beretta and a pack of cigarettes
he lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt
wouldnt need a clairvoyant to realize hes trying to give up
something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to the living room
theres a call going out for david sam
david acknowledges and berlin clearly recognizes the voice
we have a d springfield street city dump
but david is already hired
im outside emersons i wanna be the first horrible face of her day
berlin exhales through a smile
the controller needs an e
david doesnt know
advises her to roll a couple of cars and secure the location
a chevrolet zig zags up a shabby canyon
its the road to the city dump
its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage trucks
everything is backed up
nothing moves except the car
the cause of the hold up is explained at the top
a sheriffs car blocks the road
a uniform moves to wave the chevrolet in
the car parks at a weigh house and a man in his s gets out
looks like he hasnt slept in a while
and got the mood to go with it
sports jacket and cowboy boots
a lot of laugh lines around the eyes
but you wouldnt want to get arrested by him
and especially not this morning
his name is frederick t ross
you can drive down there sir
im already walking
where is it
one of those walking with him is a year old kid with a dog
travis looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache
on the infill
the guy from l
s just gone down there
whats he doing here
he was waiting for you sir
wait ed a good while
said hed go down and take a look
i hope thats o
the track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires
damn a its o
with a bit of luck im goin home
what we got
they cut his throat
the information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth
who are you
he wears glasses and wields a rusty
pump action remington
where do you fit in trimble
his fathers the manager sir
the kid was up there shooting vermin and he found the body
get ready for it coz im tell ing ya youre in for a shock
trimble speaks with some enthusiasm
ross looks back with none
they slit him from ear to ear
ya want me to make a statement
not right now
a series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up
black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind
gulls and bulldozers
plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth
several cars parked here including the blue mercedes
several on lookers behind yellow police tape
ross negotiates it look ing pissed off
looks up and somewhere in the smoke is berlin
did you bring it with you
i hope im not intruding
be my guest
what you got
old guy offed himself with a knife
i cant find the knife
and the next thing ross is looking at is a death in the trash
a massive dozer in the background
everything else is garbage
they cut his throat
would you get outside the tape
and tell your dad to put that fire out
that aint legal
another face here is so familiar ross hasnt bothered to ackn owledge it
blattis is a year old local newspaper reporter
little is visible of the body except a blood stained raincoat
i wonder what would make him do a thing like that
dont annoy me travis
truck horns wail in the distance
on the horizon its thunder
so wheres the knife
berlin wears surgical gloves
removes film from a small camera
guess the dozer musta shifted him
you need some hands up here to look
look for the knife
swatting smoke ross directs anger at a fat cop called venables
move that ass
berlin hands the film to ross as he gets into identical gloves
you done the pockets
i havent started till monday
im a tourist
welcome to eureka
by now ross is crouched next to the corpse examining the wound
how longs he been feeling like this
week or two
musta been on the ker osene
stinks like a diesel engine
fucken noddles hanging off
mr blattis of our local news paper
you sure its a suicide
hes well rehearsed
what does that mean sergeant
cut your own throat youre ner vous about it tend to hesitate
hes got three trial cuts lower left side of the neck before he works up courage for the big one
blattis looks vaguely impressed
ross begins searching pockets
you think popeye would know that
i dont think popeye would be here
dead dog over here sir
find the knife
and venab les is the coroner called
alright gentlemen im gonna leave you
i got a couple of questions for the paper serg eant
mind if i swing by later wring out a tea bag with you
he did nt like to get outta bed
catch you later freddy t
off he fucks under an ailing sky
berlin lands a friendly grin
so what happened to the barbecues and fishing
watch my lips coz youre not gonna believe this this is a rare occurrence
we havent had a body in eighteen months
he finds keys and change and a sandwich in the winos raincoat
how does anyone dead as this lose a knife
what about that kid ross
stands to shout travis
find that kid and get the knife off him
hes gonna lie to you but hes got it so get it
well go on get on with it
whatta you staring at
travis stares up like he just stuck his dick in a light socket
i think i found some thing horrible sir whatta you mean horrible
i think ive found a hand
ross crouches in garbage
peers into a trash sack with assist ance of a flashlight
its a fucken hand
pas ses the light to berlin
his turn to examine the ruptured bag
looks like a womans hand
berlin finally stands
offs the flashlight
and hands it back
what do you think
i think youre here all day
pissing with rain and unspeakably miserable
the grid search is in progress and square yards of the dump have been ripp ed to pieces
intermittent voices from police radios
more veh icles down below including an ambulance with hazards revolving
up here half a dozen arc lights scald off vapor
berlin search es under a busted umbrella
looks up and runs into rosss eyes
how much longer we here
were not gonna find nothing else
he wears a rubber cape looks like a huge pissed off napoleon
we give it one more hour
did the photographer do the dogs
he should do the dogs
and both turn towards a voice shouting from deep in the gloom
sergeant we got a brassiere over here
looks like it could be blood
alright im coming
another intrusion from the radio
travis repeats the question
the coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict
yeah he can go
think ill lay down with him
only way ill get outta here
did someone say something funny
does berlin just about smile
its good to be with you ross
and this is probably the only time ross will look happy today
glad you finally made it bro
the mercedes descends an incline and parks
brown chevys and black white patrol cars
dismal lights and raining like it doesnt end
berlin gets out and unloads the trunk aquarium insulated picnic box
slams the trunk and reveals blattis
you want some umbrella
proffers a big yellow one plus assistance carrying equipment
is this normal
average rainfall inches
pisses down october to june
raining hard enough to hurt
a brisk intimacy across the lot
better in the summer
you get to fucka few tourists
he hits a security code at the door
obviously familiar with the station
dialogue continues as they step into a corridor
not married are you sergeant
thats good you get to fuck a few more
so how long you known freddy
forever he was my serg eant when i was a kid dont get to see a lot of each other but we been buddies two hundred years
did he get you the job
i think he would have if he could have been trying to get me up here long enough i think he may have bribed the old guy to retire
popeye wasnt old
younger than you
they push through doors into the biggest room in the building
a dozen desks back to back and all the clutter and clatter of typewriters and paperwork and secretaries swapping the gossip
too many cops to describe and no time to remember them anyway
but heres one making introductions
about years old
face a mix of brick and fat
the chief of eureka police is citrine
sergeants serato and taylor
any handshakes and greetings that fit in around the equipment
mr travis i think you know
do me a favor travis
bring in the resta the stuff from my car
blattis tosses his parasol dont lose it and follows berlin
did you find the knife sergeant
but we have a theory
kid told me he didnt take it
maybe hes lying to you
by now theyre in an l shaped room with wood benches and bull etin board all over the walls
bullshit everywhere in packing cases
dusty playboy spreads amongst other junk on the boards
is it true you found a hand
and he benches the aquarium as berlin loses the insulated box
is that it
interview over blattis
cmon chief if its sensitive tell me
im not taking notes
right now the box contains camera equipment which is unpacked
we got a body part
we dont know what it is probably some kind of hospital debris were gonna try and check it out
now you know as much as we do
grateful for your candor sir
then do me a favor and keep this outta the newspaper that dump serves a dozen different communities we dont even know if its ours
till we do i dont want no one worrying about
wasnt frozen was it sergeant
come on michael outta here the guys trying to move in
i told you what we know something else you ll be the first to hear about it
a womans face around the door
los angeles for sergeant ber lin
and goodbye blattis as berlin reaches for the telephone
why did he ask if it was frozen
that i couldnt tell you
and dont worry about anya this crap by the time youre back its gone
citrine splits as berlin picks up hey ronzo good of you to call
a long phone lead and he continues to unpack equipment
berlin phone listen my time isnt good but two things really important the bras siere i sent you
i need to know if those stains are human blood and if they are do they match the blood in the sample
cmon gimme a break i dont know anyone up here it would take two weeks cmon ronny im ask ing nice
i really need to know wheth er im interested in that brassiere
a cut out of popeye the sailor with fist round a camera on the wall
telephone resistance is collapsing and he breaks a smile
youre my favourite man raining i gotta go ronny i gotta go i got a house fulla removal men and a date at the morgue and ron con gratulations youre
my first call
ross has a vic inhaler up his nostril
an inadequate defense
a sudden stink slams into his neck muscles
head and inhaler travel rearward
he shifts eyes to berlin who scans the bums autopsy reports
a pathologist comments on his handiwork into a microphone hanging from the ceiling
except as previously noted the liver is not remarkable
ross doesnt believe it
if the knife hadnt killed him the booze would
i nev er seen such a bad cirrhosis
you say the cuts left to right
he does isnt that unusual
hes left handed
he picks up a nicotine stained left hand
simultaneously a lab technician wants berlin to sign in exchange for the picnic box
i guess he was so drunk he did nt know which hand he was using
re box what are you gonna do with it
depends how healthy it is
if its any good ill try and get a print
he hands the clip board back and remembers a question for ross
oh ross that newspaper guy at the station asked me if the hand was frozen
why would he ask me that
ive no idea
another fast fix on the vic and berlin chews fresh gum
a need le on a weighing machine quivers
the liver weighs grams
a few beers wouldnt do that to you would they
not a few
an explosion of hugs in the kitchen
everything happens at once
margie ross is slim and dark and still looking twice as pretty
shes got compliments for berlin too if they can get out of each others arms youre looking wonderful john
but greetings are better performed than described so im leaving it to the actors
you do a rush on three pizzas
he emerges from the refrigerator wielding a bottle of champagne
im not giving him pizza
i havent seem him for a year
im gonna cook him a dinner
dinners another night darlin
this is a drive by
i got an hour
he detours via the kitchen door to shout upstairs
whats the hurry
friday night at city hall
got a great chance to frighten the fat
freddys new obsession
who is who
a professional whining con person bitch with an ass the size of africa
ross fights a difficult cork you wanna get some glasses honey
shes an accounts manager very pal ly with our mayor up to her elbows in fraud and i just cant prove it
so tonight she confesses
tonight im feeling lucky
the cork explodes and he goes for glasses but one isnt willing
not for me
what dyou mean i just opened it for you
this is french champagne
no it isnt
im on a diet to day
ill take a diet soda
since when did you drink diet soda
stop nagging him
if he doesnt want it he doesnt want it
you re quacking like an old duck
and shes already at the fridge and popping a can of diet cola
here you go honey
youre looking wonderful john
i cant believe we got you here
hows the new residence
what does that mean
not too good in daylight
cmon just shut your eyes until its painted
youre gonna love it
this is gods country john
this in huge close up
focus hardens on a finger tip
a shock of light
the focus adjusts and a flash bulb fires again
ber lin moves away from the view finder
chewing gum stuck to the side of the camera returns to his mouth
he activates an auto matic rewind
it fills the silence while he heads for a phone
a lot of paraphernalia and technical type of shit
the bullet in board is filling up
photographs chronicle the hours spent on the dump
he dials with eyes on the pictures
a dozen cata logue discovery of the bra
this is mike blattis i cant take your call right now if you have a message you know the sound
a reel to reel tape recorder the size of a refrigerator domin ates the room
a black board details day night weekend shifts
a rack of night sticks
and of course paperwork
venables crouches over a desk filling something in
would you drop these off for me
sure he will and six rolls of film are handed across
are you winning sir
berlin smiles and venables follows him out into the corridor
a couple of coppers on their way in
one big and morose looking called bisley
the other weve already met
tay lor is a tall balding guy with hazy reddish hair how you doin
berlin responds a happy o
with eyes returning to venables
you know something strange about that hand
i think it was frozen
what does that mean to you
they arrive in the big room
cmon venables youre a policeman
and policemen always have an answer
well we had a very bad murder here coupla years ago
not act ually in our county but south of here
girl with no head no hands
you didnt read about it
he didnt it was big shit
they had forty fifty detective working it
nev er identified her
never found the head never found the hands
a vacuum cleaner starts somewhere but berlin isnt hearing it
so it could be that some crazys stored her hand in a freezer and only now decided to get rid of it
where do i find the file on that
in there if we got anything
i believe the code was jennifer
berlin is already looking
a last question as venables leaves
was it really frozen sergeant
been dead two weeks
the atrophied hand is emersed in some kind of fluid
index and second fingers bound with wire just below the upper joint
ber lin reaches for steel pliers
his face remains in close up for a nasty snap as he cuts a finger off
hes filling a syringe with the same fluid when ross walks in
jesus you still here
what time is it
seven thirty five
here town gets top cop
i was gonna pin it to your wall
a newspaper featuring a small photograph and article on berlin
holding the finger he carefully inserts a hypodermic needle un der the wire
gently shoots in fluid to inflate the finger pad
why so coy about the word frozen
because dont get into it
theres nothing in the files
watch my lips
dont get into it
the finger pad is sufficiently restored to try and get a print
it wasnt our case wasnt our coun ty and got nothing to do with that
a slide projector does its stuff on a sheet of card pinned to the door
close up of the hand and off screen voice of berlin
notice anything weird about it
the answer from ross is no
a pen moves into frame and berlin points to marks on the hand
the machine shunts up another slide
now the back of the hand
i count eleven scars on this hand and four that might be
now i count em on my hand
im years old
this girls about
how come shes got so many scars
he walks out of the projection beam and neon light flutters on
so tell me about jennifer
reaches for a pack of cigarettes and perches on a nearby stool
you know im gonna find out
berlin counts out cigarettes
and destroys them in an ashtray
its an unsolved
they spent thousand dollars bought emselves a dead end you might wanna check it with taylor he worked the case
i already did
whats his problem
ross reaches for the paper thumb tacks it to the wall that
he thinks you stole his promotion
re cigarettes what exactly you doin there john
its a method for quitting smoking
a zippo opens sports l
insignia and berlin lights up
he takes a punishing hit and exhales a lungful across the lab
thats an interesting method
must help beat the withdrawal
back on his feet berlin is about to begin more work on the hand
its a technique i read about
if you smoke a day you buy three packs throw one cigar ette away and smoke
day you throw away and smoke
why dont you throw them all away and smoke none
because its a ritual you gotta go through with
im down to
daftest thing ross ever heard
berlin is poised to make a print
you want my advice
find yourself a farmers daughter with nice big fucking tits and shake that bye bye
send it to sacramento john
i sniff grief
berlin ross are opposite ends of a bed jammed on the stairs
i gave em a buck tip
various navigational sug gestions from ross win them another stair
plus advice from a year old called bobby
you gotta go left dad
ross knows hes gotta go left
both heave as margie walks out the kitchen
youre all done except the floor
the house is a zoo of furniture
bullshit piled up everywhere
youre a saint margie thanks
by now shes got the apron off and her coat on
dont forget the wagon darlin
and off they go via a slammed door as the phone starts to ring
in they stagger
the bed goes down
and berlin sprawls on top of it
devastated for oxygen
you gotta stop smoking
i am stopping smoking
i dont mean this system shit that keeps you sucking i mean stop
i was exactly like you are
i used to wake in the night heart going so hard i coulda made love with my left tit
if i can stop you can
howd you do it old man
someone bet me a dollar
not worth giving up for a dollar
berlin manages to find air to sit
reaches for the ansa phone
ill bet you fifty
first call comes from delaware roofing vis a vis the estimate
you got a bet
during these proceedings the machine has moved to another call
ronzo got some results for you first the blood on the bra is human and its not a popular brand a
neg and thats a rare one two the blood on the brassie re is compatible with the blood from the hand three if you need anything else the official answer
from all us christians down here is fuck off shoot me a duck bye what are you gonna do soldier
im gonna dig up jennifer
and heres part of the exhumation
citrine stares at a tele type machine waiting for transmission on jennifer to complete
approximate date of birth approximate date of death identity unknown
visible misgivings as he hauls it out and reads
one or two chairs already on desks
ross still at his pawing over documents with a detective called serato
cigarette smoke and shirt sleeves
ross looks up and catches citrine as he passes
chief i gotta talk to ya about this fat lady
what about her
shes making my life a misery
i wanna give her a lie detector test
citrine continues up the carpet
alright well talk about it
a florescent glow from a t
monitor supplies the only light
berlin vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen
what is that
laser enhancement of the finger tip
its really bothering me
see these striations right here
green on the screen its like shes always worrying the end of her finger
rubbing it with a thumb nail or something
but citrine isnt interested in finger nails
hes staring at a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl
she wears a brassiere stuffed with newspaper and a black wig
welcome jennifer two shes almost identical to jennifer
slim white same age bra size is even the same
nicely made lady
citrine stares at the dummy like hes gonna ask it a question
how do you know her hairs black
hair on her hand
plus jen nifer had raven black hair
what is all this jennifer stuff
he waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench
these cases arent connected john
yes sir i think they maybe
i think jennifer and this lady got hit by the same guy
i dont see that at all
on the board is a super imposed picture of a hand over a wrist
i got four points of posit ive comparison on the cut
yeah thats all very inter esting but wheres the body
a question he doesnt need because he hasnt an answer
citrine has an eye on further photographs relevant to the jennifer case
i dont know nothing about this jenn ifer girl cept what some of the guys told me but principal feature of the case was a gruesome displayal of the body
he wanted it found
so if this is the same guy whys he hidden this one
another question he cant answer and this time he doesnt get a chance bisley walks in with an apology for the interruption
got a face like humphrey bogarts mother fucked a different guy
just wondered if you had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff
youll have it in the morning
alright ill try again tomorrow
bisley has gone but his tension stays
berlin unwraps fresh gum
probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall
he worked a lotta time on this
i thought it was taylors case
sucked in officers from all over the county
and it was the worst six months this station ever had
this is citrines shop and berlin isnt gonna row it with him
what do you want me to do chief
im not telling you what to do
what i will say is right now that childs tricycle there is more important to me than this
he refers to a little bicycle
vouchered and obviously stolen
by now citrine is at the hinges
a pause before he disappears
why dont you give it a minute stop by my office
we should talk
melted neon in the streets
a wet mid town night
nothing but sound of windshield wipers and click of a zippo lighter
ross rides stoic passenger while berlin drives with festering eyes
what does he think it is
everything it isnt make a left
he even tried a self inflicted
cmon ross the bra and hand were in different bags a feet apart
they stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind
whats she gonna do
dump her bra in one bag her hand in the other and wander off whistling hey jude
its the garage on the far corner
berlin is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the zippo
you cant stop it can you
what do you mean
worrying clicking picking you may as well be back in los angeles
what do you mean ross
the lights change and off they go and berlin waits for a turn
why dont you dump it
mail it off
give the fucking f
why dont you dump the fat lady
because i dislike her too much
and im not in love with this fukker
thats how i feel about him
no you dont
thats how you think you feel about him
thats how you feel about yourself
you wont give yourself one fucking minute for you
and by now theyve arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt
its indicative of their friendship that ross can talk like this
wait for me
it might not be ready
he quits the car and berlin watches him scurry towards a service shop
rain beats on the roof and berlin looks stubbed out
a lot of cuts coming up and here are some of them
runs a hand through his hair in unconscious frustration
a finger constantly bothers the zippo
eyes towards ross who silhouettes in florescent light
somewhere in the background the lights change to red
once again the beeping sound of traffic lights speaking to the blind
maybe he looks across but that doesnt matter
something just happens inside his head he isnt yet quite aware of
everything in close up
big on the zippo
big on berlin
and he leaps out of the car
berlin sprints through the weather
a station wagon is still in the air at the end of an hydraulic jack
surprise from ross and a mechanic as berlin arrives
fuck the fanbelt and listen to this
i just had this insane idea if im wrong ill take a week off and redecorate your entire house
rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them
shes blind ross thats why all the scars hear that traffic light
that noise is to help blind people thats why the marks on her finger tips
this lady reads in braille
berlin sits at a desk at the end of the room
nothing here but a legal pad and a phone
the pad is covered in names numbers
right now hes into a call and this is sounding promising
and he writes
about weeks ago
hope in his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ann
shes doing what hes doing on a different line wait a minute i specific ally said i was looking for a girl
and all hope over because lesley is a boy
but here comes ann this might be something
shasta trinity institute
sticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call
berlin new call hello
this is sergeant berlin
yes thats right
i believe my assistant explained
how long ago was that
who is who
whass his name
ross in transit grinning from ear to ear
berlin interested in little but his notes and ross in nothing but obvious good news
pig woman agreed to take a test
i think i got something twenty two years old dark hair study ing mathematics yes yes im holding last seen weeks ago
mussorgsky is back on a shock cut
big music and a shattering landscape
juniper woods and mountains
sunlight on fresh fal len snow
somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley
rosss car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches it away
an unexpected building in the distance
victorian at a glance but probably later
a clock tower and fifty lifeless windows
the chevy disappears towards its somber architecture
pine trees and slush and parked cars
the chevrolet swings in and parks in front of the mansion
breath in the air and eyes on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance
berlin first with ross following
as soon as they hit the ent rance they trigger a recorded voice
you are now at the main entrance
there are six steps
midway up them with ross look ing back
reception is through swing doors and to your right
goodridge is mid s with a beard like abraham lincoln
sits far side of his desk alternating eyes between ross and berlin
the latter studies a photograph of a girl in a file
its pos sible theyve found jennifer two
how recent is the picture
as recent as we have
what ex actly is your interest in amber
im afraid i cant give you an ans wer to that mr goodridge
as i ex plained to your secretary were do ing a lotta looking but were not even sure its her were lookin for
then what are you hoping im gon na do
dissuade or persuade you
i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is
then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving sergeant
what i said on the phones the same as im saying now
i got no idea where amb er is or who it was took her there
he doesnt like them but not as much as ross doesnt like him
a blind girl can just walk out of here and you dont know who with
you find something curious in that
yeah i guess i do
then let me put your mind at ease
firstly amber isnt blind she has some useful vision and second this isnt a prison its a college of higher education a severe vis ual disability doesnt mean my stud
ents dont value their independence as much as anybody else and amber was a very independent young woman she decided to leave so she left
and you got no idea with who
no sergeant i got no idea with who
and i might add that in another six weeks a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here driving away for their christmas holidays with pe ople whose name i
wont know either
ross could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex cuses himself to answer it
whatever he hears he isnt liking
you have an appointment with miss robertson
as shes a member of my staff may i ask what this is about
well apparently she saw amber the weekend she left was briefly in the room with the guy she left with
well shes teaching an other class at four
id apprec iate it if you dont detain her
looking back down a deserted corridor
someone tried to put sun shine on the walls with yellow paint
somewhere a long way away there is a sound like children singing
ross loathes this joint
loathes its silence
eyes back to berlin as he rings a doorbell
where is everyone
i guess this is staff side of the building
here come footsteps and the door is opened by helena robertson
early s and blonde and not immediately beautiful
but delic ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes
they look away for introductions as though shes shy
ross berlin grab glances as they follow in
neither expected helena to be blind
claustrophobia evaporates instantly
great views down the val ley from every window
plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and colors
but no pictures on the walls
no friendly photographs
nor any lights
although the afternoon is shutting down there isnt a light in the room
ross elects to stay at the windows
berlin takes an offered chair
helena sits nervously opposite
what dyou wanna ask mr ross
im mr berlin
mr ross is right here
and mr ross is maybe gonna take a few notes if thats o
she nods o
id like you to tell me in what ever way you want what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft ernoon she left
take your time and nothings too trivial o
well i think i told you on the phone
i went up to her room to say good bye and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while while her friend was coming in and out collecting
what kind of friend
was he a boy friend
an old friend
lots of headshake
and lots of silences
i really dont know
can you give me any idea what this fellow was like
headshake well dyou know how old he was
headshake alright let me put it this way
how old dyou think i am
or fifty three
possibly the only grin ross is going to get out of this place
you must have some idea about him
when we spoke on the phone did you know i was blonde
you heard my voice
a good point
and a point taken
and berlin might even say so
we dont have some kind of sixth sense you know
ex cept in ridiculous novels
now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room
he used a breath freshener
a sardonic headshake from ross
well that solves the case then
and i think his name was john
you never said that on the phone
what makes you think his name was john
i dont know
i guess she must have called him john
im mak ing tea
would you like some
berlin would but ross wouldnt
she leaves and whispers begin
this looks promising
i think this one could be it
thank christ we got a witness
let me just keep going a while
she might remember something
shes blind bro
you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano
he thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright
were better off having another pop at old abe lincoln down the re
get angry with the prick
get some of his useful visions in
someone must have seen something
negative from berlin
checked it out
sunday and no one about
this is fucken crazy
two hours here two hours back and the only word ive written is john
a touch later and the sun is setting
ross stands at a window to watch it go
watches one or two cars driving away
watches a bird sitting outside on the fire escape
berlins voice can just about be heard off screen you said he spoke
can you re member what he said
ross saunters back into helenas answer
well he just said come on hurry up will you because its starting to snow again
empty teacups and empty notebook
ross sits opposite berlin
and i remember he was a lit tle breathless from carrying the cases because the elevat or had gone out that weekend
the elevator wasnt working
no it has a mind of its own
a clock strikes four somewhere
and berlin knows hes lost it
can i see your hands
he takes her hands and helena immediately looks uncomfortable
he examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes
i have a class
i have to go
is there anything else you can tell me
anything about him or her
doesnt matter how small
except he smoked
yes i could smell it on his breath like i can on yours
a taut instant between ross and berlin
berlin caught out and he knows it
ross roars in silence you lying pig and writes in his notebook
the angle switches to see berlin is a liar
i really have to go
everyone suddenly on their feet and helena gets into a jacket
dyou have a dog
seeing eye dog
lotta scratch marks on your door
sometimes i look after friends dogs if they go to dances or something
could i just refer you to this memo here sergeant
he tries to get his notebook under berlins nose
but berlin isnt looking or listening but following helena into her hall
did amber have a dog
what color was it
i dont know
she opens the door and ross is barely through before it slams
ross baits berlin up the corridor
ridicules in silence while counting imaginary winnings
watch my lips
helena walks innocent of the pantomime and berlin tries to ignore it
if she writes or calls or any thing at all you let me know o
he bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge rosss bullshit
ill leave a number with the office
lips drill a whisper into his ear
fifty fucken dollars o
what exactly do you teach helena
fifty of em
and i want em now
meanwhile the elevator arrives triggering a voice
you are now on the fourth floor
doors slide open and christ look at this
what kind of eye defect needs glasses like this
lenses like ei ther half of a glass ball
hes early s and decidedly iffy
is he student staff or what
as he exits they enter staring aft er him
as the doors close the myopic turns to stare after them
ross drives and berlin studies ambers file
no answer but cans appear anyway from a pack between rosss legs
had a seeing eye dog since she was eighteen
didnt i tell you those dogs meant something
no you didnt
alright i didnt but i nearly did and if i had id have been right
i knew there was some thing about that labrador that dog was too good to be dead
we gotta get back up that dump
not me mister
im not going up there again
might find someones prick in a hot dog roll
they got stringent hyg iene rules
hes long gone in lime
ross pops cans and hands one over
but berlin doesnt want it
im feeling lucky
so am i
but wheres my money
dont start again
if you win a bet you cant keep winning it
pay me and i shut up
i havent got it
then give me that zippo
i need some security
i dont trust you anymore
i had one puff on a pipe
i dont want excuses i want that weird looking stuff called cash
snaps fingers gimme the lighter
and he does to shut him up
ill tell you what im gonna do
im gonna do you a big favor
forget the and ill keep this
what do you want it for
to throw out of the window
does it as he says it
bye bye zippo
berlin cant believe it
what are you doing ross
ive had that years
its not your friend
it keeps you sucking
remem ber the old bums lungs
i remember the old bastards liver
i dont believe you did that
i had a great sent imental attachment to that
you want me to stop the car
an academic question considering the zippo went down a ravine
get me to that garbage dump
im gonna find that fucking dog
gloom congeals around flashlights
a winter mist falling down
trimble and doberman watch as berlin goes at it with a shovel
a dozen graves already dug and hes halfway into another
des pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves
also breathless and rests to catch his wind
dont you have to go to bed
no he doesnt
he wants to see the victim
digging recommences with trimble supplying the light
berlin suddenly stops
get that lamp down here
theyve found the dog
berlin begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his teeth
eyes excitedly back to trimble and gesturing towards a bag
that bag there
you find a knife and a paira long nosed pliers
trimble does it relishing the snap of a switch blade
berlin still busy with the light in his mouth
trimble pissed because he cant see whats happening
berlin removes a crump led bullet from the back of the labradors skull
holds it up for scrutiny
looks like a
you didnt shoot him did you
i love dogs
letters big as a house
the printer reciprocates as fast as its mechanics are capable
details coming in from san diego
vicap case number f
case number victim status etc etc
letters smacking into paper too fast to read
but one de tail is repeated constantly and underlined
transmission ends and berlin hauls at least a yard of homicide out of the machine
cant believe what hes looking at
he hit six
reads as he walks back into the big room and gets interrupted by a call
he heads for the phone with eyes following ann find ross for me will you
berlin phone berlin
thats nice of you helena but i already found out
no no of course not good of you to call
you heard a what
a hollow car
a hand shoves papers at the edge of his vision
taylor looks a mite cheesy
you got a minute for this
and berlin nods sure
yes im still here
why didnt you mention that
al right we should talk again
no im just south of my eye lids in it right now
how about sunday
the first shining day of november
sand dunes and an infinite stretch of beach
behind the sea break is a lagoon and a tiny harbor
berlins mercedes descends the coast road towards it
rosss boat is a foot fisherman
shining brass and varnish
but like him its getting on and often grumpy
this last qual ity presently evident in both
engine roaring and ross is cov ered in oil
berlin has to shout above the racket to be heard
i put the slug in for a ballis tics report the man tells me for get it
soft lead its worthless
i think fuck it
and fuck citrine
i call a friend of mine in los ang eles and he runs our whole damned show through a main frame looking for anything similar to our ladies shot with
a twenty two you dont believe what he finds in san diego
ross detours eyes to wave at his son
watch those revs there
would you shut it down a min ute ross
this is important
ross signals bobby to turn off
and the diesel splutters down
alright lets take a walk around the block
i gotta buy a gasket
seagulls and sunshine and probably saturday because the place is busy
ross walks with berlin up a wooden quay
their journ ey will take them across a small bridge towards a marine shop
six girls over a period of months and give or take a head or two the m
s exactly the same
all shot with a high velocity twen ty two in the back of the head
how come the f
dont put anya this together
they work ed over jennifer for months
they possibly did but they nev er had a head so they never had a bullet and they never got an i
not on any of em never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is were the first to get a positive identity
identity of whom
you got a girl doesnt even have a drivers lic ense
shes untraceable john
you need fifty detectives on this
thats what im here for
i want you to come and see citrine with me
hes not gonna here it from me but i know hed listen to you
listen to me saying what
i wanna take that fucking blind in stitute to pieces
every address book every phone call everyone in and outta there in the last years
for a dead dog
weve fused into a major series ross
this girl isnt the second victim
this is jennifer eight
and this is the second time they stop and stare at each other
that old wino on the heap wasnt a suicide
he stumbled into some thing saw something and whoever took him out knew how to fake it
that isnt what you said before
i was wrong
says it with remarkable humility considering hes the expert
im going in to see citrine this afternoon
will you come with me
hes in hospital
he was trying out a new pair of skis in his hallway
the phone rings and he goes for it and falls off
he must be the only skier in northern california to break a leg in his living room
they arrive at the chandlers with berlin in no mood to smile
you believe me dont you
what does it matter what i bel ieve
what you gotta worry about is what citrine believes
but he doesnt really believe it
and doesnt enjoy saying no
but i cant help you with this
we cant go through the door with two contentious issues you with a mass murderer and me with the mayors best friend
do that we lose both
im sorry bro youre on your own
the mercedes and music travel north
the latter made sinister by this landscape
forest plunging into dark ravines
the sun colors the mountains red
but most of the valley is in shadow
a high wind in the chimneys
and the view is still from above
like someones looking down from the top of the building
and maybe someone is
berlin parks it and gets out
stretches and walks towards the institute
he looks very small from up here
helena plays elgar in an empty gymnasium
sunlight streams in staining the air red
as berlin arrives doors on the opposite wall flap together like somebody just hurried out
did he see someone
the trees outside move a lot of shadows
berlin takes one to watch her re hearse
realizes just how beautiful she is
and helena realiz es someone is there
before she can ask he identifies himself
have you been here long
no just a minute or two
i knocked on your door no one home so i followed the music
ill get my things
im not in a hurry
but shes already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag
matter of fact i saw a little restaurant place down the road
looked kinda pretty
i thought maybe we could have some lunch
no answer but the answer is no
berlin finds her book for her
was some one in here with you
when i came in the door was flapping
i dont think so
no one comes here at the weekends
the gale shouts its head off
the camera looks down from above
nothing to see except the stairwell and a hand on the banister
i suppose im the worst witness youve ever had
i gotta admit youre one of them
just wish i knew what you meant by a hollow car
well some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin and this kind of car sounded hollow
any moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close up
maybe it was a foreign car
our kinda cars sound fat
the elevator is parked on this floor with its doors half open
are you sure you wanna see it
its another three floors up
despite breathlessness he does
how often does it break down
oh all the time
they keep threatening to have it re placed but they never will
gloomy windows and a wardrobe
berlin walks in leaving helena at the door
i sat right there on the bed
the bed is gone but why tell her
he checks the wardrobe
if i came to the diner with you would you bring me back
of course i would
his smile deteriorates as he realizes shes staring at him
what are you staring at hel ena
you suddenly reminded me of him
he was standing right where you are kind of breathless like you
nothing happening except the wind
then a smile as she leaves
ill get my coat wait for you downstairs
and he begins an exploration
musty bathroom with old fashion ed fixtures
a tap leaking behind shower curtains
nothing in the cabinet
nothing under the sink
six steps and he is in a kitchen
finally finds something worth looking for
tears the sack out of a vacuum cleaner
discovers a knot of hair from a black dog
simultaneously the door slams
shock powers him in to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock
hits the door and shouts
hears footsteps moving rapidly away
a huge christmas poster advertises shasta trinity arts crafts
helena sits in the deserted foyer reading braille
the volume is the size of a phone directory
berlin appears via the main entrance
windswept and wasted and surprised shes still here
im sorry someone slammed the door on me
i couldnt get out
it was probably the wind
hellava wind that turns a key
but he says nothing
takes the book while she gets into her coat
shes obviously made an ef fort
a change of clothes and her hair pinned up
but she has got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin
what are you reading
have you read it
by now theyre at the doors with berlin escorting her through
red brick walls and help yourself to salad
all but empty and their food is yet to arrive
berlin is clearly having a tough time with the conversation
basically because there isnt any
ill tell you what if i prom ise to stop being a cop will you promise to stop being a witness
helena sits frozen like shes waiting for results of an x ray
i mean we dont havta sit here waiting for me to ask the next question
you could ask one too
are you wearing a uniform
well im glad we got the conver sational side of lunch over with
i dont like sitting in the middle of a restaurant
i feel like everyones looking at me
theres no one looking at you
theres hardly anyone in here
the only person looking at you is me
and he likes what hes looking at
and maybe helena senses it
are you married
but i dont like to talk about it
you just asked me to ask you questions
i know but you pick on the one time in my life i like not to remember
i was in the bad lands
really not well
its something that happens to a lota cops
we dont wanna talk about that
thoughts that lie too deep for tears
yeah thatll do
is that hamlet
do you like poetry
his attention is temporarily elsewhere
a lunch party just arr ived
its clear goodridge is profoundly unhappy to see berlin
i dont know i havent read much
i dont think poetrys my kinda thing
do you pray
you said you were in the bad lands
no i dont pray
had a dream once about god just around the time i was getting well
he was a nasty lookin little guy moved into the apartment right on topa me
i said dont you listen to peoples prayers
he said prayers
theyre junk mail
big pines either side of the driveway
the camera sits in the back more interested in the approaching institute than berlin
i got really sick of the street
so i went to school and became a scientific services officer which is basically a scene of crime off icer
then this came up and i got what they call a lateral transfer
pulls into a parking spot and the next sound is the hand brake
i couldnt take another minute of los angeles
felt like id said sorry in every street in the city
sorry your father mother sis ter whatever
i couldnt take another day of it
come on im gonna rob you of a cup of coffee
berlin looks down from the fire escape
for the first time the place sounds busy
cars arriving and doors slamming
voices of students coming back from the weekend
why were you out there
helena waits inside and didnt realize he was back in the room
coz i wanted to feel the snow on my face
i think thats when i heard her call him john
time to go and both know it
stale shadows and growing silence
is it snowing now
getting dark though
and his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it
you think youd know this man
if he was in the room with you again
youve already asked me that
the silence is almost uncomfortable
berlin continues to stare
ambers dead isnt she
pretty houses in a pretty little street
hills in the back and sunshine out front
berlin pulls up in his mercedes and does a bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes
this could only be mrs citrine
a budget smile and hes inside
dozens of repulsive paintings
a truly repulsive painting by numbers of the mona lisa in progress
the color codes are com pletely fucked up
citrine wears a wooly hat and hates walking on crutches
berlin picked a bad day to come in here with this
youre pushing this too hard
its like you want me to say stop
you must know thats the way this is going john
theres other work to do why dont ya ease off a little
coz this is a major were closer to this bastard than anyones ever been
then wheres the body
wheres the body and whys he hidden it
he hasnt hidden it
he never made a hit this far north before and he never read a weather forecast
shes probably fifteen feet from the highway three feet under snow
have you got a match on the bullet
have you got a print from the hand
it could be anyones hand
illeg ally disposed of hospital debris
its her hand
her dogs shot
and shes missing
shes not missing
did she shout
did she scream
did he coerce her
she left of her own free will
and if she gets on a plane and goes to peru with the prick shes still not missing
you got no case john
if youre not gonna hear me chief
i have heard you
you just dont like hearing me
you got this whole damned thing outta proportion
i dont know what you gotten used to in los angeles but i dont believe theres a police chief in this country would put a task force together for a
we have a multiple homicide sir
we have a body part in suspicious circumstances a tailors dummy wearing a brassiere and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig
berlin arrives at the station in the same mood he left citrine
heads for his room and runs into rosss stare
problems on his plate too
he sits at his desk looking uncharacteristically an xious
what ever hes drinking isnt tea
he finds a bottle of j b in a drawer and walks toward berlins freshly slammed door
the lab is stuffed with junk waiting his attention
dozens of common things made sinister by their labels and plastic sacks
ross delivers a dose of scotch in a plastic cup
pours himself another
leans on a bench and gets into the pissed off silence
did he shut you down
how you doing
i dunno i darent go in there just about get her wired up and the fucking mayor walks in mad as hell what are we doing fuck ing with his
we should be out chasing major violators
i wish hed tell that to citrine
he almost does the whiskey but reaches for chewing gum instead
he thinks the kid shot the dog
he looks at ross like what are you looking at me like that for
did i say he did
you looked like you did
no i think youll find i looked like he could have
by accident even
hes up here spraying the scenery all day
he didnt shoot it ross
and no way by accident
theres a flash burn
it was point blank
serato walks in with a cigarette plugged into his ashen kisser
say you didnt say that angelo
i said it
oh my god mothers shit
are we in it
this room and the interrogation room are linked with a one way mirror
berlin looks through munching gum
emerson is years old and many pounds of vexed flesh
but something about her ex pression expects apology
serato paces the place chain smoking
ross listens devastated as the expert explains his lousy chart
this is the important one
she gets a dead straight line and thats an exceptional reading
this is the stupidest thing we ever done
fucking citrines gonna fire one of us for this
i cant believe it
i just know she someway busted it
this is an honest girl
she couldnt lie if she tried
is she lying ross
for a moment there is an intense trust between ross and berlin
alright fuck it
lets go for broke
berlin grabs the read out
fueled on residual anger he vanishes out the door
ross is fir st at the mirror to see him reappear in the interrogation room
the polygraph machine looks like state of the art
a table and two chairs
berlin takes one and sits opposite emerson
she at tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare
my names sergeant john berlin
and the time is his
he knows what hes doing
and she doesnt
i been a policeman years years months of which with the l
i witnessed literally hundreds of lie detector tests and i never seen one like this
what dya mean sergeant
well look at it
look at this line
thats the important one
dead straight down the page
no body gets a dead straight down the page
even our expert says a dead straights exceptional
all hes doing is telling her truth
up to her to interpret it
thought you might wanna comment
a tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born
i wasnt actually lying officer
and suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is max factor
hes got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push
you busted the box lady
you flunk ed it
you lied about things you didnt need to lie about
the only truthful statement you mades your name
your name is carol emerson
the quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible sort of groan
shes bellied up and anxious to spill her beans
berlin better get through the door fast because he might laugh
you tell one more lie youre go ing in a cell
sergeant ross is coming in to take your statement
a wave atomizes and comes down like silver champagne
helena berlin hang on the prow of the boat with the ocean rushing bel ow
another wave and more spray for helena
she turns like get ting sea in your face is the best invention ever
oilskins sat urated and her hair streaming and she knows hes loving it too
sunshine spray on the windshield
ross at the wheel with mar gie next to him
eyes on berlin helena playing like children
such a shame
shes a really sweet kid
shes a doll
but i wish he hadnt brought her out here
stairs descend to a cabin and ross interrupts himself to shout
bobby what happened to that beer
rule one is you dont diddle around with a witness
hes happy darlin
im sure he is
but gettin in to the element is a bad idea
bobby clatters up the stairs clutching a six pack of budweiser
tell em im going up the coast a way get out of this weather
bobby exits the wheelhouse and walks their eyes back to helena
except for the hair color she looks just like suzanne
well thats who she is
cept she cant run away
wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore
smoke from a dying barbecue and nat king cole croons unforget able
ross sports shades and sits staring down the line
some one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the boat
helena teaches bobby to play chords
hardly worth the ef fort but theyre enjoying it
berlin looks down from the oppos ite side of the deck
his gaze interrupted by margie you want another coke honey
sure he does and her eyes travel to ross
you want something darling
i wouldnt mind another b
in code so berlin wont understand
but he and ross swap grins
how much longer you on that diet
im doing it by the day
margie climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself
popped cans change the subject
this seems like a question ber lin doesnt really want to ask margie doesnt want to answer
hows your little sister
shes in europe
clearly a sensitive subject and ross decides the truth is best
she married some english prick
hes not that bad of a guy
got a handshake like a partially excited penis
the joke doesnt reach berlin
margies hand is on his shoulder
her loss darlin
and she heads for the lower deck
a sweet smile as she descends
anyway youre doing o
shes a sweet heart
and also playing the guitar in my life
and she does it well
whys she blind bro
slow banging of something swaying
and this exchange goes slow
whole family wiped out
a bleeper goes on one of the lines and ross twists in his seat
strap me in
here comes another
and he winds in yet another three quarters of a pound mackerel
worst days fishing i ever had
its been a great day
ross dexterously extracts the hook with serious eyes on berlin
you just go easy brother
looks at fish alright were all goin home
darkness in about an hour
wide over the car park
sand dunes surround it
practically deserted of cars
headlights snap on focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good byes
i really liked margie
silhouettes with exaggerated shadows walk across the car park
what does she do
she runs a kind of hair dress ing and you know beauty salon
have you known her long
i was married to her sister
the angle changes and is closer now
helena has taken his arm
you dont ask what im like
i know what youre like
how dyou know what im like
ross told me
what did he say
he said youre quite chubby
and you have a nervous tick
he said that
what else did he say
just your age
which is what
i dont mind
berlin is more amused than annoyed
they arrive at the car and his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from helena
you wanna drive
cmon were in a car park miles from any where
theres nothing arou nd but nothing and sand dunes
i cant drive a car
doesnt like cars
but hes not hearing
cmon itll be fun
you can drive me around in circles
no lady ever had a driving lesson like this before
berlin all but sits in her seat
arm on the back of it
hand on the wheel
for a split second theyre doing
now theyre doing about
the mercedes spirals in widening circles
instructions and enc ouragement from berlin
the mercedes straightens and heads through the dunes
its a big car park
were going along a little track
helena may like driving but she doesnt like the sound of that
its not a public road
headlights behind them approach quickly
disappear and reappear as they follow the geography of the dunes
berlin only now bec omes aware of them
one more dip and they slam in
her anxiety is misinterpreted
he takes the wheel
let him pass
the vehicle is right up behind them
as it overtakes helena is scared
and still scared even though berlin has stopped the car
its alright im sorry
it was my fault it wasnt a good idea
that was the hollow car john
just time to see tail lights of a van disappearing in the gloom
a volkswagen van
are you sure
rain lashes the windows
but a lot of improvements inside
new paint and now carpet
not a lot of furniture but it looks nice enough
theres even a fire in the grate
berlin sits at a tab le on the phone
the voice hes hearing will talk in brackets berlin phone is it a two door slide door a what
i dont know well you gotta get closer than just a v
you re talking maybe thousand veh icles
what happens if you just run the name john against all of them
heads for a sofa
paperback of hamlet
tv on without sound
frankly that isnt gonna do you any good
youll be knocking on doors all over the state
you gotta request tho se jennifer files maybe something in them give us some kinda reference
christmas ads interrupt the movie
berlin sighs in frustration
starts doodling on the paperback
shakespeare acquires glasses
i cant request anything right now
push one more inch i lose the lot
well listen ill run the bay area for you
but if you want a print out of every john in california with a v
van thats gotta be official
thank you dan
a painting of ronald reagan fills the screen
so awful its al most impressive
next to it is a formal photograph of the city mayor mr heineman
berlin continues to wait with eyes switch ing to a picture of the taj mahal
i love to paint
he turns as citrine walks in
its not great art but i change the col ors
heads for his desk and sits dispensing with the crutches
im shutting you down on this blind thing john
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman
dont underestimate me
the mayors pissed but thats nothing to do with this sit down how many times have you been up at that institute
three or four
im talking outside the girl
got a letter from this goodridge guy
says youre upsetting his students
thats bullshit he says you freaked one of em out
reading the letter asking a newly blind kid if he can see is both cruel and dangerous
he floats the letter across the desk and hears the explanation
i never asked if he could see
i just asked one or two of the stud ents if they remembered anything
and did they
citrine rubs his forehead in preparation to change the subject im not a nasty man john im a nice man
i get a lot of christmas cards a lot of cards on the wall and im getting a lot of complaints
the guy you replaced was something you re not a lazy sonovabitch but the reality is i was getting a faster ser vice outta popeye than i am outta you
i cant allow this to continue john
if there was any argument to be had berlin would be arguing it
i dont want you up at that institute again
and im flat out about that
im sorry i know it means something to you you can go tell your witness if you feel you must but as far as youre concerned the case is closed
colored lights strung across the street
symptoms of christmas everywhere
store windows full of trashy decorations and every thing soluable in mist
ross and berlin develop out of it like polaroids
their destination is a dingy looking downstairs bar
god it pisses me off ross
no god brother
if there was a god asses wouldnt be at the perfect height for kicking
this is the local coppers bar
its full of cigarette smoke coppers
laughter sugar music
ill be seeing you
sentim ental journey
either one of these is playing
familiar faces among those drinking at the bar
the forty two year old blonde serving them is busy
she is in possession of very big breasts
can i buy you a beer sergeant
dont try and ingratiate your self with me venables
but just this once ill have a heineken
and john here will have one too
ross pokes venables a surreptitious with eyes on the blonde
right now shes far end of the bar delivering a beer to bisley
look at those amazingly bos oms you wanna beer king jay
no i gotta go
taylor gets a last cough out of a cigarette before stubbing it
gimme a ride
and hes already gathered his shit and halfway into his jacket
hows that hand job comin along john
berlin makes a gesture hed have trouble understanding himself
hey were not talking talk tonight
no ones gonna make that gent
six months investigation the nearest we got we thought he was a sailor
by now taylor is moving through the crush of faces behind them
yeah in and outta frisco on the big boats
every lead we had went right out to sea
night night freddy t
how come hes suddenly so forth coming
id like to kick him right in the ass
if hed discussed it with me i mighta gotten somewhere
i never knew about the sailor the ory ross
he might have that one little thing i need in his files
john stop it
the case is on its ass youre closed
reaches for a menu
cmon let it go for once
have a drink
cmon relax drink your beer
and just that one moment of insanity as berlin downs it in one
lets have some wine
a shabby booth with black and whites of the two unrecognizable celebrities who ate here
hamburgers are almost over and a bot tle of wine almost drunk
both look tanked and especially ross
you gotta stop calling los angeles
youre dragging l
around with you like an addiction
look at the shit youre putting yourself through
for nothing i know it i been there
up to my asshole in anger living off the vitamins in cigarettes
if theres a body under the snow fuck it
let somebody else worry about it
you gotta accept you stopped living in that world try and give yourself a break in this
just makes to so god damned mad
youre a fucking great policeman but give yourself a break
youre here minutes you find yourself a fucking homicide
not many people could do that in a place like this
and you gotta admit theres a lot of shaky areas in this case
i mean stop me if im going up the wrong nostril
waving his empty at the bar ross communicates need for another
how dyou know this girl isnt lying to you
not lying as such but mak ing up stuff to keep you coming back
she wasnt lying about the van
alright she wasnt lying about the van
but it could have been any van
any little foreign diesel
shes blind bro
shes pro bably lonely and youre a nice guy to have around
but youre getting far too far into the element brother
you dont need me to tell you what hap pens when you get emotionally involved
alright enough ross
youll bring on my nervous tick
very late and the only light comes from coloured bulbs pulsing on a christmas tree
apparent berlin has had too much to drink
makes it to his desk and shuffles at the messages
one is just about important enough to get a close up
time subject berlin finishes typing something
tears it out and seals it in an envelope
shirt sleeves and yawns
he slumps in the chair stares at jennifer
fuck this for a friday night
hes had enough of it
grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights
berlin emerges from one office and heads for another
tay lor on the door
delivers the envelope and an his way out when something detains him
lights on the tree strobe through venit ian blinds
illuminate bits and pieces of rattan
plus a board covered in christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets
maybe motivated by the booze
but a desk drawer is open almost before he realizes it and he searches for a key
nothing but a bunch of business cards and family snaps
taylor with his moth er taylor with his sister red hair like him and taylor with his dog
the drawer slams and one underneath opens
same flot sam of personal junk
scotch tape and paper clips and more bus iness cards
a bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo
fuck all else and he closes the drawer
but whats this
a cane let ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys
excitement lasts as long as it takes to try them
dont fit ei ther lock
now hes staring at the shadows with nothing moving but thoughts
a few moments more and hes heading for the door
massive close up of the lock
a weird looking tool goes in and another follows it
this bastard aint easy even for an expert
the frame widens to reveal berlin
he shuffles picks in a wall et on top of the cabinet
was that a noise somewhere
he stops to listen
wipes cold sweat away
only thieves and foxes about
a final twist and the lock delivers
several dozen manilla col ored files from which to choose
a pair of folders titled jenn ifer travel to the desk
the first is full of press cuttings some gruesome looking snaps
next file and this one looks more interesting
a notebook full of random questions answers comm ents
a list of ships and sailing times
must follow this up underlined twice
cant over estimate importance
also under lined
lists of numbers
what ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on
taylor stands in the doorway
the surprise is mutual
the play one sided
this is already taylors game
smokes his cigarette
berlin is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain
feel like im getting close to this guy
and all the time feel like im sharpening a pencil with a broken load
im sorry king j
what are you looking for
he gestures to the right one
berlin feels about inches tall
im gonna get some coffee
when you finish in here maybe youll let me know
i got a report to type up
as he exits he tosses a bunch of keys
they crash uselessly on to the desk
berlin looks like he couldnt get a fuck with mud
the mood is low as it goes
and so is the angle
ultra low beh ind the car
just road and a blur of tires
the frame widens the mercedes fills it
brake lights on as it descends the hill
berlin in big close up
his face like the music
here come the gates of the institute
as he turns in he stamps the brakes
a van veers past him
nothing special about it except its a v
he watches it vanish up the hill with other things on his mind
christmas vacations and the building sounds deserted
berlins foot steps might be the only sound in the place
they stop and a bell rings
ho tries to assemble sox kind of appropriate ex pression
but as soon as she opens the door its obsolete
hel ena looks pretty as flowers delighted hes here
she reaches for his hands
and every new second makes it a tougher goodbye
oh jesus look at this
she prepared him a surprise dinner
and she looks so happy about it
a pathetic little table with cand les and forget me nots and can of diet coke by his plate
hes barely through the door and goodbye is already in deep trouble
i wanted it to be a surprise
berlins face gets ready for something he doesnt say
why did she have to do this
and why didnt he tell her over the phone
a schubert sonata in the background
candles low and the atmos phere junk
evening already in the room and it feels like time to go
but first hes gotta toll her something he doesnt want to hear himself
would you like me to make some fresh coffee
i have to talk to you helena
how do you know
coz you hardly said a word since you got here
but you been thinking pretty loud
she stands and collects the cups and gets halfway with a smile
ill make some more coffee
a hiss of running water
close on the kettle
close on the tap
she knows what hes going to say
and now shes alone her face doesnt mask her feelings
shes missing him already
but does nt know why
simply knows she doesnt want him to say goodbye
she reaches high into a cupboard
her shirt stretches over her breasts
christ this girl has a great figure
carting hair out of her eyes she returns to the sink
for an instant shes star ing out of the window and right into somebodys face
tall and weird looking
but just a glimpse before he moves rapidly away
berlin has moved to the sofa
a shaft of dead sunlight crosses the apartment
helena comes in making a brave face of it
does nt realize hes moved
im here helena
and she smiles and changes direction
puts the coffee tray on a table in front of him
no music now and all sounds in close up
close on the lip of the coffee pot as she pours
close on the cup she gives him
everything close in helenas world or her world wouldnt exist
not a lot to look at but the man is looking in
from his p
helena sits facing him but berlin has his back to the window
this sort of surveillance is always ominous and here is no exception
berlins explanation comes with occasion al use of hands
helena suddenly smiles so it cant be all bad
they stand and berlin reaches for his coat
helena crosses the room
finds her forget me nots and now theyre his at the door
as he takes them he takes her hand
kisses her finger tips and cant avoid embracing her
they kiss like awkward kids bumping noses
finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway
berlin is already in the elevator
resists doors determined to separate them
they shunt in and out perpetually informing him hes on the th floor
ill call o
she nods and releases his hand
he watches her walk all the way back up the corridor
headlights follow the meandering road
another bend and lights in the distance
in seconds hes passing the diner
still open with cars out front including the white volkswagen that nearly busted his fender
hes not gonna stop
then decides to
makes a u and pulls in
parks a couple of vehicles away from the van
helena finishes the dishes
stacks a last plate and closes the cupboard
heads back into the living room
something about the apartment doesnt sound right
she follows the noise through a door into a bedroom
curtains dance in the darkness and behind them she finds a half open window
curious because she doesnt remember leaving it open
secures it and silences the icy wind
berlin checks the drivers door
locked and he explores with a pencil flashlight
moves to a slide door at the side
simultan eously the door to the diner opens releasing a quartet of midd le aged drunks
he dissolves while they bullshit around
laugh ter in chill air
the comedian of the night keeps himself amus ed
jokes about getting into the wrong car with the wrong wife
berlin isnt laughing cmon you drunken fuck
get outta here
a slide door rolls open and berlin peers in
full of furniture and cardboard crates stenciled trinity institute craft dept
worth the try but forget it
this bastard obviously has legit imate business at the institute
takes a last poke around with the light
spots something red
a cigarette butt caked in lip stick
but whats this white stuff
some kind of powder spills from a capsule crushed in the door rails
he picks it up for a look and gets a bad one from behind
whatta you doing mister
berlin finds himself facing an irate looking woman in her s
a lot of red hair and freckles
but definitely more frightened than angry
his police department badge is an instant sedative
gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here
she should keep her doors locked
she smiles and thought they were
got your drivers license
she hands it across and he inspects it coz thats what cops do
i noticed you coming outta the institute
you up there a lot
oh it was you that nearly ran into me
no it was you that nearly ran into me
you up there a lot
i guess more than usual this time of the year
my mother i run an arts crafts center we buy a lot from the institutes
wheres your store amanda
hands the license back and is already heading for his mercedes
next pit stop you make sure your doors are locked
if theres moonlight thats the only light
nothing to see but a pair of large taps
nothing to hear but a bath filling
then something starts bleeping
its a liquid level indicator activ ated by rising water
a hand searches for taps
shuts them off and silences the indicator
the frame expands to reveal helena
she moves to a hand basin
finds a brush and fixes hair
finds a clip and pins it up
close as she kicks off shoes
pantyhose descend on top of them
walks into the living room unbuttoning her shirt
vanishes into the bedroom and the camera waits
ret urns with towels and the camera follows back into the bathroom
a creaking hinge as she closes the door
a dressing gown hangs on a hook
she reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in to the sonovabitch
dressed in black and stealthy as a cat
he retreats a pace deeper into the darkness
just enough light to see he wears glasses
and just enough light to see her undress
helena unzips her skirt
slides it down her lags
drapes it on a chair
removes her shirt and hangs it on the back
she wears a white brassiere and panties
and no apologies for repetition
this is a fantastic body
she checks water temperature
either too hot or too cold
either way a tap goes on
now she reaches behind her back
unclips her bra
gets hit with dazzling light
the intruder is taking photographs
and if this is his turn on hes in paradise
she stands in front of him in total oblivion
her panties join clothes on the chair
nov shes naked and now another picture
again the bathroom detonates with white light
his face is concealed by the camera
but this bastard is about to run out of luck
moves in as she silences the tap
suddenly a lot of silence about
helena twists in panic
she just heard something
didnt she just hear something
is somebody in here
fear kills her scream
she hits at the darkness
but hes gone
big close on telephone ringing
no one home except the machine and camera
the former answers on behalf of berlin john its me
please call me
i left two messages at the police stat ion
they said you werent there
please please call me
the camera moves on
breakfast remains on the table
newspaper still in its wraps
out the window a bonfire rages in the yard
berlin clears rubbish from the garage
grime and sweat and the efforts got him breathless
heaves another armful on the fire
the phone starts ringing again
this time he decides to answer
berlin in a hurry to get there
footsteps tell the story
fast up a corridor and through a door
faces look as he crosses the department
secretaries and bisley and ross
but only one face of interest
taylor turns halfway through lighting a cigarette
are you outta your fucken mind
taylor says nothing
if any thing happens to that girl im gonna break your fucking back
just easy on the words youre putting in my face sergeant
whass going on here
a question practically every expression in the place is asking
his blind friend got attacked
angelo went up there and some how it got itself in the paper
you put it in there
i may have said some thing
i dont recall
dont lie taylor
i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment you gave him the whole damned case
alright i gave him the case
so the case is closed so what
his indifference inflames berlin
smashes the newspaper at him
so read it
you just hung a target around her neck
dont you know nothing about this guy
he reads the newspapers
col lects the cuttings
when are they gonna find her
now hes reading helena robertsons name phrased like shes a fucking witness
you couldnt have done anything more stupid if youd sat down tried
hey cmon country boys lets all line up and hear the expert
just walk away from me taylor
now the volume is going up
now the whole department is silent
you think youre the only guy ever worked a homicide
i was a big city cop too
and i bust ed the clock on fucken jennifer
i know more about this man than youll over know and thats how i know it aint him you re investigating a soap opera
we stop this now
he tells her bye bye and she gets attacked
well give me a fucking break
there is no ser ial killer
stick her name up in neon theres still no serial kil ler
and i aint the only one say ing it
everyone in this building is saying it
and i mean everyone
everyone means ross
berlin looks at him
and his gaze hurts
shut up king jay
no cmon freddy lets have this out over
you know what everyone thinks
they think youre making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass
and no ones blaming you for it i hear shes worth the flowers
but dont come in here get ting holy over us
sure i put it in the paper
coz i wanted to stop this bullshit
i dont want you drunk out ta your head searching my office ag ain
its pissing me everyone off
you dont know what you done taylor
if your friend from san diego was up here and thought for one out of two fucken seconds she was a danger to him heda taken her out weeks ago
his cigarette is already stubbed and hes already walking away
why dont you get yourself a dict ionary
look up the word witness
i know what a witness is
well her it aint
that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat
a big mistake mister taylor
mister berlin suddenly turns into harrison ford
taylor slams into filing cabinets right next to the christmas tree
gets berlins forearm under his throat and fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut
both men are heaving
no volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence
im gonna do something you never did taylor
im gonna catch this bastard
and when i do hes gon na find out just how good a wit ness she is
meanwhile you be aware of me coz i wish you ill
berlin moves away and the silence is brutal
nothing happening but bad vibes
ross and berlin exchange glances and this shit is really bad
berlin vanishes into his lab and the door slams
berlin and his dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his rage are all alone
and thats how they wanna be
but the door opens and here is ross
have to be a friend to survive in here
nothing you gotta say do i wanna hear right now
so save yourself saying it
im not in here to apologize john
i told you what was gonna happen its happened
good bye princess the same night she gets attacked
thats a tough one to swallow bro
im already familiar with taylors opinion
you dont really believe this
one hundred fucking per cent
and you know why
coz i never told her good bye
is that good enough for the committee
and as long as you like evaporates before ross can speak again
i didnt know that
you didnt know that
berlin is drinking whisky
sticks another slug in the cup
now realizes whose bottle this is
slams it somewhere on the bench
you left your booze in here
who dyou think it was
ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldnt give an idiot
you think it was him
thats a very stupid question ross
im asking it
how the hell do i know who
some jerk off
some peeping tom prick
his hand has found the switch blade
a nasty click as it opens
but definitely not him
this guys in the trade
hes not gon na stand there looking at her ass if hes in the room shes dead
berlin puts the knife in his dummy
if shes alive
ease off john
im sick of this toy town shit
everything you say sounds reason able
but theres also a reason able explanation for the opposite
dont give me that
not another word
when you had the fat lady in there and i asked you if she was lying you looked me right in the eyes and said yes
so as far as i was concerned shes ly ing
and if the king of fucking england had walked in told me different i wouldnt have bel ieved him because you told me
this atmosphere would stretch any friendship to breaking point
and now im telling you
im looking you right in the eyes and telling ya theres a bad man out there and i dont know if hes in the next room or the next state
and i dont know what his trigger is
but if he reads her name in the newspaper i believe hell be inclined to do something ab out it
ive got a bad feeling
and i been doing this too long to be wrong
there are tough eyes to look into
and ross finally looks away
i dunno what i can do to help you
i dunno what id do with your help
ive gotta take her out of there
what about citrine
he can fire me
wide over the countryside
the car is a long way off
a pretty magic looking dawn
cows on hills and mist in the hollows
the mercedes finally arrives
up the track and into the refurbish ed garage
engine off and little but a sound of singing birds
helena sits on the sofa
shes a lousy liar and having a tough time with the phone
my aunt called twice
well soon i hope so
right now im scared to be there
just a second
just a second
goodridge wants the number
she seeks decision from berlin who doesnt want him to have it
helena phone mr goodridge
i cant find it
theres no one here to read it right now
well yes i know
of course i will
ill get it and call you tomorrow
and thats it except for goodbyes
he takes the phone and re places it
her expression is a toss up between guilt anxiety
i feel really bad about it coz they invited me for christmas
has he got your aunts address
i dont think so
he said the police had been calling
want ed to ask me some more questions
she doesnt know probably angelo
ill take care of it
dont worry we re gonna find this guy and everythingll be o
only thing he fails to mention is which guy hes talking about
anyway the subject is already changed
he notices tapes in her bag
would you like me to put your music on
no she doesnt want music
hes gonna light the fire and make them lunch
berlin is splitting logs and helena is sitting an a step watch ing him
shes looking almost happy with only worry in the way
youre looking worried again helena
no im not
youre looking more worried now than when you decided to stop worrying
alright im worried about christmas
i wish i hadnt told him id be back
a log tangents off
berlin retrieves it
tosses it in a barrow
hell get over it
ill roast us a chicken o
with cand les around it
how about that
a distant owl hoots
she knows hes smiling
shes smiling too
wouldnt it be better if i cook it
you said you can only boil
the music is puccini
part one act two the humming chorus from madam butterfly
giant close of the spinning cassette
the cam era remains close as it explores the room
candle light fire light
along a mantlepiece
eleven thirty five on a clock
two christmas cards
several photographs from the happy years
one a picture of ross berlin in uniform
another features berlin with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair
for a moment it could be helena
but the cameras already gone
helena cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa
looks considerab ly more relaxed
but theres a tension here and both are aware of it
she stares at him and berlin stares back
a billion people in love have been through this
its bed time
a suggestion of berlins bed to be is heaped in pillows blank ets at the end of the couch
come on ill take you up there
she finds his hand and stands
the music follows them upstairs
moonlight through the windows
they are silhouettes
they want to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst place to be
no sound except the music
and whats anyone supp osed to say
this atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more
christ hear this music
a sweet pulse of puccini
big close of lips meeting in moonlight
now in each others arms
and then theyre kissing
and nothing else is happening in the whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring
somebody has got to give in
the phone finally gets answered
the voice at the end isnt expect ed
but berlin sounds pleased to hear it
it seems one problem got solved
i gotta tell you margie
you are mrs santa claus
is ross throwing a party or opening a bar
crates of booze and stack upon stack of beer
a bit of where do you want it
act ing from berlin as he staggers in with a delivery of bud
ross makes room on a table
rips a beer out the plastic and pops it
cant thank you enough ross
dont thank me
swallowing beer ross exits the back door with berlin following
its her invitation
and as far as citrine in concerned better we keep it like that
the wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload ber lin heads for his mercedes with ross calling after him
pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across
theres an old desperado in one of the cells
why dont you give him this and tell him happy christmas from me
the girls prepare for festivity
they got a full length mirror
a wardrobe of dresses
a menu of shoes what they do with them in this scene is their affair
right now margies holding some blue number in front of helena
its blue silk
you like blue
not you blue
this isnt you
she slings the dress on the bed
it joins a pile of rehearsals
moves deeper into her dresses and helena appears in the mirror
when did john divorce
two or three years ago
what was she like
she was a semi professional model
but a policemans wife she wasnt
so one day she just packed it and left
and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet
what does that mean
you know he crashed
he just couldnt come to terms with it
john hates to lose and he hated losing her
every spare minute hes driving down to san diego having a terrible time with her getting drunk and driving back
you just dont believe the amount he drank
she pirouettes with black sequins
what do you think of black
evidently not much and margie is getting short of alternatives
wait a minute i just had the most brilliant idea
you think he still loves her
think he still thinks about her
but not like then
then was an obsession
she emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes
if these fit we got the perfect dress
i havent worn heels since i was
i dont think i could walk in these
sure you can
anyway parties are all about standing still
helena is excited to try them out
the experiment is a success
ill go get the dress
its kinda sultry
i only wore it once coz in reality i cant get away with it
you think john would like it
i think john would love it
the ross residence looks like an ad for j b
warm yellow light from the windows
holly wreath on the front door
the mercedes pulls up and berlin gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger
a hard wind around the house
he walks inside without knocking
the den looks like a little museum
walls decorated with civil war memorabilia
one wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns
ross looks like roy rogers trying to look like fred astaire
a powder blue evening suit
ho dumps ice in a barrel full of bud wieser and berlin produces a couple of presents
this is from helena
and this is from me
the first obviously a music tape
ross holds it to his ear
sounds like frank sinatra
and the second a bottle of ross tears the wrappings off chivas regal
lets do one of these right now then well hide the sonovabitch
but hes already lost berlins attention
margie walks in with helena
jesus what have you done to her
bright red lipstick jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins
sexy it is but her it isnt
she looks like one of those big tit dopes from tennessee
she also looks like million dollars
christ that smile works with paint
an appraisal comes from ross wow
the whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored lights and laughter
buddy holly supplies the music true love ways and ross is a victim of the nostalgia
dances close with margie
among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are helena berlin
eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other
but someone is staring at them
about forty years old with big hands
too old for acne but the skin is bad
got a scar on his cheek like a ladder in a stocking
he continues to stare until the dancers separate
music ends and hes already in the crowd
berlin arrives with a whisper for margie and next thing helena is on her arm heading for the stairs
obviously a ladies room run
everly brothers next record up and serato appears through the crush
spots ross who wants to know what happened to you
duty sergeant fucked up
can you believe it im on tonight
how long have you got
one big drink
and they head for it
did you get my message
i left a message on your machine
it wasnt me calling
this last question to ross who delivers a typically large shot
i guess shes in the kit chen
we got a so called prof essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey
are you sure you didnt call
i spoke to old whass his name a couple of times
but not to her and i never asked for her
someones calling the institute to talk to helena
says he wants to ask her some more questions
and he pushes off to see his wife
berlin looks around worried
you got a quiet phone somewhere
hey john dont start getting antsy over this tonight
it may well have been the local cops
thats just what i wanna find out
margie fixes helenas lips
big on the lipstick
another layer of magenta is going on are you sure i look o
her question interrupts the revlon youre the prettiest girl here by about two hundred per cent
margie moves in again for the lower lip
how you doing on those shoes
dont mix very well with beer
perhaps she is a tiny bit tipsy
margie smiles and says press
girl like you should be drinking chill white wine
a knock on the door
come in and bobby sticks his head inside
that woman in the kitchen says if she doesnt get help within seconds shes gonna resign
that woman is a disaster
she turns to the mirror in exasperation and mends her own face
alright tell her im coming
no wait a minute honey
take helena for me and find john
and dont let go of her hand until you do
a pause in the music amplifies conversation
bullshit and beer and everyone talking about nothing
bobby leads helena through the row
cant find berlin and now theyre in the den
the ser ious guzzlers have made it base
everyone talking and everyone lying but no berlin and bobby is about to make a major mistake
ill just go see if hes in the kitchen
you stay right here
her protest is absorbed in sound
and anyway hes already gone
at once she is vulnerable
doesnt know if shes staring at the back of a head or straight into someones face
didnt we meet somewhere
the question comes from the man with the scar
hes drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist
hey fat guy
im about to ask this lady for a dance
trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no
if i told you id driven all the way from oakland would you dance with me
willy nelson starts to sing
and helena attempts to break away
whats so special about the other guy
you like cops dont you
im a cop
helena finds the top of a couch
holds it like a raft of secur ity
but where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following
let me ask you a question
how do you know the difference between one guy and another
maybe you dont
maybe you only know the difference when youre dancing
he laughs if you knew what i looked like youd dance with me
i look like john wayne
i know what you look like
she navigates the back of the sofa
collides with somebody and apologizes
is anyone sitting there
enough ambiv alence in the question for the guy not to know shes blind
no one sitting there
simultaneously a pair of middle age crew cuts occupy the sofa
a second later helena sits bang into one of the laps
spilt drinks and surprise all round
pleasant sur prise for the victim
hes a lecherous looking old bastard and helenas dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie
happy christmas max
i normally get socks
every humiliation there is
however helena gets out of this is however she achieves it
but by the time she does shes crying
a calm spot between kitchen stairs
in the background guests raid the kitchen for food
berlin looks like he should be smok ing a cigarette
at last margie comes downstairs with the news
she wants to go back to the institute
ross already arrived
berlin looks desolate
she cant go back
you better go talk to her
ross watches him walk upstairs
his eyes an assessment of this absurd relationship
all sorts of people fall in love darlin
aint it a shame
a wedge of light as berlin walks in
then moonlight again
hel ena sits at the edge of a single bed
hair a wreck and mascara streaks down her face
he sits identifying himself with an emb race
clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears were
it was an accident
everyone has accidents
whatever he said would be the wrong thing to say
because he doesnt un derstand
and her only explanation of this misery is new tears
i cant walk in these shoes
gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos you dont have to dress like this for me
and suddenly the mood is different
he is amongst her tears
kissing her mouth
already undressing her
her dress glides up
he unclips them
she feels his hands drift down her legs
hears the zip opening her dress
she returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere
he kisses her breasts and by now the cameras too close to see
helena asleep in berlins arms
just the worry of the wind
he kisses her and slips out of bed and everything slams into mass berlin is fully dressed
geared up for work
black leather glo ves and black leather jacket
shoves the beretta into his belt
from somewhere a very soft sound of christmas carols drifts in
this is deep past midnight the house is quiet and gone to bed
fallout from the party everywhere
still that distant sound of carols
berlin dumps his bag and walks into the den
just dark ness and the forgotten tape machine
flips on a lamp and tries to open the gun cabinet
still trying when startled by a voice
you cant get in there
thats comanche proof
berlin swings round in surprise
ross is half asleep on a sofa
what are you doin
i spose im drinking myself to sleep
its helenas christmas songs
theyre really pretty
holy night and about two inches of chivas left
have you got any glasers
ross does twenty fives
berlin sticks a foot on a table
walther automatic from an ankle holster
ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs
what exactly you doing john
im going up to the institute
this cop thats calling thinks she gonna be there over christmas
ross unlocks a cabinet and berlin is about to load the glasers
i checked with the locals and our station no ones called
whoever it is isnt the police
i think this bastards getting worried ab out something
and i think the res just a chance hell turn up
well lets hope he does
ross selects a gauge winchester and rams the mechanism open
and if he does im gonna drop a bomb on the fukker
listen you dont havta come
ross is stuffing solid lead car killers into the pump action
watch my lips
im your partner
this is probably a crane shot
a gale works up the valley
the institute is in total darkness
not a vehicle out front
not a sound except the marauding wind
rosss chevrolet is concealed amongst trees
been here long enough to allow slow flurries to accumulate
it stares towards the building maybe yards away
berlin wears a black wool hat
ross a big black overcoat
both got shit frozen out of them
a bottle available and anyone who wants a slug better help himself
plus sleet on the windshield and a lot of stale time
berlin asks what time it is
and ross takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by
wheres your watch
i guess by the bed
its twenty of three
yawns do a circuit
ross flops in his seat and the angle chang es
the view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads
a little young for you bro
gets his eyes you think if she could see shed be hanging around with an old dog like you
you got a stomach growing around to meet itself behind your back
im in my prime
what dyou mean bits
a star light on the windshield
distant and nobody seen it yet
policemens bodies age at diff erent rates
look at me
gut in its fifties
balls in their six ties
and feet in their eighties
hit those wipers ross
urgency snaps him into close up
big noise as wipers clear the screen
i thought i saw a light
berlin stares at the instit ute through small binoculars
flashlight went right ac ross those windows
instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps in
hes fucken in there
and suddenly everything including super sinister music is happening at once
pines singing as the gale tears into them
clutching his winch ester ross opens the trunk
a dim light and a fluster of equip ment
berlin sorts out a pair of radios
selects a channel and ross whispers what are you on
here come huge cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue
what if we need a back up
were not here
i dont want the desk to hear us
its channel and copy
and theyre already on their way
the storm bullies its way around the building
lights approach quickly
but one of them is already fading
it belongs to ross
this fuckers got about minutes in it
and whatever the plan was it just got changed
berlin looks around in apprehension going in there alone aint no joy his flashlight ascends the fire escape
and there it is floors up
a half opened window
ill start at the top and work down
you aint going in alone
thats a liability ross
i dont want you hanging on to my shirt
anyone but me comes down these stairs take em out but try and keep him alive
i want this bastard living
takes off up the stairs
ross watches him vanish
waiting out here aint so tasty either
the wind rages in nearby trees
a door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away
im going in
big on ross and the radio
you take care bro
berlin climbs through the window
drops down and waits to orien tate himself
hes on a small landing midway between flights of stairs
different kinds of noises in here
one hundred per cent more sinister
you hearing me
im going upstairs
snaps the safety catch on his beretta
and it sounds ominous
every shadow in this place is animated with foreboding
looking down the stairwell
the light comes up
berlin arrives on another floor
hard to sweat in here but hes doing it
his progress is distinctly cautious
a harsh wind rockets down the stairs flapping a pair of owing doors
berlin eases through in to the corridor
at its far end is the elevator
he travels to wards it in an eerie piston of light
ross has moved into the shelter of a wall
sleet passes almost horizontally
his flashlight is over
the color of a tangerine
im on helenas floor
im just gonna take a look at her apartment
fucken flashlights kaput
shit whats happen ing brother
i can hear some thing
berlin stares up at the coiling i can hear footsteps
right up above
they disappear into the gale
doors beat at the end of the corridor
he moves towards them and pushes out onto the stairway
nothing but the wind
hes about to climb when an al arming voice shocks him rigid
you are now on the third floor
berlin is already running
light swinging wildly as he sprints back up the corridor
fifteen yards to elevator stairs
breath less as hell he hits the radio
fuckers in the elevator
al most jumps stairs in haste
bursts out onto the rd floor
ham mer back on the beretta
just in time to see the doors closing
get ready ross
he maybe coming down
but he isnt
hes go ing up
by the time hes recovered breath the voice is back in business
whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor
totally breathless now
eyes ascend faster than feet
whine of a swinging door
berlin rounds the stairwell
the doors still busy
top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in
as he heads for that door
three steps to go
two steps more
reaches for it
the door smashes into him like it hates him
so fast it hardly happened
he staggers back
his flashlight clatters downstairs
banisters capsize as the light passes
every shadow goes crazy
the flashlight arrives at a lower level
rolls away and stops
wastes power into a corner
cant see berlin and cant see his radio
but ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet
are you al right
come in john
ross savaged by the gale
in considerable anxiety
less than a volt in his batteries
his failure to contact berlin accelerat es his concern by the moment
calls repeatedly you hearing me
big close on the radio
fingers switch channels
tries calling on five six
still nothing and goes to channel eight
come in john
alright fuck it
light or no light
hes going up there
still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape
you hear me
just be care ful now coz im coming up stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs
hardly got a foot on the first before a figure rushes down
dressed in black and very breathless
a powerful flashlight floods on dazzling ross
is that you john
or i blow this fucken staircase to pieces
thank jesus the anxietys over
the gauge drops to his side
what the hells going on up there brother
i been calling minutes
the light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face
hey cmon john
talk to me
just the sound of breathlessness
what are you doing
it glints at the peripheries of his vision and ross is alarmed
what the fuck are you doing
its me holy shit
john john not you dont shoot you crazy bastard
two deathly flashes in quick succession
the first practically taken rosss hand off
the second slams into his guts and hes down
the glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet
the myopic janitor looks down
five floors below a man lays on his back
his shotgun discharges uselessly into trees
another man leans over him
illuminates his agonized face with a flash light
shoots him again point blank in the upper body
the myo pic isnt staying for more
hurries back along the fire escape
wind breaks on the roof like waves
an utterly dismal room lit by a starving light bulb
the myopic arrives from the fire esc ape
huge eyes behind those orb like glasses
picks up a phone and dials
piles and piles of old newspapers
hundreds of fuck magazines
in the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera
on the wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls
plus a special enlargement of helena standing naked in her bathroom
gimme the police
close on a bulb in a flashlight
the merest glimmer of energy
barely the light to see the blood
it seeps into a long frozen footprint in the ice
fills it fast and expands over the sides
somebody say this cant be happening
berlin crumples to knees in the snow
dumps his light gasping for breath
oblique light creating desperate silhouettes
berlin howls like a dog
howls into his radio
nine nine nine
blood all over his hands
this is a nine nine nine officer down
ross is heaving like an old bull elephant
on the verge of unconsciousness
he tries to speak
got hit in the throat
berlin fights off tears
dont talk old man
repeats the emergency code but this time he cant be heard
almost imperceptibly a carol filters in in the bleak mid winter and the camera moves slowly away
berlin cradles rosss tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind
this beautiful christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these cuts
and there will be no other sound until the sequence ends
a blue emergency light
revolving in slow motion
like a dream
the city streets are a blur
the light accelerates into sudden reality
ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital
close up of margie kissing her husbands lips for the last time
tears spill down his cheeks from her eyes
freddy ross is dead
outside in the corridor
looking in at berlin
he sits head in hands on a bench
this is somebodys point of view
the camera travels up the windows
waits at a distance as citrine arrives
pajamas under his clothes
he walks with assistance of a stick
neither say anything because both know what this is about
ber lin stands and hands over his badge
exits the mag and now his beretta
a brief word from citrine and he turns and walks away
a little house in winter meadows
kind of pretty now its pain ted
just the first tint of pink on its roof
the carol dissol ves into birdsong
here comes the sun for a fine christmas day
all new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times
a barbecue still in polythene wraps
price tag and unconnected gas pipe shift gently in the breeze
a brand now swinging seat
berlin sits in it with shock wearing on
expressionless of sor row
though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there is
sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red
silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life
lights glow on the christmas tree
unopened presents still und erneath
serato sits smoking in silence
listens to a sound of plates getting stacked in another room
he looks up but not in surprise
he just wasnt aware berlin had arrived in the house
stunned and stubbled and full of grief
and thats just serato
taken bobby to her sisters
this atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud
they were going there anyway
does he know
serato shakes his head
loses his cigarette
and sammy appears
thinks his dads in hospital
sammy serato is and pretty
she continues collecting plates
whyd you go up there john
knows hes not going to get a reply and doesnt bother to wait for it
helena materializes from the den like a shadow
sallow for want of sleep and glad to have berlins hand to hang on to
i want you to go to your aunts
a suggestion that surprises helena
and clearly doesnt appeal
why cant i stay with you
its not possible right now
please dont ask no quest ions now
not right now
if silence can intensify its now
sound of the front door and then footsteps
berlin freezes as margie appears
wracked with grief
dead sickness of tears
like she cried bones out of her face
but no weeping now
is that margie
im here honey
im right here
the strongest face in the house
and now helena is in her arms
dont cry darlin
he was a big old cop and he didnt like tears
dead echos of plates in the kitchen
and song of birds outside
feels like every second in my life was just the moment leading to this
raises her hand to silence him and this is silence margie owns
christ this is just awful
helena crying and berlin on the way
whats gonna happen now john
she has an aunt in vermont
ill take her there tonight
im going back to the institute
helena can stay here if shed like to
id like her to
ill look after her
and she can look after me
im tired now
i must sleep
footsteps again as she walks out and silence again like before
the camera will slowly crane down on berlin
fully dressed but wiped out he lays an the bad
last thing he needs is booze
he is clearly full of it
drifting in and out of consciousness
a nightmare either side of the line
he relives that night again
and ross is alive again as guilt and regret demand to be heard
you want me to make a predict ion
this guy aint turning up
what time is it
twenty six minutes past two
you shouldnt have come ross
you take your time
i just wanna be back in time for bobbys presents
a memory that is too terrible to bear
berlin gets up and sits at the edge of the bad
head in hands
wants the pain to go aw ay
but anguish is stronger than alcohol
hears noises outside and makes it to a window
tears curtains back revealing lights
his mercedes hangs in space as though staring into the bedroom
the mercedes descends onto a low loader courtesy of a car lift ing truck
berlin out of his door
almost too ruined to apprec iate whats happening
crane lights and flashlights and chains getting tightened
couple of strangers and a kid he recognizes
what are you doing travis
i been told to take your car in sir
i dunno sir
brought you up a chevy
flashes his light at a standard issue brown police chevrolet
im sorry sergeant
i did knock a couple times
didnt get any reply
you got a warrant for this
who sought the warrant
the man from the f
the man from the f
black suit and wing tips
investigators are either lawyers or accountants
and this fellow looks like both
when he smiles its a decaffeinated ex ercise
bothers nothing but lips
this smiles always the same
i want a hour protection of margies house
otherwise im not saying nothing
you give me that or read me my rights and talk to a lawyer
berlin looks awful
showered and shaved but just fucking awful
citrine slips focus to the man
and st anne imperceptibly nods
alright you got it
and ill be putting an observer in with you
i want serato
negative why cant i have serato
coz im short of men ang elo wont do it
who ever i got free first you get
close on a pair of dancing needles
they react to voice levels on a twin spool tape recorder
but no sound of yakking in here
st annes assistant sucks a pencil
busy with a cross word puz zle
fills in a word but the camera isnt interested
it moves away to discover head phones
and moves closer to hear st anne
always figured id like to retire to a little town like this maybe buy a boat even do some fishing
a change of chairs
a wood chair for the subject
mobile chair for the man
castors give him considerable freedom
enable him to back off or move in with the intimacy of an ophthalmologist
st anne you fish john
i have done
a side table features several pin sharp pencils
a sony pocket recorder
two packets of pall mall reds
two yellow legal pads
the chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file
st anne alright lets not beat about the bush what ever that may mean and get down on it
you were specific ally instructed by your chief not to go anywhere near the blind inst itute
so why did you go up there
because of a feeling
i had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up
st anne which man is that
the man i detail in my report sir
the report thats in his hands
st anne knows well which man
is this an interview or an interrogation
st anne its an enquiry
im not prepared to be interrog ated
ill be interviewed as an officer who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator
st anne well thats fine by me john
and im sure thats fine by your chief
he smiles the non smile
tosses his pencil down
and sits back
so you thought your man might show
st anne bit of a long shot wasnt it
it was the only shot i had
st anne so the one night you decide to go up there he goes up there
except id decid ed to go up there every night
st anne despite the wishes of your chief
st anne you were prepared to fal sify your reports to him
i had very good reasons for do
st anne just a second john
i knew there was something missing
st anne cuts him off to pick up the phone
obviously something vital is needed
could you bring an an ashtray in here
got a coupla guys who smoke in here
and attention back to the file
you dont mind if i jump around a little this morning do you
just while im easing my way into this
youre asking the questions sir
st anne you had an argument with ross
ass aulted one of the officers right
i wouldnt use the word assault
st anne you got a racy temper sergeant
st anne just something they did on this occasion made you lose your rag
taylor put a piece in the newspaper which in my op inion put my witness in jeopardy
st anne from whom
from the man i detail in my rep ort
a crazy man who to my cert ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls
six in san diego one someplace else and one up here
st anne not a lotta support for that scenario though is there
not a lot
st anne not even from ross
st anne is that why you lost your temper with him
no one believing you
his assistant brings the ashtray
and st anne smiles gratitude
so what can you tell me about you man
what do you mean sir
st anne i mean who is he
i dont know who he is
whos jack the ripper
hes jack the ripper with an automobile
st anne you didnt run a profile
i didnt have the res ources and it isnt my expertise
st anne this crazy man
what makes you think he wants to eliminate miss robertson
you read my report sir
st anne im asking a question
because he reads im investigating the disappearance of her friend miss robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety
how good of a witness is she
hes crazy but not stupid hes intelligent
got a flexible m
and he doesnt wanna get caught
st anne just like jack the ripper
this is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both
alright well have plenty of time to discuss your mystery man and his flexibility later right now id like to talk about the event
citrine rests on his cane staring through the one way glass
a menu of anxieties
but perhaps sadness is his principal expres sion
his eyes slide to the assistant can you turn that thing on
glad to oblige and voices cut in
this is citrines p
st anne berlin alright the door comes back and hits you
knocks you down
knocks you out
for how long
i dont know approximately you figure
then what happened
immediately you get up
i realized the flashlight was at the bottom of the stairs st anne did you check your weapon
it would have been instinctive
all i know was i was in possession of it
st anne you didnt check it
not that i specifically remember
st anne why not
i dont know
i wasnt think ing about it
i was dazed
st anne you were woozy
i was unconscious seconds ago
st anne i understand
then i picked up the flashlight tried to get ross on the radio
i got blood on my hand realized my eye was cut
st anne could you see out of it
yeah i could see
then i ran
climbed out of the window ran down the fire escape and right at the bottom i found ross
st anne were you breathless
sure i was breathless
st anne when did you realize you were no longer in possession of the
not until i was in the hospital
st anne you figure you lost it in the hospital
or on the way there
no i thought it must have fallen down the stairwell
st anne berlin like the flashlight
yeah had you been drinking that night
it was christmas eve
st anne that wasnt my question
st anne berlin how about ross
sure were you drinking in the car
there was a bottle in the car
i think ross had a mouthful
st anne but not you
i may have had a nip
st anne to keep out the cold
very cold that night very windy wasnt it
st anne motors off refers to notes without looking at berlin
which hand was the flashlight in
my left hand
st anne and the walther was in your right
the beretta was in my right hand
st anne you said you didnt check it
so how dyou know which gun youre holding
the chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass
you said you figured it had fallen down the stairs with the flashlight
you said you were confused
you pick up the flashlight in confusion how dyou know you didnt pick up the
lets not start playing games mr st anne
st anne games
i told you id lost the walther
st anne you told me you didnt know youd lost it until you were in the hos pital
so if you didnt know till then it coulda been either weapon
the gun in my hand was a beretta
and for the record i want that note corrected
now please sir
the dead smile and rubber in action
st anne changes his notes
st anne o
im sorry i made a mistake
with respect sir you didnt make a mistake
i know who you are and youre far too experienced for mis takes
now if you have doubts over the content or veracity of my rep ort i wanna be made aware of them
st anne sure
i wanna be made aware of them now
st anne do you want a lawyer sergeant
there you go again
do i want a lawyer sergeant
its a game question
what do i want a law yer for
i got nothing to hide
st anne you dont
you know i dont
so lets quit the bullshit and get down to it
whats your angle mr st anne
for the first time st anne moves his chair into berlins space
st anne wheres the little gun sergeant
ive no idea
st anne you dont
if it isnt in the institute the man who shot ross took it
st anne the man who shot ross used it
implications are ganging up quicker than berlin can focus them
and you dont know where that little twenty five calibre walthers gone
berlin confirms it
looking very concerned
the wheels retreat
st anne shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches
sergeant here it is
i intend to produce evidence that will prove you shot frederick ross with malice afore thought
my angle therefore is to pre pare a case on behalf of your chief to prosecute you for first degree murder
the lights on the christmas tree are off
that just about sums it up
the words out and it talks in barren silence as berlin appears
taylor and serato in conference at a desk
the former looks
the latter turns away
berlin walks the room into close up
like some coffee john
seems like ann is the only benev olent face around
she gets a lost smile bewildered shake of his head
disappears into his room and quietly closes the door
a picture of ross fills the frame
snapped the day they search ed the dump
blasted with rain
a waterproof cape and a finger raised in defiance
berlin shifts eyes from the bulletin board
pours a last inch of whisky and drinks
eyes back to the board for a last photographic panoramic record of his time in eureka
the photo of ross again before his eyes sweep quickly on
pict ure of amber stone
thumb tacks and maps and tape
information relating to specific areas in san diego
carlsbad ocean beach point loma
jennifer seven jennifer eight
but who gives a fuck anymore
two dead dogs on a refuse dump
and now the dead face of a dummy
berlin stares till someone knocks on the door
st anne comes in smoking a cigarette and eating a ham sandwich
st anne you go home john get some sleep
i dont wanna talk any more today
arent you gonna arrest me
st anne you know better than that
he will exit when he stops speaking
before he does he wanders the lab showing particular interest in the dummy of jennifer
i arrest you youll get bail and be walking outta here anyway and ill have no one to talk to your chief said hed make you available to me
if you go to the store call in and let your duty officer know
bobby is in hysterics
a gale of tears
fits his words between them
his mom does her best to cope with his grief and her own
your daddy would have wanted you to be strong
we gotta be strong for daddy darling
i dont want her in this house
i want my dad
why did she have to come here
i want my daddy
fingers search out and identify phone numbers
dial for inform ation and helena whispers i need the number for a cab please
the cameras getting closer and so is st anne
and today there is a definite change of mood
still very measured
still a pro fessional demeanor
but a bad sense of shit about to come down
st anne there was a gale that night
all the doors are swinging
so this door swings back and clips you
and down you go
within seconds of uncon sciousness youre back on the fire es cape and youre confused really con fused
you dont know if tuesdays come in twos or happen once a week
bit of a cold coming on and near enough for berlin to catch it
you see a figure coming up the stairs
ross aint meant to be on the stairs
he challenges you
and this aint a piece of wood with a nail through it
this guys got a gauge winchester up your nose
and hes drunk
and youre dizzy
and your eyes fulla blood
you aint thinking good and youre seeing worse
it just went off
you just put him down
and you get hit by a glaser you stay down
but he aint dead
now you realize you shot your partner
oh suzanna how do i get outta this
the serial killer shot him
and here comes the malice john
seconds later you put another one in his throat
isnt that what happened
st anne tell us what happened then
i already told you what happened
youre looking for an inconsisten cy and youre not gonna find one because im telling you the truth
st anne tell me the truth again
a yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of the house
helena gets out and pays
no she doesnt need assis tance
picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle
back door opens and helena walks in
first thing she senses is cold
this place smells like it hasnt been lived in since she was last here
and last time she was here she was happy
dumps her case and heads for the living room
cant see it but feels the overwhelming gloom
finds a couch and now she sits to wait
the silence is almost total
but something disturbs it
helena looks around
back on her feet she tries to discover source of the sound
finally arrives at a table lamp
she feels the bulb and its hot
a large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade
reaches in and turns it off the house is in virtual darkness
st anne lights a cigarette
attention with his notes
sniffing a fair bit
hes acquired a toilet roll to deal with it
occas ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose
glances at berlin you want a cigarette
no he doesnt ive given up
st anne you have
how about the booze
how does st anne know
perhaps he doesnt
sounds like he does
too much booze can be very dangerous
memory black outs
stuff like that
his attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe
the man takes a drink then the drink takes a drink then the drink takes the man
something like that isnt it
why did you give up
i guess i was drinking too much
st anne i was talking about cigarettes
score outta find yourself getting breathless
st anne specially if youre running
which floor did the elevator run up to
st anne you ran up to the fifth
you must have been real breathless by then
berlin doesnt know where this is going but he doesnt like it
eyes to berlin now and his smile looks real for the first time
were gonna get our observer in here this afternoon
keep an eye on us
he smiles notorious for withholding information the f
st anne makes a note
junks the pencil
sits back in his chair
were you aware there was a janit or in the institute that night
st anne you didnt check
there wasnt time
st anne that wasnt my question
no sir i didnt check
st anne breaks off to blow his nose
berlin looks very worried
st anne im really catching cold up here
must be all this fog
whats the relevance of the janitor
st anne the janitor
let me just ask you a question before i forget do you take any medication for that
st anne breathlessness
st anne alright let me answer your question
whats the relevance of the janitor
hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer
why dont i take you through it from where im sitting
at some time bet ween a
the janitor thought he heard a vehicle approaching through the woods
he looks out and sees noth ing no lights nothing
figures it must be hunters
some time later he thought he heard something else like a door or a window slam
he gets up and between half past two and a quarter of three he makes a search with a flashlight of the top floors
finds nothing untoward goes back to his apartment in the roof
berlin looks grey as sick
knows whats coming
and here it is
the flashlight you saw was his
the footsteps you heard were his
the elevator you were chasing up and down after was empty and is prone to such activity due to an electrical fault
apparently it happens frequently dur ing gales
the gale that was swinging the door
that knocked you down
that confused you so much
and here we are back to where im sitting
you wanna tell me what really went on that night
it seems st anne has effectively destroyed the serial killer scenario
stubs his cigarette and waits for berlins response
two people know i didnt kill him mr st anne
ones me and the others the man that did
st anne what man
st anne is winning
and they both know it
and he almost grins
we just dealt with the man
how dyou know the jan itor didnt shoot him
if st anne can raise an eyebrow he does
by implication berlin is ditching his killer
during this st anne rewinds his sony
youre telling me its his flashlight i saw o
he sees my flashlight
and im coming up the stairs with a beretta in my hand
and hes frightened
he hits the door on me
picks up my gun
he runs into ross and in panic he shoots him
the little sony snaps to a stop and st anne looks at his watch
st anne not unless he had a gun in one hand and a phone in the other he didnt
ross was shot at ex actly two fifty seven a
the janitor put a call through to the local police at a
you obviously realize how i can get so accurate with my timing
st anne backs off and carefully replaces the sony on the table
ross switched into channel we got a recording of the whole incident
i was gonna play it to you but i got a meeting well have to do it after lunch
its one lets make it back by three
helena is curled up under blankets
maybe day dreaming but not asleep
shes maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else
sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen
the car pulls up and its engine silences
helena is already out of bed
silhouette of a figure outside the front door
someone rattles the handle but its locked
and by the time helena reaches the door the visitor has gone
thinking its berlin she twists the key and steps onto the porch
a stale winter fog settling down
hardly a sound except her own voice
is that you
just the rattle of local crows and a bull heaving somewhere in some distant field
she cautiously descends wood stairs and walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown chevrolet
exploration of the car establishes nil
more confused than con cerned she listens
country sound and not a sound out of place then suddenly she is alert
something clatters somewhere
like cans kicked in the garage
was it the garage
john is it you
helena locks the front door
moves into the kitchen
locks the back door
glum silence in the house
nothing but an old alarm clock ticking
then a sound like something moving
like a door creaking open
was it in the garage
the living room
she returns to the living room
curtains drawn and almost dark
the endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes
if anybodys here theyre upstairs
helena moves to the bottom of them john are you up there
its me darling
i got a cab
the only reply is more silence
she begins to climb the stairs
one hand on the wall
she ascends slowly
her helplessness giv ing way to suspicion with each new step
at the top she pushes into the bedroom john are you here
are you alright
apparently no one is here
certainly no one in the bed
and no one in the bathroom
she reappears with an expression suppress ing anxiety
feels her way past an antique wardrobe
curiously its door is open
a full length mirror inside
shuts it as she passes and for a split instant the man in the room is revealed
almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist
helena in speechless with shock
both she and the intruder are breathing hard
the only other sound is the wardrobe door whin ing open again under its weight
manifests a reflection of his back
totally in black
black wool hat
got really fucken lucky didnt ya
he backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip
the frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still on the intruders back
helena stares unseeing at her own face
i was getting kinda concerned about you jenny
like how blind are you
blind as your friend
or less blind
coz she could see you know
had a view outta one of em
but you dont see nothing do you
nothing at all
he reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife
even closed this thing is inches long
a leather loop attat ched at one and
he teases the metal in front of helenas eyes
can you see this blind girl
not a switch blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out
gimme your hand
too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him
gimme your fucken hand
helena lifts her hand and he takes it
he runs the edge of the blade over her palm
then closes her fingers around the handle
you like it
she is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks
i cut your friends head off with that
words come out she can barely hear herself
you are a coward
you say something jenny
in this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol
id like to cut you
id like to cut you so bad
but aint life strange
youre my little buddy now
i guess we all got lucky
fog and dusk in that order
headlights descend the slope
park and citrine plus cane get out
as he crosses the lot a uniform fires up a harley
next face is serato heading for his car
he accosts the chief with a piece of paper
it is read with escal ating incredulity
this would be comic if it wasnt so serious
shes in love with him chief and try anything
are you going up there
no i just sent travis
ive got a call to make
what about the man
has he seen this
no he hasnt
alright make your call and get up there
bullshit or not i wanna proper statement
citrine walks in in his overcoat
bisley looks across from the window
and the assistant up from a crossword
are they busy
no sir they just got back
would you ask mr st anne to come in here a moment
the assistant does it via phone
and bisley looks over unhappy
i hear ive been nominated as an official observer
its either you or taylor
he dont wanna do it either
ill toss a coin for you
but one of you is going in today
st anne comes in blowing his nose
citrine shoves him the mess age
he reads it with similar incredulity but perhaps a touch more amusement than citrine what dyou wanna do with it sir
what do you wanna do with it
st anne let him have it
i dont mind putting a little salt at the edge of his plate
a single light in a downstairs room
the house is stifled with fog
a brown police chevy parked out front
here comes another to join it
as berlin gets out serato appears on the porch
he descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop
i need a friend angelo
serato keeps it dispassionate
ignores berlins desperate eyes
you got one
puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar
shes a bad witness john
but a fucking lousy alibi
this isnt a good place to be
a dismal lamp supplies light
a close up of helena on the sofa
hears a sound of booze getting poured
but nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice
i know why you did it darlin but youre not helping me
every thing theyre hearing they think is a lie
now here comes the man im desperate to prove exists whadda ya know he turns up at my house and has a chat with you
by now berlin and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame
no one in the state of california is gonna believe that
they got the man in there an a f
inter rogator and hes taking me to pie ces doesnt believe a word comes outta my head not a word no one believes me i dont believe me
dont say that
dont you dare say that
i believe you
i know youre trying to help me but you dont understand
then explain it to me
i got enough darkness dont i
he doesnt want to
but now hes got to
and so here it comes
the man who killed amber is a psychopath
he was up at the in stitute to kill you he dont wanna kill rose he was there to kill you thats the truth and i didnt wanna tell it
to you but thats the reason i want you to stay at margies coz i cant protect you here
why does he want to kill me
coz he thinks youre a witness
i cant identify him
he dont know that
then why didnt he kill me
back at the booze and hes almost inaudible stop it will you
why didnt he kill me john
something snaps in berlin and he throws his glass at the grate
will you fucken stop it
im not serato
he didnt kill you coz he wasnt here
he isnt in the room with you and lets you live
and just as suddenly hes full of remorse
takes helena in his arms with a lot of sorrys
but she isnt interested in apology
theres a passion in her face
and fire even in her blind eyes
kiss me john
kiss me he does i love you kiss me again he does i love you
are my lips lying to you
kiss my mouth he does is my mouth lying to you
music slams in on the cut
berlin is about to take this garage to pieces
he searches cans and boxes and stacked timber
what ever it is his eyes are looking
the camera looks down from ab ove
bits pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing
close on a hand searching underside of the bath
pipes and cob webs
he reaches toward the taps
his hand is literally inches from the walther taped to the end of the tub
fingers almost touch it
just a fingernail away when helena interrupts john
i just remembered something
and berlin rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car
he used a breath freshener
a breath freshener
helena stands in the doorway and berlin is already on his feet
i heard it hiss twice
berlin wipes a thought through his hair with fingers
i dont know what that means
walks past into the bedroom
everything taken apart
every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes
hes either here to take something
or leave some thing
i dont find nothing
berlin pours last of the whisky
looks totally snuffed out
he and helena sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a mile apart
a yellow pad on the table covered in notes
berlin swallows scotch and reads to himself i guess we all got lucky
you gotta stop drinking darling
another mouthful of scotch she hears the glass hit the table
hes glad youre drinking
every drink you take youre helping him
he doesnt need my help
i know about alcohol john
im blind because my father drank
thats what she knows about alcohol and hed prefer to be dead
i lost everyone i ever loved
i lost my hopes
im in love with you john
i dont want them to take you away from me
st anne is close enough to kiss berlin
right into his space talking right into his face
and today hes not in a good mood
st anne he humiliated you
in front of every one
in front of a bunch of secret aries
well that would piss any one off
that would piss me off
id be real mad if a guy did that to me called himself a friend
coz that aint a friendly thing to do
you side with friends
you dont go bitchin on them behind their back
and he suddenly switches gear
and whispers like its a secret
he wasnt much of a friend at all
ross was my best friend
st anne did you shoot your best friend
st anne the next time i ask you that quest ion youre gonna tell me the truth
st anne shunts back in his chair
expands the frame as he goes
sergeant taylor sits on a chair with his back to the wall
cig arettes and ashtray on the table next to his
st anne lights a pall mall and as if its an after thought he snaps the sony on
just be careful now coz im coming up
footsteps on cast iron stairs is that you john
or i blow this fucken staircase to pie ces
sound of someone breathing hard berlin already looks devastated
hes about to got annihilated
just the gale what the hells going on up there brother
i been calling ton minutes
lungs heave for air hey cmon john talk to me
just the sound of breathless ness jesus christ
what are you do ing
what the fuck are you doing
its me holy shit john john not you dont shoot you crazy bastard
shots st anne clicks the sony off berlin is too stunned to breathe
st anne thats second degree you wanna stop at that
will you give me that john
berlin gives him nothing but silence
a knock on the door come in
and the assistant hands st anne a note
reads it and excus es himself
leaves the silence for berlin
but taylor breaks it
hes offerin you a deal
why dont you take it
he aint offerin me shit
taylor lights a cigarette and exhales
something of a real red headed fuck about him
and berlin would like to break his neck
youre letting it show king jay
i dont like you
but dont kid yourself
i dont take no ple asure sitting in on another cop
he rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray
your an alcoholic arent you
berlin stares its written in your file
the phone rings and taylor answers
puts his red eyes at berlin
they want you to look in the mirror
berlin has to find every strength for this one
humiliation com pounds
gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass
the myopic peers into berlins face
st anne stands close with his toilet roll
light refracts in the myopics lenses i seen him up there quite a lot
st anne blows his nose is that the man you saw that night
he stares again at the tormented face
it could be
st anne alright thank you mr dawson
hes escorted to the door and his space is occupied by citrine
whats all this deal business
st anne on his way to the door now
he pauses for the question
st anne i can have him out of here on a sec ond degree this afternoon
i own him and he knows it
and chief im still waiting for that warrant on his house
helena waits on a bench in the empty room
maybe a few scruffy magazines
but nothing of use to her in here except shes near berlin
he arrives like every hope got abandoned and sits next to her
they clasp one anothers hands before she embraces him
you dont wanna sit here any more sweetheart
i wanna be near you
something difficult to tell her and doesnt know how to say it
i think theyre gonna arrest me
i dont want them to arrest you
its not as bad as it sounds
they cant refuse me bail
raise bail of my own cognizance find the best damned lawyer there is
her tears are close to his face
no one but him could hear her
oh john id do anything anything to get you free
if the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here
both st anne and taylor are smoking and the sony playing again
this is the final part of the tape
no speech but a lot of labored breath ing
ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun
more desp erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck
st anne and that ones with malice
that ones first degree
why dont you stop lying to me
clicks sony off cmon john i can help you
why dont you tell me the truth
ive told you the truth
it isnt me
ive never call ed ross freddy in my life
ive heard you call him freddy
and you got no voice in here taylor so keep it shut
st anne tell a lotta lies dont you
some thing that comes naturally to you
i dont lie
st anne prepared to lie to your chief
under exceptional circumstances
st anne what were the circumstances that caused you to lie to freddy ross
i never lied to ross
st anne you didnt
shakes his head in confirmation
and st anne finds a notebook
well he thought you did
wrote it down in his book
john berlin is a liar
right here underlined
berlin stares at the book can barely credit what hes seeing
dated the day you got your first break with your mystery man
you dont know why he wrote that
he doesnt maybe he thought there was no myst ery man
that the investigation was bullshit
that you were making it up
and during the next attack st anne will work himself into rage
coz you wanted to be top cop
isnt that why you went running up that gar bage dump so everyone could stand in awe of the top cop
isnt that why you came up here
coz you couldnt make it in l
get yourself a pissy lit tle degree come up here and be top guy
but ross was top guy wasnt he
always would be top guy
and you know what
he did it without even trying
everybody loved him
he had everything you wanted didnt he
great woman great kid
everything you couldnt have
and you wanted it to go away
coz your life was lousy wasnt it
a lousy life with a lousy wife who was fucking everyone wasnt she
is that why you pick on a little blind girl
coz you can control her
is that it
control who shes fucking
tears of grief and tears of rage
berlin cant restrain either
you wanna lose your temper with me
cmon john lose your fucken temper
youre good at losing your temper
no way mr st anne
st anne lost your temper with ross didnt you
cmon tell me the truth
is that what happened
you had an arg ument in the car
lost your temper with him
stood over him blew his fucking larynx out with a glaser
where were you aiming john
going for his face
blow his fucking face away because you hated him so much
berlin is a wreck of despair
but somehow he keeps his dignity
i loved that guy
the hard est thing to take in here
is knowing he thought i killed him
st anne well that he did
and that do i sergeant berlin
and at last he looks pleased
because hes got this man busted
what do you take for that breathlessness sergeant
cant take anymore questions
answers with a shake of his head
how about aminophylline
i dont know what that is
st anne you dont
its ant anti asthma medic ation prescribed for breathlessness
produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table
came out of the ashtray of your car
every cell in berlins body freezes
misinterpreted by st anne
but you dont know what it is
but he does know what it is
the pill he found in the v
you dont know how it got there
taylor stares a rock drill and st anne stares something similar
you dont use it for breathlessness
berlin focuses a fragment of hope
but no sign of hope in here
im running outta questions john and youre running out of lies
im offer ing you one last chance and you better take it or the u
attorney is gonna put you in the god damned gas chamber
to think sir
st anne alright
think about it
but dont you make a fool of me
you come in here with one more lie and i bull shit you not im gonna press for the maximum penalty there is
and thats the death penalty sergeant
berlin hurries in and grabs helenas hand
instantly transmits the adrenalin
they head for the door with him whispering hard
we got a break isnt much but its a break
the man that murdered ross gets asthma its not a breath fresh ner darling its an asthma inhaler
berlin helena couldnt have been in the house longer than its taken to call los angeles
margie infected with the excitement although as yet she hardly knows whats going on
berlin paces the tiles on a long phone lead
eyes to margie while they wait
this capsule came out of a v
van i didnt even think about it stuck it in the ashtray if id been smok ing ita been thrown away weeks ago
phone no amanda its definitely amanda
another excruciating wait plus further explanations for margie
i had the van this guy drove that van takes his medication and loses one
phone dan hearing are you sure
would you try frisco for me
ill try and get a second name
dumps the phone and stokes anxiety in helena and margies eyes
no amanda with a white volkswagen
you dont have a yellow pages for oakland do you
she dont i got ta get down there find that store
everything happens in a hurry
he embraces helena
shell pray for him
already out the back door with margie in tow
a black white parked in the drive with venables stuffed inside
plus a grim wind tearing trees
berlin pauses as he reaches his car
you be careful
this mans close
catches her eyes
can barely look at them
theyre full of hate
if you find him john
i want you to call me
i wanna know his name
wide over the bay area
wind swept and rain swept
city lights beginning to come on
in the distance the docks and far beyond the ocean
somewhere here is a solitary phone booth
im look ing for a special type of rattan
friend of mine recommended you said i should ask for someone called amanda
followed by sound of a phone slamming down
a stack of coins and a pair of ripped out yellow pages
berlin crosses off another number
running out of craft shops and run ning out of quarters
a new number hears the same old bullshit
but this one is answering good
fights to keep his voice light
berlin phone shes not there
let me just make sure i got the right amanda lotta freckles right
thats right thats her
well eh what time dyou expect her
ill eh try and pop over this afternoon
and he comes out of there running
the chevy roars up the hill
the kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses
a jungle of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk
many chairs of the ilk berlin saw in the volkswagen van
and now hes staring at its driver
he watches as a red headed girl clears the till in preparation to close up
within moments the lights are dead and amanda is heading for her door
plenty of rain to hurry in
drives a red datsun
she ex its the car park with a man in a brown chevrolet following her
the chevy tails the datsun through city streets
a lot of rush hour traffic
music to go with it and its probably mussorgsky
a final cut and headlights are navigating the hills
disappear and reappear as they ascend
steep inclines and the houses are middle class
too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain
still climbing the datsun takes a side street
berlin keeps yards behind
she turns off and parks in a sloping driveway
a white volkswagen van at the top of it
berlin has already pull ed over
kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house
berlin just rang the doorbell
imposes an impartial expression
but this is his last chance and he knows it
the front door is opened secured on a safety chain
amanda carries a white cat
im sorry to trouble you but eh
wait a minute dont i know you
and she stares like he does not
before she stares like he does
remember you near ly ran into me
way up in trinity
his smile disarms the securities
and she opens the front door
as i said sergeant you nearly ran into me
whats the problem
im afraid its the van again
is it your vehicle
no my mothers
you better stop in
im just here to feed the cat
so far so good
inside without showing an i
he doesnt have
this is a gloomy place
she shuts the door
shuts out the gale
im sorry to worry you with this but we had a real serious robbery and we re chasing a white v
you guy came up an the computer so as a matt er of routine we have to check
could you tell me whos driven it recently
only me and mom
how about any guys on your staff
we only got one
he doesnt drive
would he have lent it to anyone
no how bout your dad
he is my boyfriend
my fath ers dead and im divorced
his hopes are collapsing by the moment and nothing else is left
would you mind if i took a look at it
i thought this was routine
the cat cries for its food and amanda begins to look suspicious
the only man that has driven it in the last months is my uncle
and no way is he involved in a robbery
could i have his name
just so i can officially eliminate him
maybe too much charge in his head and she doesnt like the vibe
could i see your badge again
sure she can and he searches for it
must have left it at home
then you better go and get it
i feel uncomfortable without an i
amanda opens the front door just long enough for berlin to leave
the emerging music is full of threat
like its part of the dark ness
too dark to see much of anything here
a sound of somebody hammering at a door
a light outside and the camera moves closer
creeps towards the door as though its going to answer
suddenly glass shatters
the door flies open
flashlights and men rush in
berlin stares towards the house
music and rain and a downstairs light just wont out
headlights go on and the datsun drives away
a flashlight searches cobwebs and soot
descends the chimney and taylor emerges from a long sealed off fireplace
blinks dirt out of his eyes and moves back into the bedroom
upended bed against the wall and everything upsidedown
the search looks like it has been thorough
st anne appears at the door and taylor looks over
were not gonna find nothin here
berlin searches the bedroom
anxiety and antiques
does a vanity and now a wardrobe
nothing much in either
but finds a shoe box full of letters in the latter
postcards birthday cards etcetera
half the floorboards already up
venables levers at another
the music is nervous and louder
next floorboard is next to the bath
big close on a postcard a fantasy yacht on a blue sea
the cap tion reads just another day in san diego
close enough to read the message
asthma not too good
as soon as im settled ill write
next letter out is also post marked san diego
inside is a happy snap of sergeant john taylor
almost too close to see whats happening
but a gloved hand just found a pistol under the bath
out it comes with bisley shouting
and st anne and taylor arrive
got a little walther
helena looks at the floor and listens
margie looks at the t
big close on the screen
this scene will intercut between the television and those in front of it as appropriate
an exterior shot of berlins house
sheriffs cars parked out front
various people come and go
one of them is sergeant taylor
perpetual wind on the sound track interrupted by a v
detectives spent several hours this morning at sergeant berlins home
various property was removed for ex amination
later in the morning may or heineman arrived for a meeting with police officers from shasta valley
pulls up outside the police station and this is conducted on the move
a reporter asks whats the nat ure of this meeting sir
heineman is sorry but cant comment
he pauses briefly an the steps with the wind savaging his hair
jim unable to say anything right now except this is a very sad and tragic day
john berlin lied to us all
lied to me and much worse lied to every man woman child in this community
where was mr berlin arrested sir
near the ross residence
who made the arrest
sergeant john taylor
assist ed by sergeant angelo serato
helena looks in utmost despair
is it true he resisted arrest
youll have to put that question to the chief
ive nothing to add
bobby appears somewhere behind the ladies
commentary con tinues
meanwhile sergeant berlin remains in a cell at police headquarters arraigned on what is believed to be a
as mayor heineman said this is a sad day for eureka
except for the one face that isnt sad and it belongs to bobby
the cell window is reinforced glass
berlin smashes on it like an insane man
travis apparently on cell duty has never seen nothing like this before
citrine doesnt want to see any more
ill sign anything you want
bring here her
i want helena here
you aint talking to no one till you calm down
i am calm
i am calm
but he isnt and citrine moves off
berlin cracks blood out of knuckles on the glass
hollers up the corridor after the chief
get st anne
i want st anne
gale still making a mass of the trees
a police chevy pulls up and taylor gets out
puts a knuckle on the window of a black white
a uniform wakes and taylor interrupts his apologies go
and the young cop does the drive as taylor heads for the house
helena descends the stairs with her luggage
shes towards the bottom when taylor appears via the kitchen
lights momentarily stall as the gale sucks their electricity
ignorant of his pre sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den
he moves after her and startles the shit out of margie as she comes out
what are you doing here
been trying to call your lines down
i just wanna let you know were taking the guard off today
margie heads for a table and unloads a strong box of documents
is she going somewhere
im taking her back to the instit ute
her new term starts tomorrow
he watches her select various papers aware of what shes about
not gonna try and bail him are you
i really wouldnt bother margie
helena reappears wearing a coat and taylor is in generous mood
you want me to drive her
im through with my shift
ill drive her
heres a classic twenty two
berlin is consumed with anxiety rage
but get mad in here and get nothing
no shoe strings and no wrist watch
but a wrist band like something medical summar izing his charge
st anne sits impassive as berlin walks floor
ill sign anything you like you write it ill sign it
but i want her and margie here
i want an opp ortunity to talk to them thats all im asking
thats my deal
st anne o
ill put it to your chief
well youd better put it to him pretty dammed quick mr st anne because if you dont shes dead
st anne didnt push her down stairs on their previous meeting did he
he was up there to plant the gun
st anne did taylor plant this too
produces a zippo in a plastic sack and berlins senses capsize
is it yours
a question for which st anne expects no answer and he is right
we found jennifer eight
at least weve found a headless and handless girl
a couple of hunters found her
maybe berlin asks him where or maybe his expressions enough
about miles south of the institute less than feet from the road
this was less than feet from the body
berlin cant believe it and knows st anne wouldnt believe him
is it yours
no answer i know its yours
you know its yours
the only prints on it are freddys
you wanna tell me how it got there
berlin wouldnt believe it either
door open and travis enters
margie ross put up your bond sir
st anne and berlin look surprised
and berlin looks at st anne
are you getting in the way of it
st anne examines the bail bond paper and raises eyes to berlin
st anne i dont make the law
music on the cut and this is a crane shot high above the house
a car tears up the drive with the camera descending to meet it
berlin out and into the house
and still the gale howls around
darkness and silence
where the hell is everyone
he quicks it to the den cartoons on t
but no one watching
with escalat ing concern he hits the kitchen and now hes shouting upstairs
about to climb when bobby appears at the top
theres no one here
where are they
mom took her back to the institute
he maybe says what
he definitely says when
how come they let you out
is margie with her
is she with her
no she came back and went out ag ain
gone to see auntie charles
berlin has already grabbed a telephone
aware its dead before bobby tells him theyre all out around here
he wanders down stairs in apparent oblivion to berlins distress
berlin races back to the den and new problems
desperate to get at the guns but all cabinets locked wheres the keys bobby
i need a gun
theyre my dads guns
come on bobby for gods sake
i wanna get the man that killed him
bobby stares at berlin as though hes staring at that very man
i hate you
i really hate you
he turns away into the darkness
berlin looks frantic and with out options
smashes the cabinets with a chair
grabs a rev olver plus a gauge remington and the slugs that go with it
wide over an intersection
berlins chevy crosses a bridge and descends into lights
music travels with him but the camera re mains static
watches tail lights dissolve into a river of red
tracking back with the car
as yet yards away
moving fast and getting closer
as it approaches a remote sound of a phone drifts in
and headlights so near now they wipe out everything
starting to sleet and windshield wipers on
the phone is still ringing like its at the end of berlins brain
like its part of his thoughts mixed up with the nightmare hes hearing again
go take a look in his office
its fulla rattan thats the connect ion thats the link thats why they never got an i
he kills blind girls put their picture in the newspaper and percent of the people who know them are blind
intercutting berlins fearful eyes with his p
of the road
st anne v
havta be a real dope to kill her now wouldnt he
i mean were talking real full blown insane
he is insane
his fucken brains upside down
but hes also very cunning
hes not going after her with a pearl handled colt he ll just push her down the stairs
just the sound of tho phone and the road dissolving into black
a miserable corridor with the merest of lights
a phone rings somewhere at its end
helena is on her way up the corridor and the ringing is louder
finds keys and walks into her apartment
phone in close up and the frame widens as helena heads towards it
reaches out and is maybe a second away before it rings off
this is a little country stop some place an the peripheries of the snow line
berlin slams the phone down and runs to his car
screeches out onto the highway and the camera begins to ascend
the camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains
plus mile upon mile of road he has yet to travel
still it ascends until the chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape
a panoramic over the institute wide enough to include surround ing forest
headlights approach down a wooded track and go out
just possible to see a tiny figure moving towards the building
high on the fire escape looking down
a flashlight arrives bel ow
eerie fragmentation of light as the figure begins to climb
the highway is winding and narrowed with snow
couldnt find a lousier road on which to overtake
berlin is right up behind a forty ton truck and hes trying to overtake
hits the horn and tries again
halfway past the trailer when a bend suddenly rel eases headlights
an angry claxon and hes forced to pull back
although curtains are open the room is in darkness
someone on the fire escape looking in
a flashlight snaps on and a circle of light explores the room
creeps across the floor and pauses at the bed
climbs slowly to illuminate helenas sleeping face
close up sound and close up picture
a glass cutter scores the window
a nasty noise but youd have to be wide awake and list ening to hear it
a gloved fist punches the section out
falls to the floor and shatters
and a hand reaches in for the catch
helena is wide awake and listening
hurrying into her dressing gown with a similar urgency to get out
she arrives in the liv ing room as the figure is clambering through the window
panic as she blunders for the front door
tears it open and vanishes into the corridor
he crosses the room and follows her outside
helena knows the building and moves faster than he may have ex pected
green dressing gown and bare feet
white nightgown and blonde hair
the man in black hurries after her
shes already at the swing doors and hes virtually running to stay with her
she bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs
he follows only seconds behind
the wind groans down as they descend
hel ena turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears
for a moment he loses her
which way did she go
downstairs or along the corridor
his anxiety is immediately assuaged
spots what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows
he takes off along the corridor
but getting closer
near enough now to sense her fear
near enough now to grab her
say night night dead girl
as he reaches for her she turns
margie wears a green dressing gown and a blonde wig and has a very big fucking pistol in her hand
taylor cant believe what hes looking at
and for an in stant neither does margie
their surprise is mutually stunning
how can it be him
how can it be her
taylors still trying to work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks into his chest
gets another as he goes down
he crumples in a deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back
margie barges through the doors
the myopic janitor is halfway up adjacent stairs peering down
no time for introductions and no time for explanations
call the police
shout ing up at him shes already descending
tell em the gymnasium
margie patrols plate glass windows
where are the fucking cops
shes shocked and looks strange indeed
wig off but hair grips all over her head
an overcoat and shoes but still wearing the nightgown underneath
a couple of dreary lights in the ceiling
helena sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket
margie cant stand waiting any longer
im gonna call them my self
helena nods and sure shes o
to stay here
the doors settle and she is alone
headlights cross the windows shifting the shadows of everything
swooping the walls they move attent ion back to the door
taylor stares in and then pushes through
worse for wear but very much alive
discarded his leather jack et revealing the bullet proof vest
blood all over his t shirt
looks like he caught one in the shoulder
a bad burn and blood runs from his left hand
in his right hand he clasps the knife
he cracks it open like a whip
helena hears it and stands
ter ror as the footsteps approach
but margie is nt around
hes less than feet away
she tries to back off but is hindered by the blanket
tries to scream but is stifled with fear
maybe six seconds to live but this refers to taylor
taylor he swings around but this time he doesnt get time to look surprised
berlin blows the fucker across the room
solid load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him
berlin keeps pumping the remington and doesnt stop firing until the magaz ine is over
no conjecture now
this bastard is very much dead
berlin throws the gauge aside
and maybe it means something
maybe at last he accepts hes stopped living in that world and ready to give himself a chance in this
helena in his arms and this is his new world
flashing lights and headlights flood in to the darkness
their embrace goes on
and this story is told
