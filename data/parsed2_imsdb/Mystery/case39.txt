written by ray wright
we hear footsteps sneaking up an old wooden staircase
two people moving as one
topping the stairs they creep down the hall to the closed door that protects us
we can hear them behind it whispering bickering insanely one shushing the other
the squeak of a door knob slowly turning
the faint click of the latch
and the door inches open throwing a razor thin shaft of light into the darkness where it illuminates a as a ten year old girl sits up in bed
staring at the two dark faces peering in at her
i can see you
and the door closes leaving us once more in total darkness
we can hear them bickering again as they shuffle away their footsteps descending the stairs fading into the uneasy silence of this old house
a young teacher darla chalks a lesson on a blackboard in a sun drenched los angeles classroom
and we know from yesterday that the base of a triangle times half the height equals the area
a girl in the back row raises her hand
lucys asleep again
darla puts down the chalk and comes up the aisle to where a slight fair skinned girl in a thrift shop dress sleeps head down on her desk
the girl from the opening scene
darla stands over her with obvious concern
puts a finger to her lips to quiet the giggles
let her sleep
she draws the shade
it drops a shadowbox on the sleeping girl
a former gang member sitting with his wife and troubled eight year old son
the martinez family
a family in crisis
sitting opposite is an la county social worker
attractive but overworked
he would just go off you know start tearin the place down
you didnt even know why he was doin it half the time you just got out of his way
and what you learned from your father now diegos learning from you
its painful for him to hear that
he loves his son quit the streets for him
overcome by emotion he nods yes
that really upsets you doesnt it
he wipes his eyes on his tattooed arm
cuz i mean i dont want him to be like me
the boy looks at his father has never seen him cry before
outside the conference room emily musses the boys hair
a whole week without skipping school
is that true
he smiles nods
a glimpse of the boy he might have been
thats the last time i make a bet with you
to his parents see you guys next week
the martinez family heads down the hall diego lagging behind
emily watches with guarded optimism knowing their chances
then turns to the next family welcoming the
you cut your hair
it looks great
the hurried opening and closing of files reveals photos of abused children
emily trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on her desk
an angry mother screaming at her on the phone no one is trying to steal your child they found bruises and cigarette burns mrs lynch i read the medical report
well if you feel you need legal representation thats perfectly within your rights
a flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone
emily puts the phone down
one less christmas card for emily
her supervisor wayne forties gay leaning in the doorway
how many active cases you have
he drops another file on her desk
no absolutely not look at this wayne look im buried sorry em we all are
he walks off
emily shoves the new file onto the shelf above her desk
looks at it guiltily
takes it down again
handwritten on the front sheridan lucy
she opens it
a school portrait of ten year old lucy clipped to the preliminary report
the sad face draws emily in
an old volvo wagon skirts rush hour traffic on wilshire
faded red paint
ski rack on the roof
an ancient bumpersticker says educate
ipod jacked into the car stereo playing hip alternative music emily leans on an elbow as she drives not crazy about l
but at ease with herself
emilys red volvo wagon turns in the drive of a single person home she rents in a working class neighborhood
light colors offset dark hardwood floors
emily comes in stack of files under her arm
drops the files in a chair
sprinkles some food in a fish tank
referees through the glass
hey thats his
turns on the tv
turns it off
puts on some quiet music
hits play on her answering machine as she flops down barefoot on the sofa with a magazine peeling an orange decompressing
hey its suze missed you at yoga the other day give me a call
hi em jackie just checking in hope youre good
a charming male voice exhausted her career path questionable her faith in mankind shaken she resisted her tendency toward introspection and went to have a drink with her friend doug
emily gives a tired sigh
faint smile under it
noisy trendy downtown bar
professional type on a bar stool
he laughs when he sees emily
i am so in your head
she gives him a kiss
sits down beside him
the whole psychology thing its just about scoring chicks isnt it
they share a laugh
he gestures to the bartender for another beer
you know what freaks me out
that you have a four year degree and make seventeen grand a year after taxes
i sit there talking to these families you know like im some expert
my familys a train wreck
i mean i had this moment today where i realized i might be totally full of it
everybodys full of it
in the end youre a number to call for people who dont have anyone else
theres no way thats bad
emily nods appreciates that
recognizes a girl going by in the crowd
a friend from school
the track emily might be on if she werent a social worker
so one of us is a major screwup i cant remember if i was supposed to call you or the other way around
no its me its just been a crazy couple weeks
you remember doug
then to emily listen my rides leaving lets catch up soon okay
emily nods okay
the girl departs
emilys beer arrives
doug hands it to her
so anyway ive done some soul searching and i just want to say that if a full on relationship feels like too much right now id be willing to consider
a purely physical one
emily sipping her beer smiles
hey you might actually enjoy yourself
im sure i would i just
hard to explain
doug saves her the trouble
i know i know the job you get home you dont have anything left
emily nods yeah leans in closer the friendly banter giving way to a moment of real sincerity
if it were anyone itd be you
they exchange a look then doug clinks his glass against hers
and as they drink together after a long day more than friends less than lovers
emily in glasses reading the sheridan file on her bed
the preliminary report concerns her socially withdrawn
lack of appetite
sleeping at school
her gaze returns to lucys photo
sadly under her breath what are they doing to you
a dark rundown family home on a once prosperous cul de sac
emily pulls up
checks that she has the right address
halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains upstairs
gone as soon as she sees it
emily stands frozen for a moment
she reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly the security chain snapping taut
a womans voice growls at her from the darkness inside what
we spoke on the phone
peering through the crack is the pallid bony face from the upstairs window
you said the seventeenth
today is the seventeenth
im sorry but it is
friday was the thirteenth
emily rather amazed at the conversation shes having takes a newspaper from her bag
indicates the date
friday was the fourteenth that makes today the seventeenth
monday the seventeenth
the date of our appointment
the door closes in emilys face
what the hell
then we hear the chain unlock
it opens again
and we get our first good look at lucys mother
dark rings under her eyes
she steps aside not welcoming emily in merely allowing her to enter
its dark the curtains drawn
margaret twitches one open in begrudging courtesy
the house is tidy but sad steeped in a kind of puritanical gloom
lucy peers down through the upstairs banister anxious unsure whats going on
emily sees her smiles
come down id like to meet you
lucy hesitates sensing her mothers disapproval
comes slowly down the stairs
emily shakes her hand
my names emily
lucy turns shyly away
is there somewhere we can talk
margaret sighs and heads down the hall
emily file in hand trying to project professionalism in an arm chair that tilts to one side
margaret and lucy sitting opposite on the sofa
when do you expect your husband back
because weve found its more beneficial if the whole family participates
well hes not home so
do you have any way of contacting him
not if i dont know where he is
just then we hear a power tool go on in the basement
emily sensing the lie indicates the floor
margaret averts her eyes
would you ask him to join us
he doesnt have anything to say
would you ask him
margaret weighs emilys resolve gives lucy a cautionary glance then exits
we hear her open a door and holler into the basement over the noise of the power tool
the power tool stops
that ladys here
from the state
she wants to talk to you
we hear an angry unintelligible reply
i already told her she wants to anyway
we hear the power tool get thrown aside
footsteps pounding up the cellar stairs
emilys and lucys faces reflect the same simple fear
their eyes meet
itll be okay
lucy not so sure
the footsteps are upon them
edward sheridan makes his entrance
a menacing man with a gaunt face and dark deep set eyes
emily holds out her hand
hi im emily edward forgoes the handshake his contempt obvious
sits beside lucy on the sofa
margaret sits on the other side
lucy tenses trapped between them
emily speaks with kindness and composure
hostile encounters part of the job
im here today because lucys school is concerned about changes theyre seeing in her academic performance
the kinds of changes theyre seeing are often associated with family problems
edward leans over and whispers something caustic in margarets ear
eddie says we dont have family problems
thats just it many times a family wont even know theyre having problems until its too late
thats where we come in
we help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict
edward whispers again in margarets ear
eddie says we dont need your help
mr sheridan is there some reason you wont speak to me directly
edward just stares at her
is there some reason why your husband wont speak to me directly
margaret nods gives edward a look as though for permission
eddie doesnt like speakin out of anger
emily does well to hide her fear
refusing to be intimidated she engages edwards stare
a battle of wills
but his gaze has a murderous intensity she cant match
she looks down shuffling papers
emily follows wayne along a row of cubicles after hours
hes dropping files on desks
the new cases never stop
no laws against being weird em
send it over to cmc well do a follow up in a month
i didnt say weird i said scary
the guy sat there the entire time staring at me the mother is like his emotional slave
wayne pauses in mock bewilderment
wait did you just fly to new york and meet my parents
wayne this girls in trouble
i can feel it
beneath waynes humor a sober hard learned practicality
wanna know what i can feel
the lawsuit were gonna get hit with if we violate her parents rights without any evidence theyve done something wrong
every time i talk to you you sound more like a lawyer you know that
yeah well maybe because every time i make an emotional decision i get called by one
im sorry youre gonna have to let this one go
you put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you whats going on
well im telling you theres something going on and its not something good
ive done my job ive told you what you do with it is yours
she walks off
wayne alone after hours with his conscience
the elevator doors open with a ding and edward and margaret sheridan step out in their sunday best
lucy between them ribbon in her hair brand new dress appearing coached as she eats an ice cream cone
emily disgusted by the charade trades looks with the parents as they go past
gazing fondly at lucy edward directs his comments at wayne who sits opposite the family with emily
they really are gods miracles
day she was born was the happiest day of our lives
were not perfect parents we know that but we figure if you let em know how much you love em a lot of the other stuff takes care of itself
wayne nods his agreement
edward puts his arm around lucy for effect
her eyes go to emily
a silent plea for help
tell me mr sheridan since youve suddenly acquired the power of speech doesnt it concern you a little that lucys grades have gone from as to ds in three months
course it does shes our daughter
with a glance wayne cautions emily about her tone of voice
so you have no idea why shes falling asleep at school every day
why shes not able to sleep at home
edward looks at margaret then emily affects bewilderment
emily and wayne in private conversation
shes pissed off
the sheridan family in the other room preparing to leave
hes gonna be having bad dreams when he gets hit with child endangerment
off waynes reluctance dont tell me youre buying this daddys little girl routine
so theyre overcompensating a little
let me talk to her
she wants to talk
talk to them about how much they love kids
she goes out the door
emily walks with lucy looking for a way in
i knew someone at school named lucy she was a writer
do you ever write
i do sometimes it helps me sort out how im feeling
lucy doesnt take the bait
she stops for a drink at a water fountain
emily bends for a sip after
as she wipes her face embarrassed okay i just shot like a gallon of water up my nose
so much for establishing trust
lucy smiles for the first time
its the opening emily was looking for
maintaining that precious eye contact whats happening to you
i can help
let me help
lucy looks away eyes brimming with tears
what is it sweetheart
they hate me
she lowers her head in shame tears rolling down
im sure they dont hate you
i hear them
they go in the cellar and talk
what do they talk about
sending me to hell
emilys mouth falls open
youve heard them say that
as emily registers this in quiet horror
a tape recorder is running
emily and wayne alone with lucy
shes hesitant to speak naturally distrustful
you can tell him
hes on our side
did you hear your parents say they were going to hurt you
nobody sees what lucy sees at this moment
edward glaring in at her through the window
lucy looks at wayne shakes her head
wayne looks at emily case closed
emily watches in agony as the sheridan family steps into the elevator
parent on each side lucy gives her one last pleading look then the elevator doors close and shes gone
emily and wayne in the heat of an argument
she doesnt trust anybody
you think i made it up
i think youd do just about anything you had to do to help a child you thought was at risk
here are the facts emily
they havent laid a finger on her that we can tell
and we have no proof they intend to
meanwhile on your desk right now are thirty plus cases of actionable abuse
what about those
im not giving up on her wayne
yes you are youre leaving this alone
a look that says he means it
i hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience
thats a little unfair dont you think
i care about these kids as much as you do but we cant go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch
parents even bad ones have rights thats how the laws of this great land are written
emily gives a resigned nod backing away from him from the job all of it
so thats it
we let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws
she exits before he can answer doesnt want to hear it
detective mike barron
veteran of the force
man of quiet faith
a well built silver haired family man who played fullback at brigham young
hes doing paperwork
smiles warmly as emily enters
was just thinking about you got a nice letter from sandy hutchinson
she drops lucys file on his desk
whatever barron was going to say is no longer relevant
soberly after a pause well its sitting in front of me which means our good friend wayne thinks it fails to meet the criteria for child endangerment and has told
you in no uncertain terms to leave it alone
she starts to open the file
barron stops her
i cant emily
mike im desperate here
the need for privacy now apparent barron gets up and closes his door
sits down at his desk again
you know how dear to my heart the work you do is but the department doesnt pay me to stakeout potential child abusers
last time almost cost me my job
this girl heard her parents say theyre going to send her to hell
sickening as that is youre a part of the system that handles those situations im not
the system is broken
maybe you just need to let it work
jesus i feel like im talking to wayne
you dont want to get involved fine but dont bullshit me im running out of people i respect
give me evidence of a crime ill be all over it
till then theres nothing i can do
the blade of a circular saw screams through a pinewood board spitting sawdust
a ten pound hammer crushes the head of a nail sinking it crushes another crushes another the speed of the handiwork conveying its urgency
lucy peering into the basement through an air vent in the floor vertical bands of light on her face
edward hammering down below
he steps aside and we see what hes making
sensing lucys stare he glances up over his shoulder
and lucy ducks out of sight breath held
children waiting for the bus after school
lucy stands apart tired and solemn
the bus pulls up to the curb
as she goes to get on lucy
emily behind her
i just wanted you to know i havent forgotten about you
im doing everything i can
lucy hugs her clinging for a moment
if i disappear will you come look for me
youre not going to disappear
if i do
emily holds her gaze seeing the fear
backing away lucy indicates the bus
i have to go
they get mad when i miss the bus
lucy turns to go
takes her cell phone from her bag
puts her number on speed dial
if anything happens call me okay
just press this
dont let your parents know you have it
tucks the cell phone in lucys coat pocket
im gonna get you out of there i promise
lucy boards the bus
waves to emily from a back window as it drives away
emily waves back heart in her throat
might be the last time she sees her alive
a sleepless night finds emily slouched on her sofa leaving a hey this is doug here it comes its me thought you might be up um anyway call if you
clicks on the tv remote
home shopping network
hip hop music video
watches it for a moment
gangster with a mic
scantily clad girls shaking their asses
the phone rings
emily mutes the tv picks up
too late i met someone else
a childs whisper
concerned but calm lucy
are you okay
why are you scared honey
theyre waiting to get me i can hear them
why are you sorry
im falling asleep
okay listen i want you to go over and open the window
can you do that
softly drifting off im sooorry
lucy no wake up
the cell phone lying on the bed at lucys fingertips
the illuminated screen casts an eerie glow on her sleeping emily drops the phone
moment of panic
then a decision
throws a coat on over her bed clothes
grabs the phone again dials a number in desperation
mike its emily listen that girl i told you about i think shes in trouble yeah i know what you said but mike youre not listening emily fumbles with her
gets the right one in the door
starts the engine
peels off down the road
the cell phone turns itself off plunging the room into total darkness
in black we hear footsteps coming up the stairs
down the hall
stopping at the door
the knob turning
the click of the latch
the door opening
a shaft of light
edward and margaret peering in with frenzied anticipation lucy is asleep
the time has come
emily red lines the tachometer doing ninety down the freeway
slowly quietly edward descends the stairs with lucy asleep in his arms
margaret in front of him moving in tandem holding a roll of duct tape
they reach the bottom
margaret rushes ahead into the kitchen
edward carries lucy toward the old gas oven where margaret waits holding open the door
delicately cradling her head edward puts lucy into the oven without waking her
but as he lifts the door one of the metal hinges creaks
lucy jolts awake with a scream
kicks open the door before edward can shut it
with animal terror she thrashes her way out onto the linoleum floor
margaret throws a piece of duct tape over her mouth silencing her screams as edward wrestles her back into the oven
but she kicks open the door again and the frantic struggle continues as
emilys car lurches to a stop out front
as she jumps out barrons pickup arrives
he joins her a reluctant accomplice
what are we doing here
saving her life
she goes up the walkway
barron lagging a few steps behind eyeing the darkened house
theyre not asleep
emily hears something inside the house
did you hear that
i didnt hear anything
emily trusting her gut starts pounding on the door
leave her alone
hearing emily edward and margaret intensify their efforts jamming lucys legs inside the oven
the duct tape peels off her mouth in the struggle and before the oven door slams shut she belts out one last desperate scream
clearly audible outside it makes barron jump
did you hear that
barron pounds his big fist on the door
police open up
break it down
barron rams his shoulder against the door but it holds solid
we see lucys screaming face through the oven window as margaret cranks the temperature dial as high as it will go
from inside we see edward and margaret peering in as lucy claws at the glass with her fingernails
coughing as the gas fills the oven with a low hiss
we hear it ignite beneath her with a faint poof
the first shimmering waves of heat rising up singeing her hair
emily hysterical knowing theyre too late the front door comes crashing down kicked off its hinges by barron
emily and he race in
they take off toward the kitchen at the end of the hall
emily and barron rush in
emily sees lucy trapped inside the oven
the sleeve of her pajamas catching fire
oh my god
edward tries to fend barron off
its a mistake
barron unleashes a devastating blow that sends him recoiling into the fridge so hard the back of his head leaves a visible dent in the door
emily shoves margaret aside and throws open the oven
pulls lucy out onto the kitchen floor swatting out her burning pajamas with a dish towel
margaret grabs a steak knife and rushes at emily but barron has her covered
backhands margaret so hard it spins her around fully before dropping her to the floor
the hells the matter with you people
pajamas scorched wild with terror lucy cries in great heaving sobs in emilys arms
reduced to tears herself emily keeps saying the same thing over and over
shielding her from the sight of her parents margaret sprawled on the linoleum weeping
edward slouched against the fridge blood pouring down his shirt his broken jaw hanging open like a man thinking wow
edward and margaret holding hands at the defendants table remorseless and defiant in their sunday best
among the many spectators we find emily and mike barron
the state prosecutor and public defender addressing the judge
prosecution asks that you disallow an insanity defense
this was an act committed with premeditation malice your honor the egregiousness of the crime makes the competency question all the more relevant
i hereby order the defendants undergo psychiatric evaluation to determine their mental fitness for trial
emily rolls her eyes at barron some justice system
barron walks emily to her car
steal a pizza san quentin try killing your kid freudian dream analysis
well youre gonna hate me for saying this but my moneys on crazy
did they or did they not know what they were doing
thats the legal standard
they knew they knew damn well
its not that simple sometimes
stops on a dime meaning what exactly
hes crossing the line by telling her this
when we brought them in that night they told captain lister
they think shes evil some kind of demon spirit minion of the devil or something
oh thats great what is this late night cable
no but that might be the world theyre living in
lucy in a hospital bed dressings on her hand
emilys friend doug sitting bedside
and whats the most important thing we talked about that you have to remember
its not my fault what happened
thats right and you know what
lucy nods not entirely convinced
doug gives her a pat crosses to the exit
at the door he runs into emily
shakes his head awed at what she did
that is some seriously proactive social work happenin there
you all right
yeah im okay
hows she doing
typical reaction blames herself
well get there
im gonna put her in a group setting see if i can get her to open up
group therapy for kids whats that say about the world
he nods no kidding heads off
emily comes over and sits on lucys bed
strokes her hair
you get to leave here tomorrow
doug said i might have to go to a state home
only for a few days till we find a better place
why cant i live with you
that would never be allowed
its complicated theres a whole process im not even a foster parent
lucy gives a sad nod
emily touches her arm
no frills purely functional housing
emily comes up the steps with lucy and knocks
the coordinator answers
a kind but beleagured looking woman of fifty who is surprised to see them
they were supposed to call you
we dont have any rooms
there was a mixup with the dates
emily rolls her eyes
lucy standing there holding a suitcase
through the windshield lucy watches emily on a pay phone outside a convenience store
her back is to us but you can see shes arguing with someone scratching addresses off a typed list with a ballpoint
emily gets in and starts the car putting on a smile
hey are you hungry
lets get some lunch
what kind of food do you like
theres nowhere for me to go is there
emily cant lie
she turns off the engine and leans back with a sigh
lucys silence is a plea for rescue
i cant lucy it wouldnt work i live in this tiny house i
im sorry im not mom material
you dont have to be my mom
just my friend
a ten year old girl stranded at a convenience store suitcase in her lap
emily stares out the windshield wrestling with her conscience
at a round table emily addresses the child welfare panel six grave faced administrators
wayne is here offering support
i know what it feels like to be that age and be unwanted
she needs to be with someone she trusts she trusts me
so much of our time is spent negotiating red tape i think if we just look at the situation this one situation this one child its clear whats best for
the head of the panel is a bloated bureaucrat in a polka dot blouse nancy
this is highly irregular and ill tell you right now it makes me very uncomfortable
but since wayne youve spoken so persuasively on miss jenningss behalf
emily comes out and nods yes to lucy who waits with a guardian
as they hug im going to go against my better judgement and approve this petition for temporary custody
emily walks lucy through the house showing her around tidying things self consciously
i like to think of it as a glass half full situation
and here is your room
they stop in the doorway
a small office in which emily has made space for a bureau and a bed
professional books and backup case files pushed aside on a shelf
lucy nods yes
wheres your family
well ive met my dad twice and my moms not a part of my life anymore
choosing her words sometimes people have kids and then decide they dont want to be parents
beneath the measured tone emilys pain is revealed raw and untouchable her entire life a rebellion against it
she opens lucys suitcase on the bed
pauses remembering something
im glad youre here
lucy comes over to help unpack the clothes
lucy in bed sipping a cup of tea as emily brushes her hair
chamomile when i get stressed out it helps me sleep
lucy nods that its good
emily brushes her hair
a natural bond between them
none of this ever should have happened if i could make it go away i would
nice moment for emily
a rare triumph
she tucks lucy in
turns off the bedside light
im right down the hall if you need me
emily pauses at the door looks back at the lost child shes taken in then closes the door halfway
emilys volvo pulls up
she eyes the house
it haunts her the memory of what happened
a sudden knock on the window makes her jump out of her seat
the guy there gestures a friendly sorry didnt mean to scare you
white shirt and tie
a court clerk
emily signs a form as he unlocks the door letting her in
i have to grab some of her things might take me a minute
i trust ya em make sure you lock it on the way out
emily closes the door glances around the dark interior
through a window she sees the court clerk drive off
its quiet eerily still
she goes up the stairway
slows noticing something on the
a faint square where a picture once was hung the wallpaper a half tone darker underneath
more squares farther up
a few nails still sticking out
tattered lace curtains sway in a draft beside a bed with a moth eaten coverlet
emily packs lucys spare clothes into a dufflebag
zips it and walks out
exiting lucys room she notes the door to edward and margarets bedroom at the far end of the hall is slightly ajar
succumbs to a natural curiosity
the door pushes open emily peering in
a sad little master bedroom with old floral printed wallpaper and water stains on the ceiling
she explores the room inspecting various personal items aftershave glasses hair brush looking for clues to their madness
an alarm clock with a cracked crystal face
she picks it up and it goes off in her hand
gives her a scare
she puts it down
sees something out the bedroom window
parts the curtains
in the backyard by the garden shed a long rectangular hole has been dug
a shallow grave filling with leaves
emilys seen enough heads for the door
but slows noticing something odd as she comes back around the bed in the wooden floor hidden under a long runner rug
emily peels back the rug and finds in the floorboards leading toward the door
something the old oak bureau perhaps
has been dragged repeatedly across the room
emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees on the back of it something even more bizarre
screwed hastily crookedly into the wood
she closes the door
slides to the big heavy bolts pauses
looks again at the bureau
slides it in front of the door a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long scratch in the hardwood
and its clear at this point what the deadbolts and bureau add up to emily stares at it
looks over at edward and margarets bed imagining them here behind this door
slides the bureau aside
opens the deadbolts
and as the door swings open she is looking straight down the hall at emily stares bewildered
abused children aged eight to thirteen sit in a circle of folding chairs
lucy among them
sometimes when our parents arent getting along its better if they dont see each other for a while thats what a restraining order does
emily looks in waiting with other parents
lucy sees her in the window and sneaks her a little wave
emily smiles and holds up a hand that says hi hon
its clear from these gestures how close theyve gotten
emily and doug walk together after session
lucy talking to other kids her age by the elevator
shes starting to come out of her shell
its good i just wish i thought it was me making the difference
emily accepts the compliment
i went by the house
i think her mom and dad were barricading themselves in their room at night
how sick is that
hatred and fear are part of the same pathology oh but i forgot you dont think theyre crazy
im coming around
as they part ways
emily pulls up in front of lucys school
big moment for lucy
lucy nods apprehensive but shes ready to face it
emily hugs her
this is your new beginning
lucy gets out
pauses on the sidewalk
i love you emily
emily touched smiles
i love you too
lucy goes up the walk
emily watches her safely into the building
emily draws grim looks as she crosses the common area
a pall hanging over the entire department
the first person she walks past says waynes looking for you
the second person
wayne wants to got it
she comes past waynes office
a coworker points over toward emilys cubicle hes there
she goes over
waynes inside grave faced looking for a file
he finds it on the shelf
a photo of eight year old diego clipped inside the cover
the boy we met earlier
whats up with diego
wayne hesitates wanting to spare her the bad news
why dont we talk in my office
tell me whats going on
we dont know why yet but
he killed his mother and father last night
emily stands there jaw on the floor
a police perimeter around a small house in a tough low income neighborhood
cops and crime scene investigators on the scene
local news media broadcasting live
a couple of news choppers hovering overhead
emily pulls up jumps out of her car
mike barron waves off the uniformed officer who moves to intercept her as she comes up the walkway to the house
sure you want to see this
with an uncertain nod she follows him inside
emily and mike barron come along the uncarpeted hallway
gets a tire iron from the garage comes back inside locks all the doors and windows kills them in their sleep
the master bedroom
had to use dental records to identify the bodies
emily looks around aghast
an eight year old did this
theres no way
i was there when they brought him in
took three guys my size to subdue him
kid was climbing the walls
barron turns to the window and wham
an attack dog hits the glass right in front of his face
barron recoils with a yelp
then embarrassed eyes the trio of battle scarred pit bulls prowling the chainlink fenced backyard
just your average american family
emily and barron come down the steps
where is he now
and no im not taking you to see him
you want to know what happened
i know what happened
i need to talk to him
mike please i care about this kid
diego martinez sitting alone in a holding cell
he sees emily approaching and immediately breaks down
emily tells the cop at the cell door let me in
he wont hurt me
the cop looks at mike barron who nods its okay
the cop opens the cell
diego looks up at her shuddering with emotion are they dead
emily gutted nods yes
diego buries his face in emilys stomach and sobs
tell me what happened
i killed my mum and dad
emily devastated trades looks with barron through the bars
doug tenderly consoles emily
has his arms around her
theyre leaning against the railing wind on their faces
every family you sit down with every day of every week is a family in crisis
those are your odds
thats the job you do
trying to beat them
wipes away her tears
the hair from her face
youre one person em
you cant save the world
i know somebody you did save
lucy on the beach below walking barefoot at waters edge hem of her dress in her hands
emily watches her and finding solace in it leans into dougs embrace and closes her eyes
the plaintive cries of seagulls overhead as emily and lucy walk along the surf at sundown emily barefoot now as well
emily nods putting on a brave face to spare lucy
its just work
lucy nods okay
they walk on in silence for a moment
why do you do it if it makes you sad
i dont know i guess
i guess maybe i want to believe families can work so i can have my own someday i dont know does that make sense
lucy nods takes her hand
they walk off up the beach together
emily days later dressed for work halves an omelet with a spatula and slides the halves onto two plates
calls to other room breakfast
theres no answer
emily goes to get her
stops in the doorway
honey breakfa sees lucy hide something under her pillow
emily comes over brow arched playful
come on let me see
lucy guiltily eyes the floor
emily lifts the pillow
underneath it is a photograph
she looks at lucy then at the filing cabinet from which it was taken
more surprised than upset
you went through my things
i wanted to know what happened to you
emilys gaze falls to the photo
she sits down on the bed with it
is that your mom
emily nods lost in the image
its a photo that captures her entire childhood
emily and her mother sitting on the steps of a house together but apart like a lost child that sat down next to a pretty stranger who hasnt yet noticed
emilys ten year old face shows the quiet sadness of the disconnect
reminds you of a child from her caseload
she used to just leave shed just
and i never knew when she was coming back or if she was
i used to think it was my fault and i would try so hard when she got home to be good do everything i could think of so shed think
i was special and stay next time or take me with her but
it didnt matter shed always go away again thats how it was
emily fights her emotions and practiced at the task wins
lucy sits beside her on the bed
understands her deeply
linked by their pasts
where was your dad
gone he left before i was born
first time i met him i was like thirteen
whatd you say to him
oh i had all these things i was gonna say
angry things id thought of and kind of memorized
and then i met him and i wasnt angry i was just sad and i told him
pauses raw emotion i said i love you even if you dont love me
emily smiles a pained smile and then buries the memory
lucy a portrait of contrition are you mad at me
no im not mad at you
puts her arm around her but i need you not to do that again okay
go through my private things without asking
lucy nods okay
emily moves on with a loving touch omelets getting cold
emily eyes the photo a moment longer then stands and puts it away in the filing cabinet
she pauses feeling exposed and turns the little key to lock the drawers
emily stops at her cubicle registering a surprise
wayne handing her case files to three coworkers
awkward moment for everyone
i need another set of eyes to go over them make sure we havent missed anything else
you mean to make sure i havent missed anything else
its just a legal thing
youll have them back tomorrow
she goes in and stares at the bare shelf above her desk
her caseload gone
more than an insult
everything she cares about
a pink phone message on her keyboard
she picks it up mike barron called
newspaper headline insanity defense for glendale couple
mugshots of edward and margaret below
the morning edition folded on a table between barron and emily
theyre drinking coffee
you watch six months their lawyer will hire some expert to say theyre rehabbed and theyll sue for custody when they get out
shes not going back there ill take her out of state before i let them near her again
i didnt hear you say that
emily knows shes misspoken but lets it stand
you wanted to talk about something
barron nods sips his coffee a bit uncomfortable
we pulled the martinezes phone records
they got a call that night before the murders
emily the call came from your house
look im not accusing you of anything i just need to know what was said
i might have called the week before
im talking to you as a friend here you know that right
did you not hear me
im telling you mike as a friend i did not call that family
then who did
go find the guy who broke in and just happened to dial the number of a kid whose case you handle
emily starts to say something but stops as a confounding realization comes to her
and then to barron
lucy sits on the sofa studying a photo of diego
emily sits beside her her advocate
hes in my group
puts down photo why did something happen
emily nods yes
barron gently mindful of lucys age were trying to figure out why
he got a call thursday night from this number
im just wondering if he might have said anything
it wasnt me
you didnt call him
lucy shakes her head
barron nods okay then speaking to her as a father might his own daughter
lucy its hard sometimes to tell the truth but i know you will because youre a good little girl
i am telling the truth
my backup files are in your room
diegos is in there
maybe you got curious and went through some dialed a number
it wasnt me i swear
emily nods okay wanting to believe but remembering the stolen photograph
the call was at am are you ever up that late
i didnt call him
are you ever up that late
mike she said no
maybe someone made a mistake
barron reads emilys posture and disengages stands to go
yeah maybe so
exiting barron tells emily as gently as possible shes lying
and goes down the steps
emily closes the door
turns around and theres lucy
do you believe me
i believe you
lucy hugs her and emily hugs her back but shes still thinking about what barron said
a photo of emily and diego tacked to the corkboard panel beside her desk
emily sits contemplating it
her gaze goes from the photo to the bare shelf above her desk
her caseload is still missing
this is bullshit
emily walks in power pose
give me back my cases or fire me
wayne caught unprepared eating a doughnut
caseload restored emily is multi tasking opening mail sorting backlogged paperwork talking on the phone i dont care if its a hairline fracture he broke her arm i dont want
him back in that house
he found christ
well he should have found him sooner
doug leans in the doorway drops a manila envelope in her in box
and a computer printout
copy of the sheridans psych evals for the file
and the cognitive profile lucy did for me the other day
re lucys profile hows it look
but his tone suggests otherwise
do i have to beg or are you gonna tell me whats going on
you have to beg
coming from an environment like that testing this normal is a bit abnormal if that makes any sense
shes abnormally normal
i think she faked it gave the answers she thought she should
why would she do that
shes ashamed of who she is
ashamed of how she feels
afraid nobody would want her if they saw the real her
off emilys reaction its no big deal it just means i might have to push her a little
no i know i just
the martinezes got a call thursday night
from my house
did you ask her about it
she said she didnt
mike thinks shes lying
what do you think
i dont know what to think
bring her in after work ill do a one on one
i wanted to talk to her about this anyway
emily alone in her cubicle scans the test results with growing concern
diego eating macaroni and cheese from a jailhouse tray
emily sets a folded blanket on the bed as she sits down to talk to him
got you an extra in case it gets cold
diego nods without looking up
i need to ask you something
about the night it happened
did you get a call really late
diego stops eating
stares at his food
shakes his head no warily like someone might be listening
he shakes his head no
still staring at his food
diego i know you did they called from my house
diego puts down his fork his fear obvious now his breathing quick and shallow
whats the matter
whats scaring you
he looks at emily terrified starts hyperventilating
emily tries to calm the panicked boy as he gasps for air a horrible wheezing sound in his throat
youll be okay
yelling down hall can somebody help us down here
a little two bed infirmary with unpainted cinder block walls
diego in bed on an iv drip
emily talking to a nurse by the check in desk
he asked to see you before you left
emily comes over to diegos bed
he holds her gaze in silence a secret hes afraid to tell
emily speaks at a whisper as if to make the truth less frightening who called you
was it lucy
diegos pulse accelerates on the ekg monitor
he gives a trembling nod
did she say something to you
something that scared you
diego replies in spanish barely discernible his throat raw el dijo
what do you mean he said
diego looks at her confused terrified
his racing pulse a jagged green line above the bed
era un hombre
a chill goes through emily
it was a man
diego gives another trembling nod
emily beside him baffled and a bit scared
after hours the office is empty half lit and eerily still
emily is photocopying at a work station haunted by what diego said the harsh upward light accentuating her tense features
the cyclical squeaking noise we hear is lucy in emilys cubicle in the b
turning herself in circles on the office chair
something very creepy about the disappearance and reappearance of that pale watchful face
finished emily walks back to her cubicle thrown by the sight of lucy spinning in the chair walking head on into that eerie intermittent gaze
emily unnerved enters the cubicle
well photocopying isnt much fun
lucy stops turning stares at her sensing something
lucy just stares
doug appears in the doorway
sorry im late guys
lucy nods and gets up from the chair
go ahead down ill be right there
lucy heads down the hall to the conference room
you all right
this is weird
diego said it was lucy that called but he called her a he he said it was a man
his face what
emily nods yes
dougs brow arches then furrows
he turns and heads down the hall
doug sits opposite lucy at the table keeps it easygoing despite what hes just been told
so hows school
any of your classmates giving you a hard time
no theyve been nice
thats not really what you want to talk about is it doug
you got me
opens his file
takes out her cognitive assessment profile
lays it flat on the table
question a are you afraid of the dark
you answered no
question b are you afraid of being alone
c are afraid of your parents
you answered no to everything in that section
i think some of those should have been yesses
everybody is afraid of something
working through our fears conquering them is how we get better
so i want you to tell me
what scares you
lucy steeples her fingers and rests her chin on top regards doug with a look of frank appraisal
it is the face of a child but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence
ill tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you
doug did not see this coming
when i was twelve i was climbing a tree and i accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets nest
they didnt like it
i got stung over a hundred times
they had to rush me to the hospital
ive been afraid of hornets ever since
dont climb many trees either
everybody has fears
now what scares you
you scare yourself
why what about yourself scares you
i have bad thoughts
people in general or certain people
you have bad thoughts about me
i just do
was there something i said or did that upset you
shakes her head its just the way you are
how am i
she nods yes do you even know what that means
often lacking sincerity or depth
youre smug too
want me to tell you what that means
doug skewered by a ten year old
a boyish shyness emerges a relic from his own youth
well if um if i seemed smug or facile i want to dont apologize
youre a grown up its embarrassing
should we talk about school now
my grades are getting a lot better
doug just stares at her
waiting until lucy is out of earshot down the hall doug confers with emily by the water cooler
hes sweating shaken by the encounter
talked to a lot of ten year olds i dont think ive ever felt like that before
i know a specialist ill call him in the morning
what do i do with her in the meantime
doug pauses no idea smiles an eerie smile
dont let her get in your head
his paranoia feeding emilys
in the hush she hears that faint cyclical squeaking
looks across the darkened office to her cubicle where lucy is turning circles in her chair again
emily barely touching hers
lucy absently but with an almost surgical precision is cutting peas in the knife
she stops self conscious looks at emily across the table
are you mad at me
want me to brush your hair
are you sure
some other time
it will make you feel better
ill get the brush
i said no thank you
lucy stares at emily for a moment then sits again
and its strange her posture seems subtly different stiffer bonier as if all her muscles have drawn taut under her clothes
in a voice at once innocent and menacing doug said something didnt he
he says youre doing great
what did he tell you
lucy stares at her seeing through the facade
then oddly bright taking a bite of food youre funny
emily silhouetted in the doorway keeping her distance as she get some rest
she starts to close the door
you forgot to kiss me goodnight
a tense pause then emily walks over and kisses her on the forehead
lucy clutches her wrist as she turns to go
i love you
emily trapped forces a tender smile
i love you too
lucys eyes gleam in the darkness
she turns onto her side for sleep but those eyes dont shut even after emily has walked out and closed the door behind her
football highlights on a liquid plasma tv
doug flipping through a dsm iv diagnostic manual
the phone rings
he picks up distracted scanning the dsm index
a strange intermittent static buzz on the line
a telecommunications glitch
try again sorry
he hangs up
finds the chapter hes looking for
anti social personality type
but he hears it again now bzzzzzzzzt bzzzzzzzzzt louder deeper and realizes in quiet terror that its coming from inside his ear
doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a q tip
wiggles it around in his ear and when he takes it out theres a sitting on the cottony tip scissoring its wings
doug stares in disbelief
he throws the q tip in the toilet
hits the flush lever
watches the hornet spiral away
stares at the empty bowl
did i just imagine that
shaken he turns to the sink
wedges his head under the tap and runs water into his ear
straightens and looks at himself in the mirror toweling his face trying to impose rational thought on the situation
but as the water spills from his ear down his neck onto his shirt it brings with it two more live hornets half drowned
with a yelp doug swipes them from his shirt
crushes them underfoot
terrified but clinging to rational thought a moment longer he turns his head sideways to the mirror parts his hair and sees another hornet crawl from the ear canal followed
by six or rationality goes out the window
he flails at them with the towel
swats them dead
picks them up and drops them in the toilet
studies the last one for a moment
its little legs twitching
drops it in
a false respite
and a brief one
because as the flushing noise fades he can hear an ominous deep buzzing sound rising
its coming from behind him
he turns to have a look
but its strange the buzzing is still behind him
with dawning horror doug turns and checks his back in the mirror sees
whimpering like a child he undoes the buttons of his shirt taking it off as delicately as possible
slipping his arms gently from the sleeves
holding it by the collar he takes two quick steps and tosses it in the shower
slams the glass door seals the crack with towels
and watches the hornets fly around in the glass enclosure buzzing furiously bouncing off the glass
but as he backpedals he realizes the furious buzzing is too close too loud and too deep to be coming from the shower over there
a sharp pain in his head confirms it
he groans and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens inside
the buzzing in his right ear spreads to his left louder angrier its sources multiplying
disoriented he stumbles backwards with an agonizing scream
catches sight of himself in the mirror the terror of the moment on his face
this cant be happening
and now the nightmare takes a devilish turn
looking at himself in the mirror he sees doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it trying to shake away the madness inside
but the hornets keep coming coughed up in clumps as he gasps for air
theyre all over him stinging his tongue his eyes
he goes berserk and starts smashing his head against the wall the door the edge of the sink anything he can find opening a deep gash in his forehead smashing
it harder and harder because the buzzing wont stop cracking his skull screaming hysterically pitching his head violently forwards and backwards like some demon possessed heavy metal fanatic
its a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when with one particularly violent head jerk he snaps his own neck crack
he sinks to the floor head askew astonished look on his face
and there he sits paralyzed eyes locked on the tv in the living room where football highlights play in silence
fully conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears nose and mouth a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore them
emily exits a counseling room
says goodbye to a young see you next week
and comes down the hall toward the common area
a coworker stands from an adjacent cubicle
he had an appointment with one of my kids this morning never showed up
did you try calling him
all i get is voicemail
emily dials doug on a fax phone by the xerox machine
on the hey this is doug here it comes beep
she hangs up
a dark thought sends her toward the exit calling back to denise cover my desk
emily knocking on the door of his marina del rey townhouse
doug its me its emily
she comes down the steps to his car walks past it and then stops noticing the window is open a crack
slipping her hand inside stretching she extends one finger just far enough to push the button on the garage door remote clipped to the sunvisor
up the drive the door starts to open
a door in the first floor hallway opens
emily steps in
she comes up the stairs into the living room
the tv is still on
calls up the next flight of stairs
doug you here
she goes up the stairs and down the hall and checks the bedroom
the bed unmade
its when she turns from the room to go back downstairs that she sees him with stoic grief emily walks down the cold fluorescently lit corridor intercepts a coroner as
he exits the exam room
he looks at her pale bespectacled a bit standoffish
you did the autopsy on doug winters
trying to remember winters oh right douglas
how did he die
preempting his reply i know the rules please he meant a lot to me
her face the proof
he indicates his adjoining office
they go in
he takes the autopsy report from a filing cabinet
reviews his findings
compression fracture of the third and forth vertebrae
severed his spinal cord
actual cause of death was
youre saying he did that to himself
it appears all his injuries were self inflicted yes
oh come on
he looked like hed been beaten to death
dont tell me he was some some suicidal
i knew him
he was my best friend
she turns away crying
miss i would never presume to know your friend better than you
but the injuries suggest he was trying to hurt himself
unfortunately he succeeded
i am sorry
emily composing herself gives a quiet nod
she has no quarrel with this man
have you ever seen this before somebody dying like this
the coroner files the report world weary
truly i am shocked every day by the violence people do to themselves
winters etched in granite
a final prayer read by a priest as he is laid to rest
a breeze ruffles the clothes of the mourners
blows hair across emilys haunted face
lucy at her side sees her grief and reaches for her hand
instinctively emily retracts it
lucy registers the slight the wider implications
emily watches the coffin descend
she weeps openly
emily red eyed driving home sees something in her peripheral vision that sends a chill through her
lucy gazing quietly out the passenger side window is swinging her legs in that contented way children do
a small but telling detail
immediately her legs stop swinging sensing emilys stare
and with her head still turned away you think its my fault dont you
she turns to face emily who measures her words
it was an accident
it was nobodys fault
lucy holds her gaze
then as if to test her reaches again for emilys hand
trapped in the lie emily has to let her
and as she drives on in that private hell holding hands with lucy
emily an emotional wreck confides in barron
he was scared
he came out of that room with her mike and he was scared
he said she threatened him
youre still in shock
lets diego said it was a man on the phone
you know who made that call
there was no one else in the house
off his look you think i dont know how crazy this sounds
look i dont know all im saying is a kid in his state of mind maybe isnt the most reliable witness
why is he in that state of mind
why was doug
pull my phone records
see if she called him
i already did
there were no calls from your house
emilys argument collapses
she sits there for a moment vexed her intellect telling her one thing her gut another
she gets up to go
pauses at the door
her mother and father their bedroom door has these deadbolts on it big ones two of em
something came through that door and they didnt want it ever coming through there again
emily digs through her in box spilling things on the floor
finds the manila envelope doug gave her
rips it open
dumps the contents into her hand
typed on the label sheridan marg
on a television margaret sheridan sits facing the camera responding to the questions of an unseen interviewer
her haunted face and frank tone make the interview chilling
and by forcing your daughter into the oven can you tell me what did you think the outcome would be
you mean what were we doing it for
to kill her
pulling back we see emily alone in a dimmed conference room watching the tape
and why was it gods will that you should kill your daughter
an eerie smile comes to margarets face
why is that funny margaret
cause shes not my daughter
youre her mother
i bore her but shes not mine
help me understand
if you and edward are lucys biological parents how can she not be yours
cause shes not of us
not of you
who is she of
not who what
what is she of
stop acting like you dont know what im talking about
stares at him
her eyes black and unblinking
you think your daughter is the devil
not him himself of him working in his name in his honor
i dont care what you call it
and why do you think that
not what i think its what i know
how do you know this
could you give me an example
seeming afraid for the first time
some secrets perhaps best left untold
she can make you see things
visions of what
whatever youre afraid of
any other special abilities
people die around her is that a special ability
she kills people
not by her hand they just die
i had two brothers brent and travis
margarets voice falters
overcome by grief she dissolves into tears
its a side of her weve never seen
and i mean they was healthy boys healthy as can be
eddie three sisters
soon as she was born they started dying
you blame lucy for their deaths
margaret nods yes wiping her eyes
unaccustomed to crying in front of strangers
why do you imagine you were spared
i guess she couldnt get rid of us till she found somebody else
now that she has i dont imagine were long for this world
close up on margaret face streaked with tears her pain deep and undeniable
video of edward sheridan in a violent rage
pushing his chair back from the interview table he stands screaming through clenched teeth his broken jaw wired shut edward please calm a pair of orderlies rush in to restrain
the camera gets knocked ajar in the struggle
the tape ends as they take edward screaming to the floor
and thats the interview
emily stares at the blank blue screen transfixed lowers her gaze to the table
theres a photo tucked inside the psychiatric file
edward and margaret in happier times young bible camp counselors in t shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest
the year they met perhaps
she holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before and after comparison
the transformation of their faces is shocking
emily sits frozen by the realization edward and margaret sheridan
an old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital
emilys volvo goes up the winding tree lined drive
unfortunately mrs sheridan suffered a rather severe psychotic episode last night
emily and the chief psychiatrist walk down a dark institutional corridor
woke up screaming absolutely convinced she was on fire
she wasnt of course they managed to sedate her
but its curious she displays all the symptoms of a burn patient
except the burns themselves
emily peers through a little square of reinforced glass
a padded cell
margaret strapped to a bed
writhing in pain
laboring to breathe
in no condition for visitors as you can see
if youd like i could let you see mr sheridan
emily hesitates afraid of him
she casts a departing glance through the window and shudders to see that margarets roaming eyes have locked on her in a hollow stare
restrained in a straitjacket edward is brought in by two orderlies who seat him at a table opposite emily and then exit
jaw wired everything he says is spoken through clenched teeth
i know im probably the last person you want to see right now but youre
his stare unnerves her
she stops and collects herself
youre the only one i can talk to
lucys been staying with me who died
emily falls silent
her voice cracks with emotion
edward nods yup
regards her in silence
emily speaks or tries to just to fill that awful void
emily skewered again nods yes
you oughta be
she meets his gaze
and there is eye contact true understanding
you judged us before you ever walked in that house
sat there in our living room tellin us about our problems how to be better parents certain of everything and dead wrong about all of it
ask what you came to ask
after a moment
what is she
its a question edward has asked himself once or twice
he leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost casual air
can tell you what shes not
she not a daughter of mine
shes not a ten year old having trouble in school
shes not some innocent victim whose door you busted down and life you saved
and shes not going no place lady till shes good and done with you
done with me how
however she wants
you think its an accident her ending up with you
she saw you coming a mile away
i dont have anything
you have that youre good
thats what she feeds on
bleeds ya dry moves onto the next
we were a big family she went through us like a wrecking ball
and you know every time something happened every time we had an excuse for why it wasnt her fault
cuz its easier to lie to yourself than think bad things about your baby girl
but finally we got to a point where me and maggy looked at each other remembers so clearly where we looked at each other and we was out of lies
both of us
most terrifying moment of our lives
and thats where you are now
emily silently registering this truth
ill tell you this
she sees everything
and what she doesnt see she just sort of senses it like when you call a friend and they pick up before it rings
only time you got the upper hand is when shes sleepin but she almost never does
we checked on her every night for three months
every twenty minutes up and down those stairs
first time she slept was the night you kicked in my front door
after a moment what does she want
what your idea of hell is
and make you live there
emily sits in haunted silence
edwards features soften
im not a hateful man
i look at you and i wish i could tell you youre through the worst of it
that its gonna work out for you in the end
i wish i could
what should i do
a pitying smile reveals edwards wired teeth
how strongs your faith
nancy the bloated director from the custody panel walking briskly down a corridor
emily calls to her from behind approaching
emily i heard about doug
im so sorry
do you have a minute
nancy glances at her watch nods okay a minute
emily and nancy enter the lavish office
hows it working out with the sheridan girl
actually thats why im here
i appreciate what you did for me nancy i really do but i think itd be best if she was placed in foster care
i know but its not working out
playing mommy isnt the laugh a minute you were hoping huh
i suppose not
nancy nods not entirely surprised
sorry you petitioned for custody you got it
shes your responsibility
till we find a suitable foster home
how long is that going to take
youre asking me questions you know the answer to
three to six weeks
surely you can manage that long
i dont want her anymore
now you look
i put my reputation quite possibly my career on the line for you
dont embarrass me
you make this work
how do i make it work if its not working
find a way
a clerk stops in an aisle hands emily a deadbolt from a shelf
that what youre looking for
he walks off
emily weighs the deadbolt in hand
puts it down and picks up the next larger size
grabs a second one just to be safe
a third for good measure
with urgency emily removes all her backup files from the shelf in lucys room
dropping them in bankers boxes
stops on diegos
eyes his photo
drops it in
grabs the office phone boxes it with the files
emily unplugs the phone in the kitchen
unplugs the one by the sofa
opens the closet and tosses the phones inside with the bankers boxes she put there
closes the door
hides the key
just then a flashing red light draws her gaze to the window stopping at the end of the block
emily crosses to the window watching as gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house
sensing emilys stare she stops and meets it
waves testing the waters
emily waves back but its a hollow gesture
lucys smile fades knowing this as she continues toward the house
in a sudden panic emily goes into the kitchen grabs one of the knives
eyes the blade forced to contemplate the unthinkable its use as a weapon self defense
she comes into the living room holding it
catches sight of herself in the mirror
a jarring image sweet emily jennings with a butchers knife in her hand
the sound of lucys footsteps on the front steps breaks the spell
emily hides the knife behind the fish tank
no good you can see it through the glass
we hear lucys key in the lock
emily grabs the knife
its in her hand as the door clicks open until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa pillow
a ten year old home from school
emily returns a plastic smile
you werent there so i took the bus
sorry work lost track of time
its okay i know how busy you are
emily watches unnerved as lucy crosses to the sofa to the very pillow where she hid the butchers knife and sits down to untie her shoes
the point of the knife is almost touching her leg
if she moves at all it will cut the skin
doesnt matter anyway the bus stops right at the end of the street
so i can always get home whether youre there or not
lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow or appears to but she is actually looking at the end table
wheres the phone
oh it wasnt working
lucy nods oh
finishes untying her shoes then gets up and walks into the kitchen checks the wall turns to emily
that one too
emily caught in a lie says nothing
can i have a shower
we had gym today
lucy heads into the bathroom
pauses at the door back turned
are they being nice to her
she turns for emilys reaction
how how would i know that
i thought you said you were going to see her
i never said that
a bewilderment that seems genuine
i must have dreamt it
goes into the bathroom
closes the door
ear pressed to the bathroom door emily listens to the running water lucy taking a shower
she goes to the closet unlocks it
grabs one of the phones
it sounds like emilys voice is coming from the fridge until we sweep past it to see her crouching by a phone jack in the corner
i dont care robin anywhere
just find somewhere that will take her
i dont want this girl in my house
emily unplugs the phone
and just then hears a soft breath behind her
hair dripping wet
a chilling stare
how much did she hear
lucy walks out
we hear her bedroom door close
emily crouched in the corner holding the phone terrified at the thought of whats in store
the head of a turning screw emily installing a deadbolt on her door in the middle of the night
its the third lock the other two already in place
hands trembling she lines up the last screw
it slips from her fingers
rolls under the door
she cracks opens the door
reaches to grab it and lets out a shriek recoiling standing just outside her door
she hands it back to emily making no overt acknowledgement of it
she walks down the hallway to her bedroom
as soon as lucys door closes emily closes hers and goes back to work doublespeed
winds that last screw into the wood and then slides to the heavy bolts
scooting backwards she sits against the bed wide eyed with terror screwdriver clutched in her fist like a stabbing weapon
a bell tolls in a steeple
down below emily is going against the tide walking up the steps past churchgoers who are coming down after morning mass
halfway up she runs into mike barron and his wife and son
its awkward more for her than him
sitting on a bench in a park that occupies the shadow of the old stone church emily and mike talk privately
his wife pushing his young son on a playground swing
no such thing as a bad kid only bad parents
i always believed that
its a lie
her parents arent crazy
you wanna end up where they did keep talking like this
off her look im not judging you
youre grieving for doug and youre still confused about what diego did
diego grew up in a bad home he saw violence and he repeated it thats the cycle you know that better than anyone
why did she lie about calling him
cause shes a liar that doesnt mean she made him do it
look let me tell you what lucy is
lucy is a damaged child a deceitful child a manipulative child
but a damaged deceitful manipulative child is not a demon
ask my brother in law hes got a couple of em
barron stands from the bench
mike you know im not crazy
dont run away from something just because it scares you
his concern edges toward sadness
he indicates the church
i stopped you on the steps
i think maybe you oughta go all the way in
walks off to rejoin his wife and son
emily alone on a bench in the shadow of a church
the circle of abused children
lucy among them a happy participant
nancy filling in for doug
its emilys pov as she spies on lucy through the window second guessing herself for a moment
session over nancy dismisses the group with a smile and theatrical applause
emily watches lucy cross the room
at the coat rack she whispers something to another girl
the veil of lucys hair partially obscures her profile but through that veil emily sees something chilling
for a moment a moment so fleeting it might just be a trick of the eyes emily draws a sharp inward breath
lucy feeling emilys stare now turns to meet it
her sweet innocent girl lips widening into a smile
but emily knows what she saw
she throws open the door and rushes in
grabs lucy by the arm and yanks her bodily from the room
this to the amazement of nancy the other children and to the shock of the other parents waiting outside
nancy comes after her in a fury
runs her down
who do you think you are barging in there like that
i dont want her in group anymore i dont want her around the other kids
well thats not your decision is it
emily opens her mouth to reply but lucy beats her to the punch
its okay nancy emilys been under a lot of stress lately but shes really nice to me and i hope i can stay with her a really long time
nancy disarmed by the glowing praise turns back to emily
well talk about this later
see you next week nancy
nancy doesnt hear busily reassuring parents damage control
emily and lucy arrive at the elevator
emily hits the button
youre never going back there
emily says nothing
lucy keeps asking the same question in the exact same intonation as emily ignores her why emily
the doors open
emily and lucy step in
the door closes
lucy continuing her verbal assault as they start to descend why emily
suddenly the elevator lurches to a violent stop
it buckles emilys knees
she is terrified practically hyperventilating
w w whats happening
lucy has gotten her attention
can i go back to group next week
youre never going back there
lucy looks at her as one regards a small dumb animal
then looks up at the ceiling
are you sure
horror as emily realizes what shes thinking
we hear the first cable snap above them
in the creaking hush that no
the second cable snaps
the elevator goes into a hellish the acceleration is dizzying
emily clutches the rail with both hands screaming as the elevator goes cannonballing down the shaft
lucy indifferent as they plummet toward certain death
the floor indicator light races toward l the car shuddering violently the noise deafening
its a horrible way to die
emily closes her eyes in anticipation of impact
and in the sudden blackness theres no noise at all
just a soft a breathless pause then emily opens her eyes
and sees the elevator is no longer falling
the doors glide open to the first floor lobby
lucy gives her a quiet look and strolls out
a businessman steps into the elevator watching bewildered as emily releases her white knuckled grip on the railing and staggers out so badly shaken she can barely stand
fish swim languidly in the tank
its after midnight
were looking down the darkened hall at emilys closed bedroom door
emily in a coat and shoes packing a suitcase
snaps it quietly shut
looks over at the barricaded door
draws a tense breath
from down the hall we hear the deadbolts slide quietly open
the door opens a crack
emilys terrified face peers out
making sure the hall is empty
she steps out suitcase in hand
tiptoes down the hall
quietly as possible as she comes past lucys door
its open a crack
the room pitch black inside
emily steps closer breath held
peers in through the little crack
sees but suddenly her eyes snap open
her face horizontal on the pillow
i can see you
emily backs away
goes quickly to the front door
emily throws the suitcase in the trunk
slams it shut
comes around to the drivers side door
closes the door
and gets the scare of her life
emily recoils with a scream throwing her body against the window behind her
lucy sits there silent betrayed
its too much for emily
she breaks down
buries her face in her hands and sobs
lucy after a moment takes a brush from emilys bag and starts lovingly brushing her hair
emily slowly lifts her head resigning herself to this latest horror
she sits zombie like behind the wheel tears streaming as lucy tugs gently at the snarls playing mommy
dont be sad
this is your new beginning
unopened mail and new case files piling up
emily looks terrible phone to ear getting screamed at sworn at interrupted every time she tries to speak
mrs lynch i told you will you let thats not what i said no i did not you never sent me the mrs lynch will you let me respond
will you let me mrs lynch will you let emily cant take it anymore
slams the phone down
sits there looking rather dazed
wayne arrives dazed in a different way having overheard
um so i notice you havent taken any personal days
come on you look like crap go home
emily levels a withering stare
i dont want to go home
emily knocking on a door in an outside hallway
its the girl from the bar
not expecting her
emily disheveled five days without sleep doing her best to appear rational
i know i havent been a great friend lately but
do you think maybe i could crash here for a couple of nights
tonight and tomorrow
becca draws air through her teeth pained by her predicament
em any other weekend you know id say yes but i just met this guy and hes coming over tonight like for the night and it might be you know
and theres nothing more to be said
the trees thrashing outside the window backlit by a streetlight cast ominous shadows on the walls of the bedroom
emily huddles in the corner wrapped in a blanket clutching the screwdriver
there is a knock on the bedroom door
emilys eyes jerk wide open
she looks at the door but doesnt answer
after a moment lucys voice innocent afraid emily
can i come in
emily says nothing
theres another knock
a little louder
i know youre in there please
emily says nothing
lucy starts pounding on the door
emily listening barely breathing
is that it
is she gone
and then suddenly wham
the pounding turns violent practically shaking the door off its hinges
far too violent for a little girl
emily wedges herself into the corner absolutely petrified
there is something very strong and very angry on the other side of that door shrieking in the voice of a child wham wham wham wham wham wham
the door getting absolutely pummeled looking like it might splinter from the force
and its so intense that its almost surreal what emily is seeing
lucys voice eerily monotone the words coming inhumanly fast like some auctioneer from hell let me in let me in let me in let me in let me in let
me in let me in let me in let me in let me in
until she cant take it anymore
and she screams as loud as she can half cursing half begging the veins standing out in her neck and the pounding stops dead
all we hear is the rain drumming on the roof
and emilys quick terrified breaths as she stares at the door wondering whats next
but theres nothing
just the shadows dancing on the walls
it appears the nightmare is over for now
but not quite
a sudden clunk in the closet makes her jump
her head snaps around what was that
she just stares unable to breathe because whatever she just heard is inside her room
white knuckled grip on that screwdriver emily stands up and comes slowly over to the closet door
raises the screwdriver
ready to stab
takes hold of the door handle
slowly turns it
opens the door
pitch black inside
a tense pause as she stares into that blackness then reaches a hand into the closet feeling around for the pull string
gives it a tug
and there right in front of her is a vision of unspeakable horror twitching spasmodically in a hospital gown
hideously she comes at emily arms flailing clumsy with rage and dementia
emily leaps aside and margaret goes careening into the furniture howling and spinning like some crazed whirling dervish
emily scrambles over the bed
reaches the door
fumbles at the deadbolt
here comes margaret
at the last second emily gets the door open
tears a path down the dark hallway
margaret right behind her hideous reeling hitting the walls with her flailing arms
emily throws open the front door
dashes from the house into the abandoned street
running in the rain
margaret comes crashing out of the house chasing her down the middle of the street
emily sees a city bus parked up ahead
makes a run for it
a metro transit bus idling along the curb
the driver with his feet up between shifts reading a porno mag
emily comes running up to the door
pounds frantically on the glass
the driver meets eyes with her through the door
more pounding from emily
let me on
the driver points to the sign above the door out of service
emily near hysterics at this point
margaret closing in fast
the driver sighs weighing his obligations
emily spins back to the door
margaret nearly upon her ten feet away five four
the driver opens the door
emily dives backwards onto the bus the door snapping closed in front of her just as margaret lunges for her throat
theres nobody out there
there is nobody out there
it sinks in the second time
emily scans the sidewalk the darkened streets outside the bus
margaret is gone
was never there
the driver opens the door nods to her out
with a hydraulic hiss the bus releases its brakes and diesels off down the empty street
emily stands alone
staring at her house down the block
the silhouette of a child in the window
wayne and his boyfriend shake rain off an umbrella as they cross the darkened office
re the office space no i like it
its like those things they put baby cows in to make veal the boyfriend slows as they go past a cubicle
saw something weird
wayne comes over pokes his head in a cubicle
head down on her desk rain soaked sleeping in her chair
waynes face darkens
is she dead
he comes over puts his hand on her shoulder
she awakens with a jolt
expecting to see margaret
she looks terrible
jesus are you okay
i had some things to catch up on
she fumbles unconvincingly at some loose paperwork
you look like shit you need to see a doctor
i saw a doctor
what did they say
they said mind your own fucking business
shocked by the outburst by her general appearance he walks away muttering to his boyfriend
emily puts her head in her hands pressing down at her temples
wayne steps into his office in the b
and grabs something then they exit
and the office is quiet again
emily closes her eyes
just then she hears a faint cyclical squeaking noise in the cubicle right next to hers
recognizes the sound
calls over the partition without moving
no reply but the squeaking continues
rising slowly from her seat scared as hell she leans over her desk and peers over the partition into the adjacent cubicle
but the office chair is turning as if someone were just playing there
emily steps slowly back
and now hears the same cyclical squeaking behind her
the opposite row
walks slowly from her cubicle
comes along the row of darkened cubicles following the sound to its source
this is the one
she looks in
emily backs away
the chair winding slowly to a stop
suddenly behind her at the far end of the office a different noise splits the silence
emily turns and stares toward the sound
the xerox machine
someone is using it
emily comes slowly down the aisle to the partitioned workstation
a torturous walk set to the rhythmic cadence of the photocopier the harsh green light sweeping across the ceiling above it again and again and again
and then it stops ejecting one final page as emily enters the workstation
and sees theres no one there
she stares at the idle machine for a moment then at the stack of copies lying upsidedown in the tray
she comes over picks them up
turns them over
the first page is a photocopy of a pair of hands pressed flat emily stares haunted
continues through the stack
successive pages show the same two hands but leaning forward into the inky blackness between them is a face its features resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass
the last page is a horrific image
a man screaming in such terror that his face appears almost deformed
the night of his death
like a snapshot from his bathroom mirror
emily shudders the stack of pages tumbling to the floor
and we see the photocopies lying on the floor are totally blank
emily leaving rushes down a corridor toward the lobby
head on a swivel
hears more squeaking behind her
she walks on
turns the corner and runs into someone unexpected
jumps back with a shriek before she realizes who it is
a ponytailed woman in her mid forties the child placement specialist emily called from home
what are you doing here so late
i tried calling you
i found someone to take lucy
theyve helped us out before
she shows emily a custody form with an attached photo emilys face darkens
under her breath oh god
whats the matter
emily stares at the unsuspecting family
lucys next victims
she fends off a wave of emotion as the full horror of her predicament hits her
then matter of factly facing that fear head on i cant
im keeping her
as emily walks off ripping the custody form to shreds robin utterly confused
emily sits opposite edward sheridan in the visiting room an odd sense of camaraderie between them
if i get rid of her if i put her into the system
she starts all over again somewhere else
cant let her stay cant let her go
that leaves you with one option
emily looks away shakes her head
i cant edward i you have to
you have to find the strength
dont you understand
thats why shes doing this
to test you
test your faith
i dont have any faith
how bout anger
got some of that
emily lowers her gaze to the table
how do i
in her sleep assuming you can
tell you what id do different
count myself dead at the outset
accept that going in and use it to my advantage
thats the one thing i dont think shed see coming someone giving up their own life to take hers
as emily registers this
middle of the night the living room is lit by the eerie glow of the fish tank
the filter humming
the fish swimming languidly
suddenly they disperse spooked by something outside the tank
the bureau has been pushed in front of the deadbolted door to form a barricade
emily lies in a fetal position on her bed exhausted but unable to sleep
she tenses at the sound of a muffled male voice in the other room
comes over to the door trying to listen
thinks she recognizes it
calls through door mike
a moment of indecision then emily tightens her grip on the screwdriver and quietly slides open the deadbolts
she comes slowly down the hall following the voice to its source stops in the living room doorway haunted
edwards psych interview playing to the empty room
hes straightjacketed sedated
talking directly to the camera
where is she now
some family somewhere
why does that concern you edward
cause you have to warn them
emily turns off the tv
immediately it switches itself back on
emily freezes realizing the room is not empty
turning she sees lucy sitting in the shadows holding the remote
lucy mutes the sound and returns emilys stare thoughtful almost empathetic
i like it here
i like you
you want me to like you dont you
the room bathed in the tvs flickering blue light
lucy is quiet for a moment
then in her innocently menacing voice explains the rules
you have to do what i say
if i say i want to go to group you have to do it
if i say i want a new dress you have to do it
if i say i want ice cream every day after school you have to do it
emily gives a haunted nod remembering a flashcut of lucy sitting between edward and margaret at the child services meeting new dress ribbon in her hair licking her ice cream
with a wicked little smile
lucy stares coldly at the television margaret speaking with the sound off
they did what i said for a while and then they stopped and started with the secrets
but they werent really secrets i guess
looks at emily because i always knew what they were thinking
she holds emilys gaze then looks back at the tv
margarets image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes
margaret straps unbuckled sits on the bed beside a young nurse who checks her temperature
done the nurse heads out
dont leave me
terror in margarets voice
its okay maggie
ill check on you later
the nurse exits
locks the door
click ka thunk
the sound of doom to margaret
she stands up looking around trembling at whats to come
her footsteps sound oddly hollow metallic on the floor
margarets pov surveying the room we see what margarets hell looks like
its not a room shes living in
with dark scorched metal walls
a bolted down bed to one side perfectly white like a practical joke
we can hear the low hiss of it filling with gas
the faint poof as it ignites beneath her
the first shimmering waves of heat rising up singeing her hair
margaret runs screaming to the door claws at the pane of glass like a madwoman
but there is no escape from the hell of her own mind
the young nurses face appears there in the window shocked by margarets insane rantings
edward dinner tray in hand going through the cafeteria line with other institutional patients
he sits down at a table and starts eating quiet lost in his thoughts
takes another mouthful of food and suddenly stops chewing noticing something very strange he lifts his gaze to edward
smiles a knowing taunting smile
then his wide wet mouth speaks in a little girls im happy youre getting the help you need daddy
edward goes berserk
launches himself across the table at the guy stabbing him in the neck with his fork
unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned
a guard rushes over
edward turns on him maniacal
as blood pools around edwards body some lunatic who witnessed the event starts to applaud
others join in
its the most excitement theyve seen all year
and as the applause spreads through the entire cafeteria
emily comes down the steps past the morning paper on the walkway
stops dead in her tracks
comes back and picks it up
at the bus stop at the end of the street lucy mingles happily with other children
she meets emilys gaze down the length of the sidewalk
smiles and waves goodbye as she gets on the school bus
emily drops the newspaper on barrons desk
the headline about edward speaks for itself
its a different mike barron than last we saw
gone is the quiet assurance
whatever happened rocked him to the core
he closes the door for privacy
theres something i want you to hear
came in at two oclock last night
you might wanna sit
barron cues a voicemail message on his phone plays it over the speaker
after a beep we hear it
a sinister male voice guttural taunting the voice of a mocking his earlier line its hard sometimes to tell the truth but i know you will cause youre a good
twenty years in the trenches cant make lieutenant
hurts doesnt it
shakes your faith sometimes
you know why they keep passing you over
do you michael
cause youre soft
soft soft soft
delirious laughter followed by a click and a dial tone
emilys mouth gapes
after a moment
she called doug
took me an extra couple of days to get your cell phone records
thats what shes been using
emily digs through her bag
reaches the bottom
no cell phone
staring into the bag voice wavering with shes taking me apart mike
she loses it for a second
barron sits in front of her on the edge of the desk
im gonna help you get to the bottom of this
re edwards photo he told me i have to kill her
barron registers that in silence
stuns her and himself by what he says next
ill help you
emily looks at him
whatever it takes
she hugs him
im gonna put beth and tim in a hotel
keep her at the house
emily buttoning her shirt after an exam
physically youre fine
hows the stress
im not sleeping i was hoping you could give me something
the doctor writes on her prescription pad
take one of these youll sleep
emily watches the pen scribble
a prescription pill bottle on the passenger seat
emily driving home glances at it with apprehension
a high rise hotel in downtown los angeles
barron saying goodbye to his wife and son sets down the overnight bags theyve packed
why wont you tell me whats going on
because i cant
turns to his son
take care of your mom
musses the boys hair and leaves
barron strides down the corridor his face reflecting the grim task ahead
his footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along a row of parked cars
a faint jangling sound stops him dead in his tracks
he turns and scans the garage behind him
its quiet eerily still
he continues onward but hears the faint jangling sound again a moment later
spins trying to place it
there it is again
closer this time
something moving hiding behind the rows of cars over there
he bends trying to get a look under the cars
cant see anything
unnerved he moves on clicks the button on his keychain remote
the lights flash on his car fifty yards away
but as he continues toward it they reveal themselves trodding into view from between the cars choke chain collars jangling around their necks
the dogs from diegos house
they sit down right in front of barrons car
its a surreal moment a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention square jawwed black eyed the kinetic calm before a predator strikes
barron draws his gun
fires a warning shot over their heads
deafeningly loud it echoes through the garage like a thunderclap
but the dogs dont move just sit there staring
barron lowers his gun
its time to get the hell out of here
he backpedals making no sudden movements gun still trained on the dogs
they watch him eyes livening with excitement one of their back legs twitching in anticipation
barron quickens his step and thats their cue
barron fires an errant shot and takes off running
but he cant match their pace the deadly trio race along the row of police cruisers closing the gap with ease
at the last second barron jumps the partition
the pit bulls crash skull first into the concrete but continue their pursuit unfazed as barron takes off up the adjoining ramp
he jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods denting the metal
the dogs jump up behind him relentless in their pursuit
jaws snapping at his heels barron takes to the car roofs the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him
he looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves
they hit him at chest height sinking teeth in his flesh
stumbling forward struggling to keep their jaws from his throat barron doesnt see whats coming
the last car
the edge of the parking garage
hes over the edge before he even understands flailing his arms for a handhold that doesnt exist
the ground far below flies up at him in a rush of acceleration
we hear a sickening thud and find barron lying face down on the pavement below blood pooling around him
clinging to life he opens his eyes and sees the trio of pit bulls sitting obediently beside him unharmed watching
but from a distance we see there is only barron
dying alone between the parked cars
no dogs anywhere in sight
emily opens the front door peers in trying not to make a sound
sees she comes closer
empty banker boxes strewn in the hall
at the far end the light is on in lucys bedroom
the door open a crack
a shaft of light spilling out into the darkened hallway
emily comes down the hallway past scattered file pages
she opens the door to lucys room
freezes in the doorway shocked by what lies before her
oh my god
photos of abused children cover the entire floor
a collage of misery
lucy is nowhere to be seen
emily comes in and starts quickly picking them up
tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a corkboard
emily pulls it out
its covered with photos from work
two of the photos are turned around
she flips them over in rapid succession
she rips all the photos from the board
photos bunched in her hands she heads for the door but hears something that stops her in her tracks a strange intermittent buzzing noise it lasts two seconds and stops
she turns around scans the room
puts down the stack of photos
there it is again sounds like a housefly trapped against a window but its bigger angrier and appears to be coming from the at the foot of lucys bed
emily crosses to it
the buzzing stops
takes hold of a corner
peels it slowly back to reveal weird
emily straightens turns
its coming from the as she approaches it the buzzing intensifies louder more agitated
pauses as she gets there terrified of what she might find the bed buzzing furiously from within
something is trapped under those blankets waiting for release
emily extends a trembling hand takes hold of the blankets and slowly rigid with fear peels them back to reveal
impossible because the buzzing is louder than ever
with a tense swallow emily realizes its coming from lower deeper within the bed between the mattress and the box spring
she slips her fingers into the crack
and slowly lifts the mattress the buzzing growing frighteningly loud as its source is exposed something hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to see what
lies below vibrating
on the viewscreen she picks it up
stares at it vibrating in her hand
presses the talk button
brings it to her ear
the low static of an open line
then a raspy male voice emily
who is this
its wayne emily i just got a call mikes dead
emily stunned barely able to speak
they dont know if he fell or what happened
emilys phone hand drops to her side in shock
from down there we hear waynes voice emily
emily are you okay
after a moment she lifts it
i have to go
on the brink of emotional collapse
her only confidante dead
just then she hears breathing from behind the open door
someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there
she crosses to it
pulls back the door and there sits quiet innocent chin on her knees
what did you do to him
lucy says nothing
emily grabs her by the arm
yanks her to her feet
after a moment he did it to himself
emily slaps her
hard across the face
knocks her to the floor
lucy sits up lip split
tastes the blood with her tongue
hint of a smile
the taste of victory
the moons of jupiter
we got back our astronomy tests today
its there on the floor
a well done lucy
theres a loud beep in the other room
lucy gets up and walks out
emily watches as lucy goes into the kitchen
takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave
empties it into a bowl
sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv remote watching it like nothing ever happened
emily walks over and pitches the tv onto the floor
the screen shatters
get out of my house
lucy unimpressed expressionless takes another handful of popcorn
emily swats the bowl from her hands
flicking bits of popcorn off herself lucy stands up from the sofa
her face catches the light from the hallway
emily shudders at the sight
lucys features look altered somehow sharpened
its subtle but the overall effect is chilling
the face of a dont yell at me
my mom and dad used to yell at me
emily backs away mortified takes off down the hall
slams the door
bolts the deadbolts
moment of panic
will they hold
slides her bureau in front of the door
shoves her bed in front of the bureau just to be sure
in the silence we hear lucys footsteps coming down the hall toward the door
theres nothing else to block the door with
emily backs away trembling as lucys footsteps arrive at the door
a tense silence
i didnt mean to
emily grabs the screwdriver clutches it in both hands
can i come in so we can talk and work it out
theres a gentle knock on the door
emily flinches remembering last time
stay away from me
dont be mad
i said i was sorry
ill brush your hair for you
the door shudders from a mammoth impact
last time it shook the door this time it shakes the entire wall
emily recoils dropping the screwdriver
cracks appear in the door as it bows from the tremendous force
cracks fan out into the plaster around the doorframe
half the screws holding the hinges fly from the wall
the deadbolts bending from the ungodly pummeling
the deadbolt screws getting yanked from the wood
emily frozen in terror watching
whatevers out there is coming in
one of the door hinges rips clean from the wall
the first deadbolt comes flying off
the second door hinge gone
another deadbolt flies off
the door splits down the center
the third deadbolt lands on the floor at emilys feet with a metal thud
a breathless silence
then the door rattles and drops loose from the frame with a nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the bed
and now they both start to slide backwards as whatever is on the other side starts pushing its way in
emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes back with every ounce of strength she can muster but its no use
the bureau overturns crashes to the floor
emilys bare feet slide backwards along with the bed
and then they stop
the barricade sufficiently breached
emily in her panic makes a hasty decision
she hides under the bed
we hold low on the open door as lucys feet step into the room the feet of a child but the breathing we hear sounds emphysemic and the voice is
unquestionably male harsh guttural taunting emily as it comes for her emily
wide eyed with terror under the bed she watches those feet pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade
we need to learn healthier ways of resolving conflict emily
the feet step gingerly past the overturned bureau
most families dont even know they have a problem
the feet stop at the screwdriver
until its too late
a hand reaches down and picks it up a girls hand but the fingers as they wrap tightly around the handle look strong and sinewy
the feet stand motionless for a moment then turn and come toward the bed stopping right in front of emilys horrified a pause and then still from emilys pov we
see lucy lower herself onto her knees
with shocking force that hand impales the another pause then both hands come into view palms flat on the hardwood as she leans her head down
emily recoiling in anticipation as the face comes into view a little girl
with a little girl voice to match
what are you doing you silly pumpkinhead
emily hyperventilating stares in shock
lucy reaches her hand in
emily backs away wedges herself in the corner
you dont want me to come under there and get you do you
emily crying now shakes her head
lucy almost sympathetic frowns
im going to count to three
two and a half
two and three quarters
lucy starts crawling under the bed
here i come
emily tries to go backwards but theres nowhere for her to go
trapped emily screams
lucy stops crawling
folds her arms sets her chin on them
comfortable here under the bed
delighting in the question
what you wanted from your mother
i want you to love me
okay i will i will i promise
lucy weighs emilys surrender for a moment
then oddly come tuck me in
ill be right there
you better come
lucy slithers out and we see her feet scamper from the room
emily puts her head down on the floor and cries covering her mouth with her hands so she wont make a sound
a whistling kettle on the stove
emily still in tears takes it from the burner
dumps six sleeping pills from the prescription bottle
crushes them with the blunt edge of a knife
stirs them into a cup of chamomile tea
she freezes at a noise behind her
looks tensely over her shoulder
she adds sugar continues stirring
we follow the tea cup in emilys hand as she comes nervously down the hall to lucys room
we can see lucy in there waiting for her in bed
emily playing the part dries her eyes and enters
sits down on the bed hands lucy the tea
the face of a loving mother
lucy brings the cup to her lips pauses
maybe you should have it you look stressed
ill have one later
lucy considers this nods okay takes a sip of tea
emily picks up a brush and brushes lucys hair
tomorrows our new beginning
ill be good
lucy takes a few more sips and sets the tea cup on the bedside table
emily tucking her in gives the cup a nervous glance
did she drink enough
get some rest
i love you
forever and ever
forever and ever
emily kisses her on the forehead
lucy looks up at her and for a moment shes the little girl emily met
innocent angelic closing her eyes for sleep
they flutter open one last time
where are you if i need you
right down the hall
lucys eyes shut
emily brushing her hair staring at the lucy asleep in bed
emily watches from the door wary expecting lucys eyes to snap open any second
she doesnt move dead to the world
or is it a game
emily closes the door
leans against the wall shaking contemplating her next move
wedges a chair under the door handle
time of the essence
the door lifts to reveal emily silhouetted looking in
amid the clutter is a lawnmower
beside it a big can of gasoline
emily stifling sobs as she douses the walls of the house
the hallway the bathroom the kitchen all of it
tip of a match strikes flint ignites
emily stares at it for a long moment
lets it fall
flames scurry in a shimmering blue gold sheet across the floor
climb the walls the entire house ablaze in a matter of seconds
emily sits and watches as the door to lucys bedroom is engulfed
its an image straight from hell a young woman the fish frantic in their tank catch emilys eye
she goes over and grabs the tank
smoke swirling past her she exits the house locking the front door behind her
she backs away and watches it burn holding her fish tank the only thing she saved
billowing black smoke
the house fully engulfed as fire engines arriving on the scene sirens wailing
emily watching with neighbors on the sidewalk as the firefighters uncoil their hoses
the window to lucys bedroom is a bright red square an inferno
and as emily stares at it disbelieving what shes done the figure of a child appears
her whole body ablaze
she just stands there arms at her sides burning
just now the fire marshall crosses to the onlookers
hollers over the noise and commotion everybody get out okay
emily wavers not sure what to say
the fire marshall sees her indecision
this your house
she nods yes anybody else inside
off her hesitation maam
emily opens her mouth to reply but sees something behind her that closes her throat
standing on the sidewalk in her pajamas
anyone else inside
yes or no
emily in shock shakes her head no
the fire marshall rushes off walkie talkie squawking
emily stands frozen as lucy comes through the crowd to her
more dismayed than angry
that was mean
she takes emilys hand
together they watch the house burn
firelight playing on their faces
the fish bouncing off the glass in the tank at emilys feet
the blue halflight before dawn
emily and lucy sit in the volvo eyeing the scorched remains of the house
the firecrew stowing equipment
emily puts the car in drive
the fish floating dead at the top of the tank in the back seat as emily drives down the freeway at daybreak
lucy gazing out dreamily at the sunrise
maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool
emily says nothing
lucy turns and looks at her thoughtful almost empathetic
she draws up her knees and rests her chin on top levels an appraising stare at emily like the one she leveled at doug
its sad isnt it
how it gets passed on
how people do to their own kids what their parents did to them
thats why you got the job
emily turns on the radio full volume trying to drown out lucys voice
lucy reaches over and turns it off
to prove to yourself youre not like her that youre not like your mother
because that scares you
scares you more than anything
lucy in mock sentiment puts her hand on emilys
i love you
even if you dont love me
emily looks at her gutted
turning her gaze forward she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly resolutely jams the gas pedal to the floor
the acceleration pitches lucy backwards into her seat
she sits up eyes wide didnt see this coming
a suicide run
what are you doing
a tense smile from lucy
the tables have turned
did you hear me
emily stares dead ahead red lining the tachometer
lucy flits her eyes skyward
immediately it darkens and starts to rain
emily turns on the wipers speeds on unfazed
i said slow down
emily ignores her going eighty now weaving through slower traffic that flies toward them out of the gray haze
lucy panicking changes channels like a tv
innocent child all of a sudden
please stop emily ill be good
emily ignores her beyond apology
and lucys face sharpens
she points down the road
through the heavy rain we see emily goes for the brake but reconsiders seeing the truck for what it is a test of faith
she welcomes it
tightens her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again right at the truck
lucy shrieks in terror
what are you doing
its not real
yes it is
are you scared
pedal to the floor
inviting the head on collision
you can see the big rig driver in the cab wrestling frantically with the steering wheel
lucy bracing herself screams emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact of death
but the impact never comes
in the blink of an eye the truck is gone
open road in front of them
its not raining
the wipers squeaking on a dry windshield
lucy sits in silence her bag of tricks empty
emily triumphant turns to her with a vindictive smile the speedometer hitting a hundred
she clutches lucys wrist
emily jerks the car off the road crashing through the guardrail
trees snapping in half across the hood as they go careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment the car tears through a chainlink fence and leaps off the
high embankment into the water
impacts and sinks with frightening speed
water rushing in from all sides
emily shackles lucy with her arms as the water rises to cover their mouths
they stare wide eyed at one another through the water
hair swirling around their faces as they sink to the bottom
as though she anticipated this
or welcomes it
or knows something emily does not
and now emily sees what lucy sees
a hand pries open the door and wrestles lucy from emilys grasp
pulls her from the car swimming to the surface with her
emily is left empty handed stunned alone in her watery grave
and just when her death seems certain a hand grabs her by the shoulder and yanks her out the drivers side window
onshore drying off with a towel talking to a uniformed officer is the passerby who saved lucys life
right through the guardrail never touched the brakes
emily goes by on a gurney semi conscious oxygen mask over her face
paramedics checking her vitals
loaded into the ambulance she meets the gaze of lucy who is being attended to by a female paramedic who puts her arm around lucy in a maternal gesture shielding
her from the sight of emily as emily did of the sheridans
dont look at her okay
just dont even look
lucy nods the innocent victim
clinging to her protector as she watches the ambulance take emily jennings away
of lucy wrapped in a blanket sitting beside the female paramedic in an ambulance
wet hair clinging to her face
portrait of a child victim
a remarkable story of survival this morning as a young girl is pulled from the los angeles reservoir in an accident police are calling suspicious
institutional patients watching tv in the psych hospital rec room
slouched on the vinyl sofa watching without comprehension heavily sedated margaret sheridan
emily talking agitatedly to a man in a suit who is writing something and not paying attention to her
we only see her face at first
where is she
whered they put her
is she with a family
you have to let me talk to them
she snatches the pen from his hand
do you hear me
he looks at her quietly takes back his pen
i hear you
theres a knock on the door
a bailiff pokes his head in
emily stands up from the chair shes been sitting in and we see shes wearing an orange la county jail jumpsuit
the man her public defender instructs her as they exit let me do the talking in here
lucy walks a private road through sunlit forest with a kind retired couple
temporary guardians whove taken her in for the weekend
why cant i live with you
oh darling were not foster parents we just help out when the systems full
theyll contact us lucy when your placement comes through
the woman puts her arm around her as they walk on
some nice family that always wanted a little girl
lucy smiles shy innocent quietly taking in the scenery
two women cross the office after hours a pudgy middle aged foster care supervisor and a younger caseworker who is leaving for the day
the office reminds you of child services another tier of the child welfare system
going to the thing saturday
i dont know
oh you should
itll be fun
maybe i will i dont know
see you tomorrow
the caseworker exits
the supervisor comes down the row of cubicles dropping files on desks
a thankless profession
it lands on some random desk amid the usual backlog of mail and paperwork
a case file like all the others
