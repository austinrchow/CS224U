basic by jamie vanderbilt the sound of helicopter rotors slicing through the air
an army helicopter as it soars over the thick louisiana bayou
lush and green only a day ago the foliage below has been ripped to shreds
the kind of damage that can only be done by nature
sitting next to the pilot is colonel william styles
mid s normally gruff but completely cowed by the damage below
the pilot unfazed
hurricane beth huh
had an ex wife named beth this is pretty much par for the course
this area got the worst of it i hope these guys are all intact thats enough lieutenant
running through the underbrush ducking branches pushing through bushes splashing through streams
labored breathing wheezes over the sound track
were headed for a clearing
the pilot pushes his stick forward descending to tree level
coming up on the pick up
two men emerge from the underbrush at a run
the bigger man carrying the wounded smaller man over his shoulder
both in ragged army cadet fatigues ripped muddy and bloody
the bigger man lowers the smaller man to the ground and unshoulders his m
the sound of the helicopter approaching
the unmistakable sound of gunfire from below
holy shit thats live fire
as the helicopter comes over the clearing styles and the pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the two men huddled together as bullet hits kick up dust around
whos shooting at them the bigger man raising his own his weapon and returning fire
the smaller man frantically waving the helicopter down
i cant see below the bigger man still shooting and then he lowers his rifle and theres only silence
no return fire
and then styles sees why
a third man
lying by the treeline
chest torn open by gunfire
his clothes the same fatigues the first two men are wearing
that was one of their own he just shot one of their own men who was trying to shoot them get us on the ground
as the helicopter comes in for a landing the bigger man kneels next to the smaller man who bleeds from a bullet wound to the arm
his face pale sweating
the bigger man wipes the smaller mans brow and speaks softly and seriously
are you ready for this
the smaller man nods
a full on shit kicking dive
nearly empty given the hour
a television plays the morning news over the bar
only two inhabitants one a bartender the other the lone customer smoking and picking at a plate of criminally runny eggs
tell the truth vic
you made these with a blender right
he grins and we get our first good look at tom hardy three day stubble dark rings around his eyes but a with strong jaw and steady voice
not your average barfly
somebody who maybe used to be somebody
dont like em dont eat em dont make no damn difference to me
you know that was like a quadruple negative
the bartender takes the plate away from him
can i at least have a drink
its ten thirty in the morning
yeah if youve slept
you know the law no liquor before noon
could lose my license
dont you mean dont need no liquor license not taken away from me
the bartender smiles
hurricane kept you up too
yeah and i couldve used the sleep
im supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going
he stops his attention suddenly on the tv
a newscaster is expected to announce the grand jury indictments in the guissepe torres police corruption case as early as tomorrow afternoon
speculations abound that up to ten former homicide detectives could be named in the proceedings
the bartender turns the tv off hastily
hardy just looks away
the bartender puts an empty glass down and fills it to the lip with bourbon
hardy nods a thank you and reaches for the glass when the pager on his hip goes off
he checks the number
havent talked to him in
can i use your phone
the bartender hands him a cordless and hardy dials
hey bill its tom
long time no
whoa whoa slow down
yeah of course ill come
he hangs up and hands the phone back to the bartender
what was that
hardy obviously shaken by the call
i gotta go out to mckinley
a sprawling five square mile compound nestled in the louisiana backwoods
also damaged by the hurricane
helicopters loaded with emergency supplies land and take off repair crews work feverishly on damaged buildings all while cadet platoons complete morning drills around them
this is still a boot camp after all
styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the checkpoint with warrant officer julia osborne early s attractive close cropped hair and icy eyes
in the middle of protesting
this is totally unnecessary he asked to see a policeman were getting him a policeman
but this guy you called hes not even army hes former army and the best ive ever seen in a room
besides he knows the territory we did basic together here
off her look youve had three hours with dunbar and havent gotten a peep we need to take a different tack
hes not army its not official then its unofficial
he takes a hit from an asthma inhaler as a pontiac gto drives through the gate and pulls up
re his appearance doesnt get any unofficialer than that
the two old friends embrace
how are you
pause i read about whats been happening with you
i should have called what kind of trouble are you in
styles looks at the ground
would i have called you if it wasnt
if there was any other way
tell me what i can do
you can get us some answers
hardy takes off his sunglasses noticing her
this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
and here you are going out of house
hows that make you feel jules
hostile and uncooperative
you want to tell me whats going on
hardy follows styles and osborne
they pass soldiers replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass
the official term for it is clusterfuck
by the time beth hit us id canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush
were missing three and the sergeant
the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names
but the sergeant
its not west is it
tell me its not west
styles look tells him it is
ah christ you knew sergeant west
he was our drill here
mans older than sand
a few years ago the army picked our good buddy as their go to non com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military
he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country
well hes a good soldier
osborne nods agreeing
i didnt mean that as a compliment
sergeant wests served for twenty three years
hes the public face of the modern army
and you notice im not in the army anymore
they round a corner
the exercise was one of his section eight private sessions
left around yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at this morning
and the problem is you only got three
no the problem is ones dead ones got a bullet in his arm and one wont talk
the one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up
im assuming thats what made him the dead one
cadet roberto r
killed right in front of me
search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup
if theyre hurt and we can get to them in time
i called the jag corps the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to d
on a transport leaving here at which gives us about five hours
whyd you call me
the guy in interrogation said hed only talk to a cop
and im the closest thing to it right
styles stops turning to his friend
tom bottom line i let those kids go out there
if jag shows up and i dont have any answers for them my career is finished im not gonna let that happen
styles exhales relieved
osborne will brief you on the cadets
half smile it really is good to see you
osborne and hardy enter stepping over broken glass and hurricane debris
hardy looks around
gotta be honest i love what youve done with the place you and the colonel go back
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff
i owe him
youre the tom hardy ive been reading about in the papers right
new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres
it was for suspicion of bribery its really all in the wording wording and your friendship with the colonel aside im not comfortable having you involved in this
subtlety really isnt one of you finer points is it osborne
osborne opens her mouth to reply but hardy cuts her off
first you dont have a choice
second ive never taken a bribe in my life
and third im still a little drunk from last night so if i skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you try not to take
tell me about the two guys
hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags
cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall levi
who names their kid levi senator jonathan kendall of ohio
remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone kendall junior is still in surgery so he wont be available to answer for his name or anything else
for another hour the cadet were talking to first is dunbar
hes in interrogation
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesnt exactly put people at ease
is he cute
is dunbar cute
pissed that is the most unprofessional is he handsome self assured carry himself well does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor does he have good
bones suggesting good breeding does he slouch or sit up straight these are important questions as they reveal a great deal about this mans character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute
osborne stares at him
she finally nods
at some point in there im gonna rub my nose
when i do go at him with everything you got
good cop bad cop
something like that
she starts to go make preparations
oh and osborne
you have any donuts around here
as two m
s escort raymond dunbar the bigger man into
a small cluttered room with the shades drawn
a folding table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on each side
dunbar takes a seat in the far chair
takes in his surroundings as the mps leave locking the door
hardy and osborne head towards the coffee room
i questioned him for three hours and he didnt make a sound
you dont have a badge he wont talk to you
ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes
osborne starts the timer on her digital watch
dunbar looks up as they enter
hardy smiles cheerily
cadet dunbar good morning
im tom hardy and i believe youve already met officer osborne
i understand you had a rough time of it last night
hardy takes a seat across from the cadet
not talking huh
you probably just want to get some food and some sleep
they feed you yet
hardy reaches into his pocket
pulls out a dunbar eyes it wary but definitely wanting it
you can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them my parents did it for years
dunbar grabs the donut wolfing it down
want another one
osborne looks to her watch its been a minute
ray let me say this up front im not a cop
dunbar turns away no longer interested
hardy continues i used to be but thats beside the point
who i am doesnt really matter what matters is that right now youre in a shitload of trouble
you understand that right
now i dont know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly i dont really care
im just doing a favor for colonel styles because he wants to know if anyone else whos still out there is in need of assistance
to be honest with you though i dont care about that either
dunbar looks up at this surprised
i dont know those guys you do
they die to me its like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news tragic but it doesnt affect me
the only thing i care about is i agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up
you like baseball
osborne looks at her watch two minutes
i could talk baseball for days
batting averages eras i got statistics in my brain i dont know how i remember them
you wanna talk baseball
dunbar completely confused
come on ray were gonna be here five hours we gotta talk about something
so who do you like
a long silence and then
i dont like baseball
hardy grins as osborne stops her watch at
i asked for a policeman
youre under military arrest its not gonna happen
whats wrong with baseball
well its a game of anticipation thats the beauty
i just dont like it
what do you like then
as they continue we track under the table to reveal a hidden styles and an m
listening to the coffee room conversation
dunbars voice over the speaker i dont know
i like the army
cmon ray everyone hates the army during basic
ill tell you straight i hated it here
you did basic here
fifteen years ago under sergeant west
piece of work that guy
i remember he used to have these two silver
s with ivory handles and if you werent quick enough hed
knock you on the head with one of them
he still carry those guns
he dunbar nods
i was also his knife dummy
to osborne see west used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds
hed use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy youd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you werent fast
enough to defend yourself
that was a loooong day
hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to dunbar
incidentally ray i promised them id ask where west and the others are
can we get to them
he looks to the floor
theres no need
theyre dead arent they
dunbar looks back up at hardy
styles lowers his head at this
you kill them
hardy rubs his nose
osborne steps forward
the colonel saw you shoot nunez youre a murderer see ray this is what we call good cop bad cop
she shouts i stand up for you youre grateful a bond of trust is established
osborne stunned by this
but i dont want to play games
thats why youre not in an interrogation room with one of those two way mirrors everyone knows those things are two way right
dunbar looks at him good nods slowly
now im gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay
hardy smiles at him gets up and leaves
osborne follows him out into the hall where styles waits
believe somebody owes me ten dollars you made me look like an idiot oh im sorry i didnt know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good
everyone knows good cop bad cop by admitting it i appeared trustworthy
you think he did it
no yes they stop looking at each other
youve got four hours and forty five minutes to find out
hardy returns another donut in hand osborne behind him
whyd you ask for a cop ray
im not telling you what happened
but i would like to know about the other cadets
what they were like nice guys
dunbar takes a deep breath
tell me about them
as dunbar begins to talk we flashback
row upon row of freshly shaven headed cadets stand at attention
their first day of boot camp
first day was when i met pike
sarge hated him from the beginning
a man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines
two ivory handled pistols on his hips
his lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the cadets
this is sergeant west
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives
you have chosen to join my army
this army is my mother my father and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty
little virgin cooze do you understand me give me a sir yes sir
sir yes sir
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit and those who refuse to quit i will kill
you ever hear of a training accident give me a sir yes sir
sir yes sir
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone as it would weaken the
fabric of this nations defense
this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me understand give me a sir yes
sir yes sir
so forget what youve seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder gentler military you will either succeed quit or die by my hand
he walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row
my power here is absolute isnt that right nigger
sir yes sir
west hauls off and slaps pike across the face
i hail from biloxi mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that
sir no sir
west grabs pike by the neck choking him
the others cadets gasp
pike goes down on his knees the loss of air is so great
he reaches up automatically to try and save himself
what the fuck is this
you lay a hand on me while im trying to do my duty and rid the world of you
he kicks pike in the balls and releases him
pike goes fetal on the ground vomiting as west stands over him screaming
get the fuck up youre still in formation get the fuck up
pike somehow gets to his feet vomit streaking his clothes
what the fuck have you done to that uniform take it off take it off take it off
pike still gasping cant move fast enough
west slaps him again and tears the mans shirt off
get those fucking pants off i want you buck ass naked you dont deserve to wear these beautiful united states army issue clothes
pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is naked
west turns and spies dunbar in the line
cadet whats your name
sir dunbar sir
you know how to work a pistol dunbar
sir yes sir
west draws one of his pistols and gives it to him
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours
he is not to be given food water or clothes
if he so much as moves you are to blow his nigger brains out is that clear
sir yes sir
the rest of you fallout for physicals
the rest of the cadets fallout following west away to one of the buildings leaving dunbar and pike
one with a gun the other naked
fifteen guys quit that day
but not pike
the cadets navigating a log spanned over a pit of mud
time went on and the sarge started singling people out
one of the cadets a small man named anderson falls from the log
screaming west dives into the pit and pulls anderson out knocking him on the head with a pistol
anderson stands naked his arms straining to hold up two paint cans perpendicular to his body as west berates him
hed zero in on a fella and ride him till he quit
anderson now in civilian clothes gets into a taxi
west screaming at a weasely looking cadet named childs
those who wouldnt quit hed put in what he called section eight
a horribly dilapidated quarters
four cadets dunbar pike childs and mueller sleep in rickety bunks
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they were dead
he separated us from the rest
we slept alone
the same four cadets eating on the floor as the other members of the cadet corps chow at tables
the four cadets fallout on a run shirtless with heavy packs and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the cadet corps files into their barracks for sleep
and trained long after the other guys got to turn in
the cadet corps mustered
west zeroes in on nunez the dead one whose t shirt has a spot on it
fellas lived in daily fear of being sectioned and with good reason too
west pulls nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over towards a separate muster of our four section eighters
they figured we were the boys whod meet with a training accident
nunez takes a place among them
looking absolutely terrified
osborne leans forward
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you
no maam he just wanted us to quit
making it through was kind of an honor
some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight command would consider you at the top of the class
thats not exactly true
off their looks im living proof
how did you get sectioned ray
dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile
that first night with pike
i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
there were six of us
the six members of section eight on a forced run through the rain
we focus in each face as dunbar describes them
first up is mueller a tall aryan looking blonde with a square jaw
mueller was from tulsa a real good ol boy type
one of those his daddys daddys daddy died at bull run and no bleeding heart yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun
he idolized west
muller grinning as west kicks his ass to pick up the pace
next to him is nunez a strapping hulk of a manchild
and nunez idolized mueller
big fella from new mexico
after he got sectioned he just followed mueller around like a lap dog
he wasnt mean like mueller though didnt have it in him
next to nunez is childs small and weasely with feral eyes
but childs did
didnt talk to anyone but you got this feeling something was wrong with him like real wrong
type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near
behind childs runs pike
pike i told you about
he took the brunt of it from mueller and west
once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless
hed been busted for auto theft judge gave him the option of jailor the army
he made the wrong choice
next to pike dunbar and kendall run side by side
kendall is short like childs but also weak
finally kendall and me
kendall was a smart guy we got along okay
pike and i tried to help him but
kendall falters and pike stops to try and help him up
west smacks the him away practically kicking kendall to his feet
he was sickly
had that shaking thing whatdyacall it epoxy
spent half his time in the infirmary
only reason he enlisted was his father
west didnt section him till last week
and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you
and thats all im saying
hardy leans back in his chair
you smoke ray
this is one of those interrogation tricks isnt it
you dont give me a cigarette till i tell you more
no actually i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some
dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table
must be my lucky day
he takes one and lights it
dunbar does the same
let me ask you one thing
you seem like a good guy ray
you carried kendall wounded to the pickup
so what i dont get is what you did to make nunez want to kill you
dunbar just looks at the ground
a knock at the door
hardy and osborne turn to see an m
stick his head in
hardy and osborne emerge to find styles waiting for them
hes not done by a longshot i can get more out of him he can wait
kendalls out of surgery
hardy and osborne sit in the back of the open car as it rumbles across the grounds headed towards the base hospital
they sit in silence until whyd you join the army
osborne looks at him annoyed
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now
we should sit in silence
were in the middle of a murder case best time for banal chit chat
he slips something into his pocket
what is that
microrecorder for kendall didnt have time to wire his room
now tell me why you joined the army or ill jab this pen through your neck
osborne smiles in spite of herself
typical army brat story
dad was noncom mom was a nurse
there was never any real doubt of joining up
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib
something like that
i lost a bet
thats just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed
i dont know
the whole honor and duty thing
make a difference in the world crap like that
didnt really work out
osborne studies him
i bet thats the second story you tell the girls to get them into bed after you make them laugh with the first one
hardy just smiles
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about isnt it
the very same
you do understand that theres absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right
i plan to grow on you
youre off to a late start
they pass an overturned climbing tower
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here
imagine what it must have been like for them out there
what do you think of dunbar
hes telling the truth up to a point
hardy doesnt respond instead looking out as they pass the something wrong
being back here
gives me the willies
not the happiest of memories
flashcut to fifteen years ago
a bunch of young cadets hardy and styles among them doing forced push ups by the barracks in the rain as west randomly berates and kicks them
back to hardy as he looks away and shakes it off
a nurse leads hardy and osborne down a spotless white hall
normally we wouldnt let anyone see him this soon but colonel styles said it was urgent
remember hes the son of a senator so go easy
kendall lies in a bed a network of tubes in his arm
he is awake but pale still weak
he studies his visitors
ive seen you around the base
youre not army are you
coast guard special detective detail
we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
kendalls laugh turns into a cough
youre that policeman with friends in low places
tell me hows guissepe torres doing these days
those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock
you in a very small dark room
i suggest you talk to us
kendall smiles again not losing any of his cool
ive done nothing wrong
gestures to his wound im the victim here
but not the only victim right
my my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly
if i didnt know better id say you two were out to get me
we just want what the truth
there are degrees of truth officer always degrees
things are not what they seem
hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave
its too early in the day for me to give a shit about some pissant cadets bad version of intrigue
you want to talk to us send word over to the brig
nonplussed osborne follows
hardy turns back at the door
youre working too hard levi
i can tell cause youre sweating
and youre sweating cause you have no idea what dunbars already told us
hardy and osborne walk to the nurses station
that was kid gloves
have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
he pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
but we have to question him noticing thought you didnt have cigarettes i lied
wait for it
osborne just stares at him not knowing what to say next
the phone at the nurses station rings and a nurse answers
listens for a moment hangs up and turns to them
cadet kendall were on our way
hardy and osborne sit across from kendalls bed
sergeant west is dead isnt he
and the other three cadets
kendall hesitates then nods again
feel free to elaborate
kendall takes a breath and begins all trace of bravado gone
my father is a powerful man
over the years hes used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain
deep breath i am a homosexual
senator daddy must be thrilled
he is not shall we say wild about the idea
he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him
however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet
what do you think of that
i think you just blew dont ask dont tell out of the fucking water
the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled
my father interceded so instead west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay
he couldnt kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own
he wanted more than that
more intrigue levi
kendall stares at them dead serious
the six cadets asleep all except kendall who stares up at the patchwork ceiling
it was the regular tuesday night drill
hed let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up drag us out to the bayou and work us all night separate from the others
the door slams open revealing west
get up get up get up
were going on a little night hike boys muster in five on the south tarmac
he leaves as the sectioners rise groaning
hurricanes due after midnight and were still going out
toughens us up pike
you dont like it quit
pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger
maybe we shouldnt go
the faggot speaks
you ever been in a hurricane mueller
mocking gay lisp you ever been in a hurricane mueller
mueller and childs laugh but nunez looks concerned
you really heard this
you know popham works in the kitchen
he told me it was on the radio
he stops listening
they all hear the wind howling outside
we should tell him were not going
oh yeah excuse me sergeant sir we dont feel like going out we dont want to get rained on
hell kick our asses from here to cleveland
he pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door nunez right behind him
the others getting ready all except kendall
dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder
we dont have a choice
the six cadets mustered in front of west and a transport chopper
west hands out m s sidearms and grenades while yelling above the wind
a rifle a pistol and three phosphorous grenades to a man
this is live fire so keep those safetied until we touch down i dont want anyone shooting their dick off
some of you may have heard theres a hurricane coming
american soldiers do not wait for good weather they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty
an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy
anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh feel free to lay down and die you get me
sir yes sir
lz is two clicks north of a cabin you are to split into teams of two
and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find
each area has twenty targets first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins
teams are as follows dunbar and nunez pike and mueller kendall and childs
i will be in the areas monitoring your progress and if i see anyone drag ass i will personally slit you stem to sternum and leave you for dead
the cadets board the transport chopper
kendall gets on last passing west who leans in and whispers to him youre gonna die tonight faggot
osborne looks up
he said what
youre gonna die tonight faggot
clear as day
no one else heard it
he whispered it in my ear
hardy scratches his temple
levi i dont know if youre familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one
you said you wanted to know what happened im telling you the truth
what happened to degrees
didnt kill him then who did
on kendall sitting among the sectioners in silence
terrified he looks like hes about to throw up
i wanted to tell someone what hed said but i couldnt
mueller would just laugh
nunez and childs wouldnt care
pike and dunbar were okay but
when west outed me he isolated me
an outcast among outcasts
and id just been told tonight was the night id die
the chopper touches down on the edge of the bayou
the door rumbles open as west points out different team directions in the blackness
first team second team third team go go go
the click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out of the helicopter
we track with kendall and childs as they head away from the landing zoe rifles up heads down side by side
moving the brush quickly and quietly eyes scanning for targets
i knew childs a little we worked at the px together
the wind is picking up and its started to rain
their ponchos flap loudly against the elements
i started getting it in my head that maybe west had paid him maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident the roar of
kendall turns towards it screaming for a moment
until he sees childs lower his smoking rifle a shredded target on a tree in front of them
he looks down noticing has his own weapon trained on childs
childs steps forward knocking kendalls rifle away
dont you ever point a gun at me
im im sorry
childs picks up the rifle from the ground and hands it back to him
come on lets move
various shots kendall and childs moving through the bayou childs taking out targets
its raining harder now
all i could think of was west out there somewhere in the dark
maybe watching the others maybe watching me
and waiting to make his move
childs speaks and kendall almost jumps out of his skin
christ am i alone in this world
shoot something a sound from the left
kendall panics pivots and fires
no target no west no nothing
kendall really freaked out now
a target kendall cap a fucking target
whats wrong with you
i thought i was gonna have an attack
go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou
childs could tell i wasnt right
just safety your shit and get behind me okay
ill take care of this
kendall nods and lets childs walk ahead
staring at childs back as they move on
on kendalls face thinking
maybe it was a trick
maybe this was when theyd get me when i felt safest
on kendalls finger clicking off the safety again
moving towards the trigger
but if i struck first and took out childs then maybe i could make it out alive
kendall raises the rifle
sights childs back
a moment of utter silence and then
maybe i shouldnt tell you that
maybe i should tell you i wasnt scared at all
but i was
long pause enough to almost kill him
but you didnt
poetic justice though
hardy smiles understanding
because childs is the one who shot you
osborne looks up surprised
but that came later
as kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it
the sound of a tremendous explosion comes from their right
kendall and childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily lights up with the blast as a man screams
childs points to the right where the dim shine of phosphorous can be seen through the trees
he drags kendall to his feet and the two take off running towards it
kendall panting and scared ducking branches and leaping ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow
the sound of gunfire
childs tackles kendall
they hit the deck face down in mud
it takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them
fuck what the fuck is going on what do we do
whoever it is isnt shooting at us
he trails off
the gunfire and screaming have stopped
silence now save for the wind and rain
dont want to go fine
childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were
kendall lying in the rain and mud shivering
after a moment he gets up and follows
the scorched ground and trees smolder under the rainfall
kendall finds childs standing down by the creek
something lies by his feet
whats he stops seeing
literally spread out on the ground dead
eyes open face half blackened he has been ripped in two at the torso
a horrifying sight
kendall stumbles back from it
did did you it was the grenade you fucking idiot
look at him
he sits sobbing
part horror part relief
this isnt our area
whose area is this can anybody hear me
childs pivots at the sound of mueller coming over the ridge
hey i seeing it holy fuck
holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
we found him like this mueller raises his rifle at the weeping kendall
you killed him you fucking faggot we found him like this
kendall was with me the whole listen to me
mueller finally seeming to understand
lowering the gun
jesus jesus fucking christ
muttering to himself walking in circles
mueller wheres pike
mueller looks up
we got i dont know we got separated before or after the explosion
no response mueller i dont know
how can you not know mueller comes at him screaming shut the fuck up you fucking faggot you just shut the fuck up mueller stops eyes crazed
childs looks to the sky which is becoming worse by the second
we have to get out of this
to find the cabin
he helps kendall to his feet
what about pike
maybe hell be there
either way we have to go
kendall nods slowly
the two start up the hill
shouldnt we i mean we shouldnt just leave him here
he points down to wests body
childs looks at it
you can carry him if you want
he and kendall continue on
mueller lingers a moment longer and then turns following them up the hill
kendall childs and mueller make their way through the bush
the wind and rain have conspired into a full blown hurricane
the three men are practically stumbling now leaning in against it to stay on their feet
kendall spies something through the maelstrom
it looks like wet wood
he points there
the cabin wooden one story and large it resembles a solidly built shack
it is being thrashed by the storm
the trio stumble towards the front door
bare of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace
dunbar and nunez shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse into the cabin
dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as nunez helps them up
what happened to you what happened to you
we finished the course and came here then heard an explosion to mueller wheres pike
we dont know
west is dead
dunbar and nunez stare at him
mueller jerks a hand towards kendall and childs
they found him
poor fucker was practically blown in half poor fucker my ass
you better watch it faggot im not sure you and childs didnt do him what about you wandering around alone
at least we have an alibi what do you mean alone
pike and i got separated yeah and he doesnt know when i remember now it was before the explosion
oh you remember now im about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly what about pike
mueller stops as the others turn towards the big man
they realize what the question means
he wouldnt kill anybody
oh bullshit hes a fucking convict
you know how much he hated west i hated west childs hated west everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesnt mean we killed him
what if it wasnt one of us
what if it was a local he was blown up by a phosphorous grenade they dont exactly sell those at
look here are the facts roberto was with dunbar queen kendall was with childs and pikes the only one not here
he did it
the others nod becoming convinced
he is the only one unaccounted for
maybe hes dead too
maybe you killed them both mueller shut up
to mueller let me see your grenades
we were each given three so whoever killed west will be missing one
mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades
now can we please he stops
hearing a sound outside
through the wind and rain footsteps on the porch
they all turn to the door
the door swings open
covered in blood
they stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty fireplace
finally whose blood is that jay
any kindling for afire
he looks around for kindling
what do you mean wests
i mean i killed him
pause isnt that what we all wanted
he admitted it
right in front of us
mueller went after him but we held him back
pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up
so we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm
why would he just surrender
kendall turns to her and smiles
because he had a plan
pike tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look for food in the kitchen
alone kendall walks past pike hey kendall talk to you for a sec
kendall looks around there seems no harm in it
you hated west as much as i did
im not saying what i did was right but you cant tell me youre not glad the motherfuckers dead
kendall says nothing
pike looks around makes sure no one is listening and then whispers the thing is weve got a real opportunity here
you turn me in tomorrow and were both fucked what are you talking about
a gay senators son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise
the pressll crucify you and your father
his career will be over and itll be your fault
but we do this different and you come out a hero
on kendall thinking about it
hes as bad as west and we both know it
now i cant do it cause im tied up but we get the others to go along dont think i want to hear this someone else can do the deed
it doesnt have to be you
maybe nunez too hes got a tendency to follow mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeants killers
well move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west all we gotta do is tell the story right
kendall stares at him
youre sick pike
he turns and walks away
pike watches him go
later on i
saw him talking to dunbar
they had been close
i was in another room when it happened
kendall looking through the empty cabinets for food when a gunshot from the living room
as kendall bolts towards the noise the air is filled with the sounds of screaming and shooting
he pushes through the door
kendall coming through the door as we slo mo
mueller sprawled out on the floor dead
pike tied to the chair bullethole in his forehead
nunez wounded stumbling out the front door into the hurricane
and a badly wounded childs pistol out turning towards the sound of the door and firing
kendalls arm hit with a slug and he starts to go down
freeze frame on kendalls form falling
i dont think he meant to do it
it was just reflex hed already been gutshot
i must have passed out cause next thing i knew
the sounds of running and heavy breathing
kendalls eyes flutter open
hes on dunbars back being carried through the woods
the sound of gunfire and a tree branch shatters next to them
someone is chasing them
trying to kill them
dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes from behind and we can now hear rotor blades approaching
as dunbar bursts into the sunlight carrying kendall
the entire thing dreamlike what we saw at the opening but from kendalls viewpoint the helicopter overhead nunez behind dunbar turning and shooting nunez going down
and thats it
hardy is silent
staring at him
nunez was chasing dunbar
because hed shot mueller
but you didnt see it right
like i said i was in the kitchen
when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone
why did he come back for you
i honestly dont know
maybe to have someone to cover for him
and i wish i could but theres no doubt in my mind he killed those men
kendalls got nothing more to say
i think thats it
he rises and walks to the door
hardy turns back
what did dunbar tell you
hardy smiles and pushes out the door
hardy and osborne stand before the colonel filling him in
pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez
who killed pike
someone must have got a shot off
he wasnt exactly a moving target
styles turns to osborne
what do you think
its too neat
how long have you been an investigator
i dont think that has anything to do with that means under a year
let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic
there are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people
it doesnt always make sense but its always neat
dunbars our guy
osborne struggles to put it into words
he came back for kendall
i dont think hes capable of murder
everyones capable of murder osborne
osborne turns making her case to styles
look all weve got is what kendall says and he didnt actually witness any deaths except nunez
he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies he didnt see any crime committed
well im sure if hed known this was all going to happen hed have tried harder to witness it for you wests body isnt in the creek bed
they stop arguing turning to look at him
weve already been over the terrain twice
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime
okay then lets widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car without the body we have no physical proof
we need a confession
i hate to break this to you but i dont think hes gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
nevertheless nevertheless what
kendall will testify and thatll be enough
not for me
you mean not enough to save you
jag gets here in three hours
try for the confession
dunbar looks up as hardy and osborne enter
cheerfully hey ray
just had a nice talk with your buddy
kendall seems you killed three people
that son of a bitch
thatd be my reaction too hes lying
well why didnt you say so
well just drop all your charges then im serious hardy leans across the table
fuck youre serious raymond you got exactly zero truck with us right now wed take the word of a crackhead over yours so if youve got something to say say
did kendall tell you about the px
he said he worked there no did he tell you about it
about the business childs ran
pills shots you name it basics a lot easier when you dont feel pain so childs made some side money so what
people are dead ray and the only one we have to blame is you didnt shoot west yeah we know pike did
dunbar stares at him
you think you know everything dont you
you havent even scratched the surface
hardy leans across the table looks dunbar dead in the eye
i know enough to know you got two choices you can sign a confession in which case youll probably spend the rest of your life in a military prison or
you can tell us to fuck off in which case youll probably get the gas chamber
smiling am i scratching your surface yet
dunbar stares at him for a moment and then launches himself at hardy screaming
tackles him to the floor choking him
osborne pulling her sidearm and pistol whipping dunbar in the head
dunbar goes sprawling off hardy as m
s rush into the room restraining him
hardy gets up gasping and stumbles to the door
but hes already gone
hardy walking angrily towards the front entrance wheezing and massaging his neck
osborne runninq to catch up
why the fuck wasnt he in restraints
i dont know
styles appears at the end of the hall
tom where are you going home im done
what about the confession
hardy stares at him
you want a confession
why dont you confess bill people are dead and you dont give a shit about it
only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault what the hell are you talking about im talking about west
we had him bill we were there
youre the fucking base commander you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has styles couldnt reassign him hes a
legend you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by
it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what
he deserved it
theres your confession
he pushes past a shocked styles and walks out the door
hardy storms across the grass
osborne still following
goddammit hardy you cant just leave watch me
you said you owed styles and now youre gonna turn your back on him
hardy whirls on her
west was a monster
fifteen years ago i was here i was section eight i was pike
fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did stripping pike down making him stand outside all night
he did that every year he did that to me
fifteen years ago i wanted him dead and now im supposed to care that somebody offed him
sorry no can do
you did more than try
you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal phenomenal at taking bribes right
osborne shakes her head
i was starting to believe you you know
that you werent who everyone said
i guess i was wrong oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit
this isnt my great second chance osborne
everyone thinks im a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that
nobody will ever know what happens here but you will
hardy stares at her
why do you care
because its my job
because people are dead
because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that
pause we can do this hardy
hardy looks at the ground
two and a half hours
thats all im asking
two and a half hours to maybe get the truth
hardy looks back up at her
speaking softly i didnt shoot west
he said he didnt shoot west
west wasnt shot kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and dunbar never saw the body
they stare at each other for a moment
hardy and osborne enter to find dunbar in shackles
apologize you saw wests body
of course where
the creek bed and hed been shot
yeah what about the phosphorous grenade
one went off yeah but it didnt touch him i thought you knew this
tell it to me
dunbar and nunez running towards the glow of phosphorous and sound of gunfire
they come over the hill to see childs and kendall standing over wests body
dunbar stops shocked
holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do
we found him like this
dunbar edges closer looking at west
with bullet holes
his chest riddled
somebody emptied a full clip into him stop
kendall told us mueller was the one who found them with wests body
hes lying then
we didnt see mueller till we got to the cabin
dunbar kendall childs and nunez push through the door to find mueller in his undershirt a fire burning in the hearth
jesus what happened
breathing hard west
mueller was alone in the cabin
pike and i got separated
then i heard gunfire
so did we
why didnt you come
mueller looks down scared
i was afraid
mueller voice fades out as he continues to talk
i didnt buy it
but mueller had all three of his grenades
mueller shows his three grenades to the others
at least you and kendall agree on that
what happened next
pike came back
pike staggering in through the door
the others get up from where they are sitting its been awhile since they arrived
pike shouts at mueller what the fuck happened to you what the fuck happened to you
one minute youre next to me and the next youre gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas where have you been jay
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place
its gettin bad out there looking around wheres west
to pike wests dead
all of them staring at pike
where have you been jay
pike suddenly understanding
fear creeping into his face
no fuck that he moves to the door but
nunez with his pistol out
trained on pike
roberto what the fuck
we just want to check your pack why
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first blame the nigger then huh
someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd you know its not like that
the click as nunez pulls back the pistols hammer
let him check your pack
pike stares at them and then throws his pack down angrily
dunbar goes to it opens it and reaches in
pulls his hand out
only two grenades
looks at pike
tie him up
the fury of the storm has increased
kendall childs nunez and mueller in the kitchen looking for food
pike tied to the chair
dunbar sitting in a corner listening to the hurricane rage outside
pike watches him
just like the first day huh
you standing guard on me
a creaking as the cabin shifts on its foundation
dunbar looks up at the roof scared
this place aint gonna hold much longer
dunbar doesnt reply
still staring nervously at the roof
pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot then you and me are friends right
pike takes a deep breath
you gotta untie me
off dunbars look i didnt do this thing ray
you hated west more than any of us
maybe but that dont make me a killer youre the only one missing a grenade
which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper
were you watching your pack on the ride in
dunbar starts to get up
ray this is my life here
i aint gonna pretend im not happy west is gone but you know i couldnt have done this
its not in me
if not you then who
oh come on were sweeping our area and suddenly hes gone
couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away thats exactly what he says about you
who you gonna trust ray
him or your friend
dunbar stares at him
you hated west mueller loved him enough to go to prison
childs px scam mueller was in on it bullshit
look in my pack
dunbar walks over to pikes pack and unzips it
checks the little pocket
pulls out a vial and a syringe
combat grade morphine
mueller sold it to me
youre lying pull up my sleeve
dunbar does to reveal a cluster of track marks
that look like a lie to you
i been using solid for the last eight weeks
dunbar sits down
not knowing what to say
after that first night on the parade grounds with you i was bad exposure malnutrition the works
i needed something to keep me from crashing
mueller found me
empty except for pike
he sits nude curled up on the tile as the nozzles blast steaming water down onto his shivering form
he leans down next to pike speaking to him
he said he knew guy who had an in at the px could hook me up
this is before i knew what a dick he was
as mueller produces a syringe from his pocket
a covert meeting among stacks of supplies
childs stands with mueller talking to a gaunt pike
behind pike are a group of other sickly looking cadets all jonesing
later on childs got assigned there started running the shit out to every cadet who needed it
but i was our classs first customer
pike hands the smiling mueller a wad of cash
dunbar staring open mouthed at pike
why didnt you tell me
becoming a morphine addict during basic aint exactly something you want to broadcast
only mueller and childs know
dunbar gets to his feet
that still doesnt mean you didnt kill him
you saw west right
how was he killed
full clip to the body from up close or far away
his chest was hamburger thats close range
you go full auto on a guy from close range youre gonna be swimming in blood
look at my uniform
not a speck of blood on it
and wheres muellers
when i came in he was only wearing a t shirt
dunbar looks over to fireplace where ashes are smoldering
flashcut to when dunbar first entered the cabin mueller standing there in a t shirt a fire burning in the hearth
way i figure it west must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them so they decided to get rid of him first
mueller and childs
one of them mustve taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper
the sectioners sit stonefaced staring out the window
close on muellers hand as it snakes into pikes pack and extracts a phosphorous grenade
mueller and pike twenty feet apart scouring the brush for targets
mueller looks to pike and then slips away
then mueller ditches me during the exercise and heads for the creek
mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin tossing it down the embankment
he blows the grenade to frame me and gets west to come running
the grenade blows setting the entire area aglow
kendall and childs turning towards the sound
note each shot of kendall and childs in this sequence should correspond exactly to kendalls flashback
west emerges from the bush at a sprint
what the fuck is going on
mueller runs down the embankment toward him
dont know sir i six feet away from west mueller suddenly raises his rifle and pulls the trigger
kendall and childs running in the direction of the grenade
childs job is easy he only has to delay kendall long enough for mueller to get away
suddenly machine gunfire shatters the night
he tackles kendall into the mud
mueller smoking rifle in hand uniform covered in blood stands over wests dead body
he turns and runs off into the brush
a moment later childs and kendall come into view at the top of the embankment
now all mueller has to do is get rid of the evidence
mueller still covered in blood enters the dark cabin
he strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace
striking a match igniting the bloody rag
and wait for everyone else to arrive
mueller watching the evidence burn
pike sighs finished with his story
i dont know
what dont you know
this is a lot of information to be getting
i have to think
the hurricane outside growing louder as the cabin rocks again
the sound of wood snapping
pike stares up at the roof
theres no time to think ray we gotta get out of here
you untie me we grab the guns get kendall and nunez and make a run for it no
no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m
s we wait and im a dead man
i got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets wholl testify how much i hated west my court martial will take six minutes
its either me or them ray and you gotta decide right now
the cabin shifts again
dunbar stares at him
dunbar doesnt move
untie me ray
a long beat
the two men stare at each other
and then dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down to cut pikes bonds
what the fuck are you doing
he looks to the open kitchen door where mueller stands
guys get out here
the others enter the room
dunbar kneeling there knife inches away from severing pikes ropes
this place is going mueller
we gotta move
shut the fuck up
to the others he was gonna cut him loose
the others stare at dunbar
cause i didnt do it
childs motions to dunbar
get away from there
dunbar moves away from pike
we all know what you did pike
i dont know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here but wheres your shirt mueller
used it to start the fire still got mine on not a speck of blood on it
not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours
the others begin to look at mueller with new eyes
was freezing from the hurricane so you took off your shirt
to start a fire goddammit
pointing to pike what about him huh
maybe he offed the sarge and changed shirts brought an extra one in his pack
yever think of that
go ahead cut him loose
first chance he gets hell waste the rest of us thats how they work the hurricane reaching fever pitch outside as water begins leaking in through the roof
goddammit ray we gotta get out of here were not going anywhere
cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west the fuck are you talking about you are to be stripped of all
weapons and placed under guard bullshit until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant wests body shut up
mueller pulls his sidearm and points it at pike
mueller what the fuck dont do this pike eyes locked with mueller
continuing a test will no doubt link you to the killing put it down
tell him to shut up failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself
pike please although that wont matter much when coupled with the murder charge pike leans forward
you stupid white trash motherfucker i saw you do it and mueller fires
pikes head snaps back
the gunshot deafening
then for an eternity silence
as if time has stopped
mueller lowers his arm the pistol clattering to the floor
his face as shocked as the others
he takes a step forward towards pike
a hole in the middle of the black mans forehead
softly so you killed him
almost mechanically dunbar begins to reach for his own gun
the unmistakable sound of a two rifles magazines being racked simultaneously
dunbar turns to see childs and nunez their m s in hand
levelled at him
get that hand away
looks to nunez
we can still come out of this okay
pike got free he got a gun he came after us
thats the story
mueller collapses on the ground
head in hands
west was one thing but this shut up mueller
you framed him
none of that matters now
we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them
youre either with us or against us which is it
dunbar and kendall looking at each other
its clear what the wrong answer will mean
a long beat until okay he is cut off as the wind outside roars the hurricane mounting to its full force and the windows blow inwards showering childs mueller and
nunez with glass
dunbars hand flies to his pistol pulling it
mueller screaming trying to claw the glass from his eyes
childs seeing dunbar move pulls the trigger
and the cabin is filled with the thunder of gunfire as kendall goes down clutching his arm
dunbar fires hitting childs directly in the chest
childs still shooting falls back his random spray of bullets punching into mueller who jerks like a marionette
nunez drawing a bead on dunbar about to shoot when
a great crescendo of wood splintering and supports buckling overtakes them and the cabins roof comes down on their heads
the rain has lessened and the hurricane has begun to lift as dunbar pulls himself from the debris
hearing a faint cry from his left
half conscious his arm bloody
dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun begins to peak through the clouds overhead
dunbar carrying kendall towards the clearing when gunfire comes from behind
he turns to look
the only other survivor from the cabin
a hundred yards back rifle in hand coming after them with a vengeance
dunbar sprinting towards the clearing bullets at his heels and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a and then i killed the last of
flashcut to nunez chest blown open going down
and were back to the interrogation
dunbar stubbing out a cigarette and looking up at hardy and osborne
can i have some coffee
osborne blinks like a trance has been broken
she goes over to the machine and pours a cup
you shot childs and nunez
they would have killed us both
you want me to write a confession ill write a confession
you saved kendalls life but not pikes
osborne hands him the coffee
why didnt you tell us all this in the first place
would you have believed me
their faces say no
osborne spreads a map out on the table
wheres the cabin
dont know on a map
west told us it was there we just found it
maybe the hurricane took it away
raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony
otherwise this is just another story mr
hardy i joined the army for college money
i didnt ask for any of this i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed
you say finding those bodiesll help me then go find them
i dont want to die
hardy and osborne walking and talking
talk it through childs mueller and nunez know theyre going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or ho hurricane so they plan it kill west pin it on
and theyre smart about it
they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness
exactly someone whos not involved whos word cant be questioned
you only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes theyve totally bought into your version of events
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
and if theyre asked thats what theyll tell the world
so its a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story
kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin buttfucks the cabin
and all hell breaks loose
a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending
so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senators son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber
that bugs you too
lets go talk to bill
hardy and osborne stand in front of an agitated styles
he tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing
frustrated he tosses it away
this whole things driving it nuts
what i said before
was dead right
you think dunbars on the level
does osborne agree
yes sir i do
hardy lays a piece of paper on styles desk
it should be enough to get you out of trouble
styles looks at it and then slowly up to hardy
you want kendall dont you
he tried to burn dunbar to us
you dont do that if youre not involved
hardy nods agreeing
styles stares at them
you both know if you do this if you go after a senators son and youre wrong
its not just me in the hot seat anymore
to hardy im giving you a chance to walk away
styles nods and looks to his desk
almost to himself you dont get to be a colonel without compromising
without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs
you politic play it safe think of the career first
and when things get dirty you just look the other way
he looks back up at hardy
his eyes steeled
four of my men are dead
you think kendall had something to do with it then you go get the son of a bitch
kendall lies in his bed looking worse than before
hardy and osborne enter
pike never confessed
weve been making progress i see
osborne looks to her watch
running out of time are we
tick tock tick tock how long till your witnesses fly the coop
not much time to solve the crime
tell me detective how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres
did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar how many murders did you cover up
maybe an even ten
to osborne can i go to jail for punching a guy whos been shot
kendall begins coughing
i think theyre giving me the wrong medicine
this isnt a very good hospital you know hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water
epileptic attacks are murder on your system
rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
my heart weeps
he returns with a glass of water and hands it to kendall
pike never confessed
no but it got you interested didnt it
got you to dig
inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didnt belong
is it the truth
theres that word again
smiling as i told you i wasnt in the room when everyone started shooting
dunbar says you were
then hes mistaken
you know i really dont think my father would approve of this line of questioning why did you tell us he shot everybody levi
you put him in for three murders the man saved your life so i should stay silent about his misdeeds
the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun dunbar was running out
see thats where i was confused because i thought you said nunez was running out the door
i said dunbar
you know i really thought you said nunez
i thought you said dunbar was gone my fault i gotta check the tape on that
off kendalls look oh yeah we taped the last interview
this one too
cause itd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie
they wait for kendalls reaction
he looks momentarily flustered by this
and then he smiles
i believe your next line is what are you trying to hide
sorry to disappoint
im on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind
youre right it was nunez
any more questions
hardy doesnt know what to say
that was his ace card
dont get me wrong mueller and childs were quite the pair the type of guys you didnt feel comfortable going to sleep around
completely capable of murder
but as i said i didnt hear the exchange before the shooting
i wasnt in the room
osborne furrows her brow at this as hardy continues
dunbar will testify that you were
then well leave it up to the courts his word against mine
what does his father do again
smiling doesnt matter im sure justice will be served
in any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son
hes quite protective
osborne turns to hardy
i need to talk to you outside
osborne and hardy exiting the room
whispering were fucked i know they got their stories straight
what kendall said the type of guys you dont feel comfortable going to sleep around
thats what dunbar said about childs to the letter
are you sure
hardy they planned this
he grins back
not bad for hostile and uncooperative eh
hardy and osborne reenter smiling
something funny levi
i was just thinking of whats going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
hardy pulls the out microrecorder and hands it to osborne
why dont you talk to levi off the record for a second
smiling she stops the tape
then turns to kendall
you and dunbar got your stories straight
little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where
senator daddy can protect you
you think youre just going to slide out of this
youre an accessory to murder levi youre going to jail you cant threaten me jail if hes lucky the gas chamber if hes not didnt do anything osborne laughs
it doesnt matter levi
were going to find those bodies and when we do im going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon what
thats a fantastic idea see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with
the story about how senator kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission beginning to panic it wont work it will and you know why
because youre not a person anymore youre a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights
so im gonna throw you to the wolves and unlike you im gonna get away with it because youre pissing me off
she finishes breathing hard
kendall totally cowed
hardy trying to suppress a smile
osborne rises for the door
enjoy your flight to washington wait what
kendall takes a deep breath
dunbars telling the truth
wrong answer we did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone
pause it was because i threatened him
because of what i saw
pause who really killed west
osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again
who killed sergeant west
kendall stares at the recorder
a long pause
who levi childs
how do you know
because i was standing next to him
he pauses taking a shaky sip of water
i was in on the px thing
he and mueller and me we were making thousands
west found out
childs said we were just gonna scare him use my dads clout
i had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us his career was over
we met him in the creek bed but before i said anything
west stands in front of childs and kendall facing them
kendall opens his mouth to speak but childs steps forward and raises his rifle firing
i swear i didnt know he was gonna do it
after he told me we were gonna pin it on pike one of our biggest customers
as they tie pike to the chair
nobodyd believe the word of a black junkie ex con against ours
childs gives kendall a look that says stay quiet
he told me id better keep quiet or id end up the same as west
pan over to dunbar who binds his friend sadly
dunbar didnt know anything about any of it
everything he told you was true except after
dunbar pulls kendall from the cabins wreckage
as kendall begins to talk to him dunbars eyes widen in shock
i told him what had really happened to west
told him to keep quiet about it or id destroy him
because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam my father would be finished
i scared dunbar into silence
hes been trying to cover for me the whole time
we got here you came to see me
i didnt know if i could trust him with that kind of secret so you framed him
the same way childs was going to frame pike
crying a little
little advice levi next time you frame a guy pick someone who cant defend themselves
kendall says nothing
what happened with nunez
he came after us
and i told dunbar he had to kill him
the helicopter hovering overhead
dunbar carrying kendall spinning his rifle to face nunez sixty yards away
dunbar hesitates before firing not wanting to
dunbars rifle erupts
and he did
kendall finishes wiping his face
osborne turns to hardy
thats how you do good cop bad cop
hardy smiles and gets up
walking slowly to kendalls bed
childs did it huh
kendall nods still a little teary
first pike then mueller now childs
when are we getting to the others
when are we gonna hear about nunez
flashcut to nunez in the creek bed shooting west
flashcut to now dunbar shooting west
or you levi
when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him
i didnt but you cant prove it
you cant prove anything until we find the bodies
kendall crying harder now beginning to shake
you lied to us levi youre going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
i dont know where are they
his mouth slams shut
teeth cracking together over and over again like a metronome on speed and his body jerks horribly going horizontal shaking violently
osborne leaping to her feet
get something between his teeth
hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove it into kendalls chattering mouth
his teeth clamping down on the metal and hardys hand drawing blood
the nurse bursts into the room
what is hes an epileptic
the nurse runs to the bed pushing hardy aside
as more medical personnel runs into the room they usher hardy and osborne to the door
youre going to have to wait outside hes a witness
it doesnt matter outside f f f f f f fuh osborne tries to move to him but the doctor blocks her path
hes trying to say something out now
fuh fuh fuh fuh fuh osborne knocks the doctor down and runs to kendalls side
kendall looks up focusing on osborne a slight moment of clarity in his eyes
fuh fucking pike
and relapses into another fit as security guards drag hardy and osborne from the room
hardy and osborne sit in silence eyes downcast
hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack lights it crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can
i pushed him too hard
you couldnt have known yeah i couldve
you wanted to get the truth
no i didnt
i wanted to humiliate him
for what he did to dunbar
for fucking over the little guy
you mean the falsely accused
hardy looks up at her and nods
you wanted to break him
so did i
she looks back to the floor
hardy takes a drag from the cigarette and then tosses that away too
the door opens and styles walks into the room
time of death was
jags been notified and i called the senator myself
my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable
you two had no culpability in the matter
thats horseshit and you know it
but its my fault and ill carry it
he sighs and takes a seat next to them
we found the cabin
demolished like they said
hurricane like that coulda scooped em up dropped them down two counties over
well find them
hardy says nothing
you think you could explain all this to me
i wouldnt know where to start
pause i guess it was about one man framing another
he thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings
styles nods understanding
what happens to dunbar now
gets on his plane in ten minutes which means you two are done
youll understand if i dont walk you out
hardy gets up to go and then stops
theyre taking your command arent they
he points to kendalls hospital room
im sorry bill
im not cut out to deal with the wests of the world
youre a good soldier bill
i thought you said that wasnt a compliment
this time it is
the sun beginning to dip in the sky as hardy and osborne exit the hospital
your cars in the motor pool
ill walk you over
they walk in silence for a bit
so what now
now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think itll work
they pass a group of cadets doing drills
hardy watching them
almost looking wistful
you know you never told me why you left the army
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority
and all i did here was follow orders
it didnt add up
plus i got kicked out
thats gonna stay my secret
hardy and osborne make their way towards hardys car
we were close to something with kendall
maybe we were nowhere near
sometimes mysteries stay mysteries
pause i havent by any chance grown on you have i
good just making sure
osborne turns to the duty sergeant
were going need a vehicle release
the sergeant nods walking up with a clipboard
sign here and here
recognizing them hey aint you the folks workin on that whole hulabaloo from last night
one of those section eight boys worked in here
heard he got out okay
hardy signs the clipboard and hands it back
hate to be the bearer of bad news sergeant but he didnt make it
the sergeant scratches his head
i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning
no no that was cadet dunbar you mean ray dunbar
well that aint right
i saw em get off the chopper
white guys right
maam ray dunbars black
hardy and osborne stare at him
shocked a beat
did i say something wrong to osborne what runways that transport leaving from
four get in
cadets scatter as hardys car roars out of the motor pool peeling across the grass towards the far side of the base
hardy white knuckling the wheel doing his best to steer around anyone who cant get out of the way in time
a large transport plane sits on the runway waiting as three m
s and a jag lawyer lead dunbar pike who for purposes continuity we will continue to call dunbar out to it
the squeal of tires as hardys car slides around the corner of the nearest building and screeches to a halt by the plane
hardy and osborne leaping out running towards dunbar and the m
we need to talk to him sorry officer we have a schedule to keep we need to talk to him now
hardy grabs dunbar by the arm
were not finished yet you wanna bet
s escort this man off the base
smiling sorry detectives
as the m
s grab hardy dragging him away
osborne trying to stop them
dunbar climbing the stairs onto the plane
osborne pulls her sidearm levelling it at him as hardy yells james randall pike come on down
dunbar stops at the hatchway
slowly turning back to them
seeing the gun
s release hardy
lets go have a talk
hardy and osborne roughly lead dunbar into the room the jag lawyer trailing behind shouting this is your entire career here fuck off
she slams the door and barricades it
turns to hardy
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down
right back where we started
you want to talk about baseball now
hardy practically throws dunbar into a chair
no more games right pike
it was you who west singled out
flashcut to west on the parade grounds now strangling dunbar on the first day
you who got hooked by muellers morphine
flashcut to now dunbar in the showers as mueller hands him a syringe
you who did it all
hardy steps forward and rips open dunbars right sleeve revealing the track marks
you wanted revenge on west revenge on them all so you killed them
dunbar standing in the cabin mueller childs and pike dead at his feet
but that wasnt enough
you needed a new identity because no one was going to believe james randall pike convicted felon had acted so nobly in the face of danger you needed a name
people could trust one that hadnt been to jail one that hadnt publicly been wests bitch boy
he stares down at the bodies in the cabin his eyes focusing on the black mans uniform
the name on it reads dunbar
as he reaches for it
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end
you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too
cant do that now though can you
you walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name a
clean record and an honorable discharge a guy who did everything he could to save his friends
dunbar looks at them
one to the other
is that what i did now
and of course you can prove all of it
we can prove that youre not ray dunbar
impersonating a fellow cadet is a court martial in and of itself did i ever claim i was raymond dunbar
was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record
you assumed who i was because i was wearing this uniform
dont believe me
he reaches under the table and rips out the hidden microphone
check your tapes
hardy and osborne exchange an uneasy glance
we dont need the tapes oh you dont
what else do you have on me
you havent found any bodies yet have you
weve found all of them
dunbar chuckles at the bluff
ohhhh i dont think so
how do you know that
just a guess
maybe theyre not where theyre supposed to be
maybe somebody moved them
habeas corpus no bodies no crime and nunez still plays as self defense
face it detectives
you have nothing
hardy knowing hes right
in a flash he reaches down pulls osbornes gun and grabs dunbar slamming him up against the wall pressing the weapon to his temple
not true cadet ive got a gun terrified jesus
hardy what are you doing isnt this how your story goes
pike annoys someone so much he gets shot in the head please please dont a pounding on the locked door
hardy ignores it
we can tie you to the chair if itll work better for you hardy for chrissakes practically in tears youll never find it hardy cocks the pistol as dunbar screams
youll never find it cause hes not a crash as the doors lock snaps and m
s pour into the room
styles and the jag lawyer behind taking in the scene
what in gods name is going on
hardy releases dunbar who slides to the floor gasping
he he made me do it do what
hunting we had to hunt him sergeant arrest these men
you mean the exercise
there never was an exercise
never targets never teams i dont even know if theres a creek bed out there as the m
s grab hardy and osborne pulling them away
what did you do
thats enough goddammit what did you do
he breaks down sobbing
styles holds up a hand to the m
i want to hear this
the jag lawyer glowers as the m
s stand down
dunbar tries to pull himself together
to hardy youre right
i was the one he singled out
beat me morning noon and night ran me ragged
when mueller found me i was gone
he gave me a little taste
mueller showing the syringe to the naked dunbar
dunbars voice over speaks in unison with mueller i got a friend with an in at the px can hook you up
what i didnt know was his friend was west
he ran the whole thing
youre lying son
you think its easy to have all that morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it
check the requisition orders ill lay money its his signature on them
dunbar alone sleeve rolled up arm tied off sliding the needle into his vein
that was his game see
ride the cadets so hard theyd need something to stay on their feet
then hed send mueller or kendall to them waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away
he hits the plunger injecting
his face goes tranquil
it wasnt a new thing either
hed been doing this for years
every nine weeks a new class of cadets new potential customers
the amount of money involved over that period of time
this was some high stakes shit
he takes a deep breath looking at them
dunbar moved his through the kitchen
i worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics
by the time the hurricane hit we were all in
some using some pushing some both
but then something happened
west heard one of us was about to talk to blow his whole operation
he figured hed made enough money had enough of the army maybe it was time to disappear
but first he was gonna teach us one last thing
west entering the barracks shouting the cadets awake
the tuesday night drill was the perfect cover
the hurricane made it even better
the cadets climbing aboard the chopper
he put us on the chopper and flew us to his cabin
and then he told us
the six men stand in rigid formation eyes on west
it has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst
someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that i have endeavored to create in all of you
perhaps that failure is mine
but we take care of our own
and this traitor must be made to pay
he walks down the line of the six men eyeing each of them
finally stopping at one
putting a hand on his shoulder
sir i wasnt i know you were
cadet mueller found the letter youd written to the colonel in your locker
you were going to betray us all
he points to the door
the hurricane raging outside
nunez looks to the others then the door and understands
he takes off running out the door
west walks over to a table covered with a tarp
pulls the cloth aside to reveal m s pistols and grenades
now well see whose trainings paid off the most
you are to hunt cadet nunez down and bring his body back to me
if you fail and he escapes we all go down together
the remaining five cadets understanding there is no place for friendship or kindness here
this is life and death
they walk to the table and gear up
lightning thunder and rain as nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush
somewhere behind him the other five fan out rifles up following his trail ready to kill
it was insanity
we were hunting a man down to kill him
making his way down embankment m l out ready for anything
from behind him movement
he got mueller first
nunez tackles him at full speed feet slipping on the wet hill and the two tumble head first into a gully
punching kicking biting anything to stop the other man
nunez choking mueller as he strains to reach his gun
with a heave nunez snaps his neck
mueller lies still
he took his gun
used it on childs
nunez spins seeing childs behind him
he dives as childs fires
hits the ground in a roll comes up with muellers rifle and shoots blowing childs back against the wet rocks
i cant imagine what it was like
having your friends try to kill you
nunez slumps against the gullys wall breathing hard
in agony over what hes just had to do
but you do what you have to survive
closing his eyes nunez steels himself
wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully
pike creeping through the foliage
trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm
his eyes narrow as he hears a high pitched whine
the bullet hits his forehead dead center
pull back to reveal nunez in a tree thirty meters away
lowering his rifle
he climbs down
kendall and i found dunbar a couple minutes later
dunbar and kendall come upon pikes fallen form
they gaze down at the uniform emblazoned with the name dunbar
it came to me in a split second
change clothes change identities
if james pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail
but if i was dunbar i could walk away from all this with a new life
as he reaches down for the uniform a shot rings out
kendall falls wounded in the arm
dunbar raises his rifle to find nunez standing ten yards away gun trained on him
put it down
a mexican stand off
the rain continues to fall
i just want to go
nunez shakes his head
you were gonna kill me pike
thought you were my friend
he cant bring himself to shoot but he cant surrender either
i have to get kendall to a hospital
he was gonna kill me too
the two men still facing each other
i snapped muellers neck
he was my best friend and i had to snap his neck because he was gonna shoot me for drugs
we dont have to do this
you go that way ill go this way
youll shoot me in the back
you killed three people
isnt that enough for one night
the sky above a maelstrom
i dont want to die out here roberto
nunez staring at him
if you even twitch
nunez begins backing away rifle still trained on him
and then dunbar spies something behind and to the left of nunez
staring down at him from behind some brush
nunez slowly backing away
he pauses as his foot catches on a fallen branch
looks away from dunbar for a split second to step over it
west nods to dunbar as if to say go on
and dunbar fires
nunez caught by the burst goes down
the echo of the gunshots swallowed by the storm
dunbar lowers his head in agony
west walks down
congratulations cadet pike
you get the gold star
dunbar stares at his sergeant through the rain
tilts his head to kendall
youd best get him out of here
dont worry about the bodies theyll be taken care of
dunbar doesnt move
this is where we part ways cadet
you tell them i died out here or ill come back for you
tell them one of the others did me
mueller childs i dont care who
you and kendall you tell them a story
smiling you can tell a story cant you
dunbar doesnt reply
west laughs and flips him a salute
and west turns and walks away stepping over nunez
giving dunbar a clear shot at his back
dunbar raises his rifle wanting needing dying to shoot the old man
but he cant
west disappears into the bayou
a groan from the ground
dunbars reverie broken he leans down beginning to unbutton the dunbar uniform
dunbar stubs out a cigarette finished
hardy osborne styles and the jag lawyer gaping at what he has just said
i guess nunez wasnt dead after all
he came after us with a vengeance
to styles you know the rest
and the bodies
you wont find them
wont find west either
hes too good
no bodies no west
no death certificates
just four people mia
the jag lawyer steps forward
youll testify to this the corruption the drug scam
dunbar says nothing
we can cut a deal for you on the nunez killing
i dont want any deals
if youre telling the truth the px requisition records will prove it all the proof you need will be when west comes back and puts a bullet in my brain
but ill do it
im a dead man anyway
looking at hardy we both should have died out there with our brothers
i know that now
the jag lawyer looks to hardy all anger gone
ill take him now if you dont mind
dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door
turning back to hardy
tell me detective
did you get what you wanted
hardy shakes his head sadly
not even close
styles walks over to hardy
tom hardy holds up a hand cutting him off
styles nods understanding and leaves closing the door behind him
hardy and osborne stand there
several hours and bourbons later hardy sits at the bar drunk and alone
out of place the only one not in uniform
osborne walks in locates hardy and strides over to the bar a sheaf of papers under her arm
her face stoic
we need to talk seven
he takes a slug of his drink
what was it you said
you were just starting to believe i wasnt the guy people said
thats the answer to kendalls question
osborne looks at him
realizing what hes saying
this isnt the time this is the perfect time
you know what makes a good detective
the number of confessions they get
youre a good detective osborne
so now you get mine
what if i dont want it
he pours himself another drink
thing about taking money is you dont have to do anything
you just sit there
maybe you dont return a phone call
maybe you dont follow up a lead
but thats it
keep the money your works done
osborne stares at him
seven unsolved murders
and you know what
it didnt weigh on my conscience
not one goddamn bit
he takes a slug from his glass and grimaces
thats not true
there are degrees of truth officer
youre a good man hardy
far as im concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past
hardy stares at her
i may not be growing on you but youre sure as hell growing on me
he motions to the bartender for another glass but osborne takes his hand stopping him
and because youre a good man i know youll do the right thing
hardy looks at her questioning
osborne takes a deep breath
pike never made it to d
somebody took him off the plane before it left
my guess is hes already dead
hardy stares at her
but i dont think so
she puts the papers on the bar
these are the requisitions from the px the ones used to release the drugs to mueller
west signed half of them pike was telling the truth
look who signed the other half
she taps the bottom of the paper
hardy not wanting to believe it
he looks up at her pained
do i have a choice in this
i can wait till youre off the base and do it myself
hardy stares at his glass
lets go finish this
styles finishing his paperwork
he rises and turns off his desk light bathing the office in darkness
hes about to leave when he notices a silhouette in the doorway
you have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs
that was good
styles squints at the figure
tom is that you
hardy steps forward into the office
it was so good i actually forgot youre one of the bigger dogs now
the base commander
the one in control
you couldnt let him testify could you
what are you talking about
if you let him testify then it would have all come out
west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear
but it got messy and people got killed
so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse hed cover for you
youre drunk im not going to cover for you bill
not for this
styles realizing what hardys talking about
look he begins to move from behind his desk
stay where you are
youve gone round the bend west had a partner
someone who knew how to get things done
hardy throws the papers onto styles desk
what i cant understand is why you signed these
if youd just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless
so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
thats preposterous toxicology report came back
kendalls attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe youve heard of it
its for asthmatics
if an epileptic takes enough it kills them
i checked with the nurses at the hospital youre the only other person who visited kendall
wanted to see if he was okay you poisoned him bill
you heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like pike
im not even going to dignify that no
you will stand there and you will listen
what happened to you bill
you were the one who joined up to do good in the world
you were the one who believed in it
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character
the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of
theres only one criminal standing in this room and its you
not for long
he walks towards the desk
no more witnesses
wests a ghost
but it doesnt matter because we have your signature the hospital log and kendalls toxicology report
and thatll be enough
youre crazy you cant duck this bill
i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wont let this happen
for the last time i have no idea what youre talking about squinting get your hands away from the desk
in the darkness we see styles move suddenly
hardy dives to the floor osborne in the doorway pistol raised fires two shots
muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as styles is blown back against the wall
hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the light
styles lies slumped in the corner two holes in his chest
osborne lowers her weapon shaking
hardy points to the top desk drawer which is open
inside it sits an ivory handled pistol
fully loaded safety off
its presence tells them everything they need to know
its wests isnt it
hardy nods and then turns to look down at styles body
now its over
flashing blue and red lights from parked military police vehicles illuminate the grounds as m
s string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the building securing the site for investigation
hardy takes in the entire scene from afar
standing by his gto watching as several m
s finish questioning osborne
when shes done she spies hardy and walks over to him
what are you doing out here
leaving without saying goodbye
what are you gonna do
go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened
think itll work
a word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss
probably not the best time to hit on them
i should probably write that down
hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her
your phone number
in case you need me to testify about the shooting
theyll clear you
he was your friend
but he was a lot of other things too
an awkward moment
finally ill see you
he turns away
walking towards his car
he turns back
she walks up and holds something out to him
a ten dollar bill
i owe you this
he looks down at the money
you saved my life tonight
pause actually dont keep it i need the money
he takes the bill and osborne laughs
he climbs into his car and starts it
grinning at her through the open window
youre one of the good ones osborne
dont sweat the details
he puts the gto in gear and drives off
she watches him go then looks down at his card
maybe she will call
a bottle of scotch at her side osborne slips a tape marked basic training intro sgt
west into her vcr
settles back to watch it
wests face fills the screen
the art of warfare is simple and complex
simple in its goal complex in its execution
its started to rain
hardy drives in silence
as sun tzu writes the true warfare is deception
a hitchhiker up ahead
hardy pulls over for him
osborne drinking and watching
at all times you must confuse your enemies surrounding them with uncertainty giving them false hope
the hitchhiker gets into the car
at all times you must mask your true intentions
hardy smiling at him because the hitchhiker is not a hitchhiker at all
whyd you ask for a cop ray
the hitchhiker is dunbar
they got their stories straight
the hurricane rages
a hand pulls the pin on a phosphorous grenade and chucks it
it blows frying brush and nothing more
west comes over the hill running to investigate
he stops at what he sees
nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed surrounded by the other section eight cadets
what the fuck is going on
your weapons sergeant
west doesnt move
kendall walks over and disarms west pushing him into the circle next to the terrified nunez
is this about that little drug business you all are running
yeah i know about that roberto told me shut up
look we wont say anything fuck that
you little pissers really think you can throw a scare into me
dunbar raises his rifle and shoots nunez
he goes down twitches once and lies still
west looks at dunbar
youre gonna have to do a lot better than that son
how about this
and with that tom hardy emerges from the brush carrying a combat knife
wests eyes sparkle with recognition
didnt i kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago
hardy just smiles
shouldve known you were involved in this
come on then
lets see you try and stick me moving faster than west thought imaginable hardy moves and the knife flashes cutting west open stem to sternum
hardy grips the older man by the shoulders lowering him to the ground as he dies
whispering in his ear stem to sternum
you taught me well sarge
and west dies
a moment of utter silence and then voices from the past begin coming back to us you think you could explain all this to me
kendall walks over to hardy and hands him a pistol
i wouldnt know where to start
kendall holds out his arm gritting his teeth
i guess it was about one man framing another
and hardy shoots kendall once through the arm
mueller and childs lay nunezs dead body out in the brush
the sound of the helicopter approaching
dunbar raises his rifle and fires towards the tree line
aiming at nothing
the helicopter comes into view overhead
dust kicks up around dunbar and kendall bullet hits
when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy
on styles face watching this through the windscreen
the one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up
rack focus to hardy concealed in the woods firing at dunbar and kendalls feet to simulate nunez shooting at them
dunbar shooting towards where nunezs body lies
making it look like he just killed nunez
hardy arriving at the fort embracing styles
and for that to work you have to have a witness
pan over to osborne watching
someone whos not involved whos word cant be questioned
various shots of hardy and osborne investigating the case talking to dunbar talking to kendall
you only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe
osborne showing hardy the requisition forms
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent
after shooting styles osborne gives her story to the m
and if theyre asked thats what theyll tell the world
osborne watching the taped west
your greatest weapon will by your allies
hardy taking a cigarette from dunbars pack
must be my lucky day
kendall coughing fit
hardy getting him a glass of water
some of which you may have to sacrifice for the greater good
hardy secretly dissolving a powder into kendalls water
we got the toxicology report
hardy confronting styles in the dark
make no mistake the innocent will die
osborne firing twice into styles
as he hits the wall
next time you frame a guy pick someone who cant defend themselves
but it will not be in vain
sometimes you can trick the enemy into doing your work for you
osborne staring down at wests pistol
he still carry those guns
alone hardy plants wests pistol in styles desk
if you engage in a clever enough subterfuge
hardy stands behind kendall and dunbar overseeing them as they fill out requisition forms
kendall signs wests signature dunbar signs styles
what i cant understand is why you signed these
as we move into a close up on hardy you never told me why you got kicked out of
the army kicked you out for drugs
i got a friend with an in at the px can hook you up
theres only one criminal standing in this room and its you
osborne watching the tape of wests speech
which brings us to the simple goal
for the true warrior the one and only objective is to emerge from conflict unscathed
the gto pulls into a space and hardy and dunbar get out
i promised them id ask you where west and the others are
washout rejects guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead
hes telling the truth up to a point
they walk towards the bars entrance
you cant prove anything until we find the bodies
all we gotta do is tell the story right
you havent found any bodies yet have you
as hardy and dunbar push through the doors into the bar
a table of four men look up as hardy and dunbar enter
mueller childs pike and the motor pool duty sergeant
all drinking beer having a grand old time
habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime
hardy and dunbar smile and go to join them
as the taped west concludes his speech
the screen cuts to static
osborne turns off the tv extinguishing the last source of light
over the darkness you can tell a story cant you
we slowly move towards hardys parked gto
murder is basic
focusing on the trunk
there are no conspiracies no grand mysteries no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings
wests body stuffed into the trunk of hardys car
everyones capable of murder osborne
dunbar lays the wounded kendall down as the helicopter carrying styles comes in for a landing
dunbar wipes the sweat from kendalls brow and asks him seriously are you ready for this
