abrams december a sign
twelve feet across
painted decades earlier grim covered black white and red
it reads in large s era hand painted type safety is our primary concern
then days since last accident and below that numbers painted on hanging metal cards
four possible digits can hang here but there are currently three
slowly push in on this sign as a man appears rising on a forklift in a greasy monochromatic work jumpsuit
removes the from its hooks
then removes the
finally he hangs up a number
the man lowers out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit wondering about the accident
and how bad it was and the factory sounds grow deafening and as it shiny black loafers
black pants three inches too long
we boom up stopping at a boys hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket
pulls out a womans gold necklace with a locket
he holds the locket
rubs it gently with his thumb
continue to boom up
we now see the boys face
this is joe lamb
on the precarious edge of adulthood
he looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes
he moves forward and we pan so were behind him now
in the frosty distance past countless leafless trees and modest homes is a steel mill
smokestacks and structures
the lifeblood of this late s town
close on charles mother and father funeral attire
she looks out of the window sadly heartsick and concerned
behind her he picks at his plate of food
im so worried for that boy
joes gonna be okay
she was everything to him
jacks gonna step up
hes a good man
but he was never really a father
i dont think he ever
maybe a little concerned joes gonna be okay
but his wife isnt so sure
then boys hushed voices charles well see him in a moment leans forward reaching for food on a buffet table
charles leaning has revealed cary a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie and preston pale and smart in a dark sweater what do you think was
in the coffin
jesus shut up
i mean cause of how she died
you werent wondering that
no im eating macaroni salad
we now see charles big and in an ill fitting black suit and martin good looking in a shirt and tie at the buffet i was thinking that about the
i dont know how you guys can eat
try a goddamn turkey roll and youll discover how
cut wide to reveal that we are in a modest ohio house in the year
at a wake
forty odd friends and neighbors darkly dressed
either nothing was in there or like whatever they scraped up jesus guys i heard it crushed her completely
at least keep your voices a steel beam those things weigh a ton
if it had been open casket i would not be eating right now
despite the turkey rolls
they look up in the other room a dog mutt lucy has jumped on a guest for food
jackson lamb joes father black suit moves to the dog walks her out of shot
bet joes not gonna wanna do my movie anymore
why do you think why
its about the living dead
his mothers not a zombie
but shes dead shithead
those turkey rolls are pretty good
a wide shot
a grey snow covered early february day here in lillian ohio
many cars are parked outside the house notably a sheriffs department squad car in the driveway
joe a vision of black on white in his too big black suit now sits on a small swing set he hasnt used in years
he solemnly looks down at the locket he still holds
no doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mothers neck
then a sound
joe looks up
a car has arrived a distinct buick gsx a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe down its center
joe watches as the car sits there for a moment
then a man gets out
someone joe has seen before but doesnt know personally
a man in his early s in jeans and a work shirt
hes not exactly sloppy but if you look closely you could tell hes been drinking
this is louis dainard
joe watches louis carefully as he moves to the house to the porch and inside the house
joes eyes glued on the house for a while
then he looks back to the locket
he opens it and stares at the picture inside which we do not see
and as he stares tears come to his eyes
a moment broken by the sound of raised voices joe turns toward the house
after a beat the sound of something breaking something glass
then the house back door bursts open joe cranes his neck and what he sees hell never forget his father jack leading an in pain and hand cuffed louis dainard
from the house and into the rear of the squad car
when he slams the back door he sees joe
sort of freezes as their eyes lock
but jacks more uncomfortable ill be home soon
and jack gets into the car and drives away
joe watches them drive off
and after a beat he looks down at the locket again
moms just gone
finally he closes it and we hear an oddly loud snap and our screen goes black
over darkness applause then a lone voice i want you
to want me
drums kick in cheap trick blasts
hundreds of kids eagerly leave their last day of school for the year winter a memory
girls emphatically embrace each other good bye
boys run off just happy to be out
lots of have a great summer
dolly with joe who walks through the crowd alone backpack on shoulder
suddenly charles is there red faced he hands joe pages that was the longest day ever here
new scene check it out
lets hit the
as he reads you hear martin barfed in the hall
i know does that guy ever not barf
i am reading
focus this is important
detective hathaway has a wife
i think it might help make my movie better
i need two things a better story and production value
they head across the street to the eleven
suddenly cary is there a burn wrap on his right arm now martin booted all over his locker it was the grossest one yet let joe focus hes reading
after he ate two boxes of mike and ikes never seen so many colors in my life
will you shut up a minute
whos gonna play the wife jen
no way did i tell you what she did with my top hat
oh yeah that was bad
his friends dont
push in on him as they head to the doors i was returning that book on codes and ciphers she was in the silent reading section i thought screw it
so i asked her if shed play hathaways wife
you talked to alice dainard really
youre not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section shut up
its for silent reading
she said yes were filming tonight and shes driving
joe charles and cary scan the candy aisle
to the train depot did you not read the scene i just gave you
does alice have a license
is she old enough
whose car are we taking
are you making this up
jesus freak show she offered to drive and i accepted takes scene pages can i see
was she nice
why is she doing this
i dont understand we dont even know her maybe she just wants to be in a good movie yever think of that
i dont think thats what it is ive been working on this movie for months
im just trying to make it good
reading disapproving hathaways married now
charles swipes the pages from critic cary
what was she reading
in the silent reading section what was alice reading
who gives a rats ass what she was reading the festival deadlines in one week my movies gotta be great
slowly push in on the screen kids earnestly playing adults darkness
then a door opens
its detective hathaway played by martin in silhouette
its an old warehouse dirty cobwebbed crowded with crates old machinery chemical barrels and junk
the detective turns on his flashlight aims it sweeps it across the space the light hitting the lens for a moment
the detective walks through the spooky dark space
a low growling industrial drone makes the whole place oddly creepy
then a sound quick but strange slithering and the detective aims his flashlight tense
we see where hes aiming the light which cuts through thick dust in the air
its an old office door ajar
hathaway is still
watching the door waiting for it to open
and then from the darkness behind him a terrifying open mouthed zombie appears attacks and the detective turns his flashlight knocked to the ground and hathaway falls too the wild
eyed gaping mouthed zombie drooling as it tries to bite hathaways flesh we recognize that the zombie is cary
actually not a bad performance
the detective pulls out his gun but the zombie grabs his wrist they wrestle with the gun the zombie wanting to rip into hathaways neck but hathaway sees three sharp
tipped nails sticking out of an old piece of wooden crate and after a significant struggle hathaway pushes the zombie back so his head is impaled by the nails which we see enter his skull
the zombie stuck to the crate via the nails screams and dies and just at hathaway catches his breath the image dims and freezes the projector has just been stopped
we are in board games books records a stereo toys and magic
super film equipment and paraphernalia
movie one sheets hang carrie halloween earthquake and night of the living dead
no sports memorabilia
charles turns on the lights looks anxiously at joe that was a good zombie murder
yeah but its not a st thank you for that its not a story yet
older kids enter this film festival im competing with fifteen and sixteen year olds who have better stories and cars and production value ive got nothing
as he tosses joe a super filmmaker magazine im coming
theres a whole article in there about stories you should read it it explains everything
looks at magazine i dont understand how the wife makes it a story jesus thats what ive been explaining in the scene were filming tonight the wife telling the detecting
shes scared for him that she loves him charles
so when he investigates the zombie stuff youll be scares youll feel something because you dont want him to die because they love each other
does that make sense
i just cant believe you talked to alice dainard
opens the door whispers midnight
i wont forget
joe just nods and looks at the magazine
a hectic family charles mother cooks
jen his smoking hot year old sister angrily sets the table where his father pays bills
pale year old sister peg does a puzzle
twin year old boys bicker over an action figure
tv in the living room plays a match game
joe and charles enter
mom its not fair that i cant go to wendys
every single person is going except me
then every single person can tell you how it was move the puzzle get the napkins
its your turn to babysit
get off that thing
mom why cant i switch with charles
because you crushed charles top hat you ever think of that
disgusted jen loudly sets charles place as oh really guess what
charles grabs a roll
guess what no were not
charles take these to the table
benji its time for dinner
hey goodnight mrs
kaznyk grab a seat we have lots of food
oh no thanks maam im okay
to charles loaded see you tomorrow
theres always a place for you here you know that oh yessir
joe leaves charles parents share a look of pity for joe
an anomalous moment in this small steel town the sun sets through the distant trees and its beautiful despite the distant belching smokestacks
joe leaves charles house and crosses the street to his own
squad car in the driveway
joe comes into the kitchen through the back door
lucy the dog greets him
a tv is head somewhere
nightly news reports on the ongoing clean up of three mile island
a half empty beer bottle on the table
joe peeks into the living room but no ones there
joe looks around for his father
heads down the hallway
stops when he sees something off camera
we hold on joes face sort of quietly stunned
and we se his pov jack joes father in uniform pants and t shirt sits on the edge of the bathtub head in his hands quietly crying
joe is stunned staring at his dad
but he cant look away
and when he finally starts to head off jack looks up
joes mind scrambles for something to say but jack sniffles gets it together quick
puts on a strong face
hey ill be out in a minute joe nods as jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door
hold on joe
stunned and heartsick
commodores quietly sing easy on the pa
joe and his father in civvies sit beside each other at the counter
jack eats a beef stew and reviews office paperwork not looking at his son
joe eats a grilled cheese deeply lonely and not even knowing it
jack pulls out a pamphlet and places it on the table its a six week program hands on training with college coaches
youll like it
i know i did
joe looks at the pamphlet for hewitt sports camp
images of happy smiling healthy athletic kids
not his thing
i thought i was going to have the summer for myself things have obviously changed for us
and itd be good for you to spend some time with kids who dont run around with cameras and i gotta help charles finish his movie
i have nothing against your friends
i like your friends
except cary who cant stop lighting things on fire
youll like it there
its what we both need
joe looks back at the pamphlet his other hand coming up from under the table and jack sees that joe is holding his mothers locket
jack wants to cry again
he wants to throw that locket away out of sight
but he just turns away
joe stares at the pamphlet
push in on the photo of beaming year old kids
then cut to the hunchback of notre dame tight on quasimodo a plastic painted aurora model
rack focus to the paintbrush that comes into frame follow it to joe holding the brush at his desk making a model
a boys room recently devoid of a mothers oversight a mess
comic books and other plastic models all built and painted by joe
cars and creatures and a train
his bedside clock radio pm quietly plays baker street
then a radio squawk joe grabs a kids walkie talkie okay its time dont get caught over
joe turns off the walkie and he grabs a small plastic fishermans tackle box as we hear wanna hear something gross
no please if youre really asking
sitting on the curb with their gear and talking quietly are joe charles martin preston and cary
martin dressed in his detecting suit
joe eats from a bag of twizzlers
i sneezed so hard yesterday i shit my pants
i debated telling you
thats called a sharteeze by the way
well then i totally sharteezed in my pants
thats exactly what im talking about the world is crazy theres a name for everything
joe passes him a twizzler
people are turning into zombies because of the chemical factory right
i dont see how the guy playing detective hathaway can ask where the zombies are coming from
another classic from smartin
i told you i dont like it when you call me that
im sorry smartin
all the boys look
their faces brighten
the boys stand as the car stops beside them its the yellow buick during the wake
but now sitting in the drivers seat is year old alice dainard
she sees joe
what the hells he doing here
make up sound and special effects
hes the deputys kid
touch flattered you knew that
charles i dont have a license
i cant drive with him
you want joe to stay back
its too late
hes seeing me in this car right now
you can trust me
my dadll never know
i wont tell him anything
looking away shes pissed
all the boys in silent wait
she considers annoyed
shakes her head
finally get in
the boys excitedly scramble into the car
the buick crosses the nighttime horizon leaving the small town driving through a rural landscape
youre driving very well
the boys shoved in the back with the gear in front charles struggles with his backpack and camera bags as he pulls out pages arranging them
with her driving theres an unusual electric energy in the air
joe eats his twizzlers in the back trying not to stare at alice
so i wrote a couple new lines can i show you
charles what i have new lines
there arent a lot im sorta trying to drive what would be great is could you cry during the scene
can you do that
cary messes with the radio
alice moves his hand away
you know the first place im gonna drive when i get my license
offering to alice want one
alice looks at him in the rear view
their eyes hold a beat
new castle pennsylvania
fireworks capital of america
she takes the twizzler he offers and looks back to the road
so i dont have any new lines right
because i just learned these
i have never been a passenger in a vehicle without an adult driving
im unresolved as to how i feel about it
the buick wooshes past a solitary kelvin gas station
the car dips into the darkness beneath a blanket of stars
the buick pulls up to this small empty train station in the middle of essentially nowhere
a series of hanging lights illuminates the train platform
theres a small office currently closed
no one around
the kids get out of the car
guys theres an electrical socket up here
hey charles charles do i have more lines
but you can pick up some stuff
the boys carry many bags and the tripod
platform charles looks at the scene through the lens he creates with both hands
guys this is going to be great
get the lights and camera on that end well shoot this direction first like we talked about
joe get the mike plugged in make sure the new batteries are in the camera before you do the make up
joe walks past alive who watches him
it strikes her that joe is charles lackey
martin sits alone with his copy of the pages quietly reading and memorizing his lines
sweetheart this is my job i have no choice
thats nothing you need to worry about
what am i suppose to go to michigan with you
cary grabs his paper and throws it to the wind sending martin running after it
no no no
preston sets up the lights as cary arrives to show him his backpack full of firecrackers i took apart two packs of cherry bombs and made my own m
your obsession with fireworks and im saying this as a friend concerns me
and my mother
well youre a pussy
and your mom has one
cary takes off
martin returns with his paper
charles writes in his notebook
he starts to get up
martin i have a new line for you
he gets up to reveal joe putting make up on alice
he walks over to martin cary and preston
charles and martin ad lib
tight on joes tackle box which opens
inside is an assortment of make ups sponges cotton balls brushes derma wax spirit gum and a large jar of fake blood
joe is preparing to make up alice who sits in front of him watching carefully as joe prepares base make up on a sponge
he looks to her
alice shakes her head nope
joe starts stippling the make up onto her face
he is now via sponge touching the face of a girl hes admired for some time
after a beat my dad works at the mill
and she looks at him
almost as if she were looking for something
joe stops stippling
the tension is almost too much for him to bear
close you eyes
he indicates the sponge its for the make up
joe starts applying the make up to her eyelids
theres something provocative for joe being so close to alice with her eyes closed
then pre lap so this is very emotional
the lights plugged into the car cigarette lighter and camera a eumig are set
alice has been made up wears a coat with purse
martin in his tie faces her
they both look over their script pages as charles adjusts the camera
joe observing holds the boom mike a condenser mike taped to a broom handle preston wears an overcoat
hathaway really doesnt want her husband to keep investiga i know we read it we get it
okay im just directing
martin get on your mark
martin youre going to have to reassure her
do you know what reassure her means
yeah i think so
okay were starting on alices side first preston a couple seconds after action walk to the pay phone make it look like this place is busy i know what that
everyone jumps charles turns cary laughing has just exploded a firecracker asshole could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera
lets rehearse this save your real performances for when were filming though
martin and alice put away their pages cary gets behind the camera
charles stands near the camera kneeling to camera height
joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the actors heads
preston holds a suitcase ready to walk
here we go
martin and alice now perform as their characters detective john hathaway and mrs
rebecca hathaway im going to stay here and investigate
i think it would be safer if you leave town
i dont like it
what am i supposed to do go to michigan with you
preston walks past them acting in the background
mackinac islands beautiful this time of year
were tight on joe now watching alice
slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role sweetheart
this is my job
the dead coming back to life
i think youre in danger i have no choice you do have a choice
we all do
and holy shit alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines
not overdone not hammy
just fucking real
john ive never asked you to stop
ive never asked you to give up or walk away
charles watches in awe hes suddenly giddily transported
but its joe who as he stares becomes galvanized any vague interest in alice has just set but im asking you now please
dont go back
dont leave me
i need to know this isnt the last time ill see you
i just love you so much
martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance
i love you too
and in the heat of it alice looks at charles unsure was that okay
charles is stunned almost crying cant talk and as he searches behind him a light uh that was
that yeah good
just like that
then a distant airhorn charles looks an oncoming train
push in on charles tight
he turns to them all production value
is there film in the camera
i didnt put it in put it in

joe get the mike ready
go go preston get in position
martin get that tripod set up
joe help her with her costume
i hope we dont miss the train
preston get in position

i love how calm he is
yeah hes a very relaxed guy
joe laughs a little as he goes cary rips open a yellow super box joe grabs the mike cary inserts the film click
joe plugs in the mike charles grabs the camera everyone ready
be extra loud when the train passes by
oh god i hope it stops
theyre set to film toward alice the approaching train in her background charles puts on the headphones and
and theyre shooting im going to stay here and investigate
i think it would be safer if you left town for a couple of days
i dont like it
what am i supposed to do go to michigan with you
mackinac islands beautiful this time of year
this is my job
charles watches beaming with excitement
joe holds the boom looks to charles to make sure it sounds okay this is when he notices something in the distance
a quarter mile away a vehicle drives along the horizon
but the train is approaching getting louder which makes joe turn back toward the train the thing almost upon them louder and louder so the actors begin to yell over
john ive never asked you to stop
ive never asked you to give up or walk away
joe looks back at the headlights and sees something very odd the distant vehicle turns onto the tracks
push in on joe unsettled as the train crosses them now joe looks back toward alice a blast of air shockingly loud
but im asking you now please
dont go back
dont leave me
i need to know this isnt the last time ill see you
i just love you so much
alice and martin continue to yell their lines charles is almost laughing at how good this looks but joe looks desperately back toward the headlights the train lighting i love
and joe finally swings the mike down and yells guys watch out
joe what the hell are y
just then ba ba ba bam
the train engine hundreds of run
platform landing sideways still filming as the crash wave alice
joe we have to go
they run off
and then its over
just the odd dying chugs and screech screech screech of train wheels running out of momentum hisses of steam the unnatural bending of steel
in the dust joe lies frightened on the ground eyes tightly shut
his mind races his heart pounds and then a loud metal bang
joe stands up fast faces a mountain of twisted steel upside down train cars piled frighteningly around him
just another few feet and he wouldve been crushed
but what was that sound
then again slam
joe backs up afraid it was almost a labored groan mechanical or animal
a crazy screech another bang then again and again
we see joe tightly gripping his necklace locket in his hand then crash
awful loud and a twisted ten foot square joe covers his head as the metal stabs the ground twenty feet away a train sliding door
joe turns to see it stunned then back to the direction of the noise but it is gone
tight on charles camera on its side finishing up a guys
joe finds martin on his knees throwing up martin keeps throwing up but pumps a thumbs up
martin are you okay
preston is that you
though i think im having a heart attack
and i have a scrape
joe moves forward up to camera behind him cary appears smiling
this kid enjoyed the crash
guys did you see those explosions
that was awesome
has anyone seen alice
is anyone dead
through the debris steel and dust
joe moves forward charles shaken eyes wide appears through the thick dust joe moves forward looking at under a train wheel assembly
a puddle of blood and joes heart sinks as he moves toward it another woman he loves crushed
charles and preston and cary see the blood oh god no nonono
martin still sick calls out what
guys what is it
joe moves closer to the blood heartsick on the verge of deep real tears everything stops but then whats all that blood
joe whips around standing in the dusty mess is alice shaken but absolutely alive
joe just beams
whats the blood
did someone get hurt
but joe suddenly knows he moves to the blood reaches below the wheels the others watch freaked out joe wait maybe you shouldnt touch what are you careful
joe pulls out his crushed make up kit
he brightens its my fake blood
what is this stuff
alice notices that hes holding the necklace
joe notices this and pockets it self consciously
preston calls out guys what are these things
joe looks they all move to preston except cary who heads off crates have spilled from a nearby split car many shattered revealing thousands of small white metal cubes which
now litter the ground
joe kneels picks one up hey dont touch it what are you doing
they look like white rubiks cubes or something
theyre heavy like metal or something
theres like a billion of them
its just a few inches per side an unusual design
behind them having walked up the angled sides of overturned train cars cary calls out guys get up here
you can see everything from up here
they move up the mass of metal revealing a vast view of the wreck
it seems to stretch on forever
it is sobering
oh my god
look at that
according to my uncle seth an accident like this is exceptionally rare
it wasnt an accident
turns away eyes on the there was a truck
on the tracks
driving on the tracks
joes seen it
thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is the pick up truck
sheared in half upon impact and lying in the overgrown grass
how can a pick up truck derail a train
obviously it isnt
boom up from behind the shattered pick up as the kids approach from the wreckage
push in on them as they arrive at the truck and stop what they see makes joes heart pound theyre stunned all of them
they just stop
finally holy shit
is that him
covers her mouth yeah its him who
it is yeah for sure holy shit
who is that
we see now its dr
woodward seat belted bloody and unconscious stuck inside the crushed wreckage
alice moves closer scared and sad for him dr
no one can take their eyes off this as sotto thats dr
the science guy
im not in his class
shut up cary
remember when old man woodward took your electronic football
yeah he put it in the dungeon never gave it back
that trailer woodward keeps in the school parking lot
joe moves next to alice who reaches out and gently nudges him you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her dr
but hes apparently dead when she nudges him he leans his arm drops limp from the steering wheel where he was holding a paper that has now fallen onto the
joe picks it up
unfolds it its an old map thin off white paper
they hold it up the map now backlit and obscuring woodward
we see marker writing on it a black line from nevada to dayton and numbers written along the way
map of the contiguous united states
whats the writing
dates and times
whats that line across
its a schedule for the train
but a shadow has appeared a trembling hand before they can react it rips the map away they all scream as old dr
woodward is revealed bloody eyes open in a daze who who are you
theyre all speechless for a moment
finally too loudly dr
its charles kaznyk
from fourth period
youve been in an accident
they will kill you
do not speak of this or you and your parents will die
were on joes stunned face but distant voices make him turn his head hundreds of yards away through the wreck guys look the rest turn to look their minds are
racing all of them we shouldnt be here the kids start moving away my dad will de ball me
lets get out of here
now theyre sprinting flashlight men getting closer
charles arrives on the platform grabs his camera
alice hurries past hunting for her keys in that big purse she eyes the flashlight men getting closer joe grabs his make up kit another duffel runs for the car
past a whining charles
as the flashlight men approach joe runs and gets in the front seat the other boys in back alice slams the car into reverse screech backs up narrowly avoids debris
then rides off the flashlight men arrive soldiers their adrenaline pumping
one man who walks up to the camera eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion colonel nelec
he then looks to the ground in front of him
close on a fresh empty yellow super film box
nelec steps to it picks it up
looks at it
then back up at the disappearing car
we push in on his burning eyes and rrrrrrrroooooooooaaaaaarrrrrrrr
the buick speeds past
overlapping mayhem but charles obsesses over his camera holy shit that was insane
he had a gun
an actual physical gun
i cant believe all that just happened here
nothing ever my whole camera lends is like happens here
my heart is pounding
that train could of killed us
are you okay
as alice nervously drives she shakes her head no
oh shit all the glass just fell out
its hard enough to drive without everyone yelling
guys keep it down
joe what was woodward talking about
i dont know i dont know im never taking a train again
youll die your parents will die guys that is not good information
great the focus ring just fell off
no one cares about your camera

im also crying we cant tell anyone we were there we cant say a thing about it my dad cannot find out i took his car do you guys hear
its okay no ones saying anything
none of us
to his friends guys were not gonna say anything are we
the boys all muster nos
joe turns sweetly to alice
no ones gonna know
alice nods if not quite relieved at least grateful for joe
but they all stare off for a long beat
the buick speeds away
crane down as the buick pulls up
the dusty boys pile out
they all kind of look at each other
what a night
charles who looks at joe for a beat holds up his defunct camera on the tripod
alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out
joe this is yours
joe goes to the window
alice holds it out the cube
he takes it with oh thanks i should never have done this
she just drives away
left there are joe charles preston cary and martin
they all kind of look at alice go
joe in the bath
the quiet swish of water as joe holds the cubic object
he relives the night he mouths explosions
remembers the fear
then he smiles
joe is startled awake as if from a nightmare jack has awoken him quickly bucking his holster urgent gotta head in early okay make sure you let lucy out
i will pull back wide to see joes room while in the foreground is his desk crowded with stuff
in focus however is the cubed object he took from the crash site
as the shot progresses you may notice that the cube has changed shape you gonna what you with charles today
yeah ill be with charles make sure you get the yard
okay i will
jack heads off
tight shot joe fills lucys food dish with kibble
joe hurries across the street
typical kaznyk bustle father busily packs sack lunches
hot jen eats cereal reads a magazine
one twin plays handball loudly against a wall
peg keeps walking through the scene with clothes
mother cooks says to the other twin in grimy mom come on
youre not wearing that
no one in this house is wearing that
compared to debbies these are long
just listen to your mother
i cant wear these or go to wendys party
this is not fair
jennifer anne not fair is africa
are there anymore english muffins
i dont know go check
peg tell the twins to stop
they dont listen to me
it all continues as joe has entered from the front door
kaznyk hi joe
did you hear about the train accident
its on the news
joe is moving toward the living room where charles sits on the sofa eyes glued to the tv a train crash being reported on the local news helicopter shot of
the chyron reads train derailed air force aids clean up
joe sits beside charles
they both watch stunned as a photo of dr
woodward appears on the tv with the heading driver of truck can you believe this
its on the news
that means its real
meanwhile local science teacher thomas woodward is still being treated by air force medical personnel after last nights train derailment
woodward apparently fell asleep at the wheel of his pick up truck which was hit by the speeding train at approximately one am
eighty two train cars were thrown from the tracks in the derailment the largest such accident in ohios history
the condition of woodward who has taught at lillian middle school for the past six years remains unknown
both stare at the train crash stunned
finally quietly looks like a disaster movie doesnt it
and we push in on charles going from depressed and lost to oh my god joe
we can use this we can film it starts to smile you wanna go back
turns to him okay holy shit thats mint
youre a total brain
we gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night i gotta go steal some more money from my mom
joe and charles ride their bikes into town across a bridge the massive steel mill in the background if any of the footage from last night is usable that means
we need alice to play the wife again
yeah i thought she was good
she was mint but shes never gonna do it
i think she will
theres no way
you heard what she said
but that was before the new pages right

tilt down from the towns water tower joe and charles ride their bikes underneath it crossing main street two large military trucks drive past we may note the airman in
the passenger seat scans the area with a handheld device

joe watches louis get out of the car the man who got arrested at his mothers wake carrying a small grocery bag
he sees joe and darkens as he approaches whats this
he was just inviting me to a party
joe steps back as louis arrives louis seems to hate joe but at the same time can barely look at him shes not going to your party
louis throws alice a dark resentful glare
you know better than this
she nods uncomfortable
louis turns to joe you get outta her
you go home and dont come back i dont wanna see you
louis goes back inside
alice follows turns to joe
as awkward moment between them
then quietly conflicted ill do it
she closes the door
alone despite it all joe is happy
off his smile we hear loud pops bam
martin as detective hathaway fires a gun shooting cary dressed in a dirty suit as a man turning into a zombie his eyes wide and glossy white and as he
is hit by the bullets he slams his hand onto his chest blood bursts all over him and he falls painfully to the ground
we then find charles behind his camera yelling out cut
that was mint
and it looked huge with the train
joe go reload the cap gun
wide shot rising past six bicycles thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble
charles joe and preston with joes dads kodak camera on tripod have been filming their gear scattered
keep moving over them to martin and alice who were on camera
beyond them in the valley the train crash seems to go forever
military trucks tents and soldiers
helicopters buzz in the distant sky
joe moves over to alice who looks out at the crash
during all this well get the other direction next alice that was mint martin go a little faster next time
ill try but im still crying about last night i feel like im crazy
cary sits pulls off the cut out ping pong balls that were covering his closed eyes
did it really look good
close on joe as he arrives beside alice who looks out at the train haunted
quiet what do you think happened
joe stops reloading the gun looks out gets lost as well
you mean why he crashed the train
i just got a horrible feeling
martin has arrives there too
preston too anyone else still shaking from the crash
i got in my parents bed last night
havent done that since i was eleven
joe suddenly walks away from them back toward the camera
did i just insult him
joe grabs the camera near charles dude what are you doing
joe moves the camera back to alice he looks through the lens uses the zoom and we see joes pov the crash zoomed in he pans from one car to
alice watches joe who peers into the camera for a long beat finally standing up looking out at the crash
that whole things an air force train
the kids sit at a table at the window
the car lot is across the street
theyre talking excitedly but quietly i make models plastic ones you know glue em paint em and hes not embarrassed by that
looks whos talking math camp
a waitress is there delivering more food thanks could i have a coffee please
cream on the side
she heads off
cary smiles at alice
he is so sophisticated
shut up i like coffee
no one likes coffee
air force trains even models have these hooks
ooo ooo ooo
they do for when their train cars are put on transport ships
every car in that crash had hooks every one
joe stop talking about it
am i the only one who doesnt understand what this all means
shut up i dont like that dr
woodward had that map
he drove onto the tracks
maybe there was something he wanted to destroy he wanted to destroy
please shut up all of you
i say he was just sick of being old and wanted to kill himself
he had a gun why not use that
there are infinitely more effective ways to commit suicide pills pussy stop pulling the fries away
i ordered these for a reason
he gets all possessive with his fries its so annoying
you could jump from a building
fall down stairs
well thats not really effective
so if its air force what would the air force have on a train
you heard what the old man said we cant talk about this
to waitress with coffee thank you very much
drowning hari kari also known as seppuku
excuse me could we please get another order of fries because my friend here is fat
funny chompers at least i dont use a booster seat
what was your teacher even talking about
who are we supposed to be afraid of anyway
i dont wanna find out guys we gotta forget we were there
you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad too
this lands for joe for all of them as we cut to the massive train wreck that goes on for a mile
hundreds of military work to clean up fast
a truck drives past camera taking us to jack and nelec who walk together amid the debris
choppers land and take off in the background yes i understand this crash has caused a whole mess of confusion
as you can expect the local authorities are trying to figure out just what happened here as well as how to help you out
its under control
itll be a very fast clean up
colonel there isnt anything i should know is there
not that i can think of deputy
i understand you have concerns about our cargo
id like to see that manifest yes
thats not going to be possible
colonel ive got a lot of people in my town that are gonna want to know whats taking place
what town is that
deputy if youre asking me if we had any dangerous property on board this train i can assure you the answers no
jack looks at nelec not quite believing him
jack is with sheriff pruitt who stands distracted picking up reports from his desk on his way out
they gave me the run around for two hours before i was allowed to talk to anyone
id say they have their hands full wouldnt you
nelec the colonel refused to show me their manifest said they were carrying mostly airplane parts its air force jack
airplane parts sorta make sense
sheriff im telling you theres something else going on theyre taking molds of tire tracks now why would they be doing that
who are they looking for
and theyre packing these weird little cubes into crates and theyre weird little cubes
yeah into these red trucks dozens of these trucks and im telling you theyre scrambling to get the hell outta there id say thats a good thing wouldnt you
sheriff i think you need to go check it out
and i think you need a break
jack ive been telling you this since elizabeth
youre a good deputy
but you need to take a vacation
take off your uniform
and give your son a hug
pruitt walks off
jack unsettled watches him go
fingers tapping theyre fingers on a counter a walkman sitting beside them
boom up to year old breen who digs the blondie hes listening to
he is alone in the station store
behind him year old sheriff pruitt enters
hey breen im not sure edies paying you to listen to the radio
breen doesnt respond
the sheriff throws a candy bar at him
breen pulls off the headphones
its like a stereo play your own cassette tapes
you wanna try it
pays for the candy bars i dont think so
kids walking around with their own stereos
just what we need
its a slippery slope
he exits the store
pruitt heads out breen puts the headphones on again
we see were at the lonely gas station the kids drove past earlier
pruitts squad car filling up the only car here
high overhead a yellow kelvin sign turns atop a tall pole near the road
pruitt crosses to his car
peels the candy bar
hearing something he turns a pack of dogs run by
a close up of the pumps spinning white number on black the gallons and dollar amount blurring higher then a bizarre reflection pruitt sees it turns and what he sees
is tall and terrifying he drops the candy goes for his breen eyes closed blasts his walkman we only hear tinny music as through the window behind him the rear of the squad car suddenly springs upward violently as if the front section was suddenly crushed
pruitt screams muffled as the car slams back to the pavement lights flicker gas pumping onto the asphalt screams of pruitt horrible pruitts screams end as breen opens his eyes
and rips off the headphones the hell was that
he looks outside sees the car shattered windows
confused he heads out breen moves tentatively toward the crushed car quickly glances for pruitt whos missing
he gets close to the car confounded by what he sees hands shaking he rights the pump and replaces it
his heart pounds as he starts for the building but slips on the gas falls hard looks up sees whatevers coming for him screams as he gets to his feet
and runs like a motherfucker breen rushes inside were with him as behind him kkkrash
an explosion of glass and junk food and
we look down upon the station from up high where the turning lit kelvin sign blocks our view for the moment we can only hear the horror happening inside the
station until finally the sign reveals the station everything inside looks like its in a blender theres a super human upheaval happening in there and breens screams continue as the turning kelvin sign blocks our view again as the a face
a make up brush applying make up
its alice and shes becoming a zombie
we are joe makes her up a not half bad simple zombie make up
pale skin sunken eyes and cheekbones
in the background the other kids prepare to film
he hands her a mirror she gazes into it sort of amazed
whered you learn how to do this
mostly the dick smith monster make up handbook
charles is suddenly there with cary hey
so im gonna need more shots of the train crash obviously you know that train model you made
can we blow it up and film it
joe doesnt want to do this at all
charles and cary head off planning the explosions
alice looks at him knowingly
i dont care they can blow it up
i can show you the train its nothing its stupid
you wanna see it
my train model
the train i made
the lights in the house dim brown out then back on
thats like the third time dude
so how am i supposed to be a zombie
just be a lifeless ghoul
someone with no soul dead eyes
dyou ever have mrs
yeah like her
but hungry like hungry for human flesh
to make them turn into zombies because thats what zombies do
alice considers this then after a beat starts doing her best zombie
joe smiles cause its pretty good
oh my god
thats really good
and alice slowly leans in toward him is this performance
or is this something else
and she puts her mouth on his neck in a fake bite which makes joe go still a shiver down his spine hes never felt anything like this in his
and when she pulls back her performance over shes smiling
he doesnt know what to say tries to stay cool
were near the gas pumps low to the ground dolly as jack edie and mr
blakely come out here
we pass small shattered pieces of red and blue plastic and stop and rack to the gun sheriff pruitt dropped
careful there was a gas spill
i dont even know how much fuel ive lost
you dont seem to be asking a lot of questions
give this man some time mr
hes just the deputy hes not the sheriff
jack kneels by the smith and wesson model
jack pulls out a handkerchief lifts the fun push in on the engraved initials h
jack is rocked by this
he opens the cylinder to check if it had been fired
cut back wide
no squad car here
jack checks out the broken blue and red plastic as he makes a walkie call i think this is most likely a bear attack
remember when i said you talk too much
well this is the time
vicky ya heard from sheriff pruitt this morning
negative still no word
vicky i need you to have dayton send a cs unit out to edies
you put out an apb on the sheriff and breen haskell send units to their houses immediately
you copy all of that
and jack were getting a lot of unusual calls
what kind of unusual calls
angry izzy opens a new car hood pieces of the engine ripped away messy dolly with him jack follows never seen this kinda thing before
izzy opens another car hood pieces missing
what the hell am i supposed to do
insurance company thought i was joking with him
look at my bonneville here look at this
i got a call about this car yesterday
what am i going to tell the customer
having trouble with anyone lately izzy
i was thinking you should talk to louis dainard
i didnt help him out with financing last year wouldnt be surprised if this was some sorta sick retribution
as jack heads back to his car three residents move to him walk with him ad lib some strange shit has been dyou call the station going on
my antennas gone yet
you need to call the our dog is gone he hasnt station
and file a report come home this morning before anything can be done jack my lights keep going on about it
and then we can and off
counting on you take care of these things
you do that for me i promise you ill handle it myself
he seems to have appeased them but as he turns we see how stressed he is
he stops noticing four military trucks driving past slowly antennas atop the trucks and the men inside seemingly scanning the area
jack is disturbed by this
joe rides along a hillside
parks his bike
walks toward the edge
he stops to reveal the town of lillian
joe rides the street calling out lucy
wide shot as he dips down a neighborhood hill sun low
a community corkboard
joe posts up a piece of paper we see it now in close up
its a missing dog sign for lucy
were on joes face as he finishes pinning it up when something he sees makes him stop
he slowly takes a step back
his eyes glued to the board
then we see the reverse slowly pulling back revealing signs posted on the board
its covered in them
joe is so stunned he doesnt notice the military trucks that pass in the background behind him
ka bam back door opens joe enters
empty pizza box on the table
jack and four police officers in the living room smoking reviewing police reports marking maps taking notes we need more help around here
weve got four men on the pruitt case alone
weve called into dayton theyll be out in the
thats not enough
people dont feel safe here and you know why
cause theyre not the officers agree
joe moves into the doorway where his dad and other convene
the air force isnt answering a damn question theyve got trucks at woodwards house looking for theyve got trucks all over town
i saw a guy riding shotgun in one of those trucks had some kind of scanner in his hand like a geiger counter or i know
theyre saying its just clean up at the train crash but theyre taking molds of tire tracks
which means theyre looking for someone now whats that about
joe has heard this and dropped his flashlight the men all turn silent
joe on the spot have you
im sure shes around
i put a couple of slices in the fridge for you there
oh i ate those
sorry kid thats
okay ill find a then the power goes out the men react it flickers on and off jack grabs his radio a the power returns
vicky you got power at the station
on and off
brook countys in the dark
get water and power out there now
joe paints his model on the floor of his living room watching in search of and talking to charles on his walkie talkie
so the air force is looking for a car alices dads car theyre taking tire prints from the crash site
i dont wanna hear about it
they could be monitoring us right now
jesus shut up
and the militarys at woodwards house
looking for his research
whatever that means
joe you can not flake out on me and be a dick
are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not
i need you to make alice a zombie again
and joe tries to snap himself out of it
but is disturbed
ill do the make up
wide shot middle of nowhere wooded area as an ohio power cherry picker truck drives up parks beside a utility pole
cigarette in his mouth makes notes on a weathered clipboard
glances at the power line
doesnt understand what he sees push in on him
he radios in this is rooney at mary was there re routing on this line
negative but the grid through liberty is dark
yeah cause theres no overhead lines on these poles
no power no comm cables
he drives again we see a wide shot of the landscape the truck comes to a stop roadside
tall trees and a salvage yard behind them
push in on rooney who calls in we got over a half mile of copper missing
that doesnt sound possible
lines are back up at m
in the cherry picker bucket rooney works the controls
he begins lifting a wide shot shows him rising to the bare utility pole stepdown transformer
when rooney finally gets to the top with gloves hands he inspects the transformer
after a moment though he stops
hears something else past the sound of electricity
he looks over toward the salvage yard
except its mostly hidden by the trees
from here rooney can only see the tops of the junk piles
a small metallic crash
rooney cranes his neck to get a view
another metallic crash this time glass breaking too
then in the distance at the middle of the salvage yard something flies into the air rooney strains his eyes to see what the hell was that
a tin can
a piece of a fender
hard to tell from here
then thrown into the air a car tire
it lands with a thud
rooney then uses the bucket controls moves backward and up a touch higher toward the transformer not exactly watching how close he is getting
an entire junked motorcycle flies into the air discarded twirling and crash lands out of sight
rooney is stunned
as the metallic rummaging sounds continue rooney moves the bucket even higher when suddenly his bucket beep beeps loudly a warning hes too high and he suddenly stops it and
the beeping stops but so do the rummaging sounds
silence save for the eerie hum of power
wants a better view so he begins to lower the bucket
were in a wide shot seeing his descend painfully slowly
then were in a long lens close up of rooney as he slowly drops tight on him as hes looking over toward the salvage yard and it takes us a
minute to realize theres fucking movements until the truck is motionless
then noise and an amplified voice i wanna know who took em
a loud town meeting
two hundred frustrated citizens crowd the auditorium
jack at the podium town officials including the local mayor sit on stage as well
babbit speaks into the microphone on the floor
twenty microwave ovens gone from my inventory
brook countys without power this feels to me like a russian invasion
the town roars its approval jack impotent tries mrs
babbit i dont believe the russians have anything to do with whats happening in town but im calling the curfew because w until you can tell me whos messing with
us i say its the soviets and were at war
i like you jack but we need sheriff pruitt back
the town erupts in agreement we have good people working on that
a short bald man of mr
mccandless speaks since wednesday morning my ham radios been a mess all sorts of frequencies i like to scan
some kind of buzz modulation have you found that
mccandless can i speak with you for a moment privately
the mayor takes over as jack has a sidebar meeting with mr
it was like having my that must be very annoying radio hi jacked you dont know the frequencies off hand do you
sure i do to pulls out paper pen
jack hurries from the town meeting to the station jack all the tools in the garage are gone
patty get in touch with vicky
david have you seen milner
no sir i havent seen him
theres a sink hole in my garage
it almost sank a foot
tom have you seen milner
have you tried his office
check his office
the powers been out for days jack continues into dolly fast with an exasperated jack as he writes tailed by rosko i need you to get every radio we have
and you tune to these frequencies understand
hey danny you have a radio scanner with a descrambler dont you
voice inverter yeah
whatever get it down and set it up for me
what is this
i think the air force is using he heads for his office seeing louis who is being escorted out by an officer across the room
hey he was at my house yesterday morning are you aware of that
quiet to jack we brought him in about the car lot and other things hes clean
id appreciate it if you would inform your son that my house if off limits
and so it my daughter
louis heads out hold on jack as he turns enters his office and as that door opens we cut to the door opens of his messy motherless room
joe and alice enter
he could not be more self conscious
he moves stacks of comic tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed pair of underwear and socks
he closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair
she looks around sa she enters
the light dim intimate
oh gawd i didnt clean up
joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to the floor notebooks and school work spill out and we get a glimpse of some b minuses
and other c pluses in red
joe embarrassed hides them then moves to his models you made all these
yeah thats the hunchback of notre dame
i watched that one on tv
alice sits on the bed
joe takes the five car train model
she moves close this is the train they wanna destroy
alice hold it
joe watches her
she really looks at it
it looks real
beat studies it looks so old
thats dry brush technique
off her look after youve painted the base color you take something like
grabs up testors bottle euro gray
her face is so close to his
her hair touches his ear
there are so many different grays its crazy
and you pour a little onto like a paper plate
then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in then you brush on the paper so the paints barely on the brush
then you make small brush strokes on the model
little ones like where the wear and tear would be
around the wheels
or where the doors would slide
then you do it again like with camouflage gray or here i used insignia red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before
like they painted over it but you could see it scratched off
lost in thought he looks at her
suddenly self conscious
what was that necklace
off his awkward stare the one you were holding at the train crash
was it your moms
it takes him a beat
finally my dad gave it to her the day i was born
she wears it all the time
it was bad how she died and stuff but they got the necklace back
their tension interrupted by an out of breath charles guys what the hell
no one knew where you were
were sitting right here
you gotta be the soldier
i thought you were calling evan
evan blew us off hes a pussy
you gotta do it
youre the only one
jack with officer tally the hell do you mean you found my dog in brookville
lucy thats where she is
weve gotten nearly thirty calls from people who have found local dogs
thing is the calls coming in arent local
tally puts a map on his desk dots in a circle anywhere from a to mile radius with lillian at the center
its like they all just
ran away every direction
jack is stunned
officer rosko at his desk with a young woman a ham radio at his desk beside a reel to reel tape deck
he takes notes its not her
she nevers disappeared before
now what does she look like
shes got dark hair it was in rollers
do you know what rollers are
yes i know what rollers are
she went to her car suddenly a garbled electronic sound from the ham radio
rosko quickly hits record on the reel to reel he grabs speaker turns the volume knob puts the speaker close to the tape recorder turns on recorder
four officers gather as jack plays back the reel to reel through milners descrambler
he writes down as they listen to mens voices creepily filtered and broken up zero niner center opera ad lib ocal position fangs out
listen thats air force
cop confirm operation what are they doing walking distance is six transmitting on these three niner retur frequencies
maybe they dont erations
want anyone to find em
maybe theyre not air force
whats he say
military vehicles parked everywhere
personnel removing boxes from the house packing it all up
but out front joe is dressed as an airman performing with martin dressed as the detective
military trucks surround the house
hathaway is with a i came as soon as i could whats happening here
military police investigation
it was a suicide
who was it
a former air force officer
he called me last night said he had a secret that he couldnt keep any longer
officer joe hands hathaway a file
hathaway looks at it
he worked at romero chemical
he found out some things the companys been doing
after what you told me at the bar i thought you should know
cary behind the camera charles beside him are we gonna get in trouble here
its for the movie
this proves it
they knew the company knew
thank you so much for the information
we just made the discovery ourselves
you understand this is top secret
i would never have given you this information if you and i hadnt served together in vietnam
as it continues we see alice behind the camera watching joe smiling
but then she sees something that disturbs her jacks cruiser pulls up
a dozen officers go through hundreds of cardboard boxes of documents
books and personal belongings are put into boxes taken from the house
overmyer enters crosses to nelec who reviews a folder
nothing so far
how much more is there
sixty boxes in the basement maybe more
what more tax returns
its here somewhere
if we cant find it woodwardll tell us where it is
but nelec has seen something outside the kids
the hells that
looks like kids making a movie
behind them a window showing the street where jack insists joe get into the car
nelec looks out sees jack take joe by the arm grab the tripod and head to his squad car
as jack gets out he sees the kids and isnt happy
he moves toward joe and his friends joe
joe spins around as jack arrives grabs his camera from charles and saying firmly to joe get in the car
joe is stunned instantly humiliated in front of alice hes taken back to the squad car uh mr
thats your camera but technically thats my film
jack opens the cars back door joe gets in jack slams it shut then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and slams that door heading to the
house leaving joe in the back
nelec heads outside jack moves to him i would like to help you out deputy
i really would
but we operate on a need to know basis
why are your trucks sweeping the town
well be out of your way shortly
then im sure you wouldnt mind me contacting dc
talk to some friends about walking distance
this lands on nelec
well do it that way
jack heads off
just not here
jack stops turns to uncomfortable nelec
joe his breathing heavying sits in the car heart pounding watching his father move over to talk to nelec close again
then he looks over at his friends charles giving him a what the fuck
alice watches him sympathetically
she mouths to him a guilty
is it me
and joe shakes his head no
but we and she know better
the squad car pulls up
jack gets out joe follows the
jack enters then lets joe pass him
joe closes the door hard and says angrily but restrained this is new
for the both of us
dealing with all this just us
so im going to make this as clear and simple as i can youre not friends with alice dainard
when i say no i dont mean maybe
i dont mean yes
i mean no
ive known louis dainard for alotta years hes been nothing but trouble
your mother used to say hes not a bad guy he just needs a chance hes just sad well i tried to be good to him but i cant
i will not allow him or his daughter in this house
i will not allow you spending time with her doing projects or whatever it is that youre doing
i hope were clear
jack turns to leave but joe enraged says were not clear
jack stops stunned joes heart pounds whatd you say
were not clear
you and i arent clear about anything
we couldnt be less clear
joseph francis lamb just cause mom died doesnt mean you know anything about me
you dont know about alice either shes kind
im not having this discussion with you
shes nice to me
i dont care what she is
her father is a selfish irresponsible son of a bitch
jack moves close to joe intimidating joe steps back jack is fucking intense you listen to me ive got twelve thousand people in this town that are scared out of
their minds theyve got one person they can rely on it used to be someone else but now its just me
jack suddenly stops himself realizing what hes saying
and to whom hes saying it
but somehow in this moment he cant be a better father than law officer
more upset at himself than joe he heads out
joe rides up a hill boom up reveal the town cemetery
joe sits his back against his mothers grave
holds her open locket staring at it
hes just come here for comfort
but then a sound and joe turns
deep and low in the distance
joe is motionless
hears it again
he stands pulls out his flashlight aims the beam down rows of graves toward the big caretakers shed in the distance
another intense low sound then a high pitch hit like metal on wood and joe backs up nervous
another odd sound then another which transitions us to jacks squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield
jacks car pulls up
he gets out of the car
suddenly the three large military trucks headlights come on all aimed at jack he is blinded tries to see hello
and now bodies are seen of soldiers holding and aiming weapons
then a voice over a truck pa drop your weapons
put your hands on the car
im here to see colonel nelec
he told me to meet him here
youre under military arrest
drop your weapons
tight on nelec
past an iv and medical machinery
hes looking at someone we dont yet see
in the background overmyer stands watching
nelec is quiet simple i dont want any more trouble
now we see who hes talking to
battered and scraped he lies in a medical bed afraid but defiant
weve been going through your belongings looking for evidence
of what you knew how you knew it
and who else might know
i remember you
in the lab
and i recall we didnt see eye to eye but thats no excuse for doing what you did here
feels that his time on earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here
by the door overmyer is quietly putting on his black gloves
so in the spirit of moving forward and avoiding more trouble tell us where you put your research
i know you had someone document the crash that night
tell me who that was and ill help you i swear to god
on my mothers life if you help us now we will take care of you
ive seen what happens mr
nelec when you take care of people
im going to bait him
im going to catch him
hes in me you know
as i am in him
so when you see him next as im sure you will
ill be watching you too
nelec offers a vague searching smile
but woodward will not not ever relent
nelec moves to the door he remains facing camera his back to woodward as overmyer moves to the bed
push in on nelecs face understanding his true nature joe sleeps power still out
then a knock
he wakes up
he moves to it
joe is half asleep but also stunned
very quietly are you were you sleeping
before earlier b no you okay
oh you wanna come in
and alice climbs in
joe sits on the floor
alice does too
its odd and silent for a moment
powers still out
rooms still messy
i was in bed couldnt sleep
i wanted to tell you something before tomorrow dont let charles blow up your train
joe stares amazed at her
i dont think its right do you
i know hes your friend but hes so he can be sorta li ive known him since kindergarten though he shouldnt always get what he wants
i mean who always gets what they want
i know i dont know you at all
it sort of feels like i do
do you not
feel like that
no i totally do im just
sort of in shock at this whole and the power returns joes clock light goes on behind him but more chilling the projector comes back on the silent home movie
of his mother plays
joe crawls to the projector to stop it but no keep it please alice moves closer to the screen
joe sits behind her
she watches the film
cant take her eyes away
is that her
and as alice watches we gently push in
as tears start to fill her eyes
behind her at a near whisper its so weird watching her like this like shes still here
beat lost in it she used to look at me this way
like really look
and i just
knew i was there
that i existed
a tear drops down alices face though joe cant see that
finally quietly he drank that morning
he missed his shift
beat hard your mom took it for him
the day of the accident
watching his mother joe is quietly stunned
finally eyes wet alice turns to joe
i know he wishes it was him
instead of her
and sometimes i wish it was too
joe just stares at her
heartsick and speechless
finally dont say that
hes your dad
just then the super movie ends the film flipflipflips
joe turns off the projector but a sound remains
a sort of shudder hum
joe unplugs the projector but the sound remains
then they look the shuddering is coming from the cube he took from the crash site sitting on his desk
joe and alice move to it
he turns on his desk lamp
the cube vibrates almost imperceptibly
joe opens a drawer grabs a paintbrush he touches the cube the thing shudders on its own
they are amazed
they get low eyes at desk level the shuddering increases in pitch and volume he reaches out to touch it with his finger but suddenly the cube bullets away five
inch hole in the wall
she screams they both fall to the floor stunned push in on joe his heart pounding
he moves to the wall looks through the hole in the distance trees and the town water tower
alice enters the dark house quietly
she steps carefully toward her room when morning
his voice makes her jump
she turns sitting in the dark in an armchair is her father
you wanna tell me where you were
or you want me to tell you
a tense beat her mind races
breathe alice just breathe
i should go to bed
i wanna talk to you
i said sit down
i dont want to sit down
be just like your mother and leave
this kills her but she does she leaves the house
alice crying gets on her bike and rides off a distant fiery glow past the factory and over the hills
the front door opens louis comes out and yells miserable but shes far gone louis mind races he runs to his buick starts it up pulls out fast and goes
after her alice pedals hard she wants to escape everywhere
no cars on the street no people
a block behind her screech a car turns onto the road
her fathers car she makes a turn were with louis as he drive clearly drunk alice makes a daring stop turns back up the hill pedals hard crying and hyperventilating
louis sees her tries to stop but cant and his car slams alice gasps stops pedaling looks back at her fathers car wide eyed and terrified should she go back
louis is bleeding
he adjusts himself painfully then looks into the cracked glass rear view
alive is still looking back at the car so she doesnt see the shape that is coming behind her and just as she decides im not going back she turns
to begin riding on louis tries to get out of the car but its painful and his door is jammed shut he goes for the passenger door when louis finally gets out he runs from his car stumbling drunk and bleeding screaming shredding his but all thats there is her bike and before he can even get that far louis falls hard onto the pavement crying a drunken horrified shocked battered mess
in a wide shot louis is in the middle of the street alices fallen bike on the sidewalk
in the great distance the water tower
we boom down in a massive wide shot of a field at night
then a long lens shot of six soldiers standing in the field
but one stands out front wearing a flame thrower
and suddenly the quiet is broken by the roar of flame
a wide wide overhead shot as the flames arc in the tall dry grass
over the radio firelight is hours
operation walking distance is in effect
t minus four hours until evacuation
evacuation is t minus four hours
the distant factory the even more distant mountains and an ominous plume of smoke a far off siren is heard
then why are you not reacting
joe stands at the counter with charles who is in a bad mood
that thing went through my wall
i told you not to pick it up in the first place
what are you so angry about
that im not going to let you blow up my train
thats part of it
juts a part
donnys returned with a developed film envelope
a red rush stamp on it
he gives charles his change tall your sister donny from olsens broke up with karen that shit ended a week ago
charles heads off joe follows
as charles rides off with the film joe follows and we boom up along the water tower as they go whats your problem
my whole movies a disaster cause of you
i know my dads being a turkey
were still gonna finish your movie
its not about the movie
what are you talking about
of course it is
just forget it
theres nothing wrong as we continue booming up we arrive at the top of the water tower where the cube has affixed itself to the side unseen from the street
in the distance the threatening fire as joe and charles ride their bikes up to his house ill get the camera back i know where my dad put it we
can still make the festival
its not about the movie
then what is it about
jesus you dont even get it do you
gawd youre a dumb ass
frustrated beyond belief charles goes inside
charles threads the film into the projector
that night of the crash you started getting all weird
attitude all of a sudden
your movie was over
thats what you said
you were upset
i gave you a camera
i helped you
dont pretend like you did it for me
you didnt do it for me and you know it
whats your problem
charles rolls the film dims the lights it was never about me
it was always about alice
and suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet there she is alice from the night of the train crash
the scene plays as they filmed it john
i dont like it
what am i supposed to do go to michigan with you
the filmed scene continues as joe and charles argue well youre the one who wanted the wife in the movie
not so you could fall in love with her
joes mind spins how does he respond to this
what do you even care what i think about alice
because i like her
thats why i asked her in the first place
so i could get to know her not you
wait you like alice dainard
youre such an idiot
from charles movie guys look out
they watch for a moment as the train crash happens but its so sudden so fast the camera picks up almost nothing
within a moment the camera is on its side filming the settling debris
charles moves forward so the film is now partially being projected on him
look at all that smoke
we cant use any of this
and you wont even let me blow up your train
we can make another train and blow that one up
joe moves forward
part of the film projected on him too
i do like her
sorry about that
thats not even what bothers me
beat finally sad its that she likes you too
that really bothers me
but joe has seen something on the screen sotto charles
i know its stupid
what would she ever like me
i havent leaned out yet which the doctor says is gonna but joe has slapped charles arm his eyes locked to the screen charles looks too and now we see
it through the from the train car through the wreckage what the hell is it
too damn big mostly out of frame its shape and flesh too bizarre we only see the legs as it clears frame joe what the hell
on film then from outside an air raid siren ramps whining through the town
the boys look at each other afraid
quick close ups as they rewind the film and rip it wide shot of the neighborhood in the distance military trucks jeeps and buses drive
neighbors coming from their homes in the mid ground confusion and talk more vehicles
finally as we boom down rack to joe and charles trying to make sense of this joe calls to a passing adult mr
whats going on
harkin points joe turns to look we pan the distant various shots of military busses stopping soldiers ordering and assisting people onto vehicles carrying all the belongings they can
others quickly load up cars strapping belongings to the roof
over all this
due to a wildfire that is raging out of control and threatening to reach the lillian chemical plant other people in a panic running to find others who are lost
a little girl cries amid the madness
an evacuation has been called for your safety
please remain calm and as you board the bus
joe and charles get on frightened and uncomfortable
outside the madness of the evac they scan the crowd
you see your family anywhere
no you see your dad
the evacuation buses drive through main street passing soldiers who are moving in the red cargo trucks that we may recognize from the train crash site the contents from the
super wide shot as an endless line of buses cars and trucks makes its way from lillian to
the buses drive past the guard gate into the base into the huge hangar that we were in earlier
those who drove themselves park their cars and are ushered to the hangar
donny steps out of his pontiac catalina carrying a duffel
rack focus to see were in the bus with joe who has seen donny and they drive inside the hangar armed air force and national guard soldiers direct masses of
people carrying luggage and belongings
move with joe and charles who scan for familiar faces suddenly charles mother is there embraces charles
charles charles sweetheart are you okay
i went back to the house and you were gone
they made us get on the bus
im gonna find my dad
you gonna tell him about that thing
come back if you cant find him
he heads off
orders are being barked residents can be heard complaining and arguing
walkie squawks and pa announcements as soldiers check their wrist bands
joe passes an arguing man and soldier i need to go back to my sir the town is sealed house i left some medication off no one is allowed back
that my wife needs you can talk to the nurses no we cant get it here the town must stay anywhere else i need to go empty until weve been given back the all clear boom up to reveal the evac center
a thousand people so far
louis lies in a cot in the triage unit fifty beds transferred from the hospital
louis stares off head bandaged eyes open muttering to himself like a man as tired hung over injured and in shock as he is
find joe who is looking everywhere for his dad he finally sees louis and hurries to him
dainard its joe lamb
i know you dont like me sir and im sorry about that but im looking for my dad and louis grabs his shirt and pulls him close
in a voice desperate and heartsick he says it took her
long beat sotto what

big like nothing it was and no one
no one believes me
no one believes me they just keep giving me pills
it took her
joe it took alice

jen suddenly closes her magazine stares at him suspiciously

jen looks right as us vulnerable but seductive
this whole evacuation things freaking me out

saw you over here and thought maybe we could kick back
now we see donny looking right at us
we totally could
i asked charles about you and he said youre a great guy i totally am
will you hate me if i start our relationship by asking a favor
moving past as donny moves through parked cars joe charles cary and martin keeping up so there are rules to being in my car okay
where the hell are we going anyway
were going to the school to open the trailer woodward had in the parking lot
i bet thats where he keeps his research
the boys duck as soldiers pass by
were gonna learn everything we can about that thing so we can find it
and thats how were gonna save alice
dorks no shoes on the upholstery and no one touches the cb gottit
you think woodwards got information about that thing in the dungeon
why else are there padlocks on the door
were going to the school
when did this one get so bossy
a small tiled room no windows
jack up all night and pissed off but bored being pissed off pounds on the door hey
i gotta take a leak
what am i supposed to do piss in here
he pounds again
the door finally unlocks and opens
a year old humorless armed soldier stands there
thanks for the hospitality
jack is led down a dilapidated narrow hall
soldier with the semi auto behind him aimed at his back
as jack passes an open door he spies an empty office through the window on the tarmac are a few military vehicles a handful of airmen
jacks mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall jack turns so am i going in alone or are y
slam flattened by jack who kneels to him
push in close his eyes wide mind racing what the hell next
behind a soldier as he runs through the dark building oh shit he comes to a stop back against the wall but push in on his face its jack in
an air force uniform
he is fucking scared at least hes holding a rifle
he peels around a corner through a window the tarmac guards vehicles
jacks eyes shift he spots an aircraft fuel tank
eyes wild a metallic cli chunk as he unsafeties the a soldier crosses to a vehicle on his radio when kafa booooom
the fuel tank explodes a massive blast
the airmen take cover run to move nearby vehicles general mayhem and our camera booms up to the military jeep that drives jack behind the wheel he blasts the vehicle
through the exit along the road back to town jack drives up in the jeep comes to a stop in shocked close up we see in the distance the mass of vehicles driving from town jacks mind races the jeep races past camera we pan revealing as donny drives joe shotgun
charles cary and martin in back
well so guys if the air force has already searches woodwards house wouldnt theyve already searched the classroom too
hay donny this car is gnarly
i was thinking about that too
maybe the classroom but not the dungeon
yeah woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon
wheres the dungeon
what kind of music does she like
i dont care
disco i guess
i could get back into disco
we shouldnt take river road they had a roadblock
i saw it
donny yanks the steering wheel he turns onto a dirt road the car rumbles away from camera donnys car pulls up lights go off
the kids pile out so what i wait here like a douche
thank you very much
do you have a tire iron
a shot of the boys climbing a fence
they move fast across the alley to a trailer locked with a padlock the dungeon
joe tries prying the locks off with the tire iron it doesnt budge
joe let me try let me try
joe hands the tire iron to charles he tries nothing
as martin grabs the tire iron joe this is impossible man
martin breaks off the latch bam
i loosened it for you
now we cut to darkness were inside the dungeon as it opens the boys look directly at us their faces say it all the mother lode
look at all this junk
hes got movies in here
the boys with flashlights turn a corner hurry down the hall i cannot believe were breaking into school who does that
no one does that idiots do that the boys break a classroom door window and enter
were looking down at the boys surrounded by hundreds of documents boxes photographs mm film cannisters and cassette tapes
charles threads the film
woodward was dishonorably discharged from nellis air base in because of subversive conduct whatever that is
joe holds up a year old photo of men in a lab
among them is year old woodward dude check it out
old man woodward
back when he was like middle aged man woodward
hes been tracking this thing since like
to the movie what is this
i dont know
it says april th incident
cary we got to find this thing
cary puts a cassette into a tape deck hits play i told them this creature is more sophisticated than any of us
that his species thats him subterranean
hes being subterranean treated without compassion or respect
various shots of photographs and documents ufo crash living restraints used experiments conducted as charles threads a film the film an air force logo pops on and off
we see inside a hangar where dozens of scientists examine large bus sized pieces of jagged and unearthly material
all the while i explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship
a craft made up of those cubes of a complex shape shifting element remarkable material that well never fully understand
he has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in but instead of giving him the help he needs weve held him as a prisoner
hes been restrained and experimented upon through pain and lack of compassion we have taught him to hate us all
weve turned him into an enemy
scientist explaining something to a group of senior officers
among them a year old nelec
film jump cuts to a huge reinforced lab cage
inside sitting almost in a ball is the massive creature
hard to see here
another jump cut as a soldier offers a bucket of food to the alien its woodward
guys its dr
woodward offers what looks like raw meat to the motionless sitting creature
all the boys watch quietly then suddenly in milliseconds the creature is up grabbing woodward through the bars the boys jump arh
i cant watch that
i told them i knew these things because he made contact with me
that he makes a psychic connection by touch
the moment we made contact i understood him and he me
what i know is that if we dont change this and start helping him we will all pay the price
but nelec wont listen the boys are scared as they watch the creature hold woodward tight lift him and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose ears and mouth joe
stands and looks intently at the screen
woodward wasnt trying to kill it
he was trying to help it escape
just then a muffled shatter crash did you hear that
the doors burst open and armed commandos dont kill us
please dont calls on radio kill us
please dont kill weve got civilians us
minors four of em
donny gets stoned in his car
doesnt notice the movement in the distance behind him
the military coming in
the locker hallway the boys are handcuffed and scared being led out by armed soldiers
nelec moves to them
quietly oh shit
overmyer checks their pockets as nelec takes carys backpack opens it pulls out some fireworks
proudly i rolled those m s myself thats right
eyes flick to joe youre the deputys boy
joes terrified as overmyer pulls from joes pocket a couple coins half a pack of bubble yum and his mothers necklace
drops everything but the necklace
joe reacts panicked hey no
joes on the verge of tears as overmyer pockets the necklace
off the terrified boys as theyre ushered away the boys are put onto the bus boom down to donnys car in the foreground where we realize that we havent been
the only audience to this donny sunk deep in his seat hiding watches wide eyed as the bus drives away
his stoned mind races
staying hidden from the remaining military donny scrambles for his cb turns to channel grabs the mike speaks quietly frantic breaker breaker requesting police backup over
breaker breaker is this the police channel
jack moves fast through the crowded evac area staff sergeant
hi how are you doing
jack moves to officer rosko who reacts to seeing him dressed this way rosko
where the hell you been
the air force set that fire they want the town empty for some reason
the whole military operation the evacuation everything is all bad
did you hear about joe
dispatch just got a call on citizens band joe and some friends were grabbed by military personnel at the middle school
off jacks reaction preston reads isaac asimovs science fiction magazine suddenly jack is there grabs him and pulls him up tell me everything right now and i wont throw you
yessir holds the super film but you should look at this first
the transport bus speeds on the road the only vehicle here
angle on the driver as a radio call come in base fortress requests eta
nelec arrives grabs the radio mike chief master sergeant dustoff is twenty minutes out
pan as nelec moves back we push in on overmyer who sits near the front putting on his dark gloves
nelec sits which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus another airman hernandez sits too
push past them toward our four boys sitting cuffed and seat belted behind the dirty wired safety glass all looking toward us terrified
whats gonna happen
i think were gonna die
theyd never do that
guys i forced you to come with me
im so sorry
looks to charles im so sorry
i think theyre gonna kill us
theyre not gonna kill us
you know why
joe is suddenly hopeful why
but just as hes spoken a shape from the darkness behind him glass
the entire bus is rocked charles screams hurt at the front of the bus nelec falls hits a bench then the bus was hit so hard it rides for a
moment only on its the military driver struggles with the wheel
was that the thing from the train
the bus slams back onto the road loud a tire blows
we the kids panic as the hobbled bus still drives was that it
oh my god
i cant see anything do you see anything
sir i gotta pull over
high overhead the bus comes to a sudden screeching stop
charles looks forward oh my god guys joe turns to see nelec loading a rifle straining to see out a drivers side window
mayhem whats that gun
cary behind him actually answers him
sako bolt action pronounced thirty aut six okay okay okay i get it leathwood art scope hernandez makes a radio call overmyer straining to see out the windows as nelec
locks and loads the unique ammo and moves to a drivers side window tries to see repeat contact with precious cargo thirty clicks sir i do not have visual from center of town driver can you see currently headed for base anything
send support immediately
no sir nothing
despite his handcuffs charles desperately tries to unlatch his seatbelt with his shaking hands cary sees this charles what are you doing
i dont feel good about this push in on cary to closeup looking past camera terrified oh god guys spiders
its out of the light and gone again push in on nelec newly terrified he hands his tracking rifle to here
overmyer is stunned for a moment but hides it well yessir
open the door
reluctant as hell for a tense beat the driver pulls the controls the door hisses loudly as it opens
in the back the boys are all frozen for a moment watching
overmyer moves for the door
five feet away from the door he stops turns back to nelec is there anywhere in particul the driver screams the thing grabs overmyer who drops the rifle it fires
the projectile hits the safety glass joe in shock behind him martin vomits
what kind of firepower do we have
charles scrambles to unlatch his seatbelt charles
maybe you should wait
the bus is slammed so hard the bus is pushed twenty feet from something on the other windows shatter charles and cary seatbelts removed land on joe and martin
the three soldiers hit the window floor painfully hernandez so hard hes instantly up
scared but pissed
the rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation we countermove with the creature as it comes around the other side climbs onto the exposed side metal and window the
boys gather their wits lights flashing hauntingly
you guys okay
i wanna go home so bad joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door tries the handle but its never gonna open
on the other side of the glass nelec rights himself momentarily disoriented breathing heavily he moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids
he tries the handle but it wont open for him either
and there is joe and nelec face to face joe seeing the fear in nelecs eyes his understanding that this is his fate
somehow nelec takes this moment to look into joes face to silently in a look repent
instantly joe knows hes about to watch this mans life end
nelec turns the creature is busting the bus door smashing at it to make it bigger
so it can get inside
the drivers leg is caught hes trying to get out but cannot is panicking as sssstab
the creature kills him instantly and smash as again it tries to widen the door
nelec winces the only conscious man on this side of the glass the boys cower on their side with each monstrous hit all their eyes on nelec except joe who
only wants to get to alice
he sees the shattered bulletproof window above them on what has become the roof of the bus
up there theres broken glass here use me im strong
lemme get on your shoulders
the boys struggle to get joe onto martins shoulders as on the other side of the glass nelec scrambles for hernandezs fallen semi auto rifle
he grabs it and scampers back to the glass as smash
pieces of metal and glass burst like ice chips as the creature violently widens the bus door opening on charles shoulders joe can reach the shattered but thick window which
he must hit break open to get out essentially exactly what the creature is doing in reverse
using both fists joe pounds the window
come on you pussy
with all his might joe hits the window again the slightest sound of glass adjusting meanwhile slam
the creature busting the bus door prying it wider like a sardine can nelec sits against the glass and opens fire futilely on the creature
he makes a call on his walkie this is nelec use the big guns
whatever happens to me you take it down you kill him and he drops the walkie and fires again the loud gunfire barely audible behind the glass with the boys
as joe hits the glass again bam a crinkling of glass you can do it
joe hits again so does the creature as nelec runs out of ammo
that was never really hope anyway
joe hits again and crash
the window shatters
glass chunks rain down on the boys all covering their face cary seeing the creature go
with all the boys helping joe pulls himself up outside the bus joe peeks out the fucking creature its back to joe just fifteen feet away focused on the door
and joe strains to climb out here onto the top side of the bus
and as the boys climb out the creature climbs in first joe then charles ad lib dialogue with cary and martin you gotta lose some weight i know
then cary and martin last they all jump down to the dirt they hear screams and turn back for a moment inside the bus nelec watches as the creature enters
the terrifyingly down the aisle toward him
and as the creature descends upon him in the silence before the final lunge nelec says eerily quietly terrified it was my turn once
to find you
its your t
before he can finish the creature fucking attacks and it would be horrible and brutal if the blood didnt spray upon in the field a distance away the boys watch
the bus shudder and shake
they see the creature burst out of the bus then run off fast and stealthy away from them in the overgrown grass like a native hunter
which of course is partly what it is
theyre sort of stunned
i just sharteezed a little
louis stares off lost
two air force soldiers arrive you need to come with us we have some questions for you what is she
is she dead
just come with us
standing is hard for heartsick louis his legs so hurt suddenly jack is there acting the role of air force hey fellas ive got orders from colonel nelec to personally
transport this man to base
hes all yours staff sergeant
as the two soldiers head off jack wraps louis arm over his shoulders heads off in the other direction as louis looks him over confused wherere we going
to find our kids
on louis face a surprised glimmer of hope
moments later tight on a pocket joe pulls out his mothers necklace
widen to see that hes taken the necklace from overmyers dead body
cary holds up his backpack
got my fireworks back
who gives a shit congratulations
they turn a car comes fast push in on joe who studies the oncoming car as behind him theyre coming man
i think we should go
the car arrives its donny
he gets out of his car wild and red eyed incredibly happy to see them ho ho
you dorks are alive
i didnt know
finally sees the bus what the fuck
we need to get back to town
hop in man
but you should know i am massively stoned right now
you want me to drive
donny looks at joe like it hurts to think
the catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood joe drives donny is asleep
other boys in the back
joe where are we going
i saw something at the cemetery
woodward said its subterranean i think i know where it whats that
what are those sounds
guys that sounds like guns
points to a tank what the hell is that
a deafening concussive gunblast
theyre lit up by what they see ahead in the oncoming cross street again and again at something we cant yet see
the boys cover their ears donny awakens but only for a moment joe quickly turns left into a driveway but we push in tight on him from the direction they
just came are more tanks and military vehicles joes eyes go wide theyre stuck
we gotta go by foot
just follow me
nudges donny hard donny
donny wake up
donny half looks at him we have to get out of here
hes too stoned
drugs are so bad
joe and the boys get out of the car fast and run across the street zig zagging between the enormous military vehicles
sir the weapons are misfiring
surface to air radar all of them
its a mess out here sir
soldier hurries off
joe in the lead they turn and look back a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire houses getting blown to shit in collateral damage
an explosion hits too close the boys scream as they run between houses and we track with them four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege power goes out and
some explosions are much closer than others another big hit and they go to a back door of a house and go inside they run in for cover theyre silhouetted in this dark space by the explosion light emanating from the windows
theyre all out of breath in a strange kitchen you guys see those explosions
they were huge
whose house is this
he hands him a picture kathys
i got it off the fridge
oh kathys cool
another crazy loud and bright explosion the light fixtures sway
charles grabs a coke on the counter
charles thats not yours what
im thirsty and im in a war zone
another fucking loud blast sound of glass breaking and the creature roaring
and there it is in silhouette moving past the bay window joe realizes where the creature is so are the blasts come on guys lets go
joe runs the others follow where we going
to the cemetery but as they get to the living room a huge explosion blows out a wall
they all go down but martin is in agony all of a sudden his leg ripped by concrete
if theres good news here the creature has left this area the explosions getting further away
but theres blood and martin is in real pain
what happened to my leg
oh shit martin you gotta bone sticking out of your leg
theres a hole in the house
joe gimme that thing on the curtains
charles wants the tie around the curtains still hanging on the wall that now has a hole in it military vehicles can be seen driving past outside
joe hands charles the thick fabric tie which charles fashion into a tourniquet wraps it around martins leg tight im gonna go find alice you have to stay with martin
charles looks at martin cant argue
says sincerely you gonna be okay without me
a meaningful beat yeah
charles nods joe looks to cary im not staying with the girls
oh my leg hurts
come on cary we gotta go
joe nods determined and he and cary head off this is going to hurt
i havent even done it yet
joe and cary run through the semi demolished neighborhood many houses shattered some cars obliterated
the only lone figures in town
joe and cary stop out of breath at the graves
so what are we doing here
just follow me
ive been following you for the last five blocks
what are we doing here
joe and cary run through the graveyard and over to the
theyre out of breath they try one garage door windows caked with dirt
the second door
dirt caked windows
the third is a barn door they try it locked
help you with what
we need to get inside
whats in these windows
cary help me
why is there dirt in these windows
help me on three
one two three
one two three
one two threee
the two begin kicking the door together on three one two crash
again and again until finally the door kicks open and they almost fall inside and thank goodness they didnt because and now were looking straight down from inside the shed
the entire floor of the shed has been dug out dropping forty feet straight down dirt piled caked along the sides of the structure
the boys catch their breath
this is scary
you got any sparklers in there
are you kidding me
cary opens his backpack whips out a fourth of july sparkler
lights it with a lighter and drops it in
the thing falls far enough to tell them its too far to jump
but burning on the dirt floor of the nearly dug hole it lights up a tunnel at the bottom
alice is down there
a jeep roars past
jack drives fast
louis sits beside him
but not angry
finally vulnerable scared and sad i came to your house that day
to tell you that i never meant to hurt anyone
swear to god
beat respectful tears im sorry jack
about what happened to your wife
jack looks at him for a moment then back to the road
finally it was an accident
it was an accident
jack glances at him
a small nod of forgiveness and gratitude
louis wants to cry again but just accepts it
joe begins climbing down the rope
joe lands on the bottom
dark as hell looks up at cary climbing down into the hole the barn roof looming above him
now cry lands too
there are three possible ways to go
joes mind races about which way to go
joe i dont understand we hear a distant rumbling like something far off but mechanical
they begin their walk into the dirt tunnel a tall oval were so far away that the screen is mostly black with a small speck of sparkly light
they come to an area littered with the stuff of a living room
they look up another hole leading down dug straight through a house
they continue coming to an intersection where a new tunnel branches off
theres dim light from up ahead where the tunnel bends
the rumbling mechanical sound louder now
joe and cary slowly move forward seeing something off camera that scares and amazes them all at once
they cross to the other side
cary bumps into a hanging sheriff pruitt
cary is about to scream but joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from pruitt
its sheriff pruitt
makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light a number of other tunnels are visible from here too
joe and cary look at the space in disbelief
what is this
were under the water tower
then joe sees something that makes him grab at carys shirt
cary looks through the mass of metal and machinery and its a human leg
joe and cary would scream if they didnt need to stay quiet
in a panicked whisper its eating a person
joe moves away from cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery and there he sees in an inset section of the rock wall three
human bodies hanging shellac
tight on joe as he sees among them alice
his heart pounds his resolve quadruples
cary sees her too shes here
were going to use your firecrackers
i dont think its going to hurt it joe
there are other tunnels
i need you to make noise
lots of it right here in two minutes
make it loud and make it last gimme some sparklers
goes through his bag why what are you gonna do
takes sparklers and a lighter from cary make sure youre gone by the time it blows you cant be here you gotta run
where are you going
but joes already gone
stay with cary who opens his backpack starts pulling out his amazing array of explosives glancing up to make sure hes out of the creatures view move fast with joe
as he races a lit sparkler giving him his light the mechanical rumbling all but gone now
joe runs looking for another way into the creatures massive space he finally finds another intersection he turns into it he disappears down the tunnel carys made a long insane
pile of firecrackers he uses an open m and begins laying a squiggly long line of gun powder back away from the firecrackers away from the entrance to the creatures contraption space
joe races down the dirt tunnel the sound of the mechanical rumbling and its increasing pitch getting louder
the sparkler dies as light begins to reveal joe who slows peers around the dirt tunnel bend he is now on the other side of the space
he sees the creature then looks across to the lifeless body of alice
his heart sinks
carys done laying out the charges he pulls out his lighter ffft
the damn thing wont light come on damnit
no go he keeps trying
joe watches as the creature finishes with its meal and heads cary come on come on
cary frantically trying the lighter fft
he looks up watches the creature grab and pull alices lifeless body down from her hanging position it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher cary shakes
the the creature pulls away the fibrous covering over alice its tentacles slither out
watching this is horror joes about to run in just as babababababababam
the creature jerks up from its almost meal of alice looks toward the explosive sounds then leaves her quickly moving for the tunnel the creature arrives in the smoke filled
tunnel as the fireworks fill the tunnel with bright multi colored lights joe sprints in gets to alice lightly slaps her face alice please please nothing slap alice wake up
nothing so he fucking slaps her face hard and she suddenly inhales sharply he eyes wide terrified alice
can you hear me
are you okay
shes catching her breath nodding looking at him amazed
what is this
what are you doing here
im just doing the best i can to save you
she grabs him and hugs him tight teary and grateful during which quietly how did you know
he told me
he was worried
and flipping out
we need to move but she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt intense excuse me
tina a year old disoriented woman with curlers in her hair wakes up
where are we
joe and alice have helped down one familiar face sheriff pruitt
theyre out of breath but their survival instinct has kicked in i left my bag in my car
then i went to my car to get my bag its been experimented on for years
its terrified and exhausted and hungry it just wants to go home
when it touched me i knew
alice help me get the sheriff down
i can get us out of here
sheriff we came that way
dont argue with me
come on kids lets go with the sheriff
joe and alice follow
they run into a tunnel
we push in on the mechanical device the pitch increasing more now as if its about to function the creature returns and sees that the humans are gone
he takes off
sparkler lighting the way were with joe and alice pruitt and tina behind them sheriff i really think were going the wrong way
well talk about it when we get up top
they continue following pruitt
i told you to get out
i thought this was the way out
hey alice welcome back kids come on we gotta go
terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction
after running hard for a beat they haul ass but after a long moment tina is grabbed away into the darkness
her screams continue behind them they run and run and run but then boom they hit a dead end
a dirt wall
no more tunnels
out of breath they turn but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness
the only sound the sparkler their erratic breathing and the joe what are you doing
joe shut up its gonna kill you
and it grabs joe and lifts him alice and cary scream as of this beast which could kill him at any time but in this moment of fear comes something
simple truth he i know bad things happen bad things happen but you can still live
you can still live you can still live youre gonna be okay
and the thing looks at him
really looks at him
in a way as you imagine his mother once had
and joe feels this too
and after a long scary beat the creature sets him down
joe backs up as the creature turns fast and speeds away
joe is okay wait a minute what
then over the high pitched mechanical sound comes rumblings like thunder from above and the three look up the kids round a corner on main street countless metallic objects anything
metal and loose has been invisibly dragged floating toward the water tower at different speeds and with different personalities metal objects bullet suddenly the diner window shatters as a stove rips through it we pan with it as it tumbles toward and up the water tower
hundreds of objects move past them from bicycles to silverware and sinks
dishwashers and tvs smash through the twilight zone all things eventually slamming into the water tower the objects beginning to crush together forming bam
sounds like gun blasts the kids turn behind them are the red cargo containers one by one those cubes burst through the containers bam
and they slam into the water tower and they begin to form an odd huge crescent shape above the tower
alice is cry laughing at seeing it work whats he doing
hes making a model
again and again pieces fly overhead beginning to form what from inside as it continues one of the spotlights
i got you
i got you
formed but here as he is being hugged by his father joe looks down something in his pocket is moving he considers it confused for a moment but he reaches
in and pulls it out
his mothers necklace and he holds the chain but the locket pulls toward the water tower wanting to go
joe knows what this means
he looks up at his father who also understand
and this is when we go into slow motion from here until the end
after a long beat joe holds the necklace up toward the tower the thing pulling
tears in joes eyes as he looks up at it not wanting to let go but knowing he must
jack heartsick watches his son on the verge of letting go
alice watches joe on the verge of tears except joe just cant bring himself to do it not now not ever
but then something happens
pulled by the invisible force the locket pops open
and we see whats inside
a photograph of joes mother
a young woman holding her one small baby
and joe looks at his mother and in this moment she at him and jacks eyes suddenly well with tears alice too tears streaming down her face and finally jack
reaches out and puts his hand on his sons shoulder which was all joe needed really
joe lets go
our score soars as in slow motion the necklace shoots across the main street up street as the majestic ship completes its formation and thats when joe sees the creature
leaving climbing up the
and we push in on charles and marin who watch amazed as the distant light rises into the sky and we push in as donny sleeps the reflection of the
rising ship seen in his windshield joe and alice jack louis and cary watch amazed as the ship disappears into the night sky we are tight on joes hand as it takes alices
and looking skyward joe smiles
as our score swells we finally
