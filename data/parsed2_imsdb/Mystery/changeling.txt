a true story written by j
michael straczynski on which appears the words slowly fade out taking us hard into a small pleasant house on a tree lined street in los angeles circa
not far from dodger stadium
a bakelite alarm clock hits a
christine collins thirties attractive rumpled reaches into frame to shut it off
she sits up rubs tiredly at her face and moves os switching on a radio as she goes
music fills the air
she throws water on her face as the music continues
she looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead
she hits the wall offhandedly something she does every day
the flickering stops
with a last look at the mirror she smoothes back her hair and exits switching off the light
dressed now she flicks on the overhead light
walter collins is nine years old with light brown hair though we dont see much of it or him hes entangled in the sheets
its important that we dont see him too clearly in most of the following scenes but without drawing attention to that aspect
time for school honey
she sits on the edge of the bed runs a hand through his hair
just ten more minutes sorry champ
more changeling a true story
christine contd you can sleep in all you want tomorrow thats what saturdays are for
now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold
its cereal its supposed to be cold
she smiles kisses him on the forehead and exits
he sits on the edge of the bed wavers then falls back into bed again
a street car known then as the big red rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning passing ford model as and hudsons and nash four door sedans
christine sits on one of the benches walters face buried in her lap still half asleep
she nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school
its early enough that only a few other kids have arrived
were here sweetie
she hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door
she watches from the curb as he heads toward the school
some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as walter approaches so she knows theyre aware that hes there
she waves then hurriedly gets back on the street car as it rumbles away
located on grand avenue downtown the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets
a roar of buzzers bells circuits opening and closing and a hundred female operators speaking at once
supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations going from one operator to another as needed
christine is one of them
she turns at the sound of a bell struck twice then rolls down the lane toward an operator frantically waving a pink sheet of paper
okay sandy whats the prob the mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off
changeling a true story
you deal with this one im not going near it
christine struggles on the headset
yes this is the supervisor maam what can i checks board yes i can see that youre on a party line maam what can i beat i know its unfortunate
but people sometimes do listen in on party lines
we hope to have private lines installed by beat well whats he doing when youre on the phone
beat are you sure
maybe theres a problem with the phone line
he could be asthmatic or beat oh
ive never heard of anything like that before either
guess theres a first time for everything right
no im afraid theres nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or
i she reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager ben harris s approaches
everything all right
just someone having a problem with a
with the connection
tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times thatll usually do it
unfortunately that was part of the problem
if youll excuse me
she roller skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper
changeling a true story
christine sits alone eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual
working hard to advance herself
then a bell rings time to return to work
other employees gather up their belongings and start inside
as christine closes the book her bookmark falls out
as she picks it up we see that its a childs drawing her and walter with arrows indicating who is who on a green hill under an orange sun
she touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again
she grabs her belongs and heads back inside
christine waits outside the school as another bell rings announcing the end of classes
kids run outside walter among them
he folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk
so how was school
we learned about dinosaurs and i got in a fight with billy mankowski
he hit me
did you hit him back
he nods good
rule number one never start a fight but always finish it
so why did he hit you
because i hit him
she stops looks at him
you hit him first
he nods why
changeling a true story
he said my dad ran off because he didnt like me
your dad never even had a chance to meet you
so how could he not like you
then why did he leave
christine takes his hand and they continue down the sidewalk
well the same day you were born something else arrived
it came in the mail in a box just slightly bigger than you
you know what was in that box
he shakes head something called responsibility
now to some people responsibility is fun its what you live your whole life for
other people think its the scariest thing in the world
so he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box
thats what i thought
she turns and crouches down in front of him
walter i decided a long time ago that i would always tell you the truth that i would treat you like a grown up
i cant expect you to respect me unless i respect you
beat ive never lied to you
your father leaving had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box
changeling a true story
she takes his pinky in hers gives a tug
first one to the corner store gets ice cream
he laughs and tears off
she runs after him letting him stay ahead of her the whole way
walter is asleep on the floor in front of the radio which is playing the closing moments of amos and andy
christine enters and turns off the radio
he stirs looks up at her
did i miss amos and andy
im afraid so sport
come on now time for bed
she picks him up and carries him up the stairs
are we still going to the movies tomorrow
i hear theres a new charlie chaplin playing down at graumans and a new serial called the mysterious airman
i dont know
thats what makes him so mysterious
am i too heavy for you to carry
not for years yet walter
not for years
and she disappears upstairs
just enough to bring us into changeling a true story
shes getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room when the phone rings
she hesitates then picks it up
beat oh hello margaret
im fine thanks
no i was just beat youre kidding
when did she call in sick

guess we can do it tomorrow
ill get there as soon as i can
but just until four okay
see you in a bit
she hangs up
she doesnt like this but theres no way out of it
she straightens and heads out of the room
a disappointed walter sits on the couch as christine puts things together quickly
theres a sandwich and milk in the icebox and ive asked mrs
riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours just to i can take care of myself
of course you can
shes coming by to check on the house not you
she stops in front of him kneels down to eye height
tomorrow well go to the movies
then well ride the big red down to santa monica and walk on the pier
more changeling a true story
christine contd he nods good
ill be back before it gets dark
im not afraid of the dark
im not afraid of anything
i know youre not honey
thats how i raised you
kisses his head be good
see you in a bit
she heads out the screen door clattering shut behind her
she crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk glancing back as walter looks out at her from the window
he waves back
with one last look she continues off
if the place was hectic before now its even worse lines buzzing voices chattering operators following christine around with papers and question
weve got lines jammed from here to ohio
he insists on talking to someone in charge
ive tried everything and the consoles just dead
i need your signature here for a supply requisition
christine glances up at the clock
shes already late
but she does whats necessary
all right get me the omaha routing station see if we can put the calls through their switchers
and lets get that console running
she hurries off to take care of it all the others following
start on a clock which reads then tilt down as christine comes out of the switchboard room pulling on a sweater ready to leave
as the floor manager steps out of his office
changeling a true story
good i was hoping to catch you
ive been following your work reports and i just want you to know that im very impressed
she glances down the block
the street car is approaching but she doesnt want to piss off her boss by running off
when i first suggested hiring female supervisors my superiors werent big on the idea
but youve held your own as well as any of our male supervisors and thank you mr
harris but i ben please
point is were looking for someone to take on a managerial position in our new beverly hills office
if youre interested i can thats great mr
harris i really appreciate the vote of confidence
so maybe we could she looks up to see the streetcar right at the stop
im sorry but i really have to go
well talk on monday
she races out to running after the streetcar as it closes its doors
hold on just a but the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it
frustrated she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly
christine sits on the front bench watching as the shadows lengthen then pulls the bell
the car rumbles to a stop as she steps out onto the sidewalk
changeling a true story
she passes a grocery store where a clock reads and continues past other houses on the pleasant green street
we hear parents telling their kids to come in for dinner radios playing music or radio dramas
christine smiles turns the corner looks to her house and its dark closed up
no lights on inside no music or dramas on the radio
christine pauses then picks up her pace
no need to panic he could be upstairs asleep could be in the back of the house where the lights wouldnt show
she goes to the front door
she enters its dark silent
she puts her purse down
she goes into switching on lights as she goes
she checks the refrigerator
the sandwich she made walter is untouched
she moves to the staircase
she opens the door to his room
she crosses to the sidewalk
looks up and down the street
time to come in
a little girl on a tricycle rolls past
susie honey have you seen walter
the girl continues away
christines concerned but she hasnt hit the panic button not yet
she crosses the street to changeling a true story
and rings the doorbell
the door opens and mrs
riley forties emerges
riley im sorry to bother you at dinnertime but i was wondering if walter was here
no im afraid not
do you know if jamie was able to look in on him
well i mentioned it to her but she was going to a dance with some of her friends
you know how teenagers are
is everything all right
im sure its fine i just
beat thank you mrs
christine heads away
christine stops at the sidewalk in front of her house looks up and down the street arms folded against the growing chill
she starts walking again
looking around trees and porches anywhere a nine year old boy might hide
she hears children playing
she picks up her pace homing in on the sound
she turns the corner to find three children playing none of them walter
she looks down the ominously empty streets
her worry growing she heads to the house
heels clicking on the hard sidewalk
she bursts in leaving the door open looking around in case he came in while she was out
she crosses to the phone hesitates for just a beat then picks up the receiver
changeling a true story
yes operator give me the police
theres a long pause as she waits looks out the window then police dispatcher on phone lincoln heights division
yes hello my name is christine collins i live at north avenue

police dispatcher on phone im sorry but our policy is that we dont dispatch units on missing child cases for twenty four hours

changeling a true story
police dispatcher on phone with all due respect maam every parent who calls us says the same thing
please i police dispatcher on phone im sorry but theres nothing i can do
ill take your name and information but thats all until tomorrow morning at the earliest
christine walks down the street arms wrapped around herself
im sure hell show up by then
they always do
she continues on calling walters name as she disappears into the shadows
christine watches out the curtained living room windows eyes red rimmed from worry but not from tears not yet as a police car finally pulls up
neighbors look on as the officers get out and approach the house
hold on christines face pale and worried under our thoughts go out again to mrs
christine collins of lincoln heights located at coliseum street whose young son walter collins disappeared almost two weeks ago
a large radio microphone with the call letters kgf is atop a podium where pastor gustav briegleb stands fifties barrel chested no nonsense a fire and brimstone preacher
his congregation sits in hard wooden pews listening and nodding
though she is not a member of our congregation we pray for her today more changeling a true story
briegleb contd as we have every day since we first learned of her situation on the radio and in the newspapers
beat we are told that the los angeles police department is doing the best it can to reunite mother and child and i am sure that is true
beat but given its position as the most violent corrupt and incompetent police department this side of the rocky mountains thats not saying a great deal
theres applause and cheering from the pews
he lets it pass
every day new bodies show up along mulholland or in ditches the work of police chief james davis and his so called gun squad
every day the needs of honest citizens are put second to greed and personal gain
every day the city sinks deeper into a cesspool of fear intimidation and corruption
once the city of angels los angeles is now a place where our protectors have become our brutalizers
where to be the law
is to be above the law
where none dare speak truth to power
beat but we will not be silent
we will continue to put their offenses and their failures in full view of the public
we will not be intimidated
the place erupts into applause and cheering
police chief james e
davis s hard edged and tall stands looking out the window as the radio drones on behind him
briegleb on radio because while the gun squad speaks in the only language chief davis understands we speak in the language of compassion truth and strength
we speak for our fellow citizens beaten and killed by a renegade police department
more changeling a true story
briegleb on radio contd we speak for an innocent child ripped from his mothers arms now all but forgotten by the police
and that voice my friends will never be silenced
more cheers and applause as davis switches off the radio
the alarm goes off but christine is already awake
staring up at the ceiling
she slowly pulls herself up and moves os
christine walks past the door to his bedroom
goes over to the bed
her hand lingers touching it under are you sure youre ready for this christine
christine and mr
harris the floor manager approach the doors to the switchboard room
i mean if you need more time the police are doing all they can and frankly i could use the money
its been almost a month and
it wouldnt do any good to find walter and bring him home if he doesnt have a home to come back to right
he smiles as he says it but theres the sense that he doesnt think walters coming back
its been too long
she senses it but moves past it pushing open the door and entering as loud as before
until the operators see christine and the noise stops
she tries to smile as if to say im okay but cant quite manage it
changeling a true story
several women approach and hug her as the noise level begins to climb but nowhere near what it was a moment earlier
ill leave you to it then
she nods as he exits then heads off herself
christine moves from station to station the noise level still noticeably low
every time she approaches an operator they lower their voices as if not to bother her
one operator holds up a pink request sheet
christine starts toward her but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off
knowing she has to do something about this she turns to the room and in a firm clear voice says excuse me can i have your attention
the room grows quiet
everyone is looking at her
listen everyone i appreciate your consideration but im not made of porcelain
i wont break down and cry if the station to station call to kankakee doesnt go through
a thin smile actually i
promised myself that i wouldnt cry
wouldnt let myself cry
until i knew one way or another what
beat point is
i like the noise here
so dont be afraid to talk and
push buttons and drop things
if it wasnt noisy how would i know i was in the right place
she manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal
harris steps out into the lunch area where a number of the operators and supervisors are hanging out
excuse me has anyone seen christine
i think i saw her in the back office
he nods his thanks and continues off
changeling a true story
he approaches the door slowing as he hears christine inside
well if you do hear anything would you let me know
thanks i appreciate it
a hang up then dialing
he glances in the open doorway
christine sits at a table phone in hand a list of phone numbers in front of her
the list reads las vegas missing san francisco missing persons department
on and on
with each having multiple checks beside it indicating all the times shes called
her lunch sits untouched beside her
she puts a check next to las vegas missing persons department then looks up as someone answers at the other end of the phone
missing persons department please
beat yes hello this is christine collins i
yes fine thank you
i was just checking back to see if you had found any missing or lost children that might match the beat i see
no i appreciate that its just
it never hurts to make sure all the lines of communication are working
i mean thats what i do for a living right
beat well ill try back next week
if you do hear anything in the meantime would you be sure to let me know
she hangs up and ticks another department off the list and dials again
harris heads away deciding that whatever it was he planned to talk to her about
it can wait
missing persons department please
a single car is parked in the dirt lot outside the small roadside diner
changeling a true story
the cook who owns this dive is cleaning the griddle and keeping an eye on the only two customers in the place a man and a young boy both wearing
hats as was the custom
theyre unkempt dirty like theyve been on the road a long time
they finish the last of the food as the cook approaches tears off the bill and puts it on the table
the man reaches for his wallet
pats an empty pocket
tries the other pocket
looks like i left my wallet at home
can i owe it to you
pay up or i call the cops
im tired of bums like you coming around here
im not trying to stiff you chief
i just left my wallet at home thats all
ill go back and get it
five ten minutes tops
the cook hesitates he doesnt want the trouble of bringing in the cops but he doesnt want to get stuck either
you got any collateral
the man glances at the boy seated beside him
the boys face is dirty partially obscured by the hat
cant ask for better collateral than a mans own flesh and blood right
to the boy you stay here son ill be right back
but now dont give me any trouble
hes a good man to trust us like this
you just sit here while i go get my wallet
changeling a true story
the boy nods reluctantly looks away as the man rises
ten minutes then im calling the cops
the man nods exits and drives off
the cook squints warily at the boy then at the wall clock
just the empty parking lot
the cook is annoyed
he glances to the boy who wont meet his gaze
finally ah hell
he goes to the phone
clicks the receiver a few times
its harve down by the diner
would you get me sheriff larsen
yeah ill wait
he casts a sour look in the boys direction
whats your name son
the boy takes a beat looking out at the road
then i dont remember
as before christine hurries from one station to another lost in the barely managed chaos
she stops at one station glancing over papers then looks over at the window to mr
harris office where he is talking with a police officer captain j
jones s serious arch
she slows unable to look away a growing dread settling in her heart
harris points out the window
the police captain nods and enters the switchboard room
as jones heads for her the strength goes out of christines legs
she holds onto the a desk as he stops before her
changeling a true story
she manages a nod
behind her eyes is the terror hes going to tell me my son is dead
the room gets very quiet
my name is captain j
jones lincoln park juvenile division
my office supervises all runaway and missing child cases including your sons and
beat a smile hes alive mrs
he was picked up two days ago by local police in de kalb illinois
hes safe and unhurt
he was in the company of some drifter weve got an apb out for him now and but she hasnt heard anything past hes safe and unhurt
she almost goes to the floor as other women rush toward her crying and embracing her
for the first time christine cries great wracking sobs all the emotion shes been fighting back all this time coming out at last
jones and christine are in a police car pulling up to the train station
it moves through a police line holding back a crowd of reporters who shout questions at the passing car
all these reporters
you didnt tell me yours is a story with a happy ending mrs
people love happy endings
checks watch train should be pulling in shortly
wed better get a move on
as christine and jones step out theyre mobbed by the press
jones smiles splendidly for the cameras waves one arm wrapped around christine who looks stunned by it all
well have a statement for you in a little while
more changeling a true story
jones contd right now the important thing is to re unite this little lady with her son
so if youll excuse us
beaming jones escorts christine into union station
seated on a bench is a police matron and beside her the boy from the de kalb diner
who we will identify henceforth as walter
he is looking out the window at the passing scenery
did you know that los angeles is where they make the tom mix movies
no i didnt
his horse is named blue
beat you think theyll let me watch them make a movie
i dont know youll have to ask
but with all this attention who knows maybe they will
the boy turns his attention back out the window as we hear the whistle of the train pulling into union station
we hear the same train whistle from this side as christine and jones come to the ramp police chief davis is waiting
the reporters are held back at the entrance to the platform
collins id like to introduce you to chief of police james e
oh my i didnt expect we dont get a lot of positive attention from the boys in the press these days so its good to be here when theres a
positive story dont you think
changeling a true story
but shes distracted looking off to the end of the platform where the train is starting to pull in
i take it youve been treated well by my boys in the department
yes of course theyve been great
well there was that part about having to wait twenty four hours before filing a report but technicalities aside the train stops
doors begin to open
other than that no complaints
theyve all been wonderful
good then you wont have any problem telling that to the press and how the lapd is concerned first and foremost with the safety of but shes already running down
the platform as people start to step off the train
jones exchanges a look with davis
just a sec
he trots off to catch up with christine who walks alongside the train looking from window to window anxious eager
then the matron gets off the train her frame momentarily blocking the view of the boy beside her
but christine spots them
with jones not far behind she breaks into a run
she runs toward them
the matron turns sees her smiles and gets out of the way revealing the boy
staggers so hard she almost falls
she steps forward slowly a hand going to her mouth
for a moment were not sure whats going through her mind
she looks to the matron who smiles
looks to the boy who smiles
then she steps back a pace horror sinking in as jones comes jauntily alongside her
changeling a true story
arent you going to hes not my son
jones freezes at the words
what are you hes not my son
beat hes not my son
im sure youre mistaken
hes been through four long terrible months
hes gone through changes lost weight i know my own son
he glances over his shoulder to where the chief of police is waiting not aware of any of this and beyond him
im just saying
i mean youre in shock and hes changed and he turns from her stoops down to look at the boy
whats your name son
can you tell me your name
christine steps back as though slapped
this cant be
its a common name it do you know where you live walter
do you know your home address
the boy considers for a moment
then changeling a true story
my house is at north avenue los angeles california
beat and thats my mommy
and he runs to her grabbing her around the waist which only magnifies her horror
jones has no idea what to make of her or this or the boy
the only thing he knows is that the chief of police is standing right over there smiling now that he thinks hes seen a mother and child reunion
the press is nearly insane trying to get through to them
listen to me
i know youre feeling uncertain right now but thats to be expected
a boy this age changes so fast
but weve compensated for that in our investigation
were experts in child identification
theres no question that this is your son
its not walter
its not walter as you remember him
thats why its important for you to take him home on a
a trial basis
once youve put him back in familiar surroundings and given yourself time to recover from the shock of his changed condition
youll see that it is him
i swear to you mrs
i give you my word
this is your son
she looks from him to the boy
who is not terribly dissimilar from walter
so that even the audience may not be entirely sure if its him or not
and part of her wants desperately to believe
the pressure is immense
if theres any problem any problem at all come and talk to me and ill take care of it
he has nowhere else to go
changeling a true story
its an agonizing moment then finally i
look ill take him home but only because i
might not be thinking clearly right now and thank you
without giving her a moment to reconsider he waves and the chief of police approaches as the press rushes toward them
in an instant theyre overwhelmed by people shouting questions flashbulbs popping a fever of excitement
how does it feel to have your son home mrs
what did you think when you saw him for the first time
hard to explain
jumping in it was certainly quite a shock
at first she hardly recognized him
perfectly natural the boys been through quite an ordeal
howre you feeling son
bet it feels great to be home
yeah its great
the los angeles police department is thankful for all the hard work done by the de kalb county sheriffs department in helping to make this joyful reunion possible
the lapd is dedicated to serving the public at all times and can we get a photo of mother and son captain
changeling a true story
he poses christine and walter so she is holding the boy in her arms
dazed stunned confused she manages to smile for the cameras
bulbs flash and time slows down the sound muted as christine looks around at it all as though in a dream
reporters shouting questions she doesnt hear
the boy beside her smiling at it all
he looks at her mouths the word mommy as the car door slams and she and the boy sit side by side
the silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment earlier
an officer gets in they drive off passing jones and the chief of police talking quietly off to one side
christine looks to the boy
he smiles at her
the only noise is the clock on the wall ticking
christine sits at one end of the table walter at the other
he is finishing a sandwich not meeting her gaze
was the sandwich all right
he nods would you like some more milk
no thank you
no thank you
now you need a bath
youre covered with soot from the train ride
he turns and heads up the stairs
carrying a pair of pajamas christine comes into the hall and stops in front of the bathroom door
i found you a pair of pajamas
i bought them for walter but he didnt like the fabric so changeling a true story
she hears him fall and pushes the door open
she helps walter stand discreetly turned away from us
are you all right
did you hurt yourself
let me see she stops suddenly reacting to something we dont see
looks slowly looks up to his face
she takes his hand and marches him out of the bathroom
she places him against the wall where she measured walters growth over the years
the marks put him four inches shorter than the one labeled march
she looks at him very serious
the last time i measured walter the last time i measured my son he was four inches taller than you are right now
beat who are you
beat what are you doing here
beat who are you
he says nothing
hold on her look of growing desperation
jones walks quickly down the hall trying to look interested in a clutch of papers in his hands christine following after
hes not my son
collins changeling a true story
i dont know who he is or why hes saying hes walter but theres clearly been some kind of mistake
we agreed you would give him time to adjust hes four inches shorter than walter
boys his age dont shrink
if anything he should be taller
maybe your measurements are off
look im sure theres a reasonable explanation for hes circumcised
jones glances back uncomfortable about discussing circumcision with a woman in public view
he lowers his voice
your son was missing for four months
for at least part of that in the company of an as yet unidentified drifter
who knows what such a disturbed individual might have done
he could have had him
might have made him smaller
captain please hes on the move again stepping into and getting behind his desk as christine follows him in
why wont you listen to me
i am listening damn it i beat calmer i am listening
and i understand your feelings
hes changed no mistake
youve both been through a terrible experience
thats why he needs your support and love to bounce back
changeling a true story
captain that boy wouldnt bounce back as my son if you coated him in rubber and dropped him off the roof
he sits shaking his head
why are you doing this mrs
you seem perfectly capable of taking care of the boy your work pays you enough to attend to his personal needs
so i dont understand why youre trying to run away from your responsibilities im not running away from anything least of all my responsibilities
im even taking care of that boy because right now im all he has
what worries me is that youve stopped looking for walter
why should we look someone weve already found
but you havent found him
hes still out there somewhere lost maybe hurt
his identity has been confirmed by the best minds in the field of child identification people who know what theyre doing
and i dont
captain look i dont want to cause trouble for you or the department
honestly i dont
i know youve done everything you can
but theres been a terrible mistake and i need your help if were going to correct it
before its too late
annoyed jones paces then picks up the phone
sara get dr
tarr on the phone
changeling a true story
christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings
she opens the door to find a police officer and dr
tarr sixties mildly eccentric in appearance
captain jones sent me
i consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases
may i come in
yes of course
she steps aside and dr
tarr enters looking around
thank you for coming
im surprised captain jones moved so quickly
i was starting to think he didnt believe me
well im here now and well put all that to rights
where is the boy
he looks up as walter comes downstairs
noting that he said the boy not your son christine looks relieved
there he is
a handsome young man
he has your eyes doesnt he
and a little bit of the nose
very fit in spite of all his travails
a very resilient boy youve got here mrs
as he bends down to look more closely at walter christine stiffens
she cant have heard that right
doctor tarr i thought you were here to help me
captain jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes and asked me to look in on him
to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern
my motherly concern isnt for him because hes not my son
changeling a true story
statements like that will hardly help the boys self esteem now will they
beat captain jones said something about a change in height
hes four inches shorter than ah well
hardly a mystery mrs
weve known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children
given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk
its uncommon but within the realm of possibility
what about the circumcision
very likely his abductor thought it appropriate
after all circumcision is hygienically sound
must have been quite traumatic at the time
no wonder hes submerged the memory
look doctor as you can see theres a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this
but its good for you to raise these questions
you should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence
wouldnt i know whether or not he was my son
im his mother
which means youre in no position to be objective
you are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember
he isnt the same boy that left here just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isnt the same anymore
more changeling a true story
tarr contd a mothers heart driven by intuition and emotion rather than logic sees these changes and rebels insists that this cannot be your son
but that doesnt change the facts
beat im willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity mrs
whatre you before she can react he takes walter by the hand and leads him outside
christine follows them out to as dr
tarr strides onward the police officer and walter walking alongside as christine brings up the rear
a few houses down they come to a group of children playing
hello children my name is dr
id like to ask you some questions
my mom says were not supposed to talk to strangers
but as you see im with the police so its all right
now im sure you know mrs
collins here and her son walter
how many of you recognize this young boy as walter collins
he looks from one child to the other
they dont reply
either they dont recognize him or theyre intimidated
now now no need to be afraid
surely you knew walter and played with him
so which of you can identify walter for me for his mother and for the police
this officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens
the kids exchange a glance
its clear they dont recognize the boy but theyre intimidated by the presence of tarr and the police officer
a few reluctantly raise their hands
another of them goes to walter who is shorter than he is
changeling a true story
walter was as tall as me
he was as tall as you
now hes not
hes lost a little height you see
its a thing called trauma
with luck none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves
so other than that do you recognize this as your friend walter collins
tarr already ahead of you mrs
collins children can be intimidated
but not adults
shall we try a neighbor
he heads off again like some very tall strange bird marching down the street
christine exchanges a look with the kids then heads off to follow
tarr christine mrs
riley the officer and walter stand on the porch
and wed appreciate it if you could make a positive identification for us
id be happy to
i saw the boy often
come closer son
she stoops down studies walters face turns it from side to side
squints at him
he squints back at her
note shes not wearing glasses
finally take your time
thats walter all right
used to come here all the time to play with my nephew roger
changeling a true story
thank you mrs
youve been a big help i before we go
riley do you have the time
she looks at her watch
holds it farther away
cant quite focus on it
pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse
my last concession to vanity men dont make passes at women who wear glasses you know
checks the watch five oclock
riley nods and heads inside as christine looks to tarr who shrugs off what was just demonstrated
a boy is much larger than a watch mrs
to walter come along son
tarr takes walters hand and heads away christine following anger growing in her eyes as we hear this is absolutely outrageous
she is on the phone walter finishing up his dinner in bg
no listen to me this so called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldnt even recognize her own beat he found what
he expected to find what you obviously told him he would find but its not beat no i am not reassured
more changeling a true story
christine contd i thought we had an understanding beat that i was embarrassed isnt the issue the point is youre wasting time when you should be looking for my son
i beat then i want to see this report so i can refute it before it goes to anyone else all right
she hangs up
the events of the day have her teetering on the edge but shes holding on
she pulls herself together and goes to the sink furiously doing dishes for a silent beat before walter looks up from his now empty plate
can i go to my room now
go on up
walter rises as christine continues to clean dishes not looking back at him
exhausted mentally physically and emotionally
he goes to the door stops turns
christine fumbles the plate and it smashes to the floor
she turns furiously to walter
stop saying that
im not your mother
and youre not my son
she moves toward him her anger coming out at last
he tears off as she slumps to the floor covering her eyes
i want my son back
make it stop
just make it stop
walter is in bed his back to the door as christine appears in the hallway
she steps into the room sits on the bed
changeling a true story
he doesnt move
her voice is soft but firm
i was wrong to yell at you
youre still a child and i think you dont really understand what youre doing the hurt youre causing
maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you but i need you to understand
hes all i have hes everything to me and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where i can help him
beat whatever the police think whatever the world thinks we know the truth dont we
we both know youre not walter
getting you to admit that may be the only chance i have to straighten this out before its too late
maybe youre afraid of getting in trouble that youre in too deep
but youre not
you dont have to tell me who you are you just have to tell them who youre not
tell them the truth
he doesnt respond
she gives it a moment in case he might open up then rises and heads back into the hallway
she switches off the light and heads off down the hallway
pastor briegleb is typing out his sermon for the day
looks at the clock
he rubs tiredly at his face when he hears the thump of the newspaper being delivered
he stands stretches and steps out to where the newspaper is visible on the front lawn
he picks it up and starts into the rectory as he unfolds the paper
then he slows stunned by something hes reading
he looks up again and hurries back into the rectory
shes in bed asleep as the telephone rings downstairs
she glances at the clock
she clearly doesnt want to go down to answer it
then reluctantly climbs out of bed
changeling a true story
the telephone is still ringing as she picks it up
briegleb on phone is this mrs
who is this
briegleb on phone my name is gustav briegleb im the pastor over at st
pauls oh yes i heard some of your radio broadcasts after my son
you were very supportive and i appreciate rev
briegleb on phone mrs
have you seen the times today
no i rev
briegleb on phone youd better take a look
then come by the parish in an hour for breakfast
i think we should meet
she starts to reply but the line goes dead
she hangs up the phone pulls her robe closer around her and steps out to where a copy of the los angeles times sits on a neighbors front lawn
she looks around then dashes to pick it up
she unfolds it as she heads back then abruptly stops
she cant believe what shes seeing
close on the newspaper
the headline reads mysterious transformation in collins boy
briegleb is eating a big breakfast
christine newspaper in hand is pacing furious
she reads aloud from the paper

christine contd w
tarr child specialist examined walter collins to determine the cause of his loss of weight paleness confusion and run down condition noticed since the return of the boy to his
mother last saturday
lovely bit of phrasing isnt it
noticed since the return of the boy to his mother
not only does it state clearly that you are the boys mother one could infer from this that you are somehow responsible for these changes
and that the police are concerned for the boys welfare in your hands
beat you should try the eggs theyre very good
still reading i examined the boy quite thoroughly dr
tarr said dr
tarr is sitting at a desk and speaking to a handful of reporters enjoying the attention
and its clear that he has something to tell
im sure that in time he will give his boyish story of the entire affair but not until he has faith in his listener
and that is what is lacking faith in the poor lads story
in the course of my examination i found nothing to dispute the findings by the lapd
how come he hasnt been able to tell anyone what happened while he was gone
i would say that the boy has either been coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what happened to him during more changeling a true
tarr contd those many months
its possible that his mental lapse may be the result of a blow to the head or a sudden shock which brought about a possible cranial injury
i believe that this condition will pass soon
until then i recommend that the police department continue working with him exposing him to whatever elements of his previous life as may help restore his memory
as she lowers the paper incredulous
and yes what you just read was exactly what the doctor really said
captain jones promised hed let me see the report before it went anywhere else
someone in authority at the lapd lied
good heavens i may have to go lie down
she turns looking stricken
he sobers at once
i was not laughing at your situation mrs
after one has this sort of conversation enough times a certain degree of hysteria begins to set in
reluctantly she does
shakes her head in disbelief
why are they doing this
to avoid admitting a mistake
that they brought back the wrong boy
off her look anyone reading that with half a brain would see through it instantly
sadly that leaves out about half the times readership but still
more changeling a true story
christine contd ive been trying to get someone to say those words since
god i was starting to think i was losing my mind
beat thank you
at least someone believes me
you have no idea how many people have sat in that very chair and said those exact same words to me in relation to our friends at the los angeles
collins i have made it my mission to bring to light all the things the lapd would prefer no one knew anything about
a department ruled by violence abuse murder corruption and intimidation
faux newsreel footage of police chief davis speaking before a bunch of microphones
when chief davis took over the lapd two years ago he said overlapping we will hold court on gunmen in the los angeles streets
i want them brought in dead not alive and i will reprimand any officer who shows the least mercy to a criminal
a crowd of police officers armed with machine guns blast the hell out of a group of guys lined up against a wall
he picked fifty of the most dangerous cops on the force gave them machine guns and permission to shoot anyone who got in their way
he called them the gun squad
no questions suspensions or investigations
just piles of bodies
changeling a true story
another guy beaten to a bloody pulp is shoved out of a moving car and left in the rain
bodies in morgues bodies in hospitals bodies by the side of the road barely alive
not because the police wanted to wipe out crime they just wanted to get rid of the competition
a pair of cops and a couple of thugs inspect a truck carrying booze over the border from canada pay the freight and watch as the trucks drive off in
mayor cryer and half the police force are on the take
prostitution gambling bootlegging you name it
beat when the gloves came off pretty soon the rest of the department got into the brutality act
didnt want the gun squad to have all the fun after all
two officers are sexually assaulting a woman on the stairs
the more they got away with it the worse things got because when you give folks the freedom to do whatever they want as god saw in the garden of
eden theyll do just that
with christine and briegleb in the rectory garden
this police department does not tolerate dissent contradiction
or embarrassment mrs
you have the power to embarrass them
and they dont like it
not when they became the heroes of the hour the day they stood there posing with you having rescued a lost boy from the wilderness
more changeling a true story
briegleb contd beat they will do everything they can to discredit you
ive seen it happen too many times to start going blind now
thats why i wanted to see you so youd know what you were getting into
and how to fight them
i appreciate what youre saying and what youre doing
but im not on a mission
the only thing i want is to find my son thats all and i just a lot of mothers sons ended up being sacrificed to expediency around here mrs
yours wouldnt be the first
do this right and maybe yours will be the last
she gets up from the table paces the garden
if they honestly thought i was wrong thatd be one thing
but if they dont care if theyre just trying to cover it up
he picks up the article waves it
this is their attempt to win by framing the discussion their way
why of course its her son
yes there have been changes
were looking into it and isnt it strange that they happened after the boy got home
beat theyre putting you in the position of having to disprove what theyre saying
and thats hard
most people believe what they hear from the police or the government
if you play it their way you
and your son
are going to lose
she closes her eyes for a beat then looks to him her voice firmer her decision made
what do i have to do
changeling a true story
change the rules of engagement
re define the argument
they brought in their expert so you bring in yours
you have an advantage they dont
you know your son better than they ever will and in that knowledge is the proof you need
beat get that information put it out there
make them respond to you not the other way around
he gets up walks toward her puts his hands on her shoulders
giving her strength
but also his concern
once people side with the police its a hard climb
but even in a town as loud as this one the voice of truth can be heard
if youre willing to take it all the way in spite of the dangers
and they are very real mrs
collins make no mistake
once you open the book on these people youre going to be looking over your shoulder every day maybe for the rest of your life
beat you up to it mrs
he looks in her eyes
and she meets his gaze levelly
the answer is evident
were in a dentists office
christine is waiting for a beat before the door opens and dr
john montgomery emerges
he had two cavities that needed filling
he put up a fight but i took care of it
he casts a look back at the closed door shakes his head
changeling a true story
your sons upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle
made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart
the boy in that room has no such gap
does a gap like that get smaller with age
because thats what theyll say
in some cases yes its possible
but the muscle between walters teeth prevents that from happening
they can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle and i can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation
will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially
pardon my language but
he hears an os moan from the inner office
sounds like the anesthetic is wearing off
starts in pauses on the other hand maybe ill write that letter first
give the little fella something to think about
small with wooden desks chalkboard all the basics
walter stands in front of mrs
fox fifties wearing severe glasses and an equally severe expression
christine stands nearby
what do you think
is that the walter collins that you remember
if it is hes changed enormously
to walter do you know who i am
changeling a true story
youre a teacher
yes but even teachers have names
i dont remember
i know you but i dont remember your name
my name is mrs
now take your seat
walter hesitates then takes a seat
the other kids laugh
i didnt say take a seat
i said take your seat
your assigned seat
you must know which one it is you sat there for over a year
walter tries another vacant seat
there are only three vacant seats in the room
more laughter from the kids
heres a hint theres only one more empty seat left
fox looks to christine
collins if thats your son ill eat my yardstick
not only will i put that in writing ill swear to it in a court of law and in front of president calvin coolidge himself if i have to
for the first time christine allows a hopeful smile
the lights are low
christine sits on the floor sorting through a box containing artifacts of affection class projects made by walter trees and houses and clay dogs a heart shaped card mothers day
card hand made with i love you mommy carefully printed on the front
she runs her finger over it tracing the impression left by his pencil
she starts to cry and a tear falls onto the pencil drawing
she frantically dabs at it trying to preserve it from distortion
then sets it down and covers her face weeping
changeling a true story
a cold wet knot of reporters and photographers are waiting in the rain on the steps to city hall
christine sits in a car with briegleb looking at it all
ill see you tonight at eight for my broadcast
ill leave the back door open and a light on
she nods exits the car and walks up the steps to the front of city hall as he drives off
she stands before the press looks at them for a moment then begins
my name is christine collins
on march th my nine year old son walter collins disappeared
a four month investigation resulted in a boy being brought to los angeles from de kalb illinois
they told me and all of you that this boy was my son
they were wrong
beat the los angeles police department made a mistake
a terrible mistake
the boy they found is not my son
that is the reason for the supposed transformation
i have letters from his dentist his teachers and others confirming that this boy is not my son
the letters are being reprinted now and i should have them for you tomorrow
flashbulbs pop dazzling her
she composes herself
i have given the police department every opportunity to admit their mistake and renew the search for my son
since they have refused to do so i have no choice but to present my case before the public
i hope this will persuade the police to finish the job they started and bring my son home to me
beat thank you
changeling a true story
as the reporters start to shout out questions we pan across to a beat cop who has been watching
he goes quickly to a police call box unlocks it and picks up the telephone
the glass door to captain jones office is closed but we can see him on the phone
finally he hangs up and comes out of the office
his tone is cold but neutral
we think this could go either way
he stops an officer
morelli i want you to find the collins woman and get her here
bring her in the back way and have a couple of matrons standing by
he heads off as jones goes into his office closing the door
a police car pulls up to the curb and christine and walter emerge from the back seat
they dash through the rain to the back door followed by the st cop
why are we using the back door
fronts jammed with reporters
she allows a moment of quiet satisfaction as shes led into where shes directed to a wooden bench
a nearby clock reads
she sits walter silent beside her
in the bg the desk sergeant puts a call on hold
anybody want to take a call from the royal canadian mounties
detective lester ybarra thirties good looking glances up
whatd they do lose a moose
changeling a true story
they need a juvenile living here illegally deported back to canada
hes living with his cousin on some ranch near riverside in wineville
all right ill take it got nothing better to do
ybarra takes the call as jones calls from his office
christine starts to take walters hand when a matron appears
leave the boy for now
well look after him
she hands walter over to the matron then enters he leaves the door open and indicates for christine to sit
he paces working up to what hes going to do
youve put us through quite a bit of trouble mrs
this situation has become an embarrassment for the entire department
it wasnt my intention to embarrass anyone
no of course not
you just told the papers we cant tell one boy from another as a compliment for the months we spent working on your case
are you trying to make fools out of us
is that it
do you enjoy this
no of course not
i had to get your attention i had to make you understand
hes not my son
he circles closing in on her
she becomes aware that the door is open and hes doing this for the benefit of anyone who might be listening in
changeling a true story
you know what your problem is
you want to shirk your responsibilities as a mother
you enjoyed being a free woman didnt you
enjoyed not having to worry about a young son
you could do what you wanted go where you wanted see anyone you wanted
but then we found your son
brought him back
and now hes an inconvenience
thats why you cooked up this whole scheme to try and throw him to the state let the state raise him for you
thats not true
even the boy says hes your son
why would he do that
how would he know to do that
i dont know
all i know is that hes lying
maybe he is a liar
but thats how hes been trained isnt it
lying was born in both of you
youre a liar and a troublemaker and if you ask me youve got no business walking the streets of los angeles
just a minute because either you know youre lying or youre not capable of knowing if youre lying or telling the truth
so which is it mrs
are you a derelict mother
or just nuts
because from where i sit those are the only options
im not going to sit here and take this jones stands between her and the door
changeling a true story
you want to bring in experts
well i can do that too
calling os matron
the door opens and a police matron enters
he looks back to christine his voice low his anger replaced by cool determination
this scene is about to take an abrupt change
do you still insist that the boy out there is not your son
he nods to the matron who moves to restrain her
what are you doing
the matron cuffs christines hands behind her back
please dont struggle maam
youll only hurt yourself
a click and the handcuffs are in place
to the matron you are to convey the prisoner to the los angeles county general hospital psychopathic ward
wait you cant still to matron make the following entry in the booking department defendant states she has been deceived by police and others and that they have given her
a boy and tried to make her think it is her son when she says it is not
christine is led in handcuffs into a waiting police van
vo has been taken verbatim from the police report
changeling a true story
collins has been known to us since about march when she reported her nine year old son walter missing
a stunned and dazed christine rides in the back of the van the boy was gone until july
since his return she has complained that he is still missing and has made repeated requests that he be found saying this is not my walter even though positive identification
has been established
the police van enters the hospital at north state street
a sterile dreary white on white place where in the background we can hear the sounds of the insane crying out
the matron leads a stunned christine to the front desk
she suffers from paranoia delusions of persecution and dislocation from reality
she may be a threat to herself or others
we recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored
the matron stops before the desk
the nurse barely looks up
got another code twelve
please this is a mistake
to matron certifying officer

jones lincoln heights division
forced calm please
you have to listen to me
the police are doing this to punish me
they tried to force this boy on me and tell me he was my son but it wasnt my son and now they say im crazy she stops noting the
looks exchanged between the nurse and the matron
her story sounds insane even to her
she begins to realize the depth of her predicament
oh god please no
if you continue to struggle ill have to put you in a straitjacket
do you want that
she shakes head good
then behave yourself
to orderlies code twelve
the matron turns christine over to two large male orderlies who take her by the arms and lead her into the psycho ward
no please you have to listen to me
they force march her down the hall the screams of the insane growing louder falling deeper into the nightmare
christine is ushered into the room by a nurse
take off your clothes

required for all new patients
the nurse begins putting on a pair of rubber gloves
changeling a true story
thats not necessary you can remove your clothes yourself or i can have the orderlies do it for you
which do you prefer
reluctantly christine begins to remove her clothes
on christines face as she stands in a spray of water and disinfectant some coming from the showerhead above some from a hose sprayed on her by the nurse in
christines eyes are closed trying to shut out the sense of violation
spread your legs
a beat wider
biting her lip christine complies
wet hair plastered to her face dressed in a hospital gown christine is led down a long hall by the nurse
as she passes the closed doors we hear women weeping talking to themselves crying out screaming beating on the walls
fingers poke through narrow viewing slits in the doors
the nurse pulls out a key ring and unlocks one of the doors
christine enters bare forbidding four white walls and a narrow slit of a window
its a two person room
sitting on the other bed is another patient
this is your room
the doctors left for the day
hell see you in the morning
wait ive got to talk to someone in authority sorry
changeling a true story
this is my room
then if i could just use the phone
phone privileges are earned by good behavior
youre not allowed newspapers magazines radio books or sharp objects
this is for your own good
the nurse exits closing and locking the door
theres been a terrible mistake
shes alone with the other patient who doesnt much like the noise and disturbance
they said it was my room
im sorry i she starts screaming
christine covers her ears
we slowly pull away from the narrow window and the sound of screaming into the late afternoon rain and growing darkness

im trying to find a place called the northcott ranch up by wineville

there is a gun on the floor of the trunk
gordon picks it up inside the rag
youre almost there

then the next right
thatll bring you right to it

ybarra drives away
as soon as hes out of sight gordon slams the hood runs to the drivers side and starts the truck still steaming
he drives off as fast as he can
a long low house stonework and brick and wood behind a large open area cluttered with junked cars
at the far end of the open area is a chicken coop about fifteen feet long
ybarra drives up in front of the house gets out looks around
someone is watching as ybarra moves toward the main house
ybarra glances off to a rustling sound and follows it to a few chickens inside held back by wire

a corner of the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired

as suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house slamming the door
ybarra runs to the porch tries the door
locked from the inside
he pounds on the door
this is the police
i have a warrant for a minor named sanford clark
open the door and stand aside
he braces himself and kicks open the door
the door bangs against the wall
flies buzz around the place
the kitchen is in shadows but theres no question its a mess
ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen
no sound except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters old musty shadowed
the ticking of an old grandfather clock
theres no one in sight
ybarra moves down the hall glances into two adjoining rooms
he continues into curtains drawn dark cocooned against the outside world
ybarra makes a circuit of the room then stops at a creak of wood from a closet
he moves toward it
reaches for the doorknob
as suddenly a clock chimes loudly and the closet explodes outward and sanford clark runs out
he slams into ybarra knocking him down
they go down in a tumble of limbs wrestling on the floor as sanford tries to escape
stop it or ill push your face through the floor
breathing hard sanford finally stops struggling
ybarra cuffs sanfords hands behind his back
on your feet
sanford stands and as ybarra leads him out we pan to a mantle and a photo that shows sanford clark and a man we recognize as the one we saw
by the road earlier gordon northcott
ybarra locks sanford in the car then climbs in the drivers side
he checks a cut on his face in the rear view mirror

what difference does it make now
were just sending you back to canada son it isnt the end of the world
you cant just stay in the u
as long as you want pal
weve got a orders to send you back home and suddenly sanford starts laughing
its a nearly hysterical laugh half fear and half relief
ybarra isnt there for the reasons he thought
ybarra is puzzled by his reaction
didnt know canada was that funny
ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off

best i can do is put you on a train for seattle
from there you can transfer to one of the locals or drive across the border
thatll be fine

gordon glances at a cop heading his way
the cop continues past him
gordon relaxes as the vender slides the ticket across
thatll be fifteen dollars

we hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall
christine stands pulls her hair back and catches her reflection in the window pale drawn smudged and in a hospital gown
looking like someone who actually belongs in this place
the door opens and she steps into the hall as a nurse passes
can i see the doctor
or someone in charge breakfast is half an hour
but i down the hall
the doctor will call for you when hes ready
beat go or stay either way i lock the door
christine doesnt want to stay so she moves off

some have scars showing lobotomies or electro convulsive shock therapy
its a scary bunch
christine isnt eating

eating is normal
you got to do everything you can to look normal
thats the only chance youve got
besides youll need the strength

christine is startled by the level headedness of the advice from someone she assumed was probably nuts
reluctantly she begins eating the cold looking oatmeal
my names carol dexter
christine reacts to the taste of the food which is awful
finish it all
i know its hard but you have to try
lunch isnt as bad
close but not as i wont be here that long
as soon as i can talk to a doctor theyll realize theres been a terrible mistake and yeah that always works
beat quieter i heard them talking
youre here on a code twelve police action
the doctors the staff they figure that if the police sent you here there must be a good reason for it
then ill just have to prove that im not insane
the more you try to act sane the crazier you start to look
if you smile too much youre delusional or stifling hysteria
if you dont smile youre depressed
if youre neutral youre emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic
you seem to have given this a great deal of thought
dont you get it
youre code twelve
so am i

points os the lady over there was married to a cop who kept beating her up
when she tried to tell somebody they sent her here
and that one
the police beat the crap out of her brother broke both his arms
when she complained to the papers they picked her up and
what about you
chris doesnt get it i mean i work nights
in some of the clubs
it gets through
this one client started hitting me and he wouldnt stop
so i filed a complaint
turns out he was a cop
next thing i know im here
but how can they youre kidding right
hey everybody knows women are fragile right
theyre all emotions no logic nothin goin on upstairs
and sometimes like when they say something thats a little yknow inconvenient
they just go fucking nuts pardon my french
if were insane nobody has to listen to us
i mean who are you going to believe some crazy woman trying to destroy the integrity of the force or a police officer
then once they get us in here we either learn to behave and shut up or beat or you dont go home
or you go home like that
changeling a true story
she nods to an older woman whose upper temples are marred by surgical scars
christine turns away
better finish up your oatmeal
want to look sane for the doctors
then i want to hear what they nailed you for
numb with horror christine forces down the oatmeal
sanford clark sits near several other juveniles being held
pensive nervous he watches a kid absently tapping a ruler against his knees
feature the ruler
then back on sanford as we hear it continuing to tap os
push in on his face
then suddenly on a hatchet rising and falling in tune with the ruler tapping
theres blood on the hatchet
gordon northcotts eyes glitter insanely as he brings the hatchet down again and just as it comes right at us we flash as sanford cries out with the memory
we pull back to see the others in the room staring at him
he turns away wont meet their gaze
somethings terribly wrong
just then an administrator comes in
sanford rises goes to the administrator
paperworks come through
youll be deported back to canada day after tomorrow
the police there will to decide what to do with you next
i hope your stay here has convinced you not to try crossing the border illegally in future
he starts to turn and walk away when changeling a true story
i want to talk to the officer who brought me in
im sure he has far more important things to do than please
the administrator senses that hes sincere and troubled
hes off duty until tomorrow but
ill see what i can do
and with that the administrator heads away
gordon northcott is hitch hiking by the side of the road
a truck approaches passes him
then slows and stops
gordon runs up to the truck as the driver leans out
how far you going
gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat
when something metallic bangs underneath
he lifts out a short length of metal pipe
dont worry about that pal
just a little insurance
a couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border
you cant be too safe you know
yeah i surely do
gordon smiles moves as if to hand the pipe back
and suddenly slams it down on the drivers head
over and over and over
blood splatters his face
breathing hard gordon shoves the driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off
changeling a true story
wearing a bandage on one arm christine is escorted down the hall by one of the nurses
shes led into where doctor jonathan steele stands as christine enters
hes in his fifties heavy set serious
please have a seat
the nurse leaves
christine notes that there are three chairs in a row
could be a test
she sits in the middle chair
sits as straight as she can
trying to look sane
i hope your stay has been comfortable so far
id think it would be quite difficult at first
catching herself well it was
difficult i mean
he makes a note of this
this isnt going well
he motions to the bandage on her arm
i see they took a blood test
to check for syphilis
apparently it can affect the mind
the idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis
did that upset you
not at all
im sure its
she smiles a forced smile
trying to appear level headed
changeling a true story
we have to cover all bases and covering her bases but
at the same time
i imagine that it would be
would probably be upsetting to
some people that someone else might
suspect that of them
beat however inappropriate that might be
she flashes another wan smile
he makes another note picks up the report on his desk glances it over
according to your file you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son
is that true
i didnt say they substituted a fake boy just
not the right boy
beat they brought back the wrong boy
not my son
hes still missing
he starts pulling out papers from his file
you see i have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station welcoming your son home
that is you in the photo isnt it
so at first he was your son but now hes not your son
beat has this been going on for a long time
changing becoming something other than what they are
people dont change doctor
you dont think people change
changeling a true story
thats not what i and the police
theyre not out to persecute you
of course not
the police are here to protect us
shes trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear
its a chess match that ends with thats odd because according to the head nurse when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately to
so either she and the interns are also conspiring against you
or youre changing your story
beat do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy mrs
he sits back
christines face tells the story
the administrator enters with detective ybarra
im sorry to bring you out in this weather detective but the boy has been quite insistent
its all right ill just see what he has to say so i can go home and get dry
where is he
a single table two chairs
sanford sits quietly nervously as ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook
changeling a true story
its raining cats dogs and democrats out there so this better be worth it
he sits across the table from sanford lights up a cigarette
sanfords mouth works for a moment but nothing comes out
look i this isnt easy okay
a long beat
sanford composes himself begins my cousins gordon northcott
he owns the ranch where you found me
he let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone doing chores stuff like that
said i could stay on as long as i wanted to
i figured that also meant i could leave whenever i wanted to but he wouldnt let me
are you saying he held you prisoner
sanford nods bull
when i got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird
couldve left any time you wanted
so whats this some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally
no its nothing like that
because i dont have time for listen to me please
he said what
what did he he said that if i tried to leave hed kill me
more changeling a true story
sanford contd you dont understand you dont know what hes like what he
what we did
what he made me do
sanford is in tears by now
ybarra realizes that theres something real going on here and backs off
okay lets start at the beginning
what did he make you do
sanford closes his eyes
takes a long beat
him and me
me and gordon we
beat softly we killed some kids
ybarra freezes the cigarette not moving in his hand
i didnt mean to i swear
he made me help him said if i didnt hed kill me too
please you gotta help me
i dont want to go to hell for killing kids
i dont know
i never knew their names
how many kids
he thinks about it for a moment
the fact that he has to add them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next
twenty i guess
no its true i swear
changeling a true story
i kinda stopped counting after a while and gordon said one or two mightve gotten away but nobody can just up and kill twenty kids we did
yeah we did that
sanford looks off pauses then softly and slowly
most times wed bring back just one or two
sometimes as many as three
gordon is at his truck the same one we saw earlier checking the engine as sanford looks on nervously
i always knew when he was getting ready cause hed go through the car and clean it up make sure the tires were good the engine
he was always afraid somethingd break down and wed be caught
gordon slams the hood shut looks to sanford
time to go
a kid is walking down the street playing idly by himself as the truck starts to approach from behind
wed go a different direction every time never hit the same part of town twice
sometimes wed go for hours just driving around until we found somebody
the truck comes beside the kid and gordon leans out the window
changeling a true story
hed use all kinds of different stories
sometimes hed say he had free tickets for the circus or he was looking for a lost dog
that one worked real good
other days there you are weve been looking for you like mad
flash image to a different kid a different street
your folks they got in an accident
they sent us to find you
theyre hurt real bad
the police took em to the hospital but they didnt have time to come find you so we said wed do it
now come on hurry
we gotta get to the hospital see your folks
flash image yet another kid who hesitates looks to sanford
a lot of kids wont get in a car alone with a stranger but when hes got a kid there with him that made it easier
beat theyd look to me and figure if i was safe they would be too
thats why he needed me see
come on in
flash image back to the first kid who takes one last beat then gets into the car
every time they got in the truck it was like i wanted to die
now hold on its a long drive and we gotta fly
and the truck heads off
changeling a true story
then as soon as we got back to the ranch
they went in the coop
the boy crying is tossed into the chicken coop
there are two other boys there also crying and screaming
some days hed do em right off
other days hed wait pick up a few more keep em in the coop until he had like four or five cause beat cause he liked to hear em scream
all at once
like they were some kinda chorus
gordon eyes insane with blood lust stumbles toward the coop
the kids screaming
sanford looking on afraid to move the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly
gordon grabbing an ax
on sanfords eyes terrified
the ax begins to fall in slow motion and as the long ash at the end of ybarras cigarette tumbles to the floor in slow motion end over end shattering
when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed
sometimes hed leave one or two of em alive
and tell me
or ill finish you
beat and i did
oh sweet jesus
i killed em
i killed em
i killed em
then silence except for sanfords sobbing
ybarra realizes he hasnt been breathing
he tries to find his voice
changeling a true story
do you think
if you saw them again do you think youd recognize them
sanford nods just a second
he goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band
hands it to sanford
i havent updated these in a while but still it should be
beat just go through
and if you see any faces you recognize put it on the table
sanford takes the photos
starts going through them
a photo a face goes down on the table
with each photo slapped down the slap gets louder booming at us
row after row
hes crying sobbing but still putting down photos
then he slams down the last one and half falls half stumbles out of his chair sobbing
goes to the corner of the room and slides down the wall until hes sitting in a fetal position hands covering his face
numb ybarra goes to the table picks up a photo
looks at it
turns it over to the name then picks up another
then a third
when he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over he stops staring at it
the name on the back of the photo is walter collins
jones is on the phone pissed and getting more pissed by the moment
intercut between jones and ybarra in juvenile hall during the conversation
have you gone soft in the head les
sir i changeling a true story
hes playing you
he knows hes in trouble so hes come up with some cock and bull story about how he was forced to stay in the country with all due respect sir
i dont think so
you didnt see him the kids scared half out of his mind he picked the collins kid
we found him remember
havent you been reading the papers
beat or maybe you have is that it
he backhands a newspaper on his desk headlined distraught sir if youd just listen just then a secretary sticks her head in the doorway
im sorry captain but hes here again
that reverend briegleb
hes asking about christine collins
tell the sonofabitch to get the hell off police property before i have him arrested for disturbing the peace
he said hes not leaving
him or his friends
theres a disturbance off screen and she goes to deal with it as jones gets further wound up to ninety
what the hell
hes drawn to the window by the sound of voices
he peeks through the slats
several dozen placard carrying parishioners and members of the womens temperance league are standing in the street beating drums and calling christines name
jesus jumped down
he realizes hes still on the phone
changeling a true story
youre not to do anything except come back here
sir department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated
and these are kids for chrissakes departmental policy is what i say it is you got that
now im ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid you got that
you bring him here and you talk to no one got it
he slams the phone down
cut back to ybarra in juvenile hall agonizing over this
finally his voice resigned he looks into the interrogation room
all right lets go
jones has come out into the hall where briegleb several supporters and a handful of reporters are standing at the receiving officers desk
they approach quickly
are you captain jones
what the hell have you done with christine collins
dont try and lie your way out of it
i talked to several neighbors who saw her being driven off in a police car
collins has been placed in protective custody following a mental breakdown
changeling a true story
her statements and behavior have been found to be consistent with a delusional state of mind that could make her a danger to herself or others
in the public interest we are looking after her son while she gets the help she clearly needs
sorry were withholding that information to respect the privacy of the family
but i can assure you that shes getting the best treatment available
he heads back the way he came as the others shout questions after him held back by other police officers
patients are being corralled into a line that extends to a barred window where a nurse is dispensing pills
line up for medication
line up for medication
christine is nudged forward by an orderly carol beside her
what kind of medication
the kind thats good for you
help you relax
shes nudged to the window where a nurse hands out a pill and water
i dont want to relax
im fine and i wont take something unless i know what it is
changeling a true story
orderly just listen we can force feed it to you if thats what you want
christine sees dr
steele breaks away and rushes to him
doctor steele i heard
i dont know whats going on but im not taking anything until i understand
come with me
he moves off into an adjoining room
carol dexter next in line takes her pill
but keeps an eye on christine
he goes to his desk as she stands in the doorway
i dont have anything wrong with me that i should have to take medication
theres nothing wrong with you
he pulls a typed letter out of his desk slides it across
then you shouldnt have any trouble signing this
she picks it up reads as he continues changeling a true story
by signing you certify that you were wrong when you stated the boy returned by the police was not your son
it further stipulates that the police acted properly in sending you here for observation and absolves them of all responsibility for i wont sign it
then your condition is not improved
beat sign it and you can be out of here first thing tomorrow
i wont sign it
she tears up the sheet of paper
i was not wrong
that boy is not my son
and i am not going to stop telling the truth about this
and youre not going to stop me and the police arent going to stop me mrs
collins youre becoming agitated
i will tear down the walls of this place with my bare hands if i have to but one way or another orderly
an orderly appears in the doorway
the patient is disturbed hyperactive and is threatening the staff
see to it she is properly sedated
she bursts past the orderly running into changeling a true story
running pursued by orderlies two more blocking her way
no i wont let you
someone please help me
they tackle her and bring her down
she struggles as the others look on and you can see in their eyes that they dont like what theyre seeing theres rage and a furious carol dexter comes to
she jumps into the struggle
steele comes on the run just as the orderlies peel carol off the fight spinning her around to face steele who slaps her
stay out of this
this is none of your business
to the rest this is police business
youll stay out of it if you know whats good for you
he looks to carol christine restrained behind them
youd think you had enough trouble with the law just being a whore wouldnt you
she gets a hand free and slugs him hard a nail slicing his cheek
he touches his face
it comes back with blood
then he looks to the orderly
attacking a staff member
electro convulsive therapy
the orderly hauls carol off kicking and screaming as christine is moved toward the nurses station
no leave her alone
whatre you they force a pill in her mouth following with water as they hold her nose forcing her to swallow
she chokes swallows
they march her down the hall as steele returns to his office
changeling a true story
the electro shock room
carol struggles against the orderlies who force her down onto the gurney
a nurse behind her applies conductor jelly to her temples as another orderly shoves a rubber bite guard into her mouth
then a pair of metal pincers points covered in cloth are pressed against her temples
a button is pushed
and her body goes rigid as a jolt of electricity blasts through her body
this was remember fairly common practice for violent behavior in the s
then she passes out her eyes rolling up in her head
christine is peering out the narrow slot in her door as she sees carol being wheeled down the hall and put into her bed
christine sobbing collapses slowly to the floor caught in a nightmare and unable to wake up
detective ybarra is sitting at his desk not happy about a lot of his life at this moment
hes turning over the photos of the missing kids identified by sanford clark and arranging them on his desk the way you might arrange cards playing solitaire
he looks up to see sanford being led out of one of the holding areas hands cuffed clothes in his hands
being transferred to a waiting bus
the two exchange a look
ybarra looks away
sanford continues toward the bus
finally in agony ybarra cant take it any more
he rises goes to the officer standing by the door to the bus
its all right ill take it from here
but we need him for questioning
he leads sanford away then stops two passing officers
changeling a true story
youve just been requisitioned for backup
ill explain on the way
he hurries off
the officers follow not sure whats up
christine sits beside carols bed
shes awake but dazed
christine dabs a wet cloth against her forehead
you shouldnt have done that
with difficulty wanted
carol takes her hand holds it
to back alley doctors
beat never had
to fight for them
and the horse
they rode in on
christine manages a thin smile despite her tears
thats hardly appropriate language for a lady now is it
there are times
thats exactly the right thing to say
and whens that
when youve got
nothing left to lose
christine touches her face and we know shes heard this
changeling a true story
two squad cars pull up to the ranch
ybarra and the other officers get out guns up not knowing if gordon is still there or not
they move quickly through the area checking the house
everythings dark silent
one officer runs into the house theres a long pause
then he pokes his head out again
ybarra goes back to the car opens the door
sanford hesitates then starts toward a nearby barn
he slides the door open and walks to the far end
the dirt here is a strange white yellow color
ybarra follows still keeping a wary eye out for trouble
he looks down at where sanford has stopped
several bags marked lye are nearby
ybarra edges toward a shovel hands it to him
off sanfords look you put em in the ground you can take em out of the ground
sanford takes the shovel and starts cutting out sections of dirt and lye dust rising around them
ybarra watches pensively as the other officers edge their way in
hes looking the other way when one of the officers reacts holy god
ybarra glances back
to see a childs shoe being unearthed
and beside it
call it in
get the coroner and every officer in a twenty mile radius here inside the hour
more changeling a true story
ybarra contd then put out an apb on gordon stewart northcott the info is in my car
the officer races out of the barn as ybarra looks to sanford who is still digging crying as he goes
you can stop now son
he doesnt you can stop now
we can take it from here
sobbing sanford drops the shovel and collapses on the ground hands covering his face crying in great heaving sobs
the patients are lined up outside their rooms for inspection
steele passes down them in review
stops in front of christine who looks exhausted worn pale her eyes bloodshot
but still defiant
he glances to the orderlies
the orderlies move all of the other patients away except for christine who shares a glance with carol
several other orderlies remain
he glances at her chart in his hands
i see youve still been refusing medication requiring force feeding
i see they switched to a rubber tube
i hear that can quite uncomfortable
she doesnt answer
her eyes never leave his
he pulls another copy of the letter out of the folder
six days mrs
collins and no progress
we may have to go to more
beat unless youre willing to prove youre doing better
by signing this
he holds it up in front of her
she focuses first on it then on him
and finally her spine where it needs to be even if the rest of her is in shambles looks at him and says changeling a true story
and the horse
you rode in on
he nods shrugs puts the letter back in the folder
turns to the orderlies
they grab her and start muscling her down the hall christine kicking and screaming as they go
steele continues out to where he comes through the double barred door just as gustav briegleb charges in the front door carrying a newspaper
sir please steele approaches
im head doctor on duty
whats the problem
you the doctor whos got christine collins locked up in here
intercut with they wheel christine into the room struggling fighting against the straps that pin her to the gurney
steele turns away from briegleb unconcerned
sorry we dont discuss our cases with anyone other than family youll damned well discuss this one with me
changeling a true story
sir briegleb thrusts the newspaper into steeles hands
read it damn you
steele unfolds the paper looks at the headline which we dont see
his reaction though is ominous and serious
the nurse behind christine applies the conductor jell to her temples
shes fighting the best she can but its hopeless
the nurse picks up the electro shock pincers
places them on christines temples
reaches for the button as suddenly the door opens and a nurse steps in stopping the process
the nurse goes to the one at the controls whispers in her ear
the nurse then says something quietly to the orderly who starts to undo the straps that hold christine to the gurney
the doctor wants to see you
they pull her up off the gurney
christine is ushered inside where steele is waiting
he looks upset about something
she forces herself to stand straight not easy given what shes just been through
one last time
are you or are you not prepared to sign that letter
she looks up into his face her resolve unshaken her voice dry but firm for no
he studies her for one last beat then turns his back
youre free to go
changeling a true story
christine takes a moment to process this
not sure if she heard this right or if its a trick
your clothes are in the next room
you can change there
she hesitates a second looks to the orderly being careful in case this is a set up
to the orderly see to it
the orderly nods
she takes one last look around then gets the hell out of the room
alone steele picks up the newspaper that had been laying face down on his desk looks at it and shakes his head
carol is there as christine now in her regular clothes comes dashing in
carol sees her goes to her
youre getting out
i am out
how i dont know
but i couldnt go without saying goodbye christine dont be stupid get out of here fast in case they change their mind
but i want you to know once i have my boy back im coming more changeling a true story
christine contd back here
for you and the others
this is wrong and we can stop it you are crazy
christine breaks the hug and hurries away as carol looks on crying
christine comes to the area where she was checked in
no one is looking at her
she passes the nurses station and heads toward the door
fresh air comes in
she steps out the front door as a moment later briegleb passes through the hallway with an admissions official having not seen her
you give me every piece of paper youve got on this case you hear me
the official moves on nervous as briegleb looks to the receiving nurse
when does she come down
before she can answer we jump out to where christine walks among the sidewalk traffic
she starts to pass a news stand where a news vendor is calling out headlines peddling papers
hurricane hits west palm beach
babe ruth hits rd home run
kids found murdered in riverside
the last line stops christine
just a bad sense that grows as she turns to the news vendor who keeps on going
biggest crime in los angeles history
beat collins boy assumed dead on ranch
changeling a true story
christines knees buckle as she hears this
she starts to go down as briegleb runs toward her from the hospital
and she collapses into his arms sobbing uncontrollably as passers by glance over at her
and continue walking
i didnt want you to find out like this
but theyre just words
she doesnt hear them
captain jones is pacing nervously in the hallway for a long beat when another officer steps out of an office with a brass nameplate that reads chief of police james
the chief will see you now
jones straightens his tie and steps into lots of dark wood and filtered light
davis is sitting at his desk looking at a series of newspapers in front of him as jones steps up and stands before the desk
i dont know if youre aware of it captain but i have an exceptionally good vocabulary
im a terror at scrabble crossword puzzles but even im in awe of the vocabulary that the press and the city council have been exercising in reference to this department
courtesy of the christine collins
scans papers incompetent
mendacious and invidious
those two courtesy of that prick gustav briegleb
bonus words in scrabble both of them
hard to work that one into a conversation
but he managed it all right
changeling a true story
sir i the key of course is the context in which words like this get used
you have to do that in scrabble you know when somebody challenges a word
show how its used in a sentence
so incompetent as in reads a department so incompetent that they never realized that up to twenty children were being kidnapped and murdered under their very noses
looks over and here so incompetent that they insisted they knew better than a mother the identity of her own child forced him upon her and then incarcerated her when
she confronted them with evidence of their own reprehensible behavior
that was a two fer
incompetent and reprehensible in the same sentence
guy must be a real terror at crossword puzzles
davis gets up and crosses the room looking out through the slatted windows at the busy los angeles street outside
captain your handling of the collins case has exposed this department to public ridicule
there is even the potential for civil and criminal liability
sir nobody could have known what was going on up at that ranch
not us not the sheriffs department the marshalls office
as for the collins woman
beat im still not convinced that her kid is among the victims up in wineville
more changeling a true story
jones contd there were four other photos of missing boys that looked a lot like him
this clark kid could have been mistaken
maybe he was
which raises the obvious question so what
davis turns back to him from the window
the mayor wants this to go away
i want this to go away
the way you do that is to stop insisting that walter collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch
because if the boy you brought back isnt walter collins and hes not dead up at that ranch then where the hell is he
people will want to know why we havent found him
why we arent we doing our job
beat but if on the other hand he is or could be among those poor boys killed up in wineville
then the inquiries stop
its a momentary embarrassment that youll have to live with
but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem wouldnt you say captain
jones doesnt like it but he swallows his pride
the boys been gone for nearly a year
if he was going to be found it wouldve happened by now
whether he was up at that ranch or not the truth is he probably is dead somewhere
better his mother accepts that now rather than later dont you think
changeling a true story
thatll be all captain
jones starts to leave then looks back as davis settles back behind his desk
sir theres talk of an investigation by the police commission
let me worry about the commission
but it wouldnt hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from de kalb and why he did this because the press bought into
his bullshit same as we did
that we were all taken in by the scheming little bastard may help take some of the sting off this
my boys are working on it now sir
and he exits as we go to detective ybarra is sitting on one side of a table a notepad in front of him staring across at walter who isnt very
happy right now and is staring back with substantial venom
his true nasty personality is free to come out at last
theres a long beat then i want a glass of water
whats your name
walter collins is dead
shrugs i didnt do it
changeling a true story
look let me explain something to you
because of your lies youve ruined a womans life embarrassed the police department and got the whole city up in arms over this
walter considers this for a beat then smiles
got a lot done didnt i
ybarra exchanges a look with the matron then closes up his notepad
all right if thats how you want it then i guess were done here
to matron tell county jail were remanding him for trial
i told you the real walter collins was murdered
i didnt do anything
i wasnt even here when it happened
by pretending to be walter collins youre interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder
we can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact
beat too bad
county jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home
a lot worse
you cant do that
im just a kid
sanford clark is a kid too
but hes going to jail
all murderers and their accomplices go to jail
everyone knows that
to the matron get him out of here
its out of my hands now
changeling a true story
he heads for the door when walter cries out scared
i dont want to go to jail
and on the boys face we hear arthur hutchins
ybarra is standing in the doorway to jones office speaking to the captain and looking at his notepad
the boys real name is arthur hutchins junior age twelve a runaway from cedar rapids iowa
did you check the wire services
ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet
the report was filed by his divorced mother who lives in clinton iowa with the boys grandmother
apparently he didnt like living with the old lady she didnt let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with and one day
he up and left
what about the man he showed up with at the diner
just some drifter
the boy was hungry ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it
only when they finished he left the kid behind while he cut out
when the police picked him up they started going through the wire reports about missing kids and he overheard them say the name walter collins
changeling a true story
but why that one
i mean of all the police departments he couldve screwed up why los angeles
i asked him the same question
pushing in on walter for i
i knew that los angeles was where they made the tom mix movies
i figured maybe i could meet tom mix
maybe hed even let me ride his horse
beat his horse is named blue
did you know that
christine is in a bed in a small room in the rectory a tray beside her still recovering from her experience
briegleb enters and approaches a nearby chair
how are you feeling
a little better thanks
the sleep helped
anything new outside
nothing that cant wait until youre stronger
the police still have a car parked outside
they want to know what your next move is
i want to go home
she takes a beat then slowly gingerly gets out of bed
changeling a true story
ive been giving that a great deal of thought ever since i got out of that
all those women and what they did about walter
beat theyre going to just keep on doing it arent they
nothings going to change
unless we make it change
she glances out the window to the police car parked across the street
i used to tell walter never start a fight
but always finish it
i didnt start this fight
but by god im going to finish it
its dangerous and youve already been through a great deal mrs
right now youre sufficiently high profile that the police will hesitate to come after you out in the open
but if they see their position threatened that could change quickly
beat your life could be in danger
she takes a beat then turns to him from the window
always finish it
a series of red brick rowhouses line a quiet street
we see couples walking hand in hand kids playing
then we notice gordon northcott coming around the corner
he looks around then cuts across a yard jumping over a fence to get to where rachel clark s is doing dishes as the doorbell rings
just a minute
she opens the door and finds gordon northcott standing outside
theres a flicker of a pause
was she expecting him
changeling a true story
i didnt know you were back in town
got in a couple of days ago figured id surprise you
yes of course
come on in
she steps aside as he enters looks around
wheres that little niece of mine
went into town
should be back this evening
bobs here good
need to talk to him about staying on for a few days
staying listen can i use your bathroom
its been a long ride and i could use a shower
he passes her and heads upstairs
she steps to the back of the house where her husband bob is coming in through the back wiping engine grease off his hands with a towel
is that she nods scared go next door
ill call the police
she rushes past him into the other room to do just that
gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam shut
he peers out the window
several royal canadian mounted police cars have pulled up along the street
mounties are getting out moving quietly toward the house
changeling a true story
bob quietly lets the mounties in
they signal for bob to get the hell out of there
guns in hand they climb the stairs
suddenly theres the sound of breaking glass from above
they race up the stairs to find the window broken and gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop
go around the other side
cut him off
the others take off as he and another mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of northcott
gordon races up one rooftop over the top then leaps to the next one as below mounties race to keep up with him whistles blowing furiously
he looks behind him to see the other two mounties running rooftop to rooftop coming fast
gordon runs faster going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground
and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop
he leaps across one chasm barely makes it keeps running
the rooftop mounties follow
one of them makes the jump successfully but the other falls short plummeting to the ground three stories below
a leg snaps on impact
the first mountie hesitates looks down
the second one waves him on
get the bastard
he nods and continues the chase
gordon runs for all hes worth
the mountie keeps after him
gordon makes another leap
the mountie jumps
but hes short
he grabs onto a rain gutter
gordon sees his situation runs back and stomps on the mounties hands trying to get him to shake loose
the gutter starts to tear free when a mountie down below fires at gordon making him back off
the mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof
gordon keeps running
but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped
he hesitates starts to cut back in another direction when the mountie tackles him hard
the two go down in a tangle of limbs fighting punching kicking
changeling a true story
they slide down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge
with nowhere else to run gordon fights for all hes got the punches from both coming fast and furious
finally the mountie backs off just a bit screw this
im too old for this fightin shit
and dives at gordon taking them both off the edge of the two story roof and down into a garden below crashing through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land
with a thud the mounties impact cushioned by gordon
as the other mounties come on the run the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised bleeding but otherwise intact gordon
looks at him nose to nose
and he yanks gordon toward the other waiting officers
christine opens the door to find reverend briegleb and another man on her porch s
hahn late fifties
collins i want you to meet a friend of mine mr
my deepest condolences on your loss
can we come in
she steps aside to let them in closing the door under mr
hahn was it
changeling a true story
i appreciate the sentiment but so far they still havent positively identified any of the
but he was identified was he not
i guess i still cant accept it
it doesnt feel real to me
it never does
i lost a daughter to polio five years ago
theres not a day goes by i dont think i should mention this to claudine
then i remember shes not here
they do as christine looks to briegleb
ive been on the phone all day with the appointment secretary for the police commission
they wont let me testify at the hearing or call witnesses
they say its not necessary
my sources tell me the police commission is going to come out with a report that whitewashes the whole thing
theyre going to say that jones and the rest of the lapd did absolutely nothing wrong that the real blame is with the kid
and with you for being difficult and forcing them to put you away for your own safety
then well just have to hire a lawyer
bring a civil suit and try to get the city council to call for a hearing by the welfare board
jut one problem
more changeling a true story
briegleb contd not one lawyer outside this room was willing to take on the police department
too risky they said
so finally i went to the very best attorney in town a man whos sued the city four times and won
unfortunately we could never afford to hire him
crestfallen i see
which is why im doing this pro bono
a smile it would be my honor to defend your honor mrs
in my fifteen years as a lawyer i have never seen anyone fight as long or as hard as you have in what is so clearly in the cause of
now i want you to tell mr
hahn here the whole story from end to end leave nothing out hell need it all if hes going to get the city council involved
one thing though
a personal favor
when weve finished here today could you spare a few minutes to come with me downtown
hahn marches into the receiving area with christine collins and briegleb
he goes to the receiving nurse
may i she sees christine collins and the sentence dies midway
hahn pulls out a handful of papers
my name is s
more changeling a true story
hahn contd hahn and i have a court order for the immediate release of all women being detained in this institution under the designation code twelve pending a formal inquiry
into the reasons for their detainment
im sorry but the doctor in charge wont be in until tomorrow morning and let me be clearer
either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order or you will find yourself on the other side of those bars
without a key
the nurse exchanges a sour look with christine and heads off
one by one the code twelve patients are brought out of the hospital and into the light
one of the last to emerge is carol dexter who blinks against the light and sees christine
she runs to her embraces her sobbing
i knew youd come
i knew youd come back
i knew youd come
its all right
everythings going to be all right now
and in christines face we see a flicker of pride and one simple truth if she could not save her son she could at least save these women
as they move toward her hahn and briegleb we hear a train whistle that segues us into gordon northcott handcuffed is led out of a train by several officers
the waiting press rush toward him
he seems to enjoy the attention
among the shouted questions we hear mr
northcott any comment on your arrest
im feeling fine
more changeling a true story
gordon contd ive been on a little vacation as some of you know
it was a pleasant vacation and the police have certainly provided me with a lot of amusement
how did you avoid capture
well i didnt did i
didnt know anyone wanted me until just recently
didnt even try
my luggage still has my initials on it
did you know why the police were after you
no but i figured it would be best if i stayed out of it
anything to say to the parents of the children you murdered
and on that the police hustle gordon away
davis is filling out paperwork as the door opens
he looks up as los angeles mayor george cryer enters closing the door after him again
this is unexpected
so was this
he drops a series of court documents on davis desk
he picks them up examines them
subpoenas requests for depositions interrogatories
all courtesy of mr
hahn and his new client christine collins
more changeling a true story
cryer contd you dont have to look them over too closely chief your own copies should be arriving any time now
beat the city council has also agreed to look into this starting immediately
i thought this was supposed to go away
this is an election year i cant afford this kind of press
it is going away sir
i instructed captain jones im afraid falling on his sword and saying he made a mistake isnt going to be good enough chief
if we take him out of the picture for a while it might help calm things down until the hearings finished
beat there are several people on the council who are planning to run against me and theyd love to accuse me of allowing a renegade police force to operate with
cryer shakes his head walks off a pace
our friends in the press are having a field day with this mess
im getting five hundred phone calls letters and telegrams a day demanding to know what the hell is going on at city hall that we allow our police force to
brutalize women and misplace children
christ all this picture needs now is for somebody to kick a puppy for the cameras
beat this is a train chief and we need to either get in front of it or be run over by it
i stand by my men
you know that
changeling a true story
and you know where i stand
so the question is
are we going to stand together
or hang together
he lets the question sit as we go to mayor cryer stands beside chief davis and addresses a rather noisy and worked up press corps from behind a podium
as mayor of los angeles it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of christine collins
as a result we have decided that captain j
jones of the lincoln heights division is to be suspended from active duty effective immediately
whats the charge chief
the charge is conduct unbecoming an officer and using improper and abusive language toward mrs
it further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating mrs
collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause
mayor cryer are you aware that the city council has said it plans to open its own investigation into the collins case
ive heard this yes
but since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the city council would be to suspend captain jones and since that action has now been taken the
question is moot
which makes it look like the only reason jones is being suspended is to head off the city council more changeling a true story
reporter contd investigation
are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain
i wont even dignify that question with a response
the two head back into glancing back over their shoulders at the press outside
cheer up chief
that little show should take the wind out of their sails
by monday this issue will be as cold as yesterdays fish
never underestimate the publics lack of attention and potential for apathy
old news is dead news youll see
she opens the door as briegleb enters with three really large dangerous looking men one of whom is carrying a heavy trench coat
reverend what sorry to barge in so late mrs
collins but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job
these three gentlemen are members of my congregation who before coming to the lord had lived lives of brutality vice and crime
now they are pledged to doing gods work
and if this isnt it i dont know what is
i dont understand
people who bring charges against the police have a habit of more changeling a true story
briegleb contd disappearing right before the trial
im a big believer in the power of prayer mrs
but a little backup from time to time never hurts
the others nod as they make themselves comfortable in the living room
can i get you anything
since we dont plan on sleeping coffee would be lovely
she heads off to get some coffee
as one of the men puts his coat behind the sofa we see that it contains a sawed off shotgun
briegleb looks out the window to where a police car sits watching the house
shes dressed in her best dress putting on a hat and a pair of gloves
her hands are shaking
she squeezes them together closes her eyes
with one final deep breath she heads out
the same police car is there as christine gets into a car with briegleb and the two drive off
the other three men get into another car and follow
the police car in turn pulls away from the curb following both cars
hes aware that theyre being followed glancing in the rear view mirror to keep an eye on things
looks over to christine smiles encouragingly
traffics getting heavy
well go up spring
the other cars do the same
but the traffic here is even worse
just then briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with christines bodyguards
changeling a true story
briegleb turns quickly trying to get ahead but the streets too busy
he looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them
briegleb is nervous sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up
the traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side
then theres a momentary break in traffic
he turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts off the engine
jumps out and opens the door for christine who gets out
he glances back at the police car
the two inside start to open the doors but they cant get them open being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other
they run the siren to clear traffic but its too late as christine and briegleb hurry down the street on foot briegleb glancing behind them
the foot and car traffic is very heavy
we hear horns honking and in the distance something that could be the sound of lots of people
just a few more blocks
where is all this traffics coming from
briegleb glances back
the police car has popped its doors and two trench coated officers are getting out
christine stops a man passing in the opposite direction
excuse me can you tell me what the problem is up ahead
didnt you hear
its the biggest protest ive ever seen
over that collins broad if you can believe that
changeling a true story
he moves on
briegleb and collins slowly exchange a look somewhere between disbelief and oh shit
he didnt mean
he couldnt mean i dont know
all i know is that i think i just stopped breathing
they walk quickly up one clogged street and down another the police following on foot
moving toward the sound of voices drums and cars honking
until they turn onto spring street and find themselves in the middle of the biggest protest march ever recorded in the history of los angeles to this date
thousands of people crowd into the street overwhelming the police presence
not rioting but making their voices heard
the salvation army the womens temperance society the society for justice catholic groups union groups and ordinary citizens carrying placards and signs that read we support christine collins and justice
collins and the lapd a citys shame
it just goes on and on and on
christine looks out to see her boss from the telephone company mr
harris marching arm in arm with the rest
he sees her smiles tips his hat and continues marching
christine is stunned
briegleb even moreso
the lord works in mysterious ways mrs
he looks behind them to where the police have stopped
theres no way in hell they can make a move in the face of something as big as t his
boy howdy does he ever
they continue up the street toward city hall
ladies and gentlemen
can i have your attention please
this is a big room and one thousand observers fill every available chair with more standing along the wall in back
its a circus
christine sits with hahn
changeling a true story
briegleb is in a seat behind the main section
flashbulbs pop as thorpe a city councilman speaks
there are nearly one thousand people gathered in this chamber more than have ever been in this room before
speakers are lowered from the window into the parking lot where hundreds of others are gathered to listen
on pa i therefore ask you to refrain from demonstrations of any kind
were all here because we want to find out the real facts in this case and everybody is going to be heard if we have to sit here for a
as thorpe looks to the other members of the council and the area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon
a number of seats are empty
thorpe i dont see any other members of the police commission
we specifically stipulated that we would begin our hearings with testimony from the police department
are there any representatives of the police commission in the room
no answer is chief davis here
no reply is captain jones here
is there anyone here representing the police
a reporter raises his hand then stands
richard thomas the evening herald
both the police chief and captain jones are in san pedro for a police inspection at a station there
more changeling a true story
reporter contd only reason i know is we have a couple of our boys out covering the thing
are you telling me they directly violated the wishes of the city council
that they refused to attend a vital hearing so they could conduct a routine inspection in san pedro
and what the hell is jones doing at an inspection after being suspended
beat i hate to call a recess before weve even started but i think a few phone calls are in order
so well take a half hour break then continue with the witnesses who have appeared here today
but let it be known that captain jones and police chief davis will be subpoenaed and required to appear here tomorrow morning
theres applause from the crowd which breaks up into pockets of discussion as a bailiff approaches hahn and whispers into his ear
hahn nods looks to christine
collins could you come across the street with me for just a moment
shouldnt we i think theres something you should see
puzzled curious christine gets up and exits with hahn
hahn is moving quickly down the hall toward a courtroom door christine following
the police decided it was best to keep this off the main docket in order to avoid exactly the sort of chaos we have across the street
he gets to the door pauses
looks back to her
he opens the door and they enter changeling a true story
dead silence in marked contrast to the city council room
as she enters she sees people sitting silently in the gallery
row after row of couples mothers and fathers some weeping softly
some of them notice christines entrance and nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common bond
they are all carrying the same grief
one of the couples mr
clay see christine and go to her speaking softly
they should be distinct enough in appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see them again later
im leanne clay this is my husband john
i just wanted to pass on my sympathies
what we went through waiting to hear anything about our son david was bad enough and now this
beat but there was no call for what the police did to you
no call at all
she nods her thanks as a door at the other end of the courtroom opens
they take their seats as a judge and two attorneys take their places preceded by a bailiff
the judge takes his seat
the rest of the room also sits
he nods to the bailiff who in turn opens another door leading to the holding area
as christine looks on gordon stewart northcott is ushered into the courtroom for his initial plea
some women break into tears at the sight of him
he first seems startled by the presence of so many then he smiles
as he takes his place beside his attorney he looks down the room and meets the gaze of christine collins
her face pales as though slapped
but she doesnt look away
i saw you in the papers
you got a lot of moxie standing up to the police like that
the bailiff forcibly turns him around to face the judge
christines hands grip the seat shes in until her knuckles turn white
but she doesnt allow him the satisfaction of seeing her react to his comments
the judge looks up
changeling a true story
gordon stewart northcott you have been charged with three counts of murder in the first degree with an additional seventeen counts under review by the district attorneys office
how do you plea
not guilty your honor
he glances back at his audience
the bailiff rights him again
in light of the defendants penchant for international travel no bail will be set
this court will receive preliminary motions by tomorrow morning with a trial date to be set for the earliest opening on the courts calendar
beat the defendant is remanded into custody
the bailiff removes gordon who shares one last look with his audience and christine in particular
he winks at her
she doesnt give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction
but once hes gone she sits heavily and covers her eyes fighting tears
hahn puts a hand on her shoulder but says nothing
theres nothing to say
the boy walter collins was reported as missing on march
jones is at last on the stand
hahn stands before him the rest of the city council christine and the huge audience looking on
we then instituted a nationwide search
on july we received a cable indicating that a boy matching his description had been found in de kalb illinois
upon questioning he admitted to being walter collins and we made arrangements to transport him back to california
collins told you the boy was not her son
changeling a true story
she denied his identity in spite of all evidence pointing to the contrary
but as subsequent events have demonstrated she was correct
so what prompted you to send her for psychological evaluation
whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision
throughout this period she acted strangely
she was often cool aloof and unemotional especially when presented with the boy we located in de kalb and in our subsequent conversations
it was because of her disturbing behavior that i submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of los angeles county general hospital
just like that
you snap your fingers and an innocent woman is thrown into the psycho ward
she wasnt hahn turns away playing to the council and the audience
every home in this state is in grave danger when a police captain can take a woman into his office and five minutes later have her thrown into the psychopathic
ward on his own authority
the crowd applauds and cheers
joes fights to be heard
over the crowd she wasnt what was that captain
she wasnt thrown
changeling a true story
theres laughter from the gallery
he doesnt like it
escorted thrown the verb doesnt matter captain
what does matter is that her incarceration was ordered without a warrant
hahn goes to the exhibit table picks up several papers
i am holding a carbon copy of the affidavit of insanity that was issued in the case of the state of california vs
who signed the affidavit
and what is the date on this document
collins was incarcerated on september th
the form is backdated
yes so it would appear
the bottom of the page is reserved for recording where and when the warrant was served
but it has not been filled in
may i assume from this that the warrant was never served
there was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody
let me see if i have this straight
a woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant because no warrant existed and when it was finally written six days later there was no need to sign
it or go to a judge because more changeling a true story
hahn contd she was already in the asylum
is this correct captain
more murmuring from the crowd
extraordinary steps were necessary because we were dealing with an extraordinary situation
is it our fault that we were being deceived by the boy who claimed to be walter collins
in light of his claims and her behavior who wouldnt begin to wonder if there was something wrong with her
because she questioned you
because she wouldnt listen because she insisted on being obstinate and taking matters into her own hands best left to qualified officers because because she was fighting for the life
of her son
a boy who may have still been alive while you were wasting valuable time denying you had done anything wrong
this silences both jones and the crowd
you could hear a pin drop
hahn approaches jones and now speaks softly
and in the end thats what happened isnt it
at some point while all this was going on walter collins died along with as many as nineteen other youths on the northcott ranch in wineville
is that correct captain
jones looks to chief davis
its a moment
christines face falls into her hands
the place erupts
changeling a true story
no further questions
hahn walks away from a devastated looking jones
a small crowd is assembled at the front of the station where chief davis stands with the boy who had been walter as a train pulls up before them
so after much effort we were able to identify this boy who was has been responsible for so much recent trouble as arthur hutchins of cedar rapids iowa
between this and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real walter collins we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of los angeles
beat i hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions
just then he turns as a matron comes off the train with janet hutchins middle thirties the boys mother
ladies and gentlemen let me introduce you to the boys real mother mrs
she goes to him and hugs him
walter looks like he wishes he were somewhere on mars
davis moves closer to them to be in frame while the flashbulbs pop
shes in the same pose as they got christine to take when she accepted her lost son
i hope he hasnt been too much trouble for you
oh no not at all
he towsels the boys head like hed like to cut it off
then he nods to an aide who approaches with a bundle of clothes
collins the woman he was staying with wanted him to have these
theyre the clothes she let him wear
changeling a true story
well thank you
isnt that nice arthur
tell the nice officer thank you
i dont want em
give em to somebody else
precocious little fellow isnt he
its not my fault
it was the police
they said i was walter collins not me
it wasnt my idea
she yanks him away
davis smiles gamely at the reporters
blame the police for your own mistakes
weve seen a lot of that lately havent we
shot mos under music somber and moving intercutting between the two trials
christine on the stand speaking quietly
officer ybarra on the stand
chief davis on the stand
the murder jury being shown photographs of the northcott ranch
walters dentist showing a drawing of walters teeth
his teacher mrs
fox also testifying
bits of clothing entered into evidence
ending on christine seated reserved holding it all in
we hold on her face to bring us into christine is sitting on walters bed
she runs a hand along the sheets straightening and smoothing them out her eyes moist but not crying
we hear a knock on the front door downstairs and the door opening
changeling a true story
im up here reverend
she continues as briegleb comes up the stairs and enters the room
takes off his hat
a show of sympathy
when walter was
when he was here id walk past his bedroom when he was asleep and even if i couldnt see him or hear him i could
feel him in here
mothers and their children are connected in amazing ways
my uncle joined the army during the big war and the day he died before we ever heard a word about it my grandmother woke up in the middle of
the night and said bobbys gone
christine nods taking it in then thats why i dont think walter is dead
i can still feel him in this room
collins i know what the police said
but the remains
what they found on that ranch is so
most of it cant even be properly identified
what if that boy made a mistake when he picked walters picture
i understand that you dont want to accept this
what mother does
but you have to let go
and start over
hed want you to move on
and maybe hed want me to keep looking
maybe hes waiting for me somewhere
he is christine
more changeling a true story
briegleb contd in that place where we will all be reunited with our loved ones someday
and on that day he will know front to back end to end heart and soul
that you did everything you could christine
she nods absently finishes adjusting the sheets
he checks his watch
we should go
she nods again and stands
he heads out of the room and she lingers for a moment taking one last look around before turning off the night light and sees the drawing he made of
the two of them walking together beneath an orange sun
hold on that image as we hear a gavel hammering and this meeting will now come to order
pushing in on thorpe at the center of the councils long table addressing the crowd and christine
this committee has now heard all of the testimony and in light of the facts presented issues the following statement
where northcott stands before the judge jury and the grieving family members
foreman has the jury reached a verdict
we have your honor
still pushing in
while the city council has no power to directly remove commissioners or more changeling a true story
thorpe contd the employees who serve under them it nevertheless can perform the function of making recommendations
this committee therefore reports and recommends beat first that the majority members of the police commission deserve the severest condemnation for their decision to whitewash the collins case
applause erupts from the gallery at this
quietly pushing in on northcott the judge jury others
bailiff will you bring me the verdict of the jury
the bailiff complies
the judge reads it hands it back to the bailiff who brings it back to the foreman
second we recommend that the suspension of captain jones be made permanent
even louder applause some cheering
the pattern continues through the balance of the statement
will the defendant please rise
northcott rises still smiling defiant
third that steps be taken to investigate a change in the prevailing laws and procedures by more changeling a true story
thorpe contd which a citizen of this city can be subjected to incarceration in the countys mental facilities
beat finally restoration of public confidence in the police department can only be achieved by the removal of its chief of police and this committee so recommends
beat this hearing is concluded
the place explodes with cheers
as the foreman stands again
you may read the verdict
we the jury find the defendant gordon stewart northcott
guilty on all counts of murder in the first degree
there are gasps and cries and tears
but northcott is defiant
does the defendant wish to make a statement before judgment is passed
yeah i want to make a statement
i want to make it real clear that i never once got a fair shake from you your honor or this court
the only one of you here worth a goddamn is her points to christine cause shes the only one never badmouthed me to the press
she understands what it is when the police frame you for something you didnt do and throw you in the hole
isnt that right
he looks to her
she doesnt flinch
i want you to know mrs
collins i never killed your boy
i changeling a true story
counsel you will get control of your client or i will have him bound and gagged
the defense attorney yanks gordon around to face the judge
gordon stewart northcott it is the judgment of this court that you will be conveyed to san quentin prison where you will be held in solitary confinement for a period
of two years until october nd
on that date you are to be hanged by the neck until dead
may god have mercy on your soul
and he brings down the gavel
christine is standing outside putting the horrors of the day out of her thoughts as a door opens and chief davis comes out followed by several reporters
no as i said after the hearing i have every intention of finishing my term as chief of the los angeles police department
i will not resign
i will fight to the finish
the collins case was merely an excuse for certain politicians who have been trying to have me removed for some time and i he pauses as he sees christine
looks away and continues in a lowered voice
anyway i remain confident that the mayors office will stand firmly behind me
the press continue after him not really noticing christine who takes one last look around at it all
and walks slowly away
changeling a true story
christine alone rides the street car to work
the car stops in front of a school
she looks out the window to where children are playing
then looks away again as the street car starts moving again
christine is back at work again as she had been though some of the light has gone out of her eyes
she moves from station to station nodding her approval or checking off forms
she glances to the clock its a little after two then goes to mr
harris who has just come out onto the floor
ten minute break
she starts away turning at you know
one of these days you might consider actually taking one of these ten minute breaks
might be good for you
she heads off toward a back room
he watches her go with a combination of awe respect and deep sadness
christine is on the telephone crossing off contact numbers on a pad of paper
yes hello this is christine collins we spoke yesterday about my son
fine thank you
i was wondering if youd had a chance to go through the file on runaways in your area in case anyone resembling walter had beat i see
no thank you i appreciate the information
would it be all right if i called you again in a month or so
she checks his number off her list as hahn appears in the partially open door behind her
changeling a true story
hes heard part of the conversation and theres a sadness in his eyes
she starts to dial again when he knocks on the door
she turns to see him mid dial
oh hello i was just i know
why i wanted to see you
his tone is grave and she knows that somethings happened
she hangs up the phone missing the cradle the first time
its about walter
well we received a very strange telegram
hes asked to see you
he said he knows youre still looking for your son and before he dies beat he says that he lied when he testified that he didnt kill walter
hes willing to finally admit that he did it
he says that if you come up to see him in person
hell tell you the truth to your face
so that you can get on with your life and have some peace
christine is on the train headed north
the telegram is in her hand
changeling a true story
as you know hes set to be executed the day after tomorrow at san quentin so
beat you dont have a lot of time
she gets out of a taxi in front of the prison
its a gray grim sight and moves toward it
took me most of the morning to make all the arrangements
turns out youre the first woman in thirty years the state has allowed to visit a serial killer on the night of his execution
four bare walls and a long table
one window behind bars and chicken wire
christine waits alone
then we hear footsteps approaching down the hall
a moment later a prison guard escorts northcott into the room
northcott nods to christine then glances to the guard who looks to christine
i can stay in the room if you want maam
sure ill be fine
ill be right outside the door if you need anything
to northcott twenty minutes
the guard exits leaving the two alone
dont suppose youve got a cigarette
no i dont smoke
he nods walks to the window to a nearby structure
thats where they do it you know
that building right over there
changeling a true story
thats where they do what
ten oclock tonight i get to see whats inside
i hear theres thirteen steps going up to the gallows
cause thirteen is unlucky
helps make sure youre gonna go to hell when you die
but i got em beat
i outsmarted em
he looks to christine smiles nervously glances back out the window
theyre gonna let me have whatever i want for dinner
got a steak coming with spinach mashed potatoes and green beans
i always wondered why they did that whole last meal thing
one of the other guys on death row said when you take the drop you foul yourself and everything you ate
comes out the other end
so maybe thats why they make sure you got something in you when it happens
they like knowing you fouled yourself on the way to he stops himself
turns from the window
sure you dont got a cigarette
she shakes her head
he nods absently for a moment
the warden clinton duffy hes a good guy
hes writing a book about all the death sentences hes carried out in this place
says its called eighty eight men and two women
beats my record all to hell
you asked me to come to see you
you said if i did you would tell me the truth about my son
well im here
yeah you are
but see the thing is i didnt think youd really come and now changeling a true story
hes pacing growing more agitated and scared
i didnt expect
beat i dont want to see you

not today not tonight not with what theyre going to do to me
its one thing to send a telegram thats easy but right now right here in person i beat i cant tell you what you want to hear mrs
i cant i cant why not
because i dont want to die with a lie on my lips
he turns from her in anguish
but is he just playing her
i did my penance i asked god to forgive me for my sins
and ive been good ever since
if i commit a sin now if i lie now
im out of time i cant be forgiven again
i dont want to go to hell she goes around to him faces him

beat look at me
he turns almost against his will
meets her eyes
his eyes go wide and he cries out stumbling back and away from her
changeling a true story
get away from me
i dont know anything about it
northcott im innocent
pounds door guard
the guard enters going to northcott
no wait please its okay maam they always get a little nuts the day of
she pushes past him to northcott grabs the front of his shirt
did you kill him
did you kill my son
he screams in anguish and the guard hauls him out closing the door after him
christine tries to open the door but it wont open
she slowly slides to the floor crying as we hear the sound of chains clanking and we
the door to the prison yard opens and closes as northcott is led into the area with the scaffolding
the warden is there waiting at the foot of the gallows along with a chaplain
several other parents including mr
clay are in the witness gallery at the back separated from the gallows area by a large plate glass window
christine is among the parents
the clays see her and put a hand on her arm for strength
christine nods accepting it and moves to one side
northcott legs and arms bound in chains makes his way to the warden at the base of the gallows
a clock reads
changeling a true story
gordon stewart northcott you have been found guilty of murder the penalty for which is death by hanging
there have been no stays or reprieves therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the state of california
do you have any last words
to chaplain i kept clean after i confessed reverend
just like i said i would
the chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards who begin to escort northcott up the steps to the gallows
will it hurt
no reply please
not so fast
dont make me walk so fast
they struggle with him now pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top
they tie his legs together and cinch his arms tightly in place
but i didnt touch all of em you bastards
i didnt touch all of em
they start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure the rope
he looks desperately to the witnesses
please somebody say a prayer for me
the mask goes on and is tightened into place
the executioner approaches the handle that will open the trap door
the warden looks to the clock
from beneath the hood we hear in a terrified shaking voice silent night
all is calm
all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the lever and the trap door jerks open
changeling a true story
northcott falls through the door six feet then theres a snap
and the body bounces in slow motion at the end of the rope
as we hear the sound of his heart slowing
until it finally stops
christine covers her eyes
there is no cheering in the witness room
only the sound of weeping
slowly the witnesses exit the prison
we find christine among them
she nods good night to some of them including the clays then starts off on her own heading into the night
and seven years after the disappearance of walter collins just to establish then the brass plate on the partially open door announces c
collins assistant manager
shes filling out paperwork as theres a knock and a group of other employees and operators appears in the doorway

the night shift operators are working a smaller group but still busy

she picks it up smiling
changeling a true story

its not ben on the phone
yes this is she
no of course i remember you how are you

where did they beat no of course

she hangs up grabs her coat and races out the door
christine climbs out of a taxi and rushes into the station
christine is ushered into a room with a long two way mirror that looks out into an interview room
clay are already there
in the other room is detective ybarra and a young boy david age
clay sees her and they embrace
i wanted to go to him right off but they said it was important to talk to him alone first
are they sure its theyre sure but more important im sure
beat its my boy all right
hes alive christine
they found him up in hysperia
but how mr
clay motions for them to shush
they turn their attention to the other room where ybarra looks up from making notes
changeling a true story
all right so after you got into the car what happened next
they drove me around for a long time then we ended up at this ranch david is shoved into the chicken coop
several other boys are already there scared crying
they lunge at the door trying to get out but it slams shut in their faces
they scream trying to get out
gordon slams an arm against the door scaring them
grinning ill see you boys later
he laughs and moves off sanford accompanying him looking very guilty
were there other boys present
six i think
it was a long time ago
did you speak to them
do you remember any of their names
panning the boys huddled against one wall scared
two of them were brothers i think their last name was winslow something like that
the oldest was jeffrey i think he was around eleven
beat and walter
we stop pan on the last kid
on walter collins at last
as christine reacts to this her hand flying to her mouth
not daring to breathe
changeling a true story
do you remember his last name
christine covers her face
can barely stand up
so if you only remember some of the names of the rest how come you remember his full name
because of what happened
two of the kids walter and jeffrey are sitting in a corner talking quietly urgently
walter and jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming
they were scared same as the rest of us but they werent scared stupid
they kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up
they pull at the wiring
part of the roof weakens and dust sifts down
they figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner maybe make enough room to get out of there and run
but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasnt wide enough wed be stuck
it might even bring the whole place down
we gotta try it
what he hears changeling a true story
we have to get out of here
and in an echo of what he told his mother the last time he saw her im not
im not afraid of anything
beat dont you want to go home
dont you want to see your mom again
the winslow kids nod and start crying
jeffrey and walter look to the rest
david holds up his hand
anybody who doesnt want to come get over at that end in case this comes down
the winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end too terrified to try and escape
jeffrey david and walter go to the weakened corner of the coop
when we get out we split up go in different directions they cant catch all of us
they nod and get into position each taking a part of the wire framework
they do so pulling for all theyre worth
the ceiling shifts above them dirt falling all over the place
they pull harder the wire cutting into fingers but still pulling
then suddenly the corner falls away part of the roof starting to come down with it
the noise is substantial
changeling a true story
they race out the opening jeffrey first then walter then david
but just as the first two get clear help
walter turns to see david stuck in the wiring
lights go on around the ranch
then runs back to david helps to untangle him
they hear a shotgun blast and feet running their way
walter gets him untangled and the two race away from the coop running for all theyre worth as a flashlight hits first one then the other
they run and david catches one last glimpse of walter running heading for the line of trees
and thats the last you saw of him
as the interview continues
thats the last i saw of any of em
so you dont know if either of the other two were captured
all i know is if he hadnt come back for me
i dont think i ever wouldve gotten out of there
what happened after that
i hid in the woods for two days too scared to move because i was sure theyd find me
i finally started walking but every time a car came up i was afraid it was them
so i kept off the main roads until i saw a train stopped at a crossing and i jumped in
changeling a true story
why didnt you tell anyone what had happened
i was afraid
i thought theyd come after me or my folks
so i didnt tell anybody
i was on my own until i got a free meal from this lady mrs
i told her i was an orphan on my own
she said i could stay on and
beat every night id wake up thinking they were right outside my window
then i heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch and i thought for sure i cant go back now
since i didnt tell anybody what happened i was afraid theyd blame me for those kids being dead
so i just
so what made you come forward now after all this time
david looks away his eyes tearing up
finally i miss my mom
i miss my dad
i just want to go home
and its all mrs
clay can take
sobbing she runs out of the viewing room and into the interview room where she goes to her son and embraces him holds him the two crying into one anothers
christine and ybarra watch as mr
clay lead their son into their car
as they drive off christine finally breaks the silence
still cant believe it
five years case closed everyone thinks hes dead
and there he is
more changeling a true story
ybarra contd and he wouldnt be if it wasnt for walter
beat your son did a brave thing mrs
you should be very proud of him
you dont think hes still out there do you
three boys made a run for it that night detective
if one got out maybe either or both of the others did too
maybe walter went through the same fears he did
afraid to come home or identify himself afraid hed get into trouble that people might think it was his fault
either way it gives me something i didnt have before tonight
she looks at him
she turns and walks off into the night as we superimpose gordon stewart northcott was hanged on october in exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea sanford wesley clark
