screenplay by gregory widen darkness
then the glint of a flashlight
its beam rocks crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room as we hear two children arguing
youre doing it wrong
youre doing it wrong
its hard but we get a sense of the room in the whipping beam of light
huge dark coats lined up like sides of beef on steel batons
bent stained helmets hung like african masks
beneath them brian and stephen are trying to struggle into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their pajamas
it doesnt go like that
who asked you
if you do it like that itll open in the fire
then youll get burned and the door suddenly opens morning sunlight roaring in
its a fire station storage room full of fire gear
a fireman stands in the doorway tall athletic their father dennis mccaffrey
whos going to die
hes not doing it right dad
he never does it right
gestures for them to come out well lets have a look
the two boys tromp out of the closet
the rubber turn out boots are as high as their thighs
the ends of the coats drag on the floor
they salute brians arm just an empty sleeve
dennis kneels down and re fastens brians coat
your brothers right
if you dont fasten these correctly they could open and youd get burned
you wouldnt let me die would you dad
mccaffreys are smarter than fire brian
playfully slaps their shoulders how bout lunch huh
hey whats with the mouth
whered you grow up a barn
the station suddenly fills with the bellow of an alarm sighs never fails
a young fireman adcox appears with the dispatch card
want to come along brian
watch the old man earn his keep
youve come along a dozen times stephen give your brother a chance
well be back in a few minutes
to brian how bout it sport
dennis scoops brian up and loads him into the fire engine cab
the other three firemen climb aboard and take their places
theres a cough of diesel a crunch of gears and the engine is pulling out of the station
hit the button brian
brian stamps his foot on the siren button
the red light snaps on the siren growls and blares and theyre off down the street
brian turns around in his seat and at the last instant before the corner makes eye contact with his older brother
they stick their tongues out
the engine howls its way through the city
brian sandwiched between his father and adcox looks out in wonderment at intersections zipping past like picket fences at people on sidewalks holding hands over their ears at the red
emergency lights bouncing crazily off shop windows
lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block
the engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping off like ship rats
dennis opens his door hops down and pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his son
stay near the truck
winks and keep an eye out for us huh
were short handed today
brian nods vigorously taking the command seriously
dennis smiles and is off dragging a hoseline with his crew toward a doorway they disappear into
brian climbs down from the cab
dont stray too far little man
brian smiles to the pumper operator
he just wants a better look
and he gets it smoke turned evil and dark now taking on purpose
theres a level of apartments above the storefronts
as brian watches a window opens and out steps his father and adcox onto a small fire escape
their attentions on the next window over out of reach wrapped in leaky smoke
suddenly dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing armed with only an axe and jumps across to the next metal balcony
a ballsy dangerous move
he kicks in the window breaks out the frame with his axe and dives in
a beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified smudged little girl
he hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way a ladder
denniss face lifts and grins at brian dirty bigger than life invincible
he winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and hes gone again back into the swirling darkness
as brian stands there full of love full of pride he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over
the flame seems to pause to stare at brian a beat
shhh dont tell anyone
brian is transfixed his little head staring up in astonishment
nobody else has noticed it
brian can see his father and adcox through the window probing looking for the flame lurking just above
brian starts to call out in a small hesitant voice dad
he tries to call louder
but suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion brian can see adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as brian steps forward under the power of a
flame that beckons him as dennis suddenly throws his body against adcox knocking him clear just as a flame explodes downward from the ceiling fully against him as all the buildings windows blow out and its like the skys erupted for brian a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him
plaster wood and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly
a fire helmet
and adcox is coming out the door now blackened and torn hopeless tears streaming down his face
get us some backup
we need some goddamn backup
and spotting brian he runs towards him
and the helmet spins and spins and adcox keeps running and the sky is raining fire and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full horrifying
size and its laughing now laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning and we read the printing on the neck guard
and adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy protecting him from the fire the world but its like brian doesnt see him
he pulls away from adcox walks up to his fathers helmet and puts it on
the scene explodes with a flash as a photographer captures the instant
sequence omitted from original script
hold on the freeze frame
let it become an aged cover of life
the magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now its sitting atop a box of knick knacks jostling in the back seat of an aging bmw
theres plenty of other boxes here a live on the move and in the drivers seat brian mccaffrey now
theres piles of empty burger wrappers coke cans and florida knick knacks on the dash board a little blow up palm tree a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with mccaffrey high
end stereo sales
brian and his battered bmw shoot past prairie cow country nervous suburbs and finally a sign welcome to chicago
wind tugging at his bangs brian stares down at the graves of dennis and mary elizabeth mccaffrey
in a crusty sink he combs his hair knots a tie around his neck
brian walks through its sculpted columns straightening his tie
he comes to a door fire academy chief
he takes a deep breath steadies his gaze and enters
the academy chief sits at his desk going over a file
out the window can be heard a fire training class in action
is this a joke
brians sitting in the seat opposite
if it was a joke sir youd be laughing
you walked out on this academy six years ago
one week to graduation
you think we forgot that
you think i did
i want another shot sir
beat look everybody remembers your old man
being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here
dead hero father rule
but you blew us off
why should i take you back

if i push you have to let me back in
dead hero father rule
simmers even if you graduate this academy youve still got nine months of probation
thats hard duty son
if you dont really love this job itll kill you
rises see you monday
as we hear the blow of a whistle and everybody lined up at attention in dress blues
at podium though the world changes every day some things are truly forever courage devotion and honor in what we do
this class is a special one for we dedicate it to the three firefighters that have fallen this year donald knowlton richard walter and michael petzold
silent beat ladies and gentlemen it is with pleasure that i certify that candidate class number having successfully completed all academy requirements are hereby graduated to the chicago fire department
candidates and their relatives cheer and leap to their feet
something struggles inside of brian
he doesnt stand at first
another candidate tim looks at him strangely
so does the academy chief his eyes finding brians
and brians standing slowly now joining them
an expensive one
we hear a window break
through the dimness a file cabinet
an axe suddenly slams into it ripping it apart
files crash to the floor
and a picture
four young guys marlin fishing
time of their lives
and a grey putty being slapped along the edges of a door
a split level firemens dive complete with mounted axes and personalized t shirts from various engine companies proudly declaring ladder co
axe first hose later and chicago tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of recently graduated candidates
a few on the back patio have hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at balloon targets each other the neighbors cat
brian and tim still in their uniforms enter from the street
survey the scene
completely out of control
what the hell are we waiting for
as they shoulder their way inside another candidate appears holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes
hot off the presses guys
tim and everyone else but brian eagerly tear into them
brian nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar
a beer willy
the barkeep turns and smiles
well if it isnt the littlest mccaffrey
to candidates with hose hey
you break anything with that you buy it
to brian sorry there must be something wrong with my eyes
i keep thinking thats a fire department uniform
its in my blood willy
the candidates are ripping open their assignments exclaiming to each other all right
thats a slum
they get cookers every day
oh no engine thats a nice neighborhood
willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a stack of business cards
well lets have a look at what else was in your blood
i always look forward to getting these they make such a nice collage for the bar
assistant director sales aspen snowmobile tours
didnt offer the kinda growth and challenge i need
and pioneers pride mobile log cabins
that was in your blood about six months wasnt it
management were pin heads
laguna jamming custom surfboards
and just this year brians sound spectrum
your own company even
i was ahead of my time
you know ive got a perfect little spot here for brian mccaffrey fireman
tim holds an envelope marked mccaffrey out to brian
arent you even curious
opens it surprised howd you know
these are supposed to be sealed
winks and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments
you crooked son of a bitch
lots of fires
they promote faster there
take a look at the last lt
s list half the guys on it came from that battalion
gotta think about your future timmy
s the station
ah man if youre gonna bribe your way into a station why not with me and your brother
on brians reaction a porsche knifes through darkened streets
the driver is dressed for success
pulling up to the brownstone we saw earlier he gets out and rubs his eyes
another day in the salt mines
climbing the short stairs he sticks his key into the lock and opens the door
it is the last thing he will ever do
a thundering explosion engulfs the stoop
the place is packed now with girls flirting with the candidates putting their helmets on etc
the horseplay around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a siren
everyone steps outside cocks an ear
and here it comes the real thing screeching past in a full tilt rush
shouts and raised toasts
hey thats my cousins company
as brian turns he suddenly confronted by an elderly surprised mrs
she grabs his cheeks and rattles off in lithuanian
brian can only smile
then two attractive jean clad legs step up
you look great
thanks for calling
ive been sorta keeping a low profile
i graduated today
i see youre still in the neighborhood
i live in lincoln park now
what have you been up to
i work for city hall
what you think i just dried up and blew away when you left
the world does turn once in awhile brian even without your permission
just then tim opens up the hoseline drenching brian
dont want you overheating brian
brian ducks the stream and pulls a length of hose near his feet flipping tim
brian jumps him shuts off the hose and pins him to the pavement
brian walks back toward jennifer youve certainly matured
she turns to leave
well if nothing else its nice to know we can still be friends
i dont want to be your friend brian
another in a series of fire engines howl past
tim grabs brian by the shoulder
lets go man
brian and tim jump into brians car
they shoot blindly down the street looking for the fire engine running down red lights or anything else that gets in their way
brian suddenly hits the brakes screeching to a stop
they roll down their windows
far off can be heard the wind up of a siren
points that way
they fly around a corner down a block and there it is lights flashing up ahead
brian guns it roars up alongside the fire engine
tim leans out the window shakes a bottle of beer and lets loose a foamy eruption in the truck drivers face
you crazy motherfucker
but hes laughing
well meet ya
as brian and tim pull up two engine companies are already dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode earlier
tim cheers the firemen on like a drive in movie
brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination
embers whipping into the night drifting to the ground around him
one of the engine companies is entering the doorway now
he watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person would run for their life from
flash brian turns at the blinding snap of a camera
several locals are gathered around a parked car some taking pictures
brian notices that right away
it takes a beat longer to notice the charred corpse stuffed head first through the windshield
its the porsche driver his legs sticking out at crazy angles
a dog barks furiously at it
also looking at body man
something sure put a crimp in his evening
the brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy clouds of dirty white steam
and one of the firemen is coming back out now walking toward brian
when hes just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask and helmet and we shudder with brian because the man is a dead ringer for his father
well look what we have here
i want to thank you for coming to my graduation stephen
it was a great inspiration to me
so youre going to fight fires now huh
he pats brians cheeks leaving behind large charcoal smears
re smears doesnt work on you
turns to leave see ya around little brother
turns well see youre wrong already
had a talk with chief fitzgerald and we decided in the interest of brotherly love that maybe you shouldnt be way over on the other side of town
so starting tomorrow your assigned to company
brians color drops a hue one case of scotch youre getting cheap in your old age brian
and stephen turns for his own men tim staring at brian as clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts
a flame leaps up into the foreground
touches a cigarette
the cigarette glows lingers then lowers slowly from the mouth of rimgale fifty five years old and six and a half feet of solid granite
wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks tucked into fire department rubber boots he takes another slow drag
looks at the body stuffed into the windshield
its twenty yards away from the brownstone
stephen looks up as rimgale drops the cigarette crushes it with his boot and crosses the street to the building
charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness
rimgale is there gloomy in the beam of his flashlight
he crouches down plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard
if you stare any longer stevie ill start charging you admission
stephen is leaning in the doorway watching him
got a cause
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigations work
i may have a stroke
the glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home
rimgales flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose and holds up to the light
he lowers it takes in the walls the room
theyre gonna have to wait a few days on this one
tims talking to his cousin
brian hangs back watches the body bag people load the porsche driver into a meat wagon
theres a still an audience for this still stray dogs circling and barking
brian walks up looks inside the car and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a finger
to coroner crew hey you forgot
theyre already climbing into the wagon
the driver smiles creepily
we always leave something for the dogs
brian looks across the fireground sees his brother walking back to the fire engine
they share a brief edgy glance
a modest one
south side irish old fashioned
brian walks up
theres a little kid about five playing with a toy fire truck on the drive
whats goin on man
the kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition
its uncle brian
he makes his hand into a talking puppet
bandito accent spinach
we dont need no stinking spinach
the kid drops his toy truck and flees inside
brian follows sticks his head in the door
a warm looking woman s helen comes around the corner
man you look great
you look like
she gives him a tentative hug
bout written you off
how long have you been in town
i know i know shoulda called
ive been really busy
i joined the fire department
helens expression suddenly saddens
beat you guys
you really know how to put each other through it dont you
the little kid is peeking fearfully from the kitchen doorway
jeez hes a giant
yeah youd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
sean come on out man
what you forget your favorite uncle
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
intense dad was kidding mom
and the kid runs unexpectedly away angry
well thats two things to strangle stephen for
where is he anyway
beat stephens not staying here now brian
he moved out last april
an embarrassed sting
oh man im sorry
you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
a small one on the river
several boats bob peacefully
raised high in dry dock its an ancient fishing trawler
bachman turner overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly fuzzed speakers as brian climbs the ladder
stripped to the waist stephens bent over cleaning out the guts of the inboard motor
he looks confused to see brian
i talked to helen
wrong thing to say
stephen turns back to his work
man i thought dads boat was finally retired to the family graveyard
dont you worry about falling out of this thing
stephen straightens up his forearms smudged with grease
brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck paint
i like what youve done with the place
its comin along
want a beer
stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge
as brian pops it he sees the small pile of city issue gallon size cans in the corner
armorall solvent extinguisher foam
been ripping off fire stations
its old stuff adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway
still good enough though for this tub
brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers
bachman turner overdrive
looks through music rack buffalo springfield
brian lifts one of the tapes an track and holds it carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic
my god an actual operating track
what youve never seen one before
in the field museum once
it worked when you were in sixth grade
sequence omitted from original script
brian opens the trunk of his old bmw
its full of stereo boxes marked brians sound spectrum
brians gutted the speakers and is re wiring them
people actually used to pay you for this
millions stephen and sexual favors
sheep dont count
what about laura that was never proved
brian moves over to another speaker
whyd you come here brian
i wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment
i mean is this really gonna have to one of those big brother little brother you broke my gi joe and im still pissed games
sighs what is it with you man huh
how do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up
that scotch bullshit
am i really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz
you were bankrupt man
you dont know me i know you cold brian
the scary thing is you probably could have faked it for awhile
but you see in this job theres no place to hide
isnt like selling log cabins
you have a bad day here someone dies
and thats not fucking good enough
want another beer
so thats it
big bad brothers gonna ride my ass till i cough blood
big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie that i dont think is going to make it
brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches on the tape player
the cabin fills with sharp crystal clear stephen bishop
theres only so much technology can do
picks up his tool box thanks for the beer
thanks for the speakers
brian climbs down off the boat
looks up at stephen
yknow i told myself a million times i didnt want to be a fireman
i said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy
i know i split and i know how you felt
yeah you know
you know what it felt like
i gotta do this stephen
i gotta know
i think youre gonna find out brian
dont be late tomorrow
a simple one room walk up
a stereo blares chicago blues as brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror
he steps back looks at himself and oh man what the hell am i doing
brian climbs into his car turns the key nothing
he gets out looks under the hood then slams it down in frustration
a pissed off chicago hauling itself off to work in the morning snap passes by brians window
tough midwestern brick
heads down in their year war with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into lake michigan
the train clacking away above him brian walks down the sidewalk carrying his fire equipment
he turns a corner and comes on
brian stands there
its his dads station
turn of the century abused
sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly crank open as brian comes up the drive
fire engine and ladder truck lights flashing pull out onto the apron
the fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is stephen
one look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isnt fireman mccaffrey but fire lt
youre too late probie
tim in ladder truck waves a small bye bye as both rigs begin heading down the street
chasing goddamn it stephen
brian bolts full out for the engine
at the last instant before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags him aboard
its adcox the fireman from the first scene now a veteran
why baby mccaffrey how ya doin
the pumper driver schmidt pops in a howling rock tune as they zoom off
re brian to adcox you know this rug rat
i practically raised him
jewish mom and he never calls he never writes
brian shouts over the noise to grindle one more seat down
grindle sticks his nose out the window sniffs then begins buckling up his coat
boys i do believe we have a barbecue
as brian and adcox fasten up their own equipment smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up
staring at confusing smoke i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it
to schmidt call in another alarm
were gonna need some back up
everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks
adcox drags the rigs suction line to the hydrant
a beautiful illegally parked mercedes is blocking the way
to stephen oh these moments do try me
admiring car be gentle
whistling to himself adcox smashes the brass coupling through the passenger window runs the line through and smashes it out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant
stephen and grindle pull hose off the bed and move out
brians so jacked up he cant get his air tank on right
schmidt calmly helps him into his gear
its only rock n roll kid
stephen adcox and grindle are crouched at the door ready to go
brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when hes cut off by dazed latin workers shouting incoherently at him in spanish
how bout it huh
brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the hose line
stephen reaches over and re adjusts brians air tank strap
youre doing it wrong
stephen eases the door open
thick smoke rolls sickly out over their heads
to brian stay beside me
and in they go
inside the smoke is like liquid lead
going by feel they hump the hose up one staircase after another crawling on their hands and knees toward a dull red glow
turning a corner they enter totally ablaze
brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting waves of flame in the ceiling at the screeching timbers crumbling to the white hot floor
at the walls howling in bestial agony
it is the most horrifying and wonderful thing he has ever seen
wash it to the windows
no well hit the son of a bitch head on
its gonna flash stevie
we gotta get behind it
nah listen to it
its a pussy
itll just steam on us
it wont flash
go high in the ceiling
adcox and grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight expecting the worst
adcox opens up the nozzle turning loose a high pressure blast of water into the ceiling
the fire screams in manic anger and heaves a cloud of howling steam that whirls back and bakes them like lobsters
brian gasps for air as swirling ash batters his facemask
a window somewhere explodes
christ you cant see anything
stephen hoops in victory
to fire i knew you were a pussy
to firemen lets go
the chase is on
going for the throat while the fires confused and defensive the firemen scramble through the boiling cloud
they hit it in the ceiling in the walls forcing it back and back
it howls and claws in anger furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces
the walls echo with its screams as it retreats to a corner
ya love it probie
im in heaven lt
hook us up to a stand pipe
brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the building water system
he goes to unscrew the cap with his hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut
jesus how bout man huh
were gonna loose this
brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back
tim and three guys from his ladder company come up an extended aerial ladder crash through a window and begin hacking their way toward brians company as boom
its a sudden shattering vibration that shakes the building to its foundations
then a sucking sound rush rush rush
stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset
hey otis is it
into radio yeah
goddamn it wheres our backup
wheres the second in companies
john wayne time
to firemen dig in
the firemen hesitate
pengelly the truck company lt
looks at stephen with concern
dig in goddamn it
the crews immediately gather in the center of the floor
they turn over tables chairs anything to form a barrier
a circling of the wagons
rush rush rush boom
each louder than the last
stephen and brian are ducked behind an overturned desk
adcox and krizminski clutch hoselines like frontiersmens winchesters
youre gonna love this
rush rush rush craaaash
on an instant the world comes apart as all four walls of factory windows explode in a hail of glass
a wave of howling flame pours in after it shrieking and hissing
at the same moment part of the floor beside a heavy sewing machine gives way and a ladderman santos falls through grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames
bellow up from underneath
he screams as his grip loosens
grindle leaps to the laddermans side grabbing his arms and coat
brian hesitates just an instant and stephen shoves him out of the way to back up grindle
adcoxs taken the hoseline and is opening fire
water and flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling roar
its a thrashing murderous standoff
stephen and grindle have got santos but the angles bad
blow it now and all three could take a header
santos is panicking losing his grip
grindle bores his eyes into the mans with the calm and conviction of moses
you go we go
they may all die but they wont leave him
he calms a little hangs on till they pull him out of harms way
adcox continues with the hose as suddenly everyone hits the deck as the fire explodes over them bursting their coats into flame
tims company opens up their line washing everybody down before charging after the fire
a ladderman nightengale steps on brians back
sorry man i thought you were dead
brian stunned sits up his coat and helmet smoking
stephen seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over the top of the barricade the others backing him as he mercilessly drives the fire back trapping it
finally into a corner
the fire hisses spits shakes the walls with its furious anger
but its all bluster now the fires dying
bcs on the radio
says they think a civilian got left behind downstairs
take tim and do a search
adcox leads tim downstairs
brian looks shaken up
stephen helps him roughly to his feet
dont you fold on me now man
brian burns at that and shakes his brothers arm off
clear the hose for me
brians walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it
hey i think its coming from a different staircase
brian takes off down the other steps on his own
its only the fires ghost here lazy and slow
off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines
brian enters one and drops to his knees
looks under a table flashes his light behind a work stand
he turns to backtrack his way out when a tongue of flame suddenly leaps up through the floor in front of him cutting off the door
brian lands on his ass as it hisses and giggles and dances unreally in front of him
i never forget a face kid
that fire from childhood
he could maybe force his way through but jesus the way it looks at him brian rolls away from it
looks for another doorway and ends up in thick smoke
he drops to a crawl stays on his belly where the airs clear
when he sees it
behind some furniture
something flesh colored
its a body
he crawls up closer
its a woman
adrenalin pounding the top of his skull off he grabs her and stumbles back down the hall makes a turn i got one
and now hes bursting from the building onto a short fire escape shouting at the top of his lungs
i got somebody
i got somebody
a sea of media flashbulbs erupts in his face
the press have arrived in force crowding the street
brian pushes through them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine
two fire paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure
is she alive
the paramedics suddenly stop their efforts
turn to brian
im afraid youre a little too late with this one
they step aside
brian looks down
the woman looks strange
mostly because shes a heavy store dressing dummy
the paramedics burst into laughter
brian looking pale and shaken turns and walks away
he passes grindle and tim sitting on the pumpers tailboard helping the real woman that was found inside
sorry to hear about the mannequin
i heard you two were close
photographers have appeared and are flashing the woman
dizzy brian wanders off tries to help out with the choking clog of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly into where he barfs his guts out in private
doubled over one arm on the brick wall for support we see the raw terror
the demons rushing out of him
someone else does too
dressed now in a long expensive coat shes standing at the end of the alley with a clipboard
brian ashes smeared across an ashen face spittle on his chin doesnt notice her
appearing beside him you all right
stephen isnt pale
hes flushed and buoyant
all this hasnt taken anything from him
its made his day
im a little busy right now
stephen leans against the wall
folds his arms
yknow you got an awful short memory for direct orders
i told you to stay beside me
you split the team man
and what was that crap with the standpipe
youd think you and a hose were never introduced before
stephen turns to leave
brian yells after him
goddamn it stephen
i told you to stay next to me
i was doin it
i was up there fucking doin it
you dont know man you dont know what i did
what you did was drop the ball probie
get that right
from end of alley hey
theyre callin for ya
stephen turns to walk away
bet dollars a year and twenty two days a month off sounded pretty good twelve weeks ago huh
as stephen leaves we see that jennifers been standing at the end of the alley listening to them
shes turns and walks as brian looks up
we register his surprise
he watches her head toward a dynamic looking guy in his s alderman swayzak surrounded by reporters
to reporters roger paul
hows it going guys
another fire in this district
getting to be cinder alley up here
walking up you used that last week
she hands swayzak a clipboard
yelling down from window to brian hey
were still workin here man
brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks
the moment the smoke clears just a fraction cigarettes appear in everyones mouth
was it good for you
the talk is easy and obscene the intense camaraderie of shared danger
ash clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one more time
to adcox stephen man whats going through that guys head
takin it on in the first room
this shits happening too often
it couldve flashed
but it didnt
adcox sees brian
hey baby mccaffrey
first ones the clincher
you did okay
might have something to say about that
ah everybody screws up some brian
youre working for the toughest lt
on the job
saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building
its just bad luck youre family
beat john when youre in there
in the fire
do you ever see
from across room interrupting cmon ladies lets roll some hose
to adcox never mind
brian turns and sees out the window jennifer and swayzak standing near rimgales red fire dept
rimgale walks up to his sedan
i need to get in the trunk
swayzaks leaning on it
we sense the dislike between them
swayzak steps aside
rimgale pops the trunk
awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground alderman
but then i guess you havent been to too many fires
i wanted to talk to you about alan seagraves death
we still havent gotten a fire report from your office
youll have an answer as soon as i do
people are asking how a prominent taxpayer got stuffed through the windshield of his own car
theyre asking me
the point is investigator you havent even told us yet if the fire was accidental
were starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case to embarrass the alderman because of his fire dept
reorganization program you mean his firehouse closing program dont you
wed just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics
because im not
i care about this city and i care about this department rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid
calm of a monk alderman i have a remarkably uncomplicated job
to decide if a fires arson and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it
but to be honest if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna bees well i guess i cant say i sleep any
and he walks back to the burned building
i wish i could just fire the son of a bitch
stephens leaning out of an upstairs window
as the tv cameras turn he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops right into swayzaks face with a murderous grin
we almost lost a whole company up there swayzee buddy
isnt any back up since you closed
and we really appreciate it the guys and me
i know youve got my vote for mayor
grindle and santos start walking for stephen
brians there following after them
im on your side
if theres a problem please work with our task force to fix it
oh yeah your famous task force
three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your task force
stevie cmon man
stephen silences grindle with an outstretched hand
swayzak leans close out of earshot of the cameras
you see that funny glow thats starting to blink in the corner of your eye lt
thats your career dissipation light and it just went into overtime
if anybodys lights gonna blink its yours
swayzak holds his ground
its a tense out of control moment between them
rimgale turns from his work watches stephen with concern
adcox suddenly inserts himself face to face with swayzak and we see the raw hatred
youre in firemanland now swayzak
do yourself a favor and just walk away
swayzak holds adcoxs gaze then turns for his car
brian watches jennifer climb in beside her boss
this is your city job
jennifer shrugs as they pull away
brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway
across the street a middle aged woman flashes them from the balcony of her apartment
she likes firemen
tim fill out the alarm card
to brian clean the pipe poles wipe down the ladders and hang some hose
adcox watches brian and tim exchange looks
brian sighs and pulls out the pike poles starts across the floor before freezing suddenly at a murderous growl
brian turns and sees a dog
it has the rib cage of a wild beast fangs long greasy hair
it blocks his way snarling with hate
thats the thing
you cant stay unless he likes you
slobber drools out of its mouth as it growls
have you guys got something against dalmatians
brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face looks back and forth between franny and the thing and sighs
sequence omitted from original script
brian enters strips down his battered uniform and opens his locker
the mannequin from the fire springs out legs spread
a sign taped to its mouth says take me brian youre brian and the others scrub the mornings fire off their bodies in the station shower
tim keeps filling his mouth full of water and launching it upward in a stream
do you have to do that
pumped could you believe that fire
there i was adcox and me pullin that lady right out of the fires fuckin throat
i love it here no surround and drown for this company
goddamn stephens amazing
you see how he took that fire by the balls
im gonna be that good some day you watch
brian compares himself to the praise heaped on stephen
yknow what stephen said to me right when all the shit was coming hard
you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if youre just gonna do this job or be great at it
ah man is he usin that line now on you
what you think he made that little gem up
jesus christ i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning
brian shuts off his shower and walks out
stephen sits alone at his bunk slowly stretching a strained and ruined back
he blows out a long tired breath and begins working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee
on the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia through the years
theres a two battered fire helmets there set reverently on velvet
beside it is a photograph of his father
top of the world
hes wearing a t shirt proudly stenciled fighting th
father and son exchange a long awkward greeting
in the doorway brian stands watching his brother who not even suddenly seems an old and broken man
the alarm klaxon suddenly sounds
brian just in a towel and tim in boxers covered with little dinosaurs dash for the fire pole
tim and brian slide down and bounce off the floor
brian and tim rush for their equipment
grindle grabs their arms
he hustles them across the apparatus floor through a doorway and into the kitchen
the makings of a meal are laid out on the counter
brian and tim come to a screeching halt
the rest of the station is sitting calmly at the kitchen table watching
whats going on
tim and brian still in their boxers set down plates of food
better be good
or we feed you to the thing
everybody digs in
the table is a craze of half a dozen different conversations
on the tv mounted above on the wall are news shots of seagraves body sticking out of the windshield
adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence
as s official toastmaster and bullshitter
thank you santos
did i happen to mention that you were cut out of my will
company laughs i think it appropriate that we recognize the two asswipes i mean probationary firemen among us who today were baptized officially into the world of old man fire
first to tim who despite being handicapped at birth with a rather dull expression and a really hideous pair of ears not only took on the beast but pulled from
its clutches assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter me a kicking and screaming civilian that will probably end up suing us for breaking her fingernail
laughs and to brian whos own contribution was both more beautiful and less likely to sue
adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin seated with honor at the head of the table
right beside the thing
yknow when i heard that both mccaffrey brothers were going to be assigned together here well my heart was filled with
a sudden desire to transfer
laughs so raise a glass lads
to funny looking tim and the mccaffrey brothers who despite years of getting on each others nerves have managed with great effort
to still be pissed off at each other
together a toast fuck you
the klaxon suddenly rings
the ladder guys groan and get up
winks well keep it warm for you
dawn lightens the room as brian slowly opens his eyes and sees in extreme fish eyes close up the thing growling at him
brian turns the other direction and sees stephen fully dressed standing over his bunk
clean the toilets
bleary eyed the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of their rigs dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps they wear only at this moment
stephen stands before them does a quick glance up and down the line
okay company dismissed
see ya guys tonight at fitzgeralds retirement party
they shuffle for the door
as brian passes you want a ride
stephen pulls up
brian opens the door
brian a beat that hangs there see ya tonight
thats been cleared out for a huge party in full swing
an irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat
city brass including alderman swayzak a few reporters firemen and their families all mix together for this is a retirement party for the captain fitzgerald
brian enters seeks out a beer at the bar
stephens there swaying with what is clearly not his first drink of the evening
cheers as a one joke gift after another is laid on the chief
stephen sees his ex wife helen dancing with another man
he turns away
i gotta change the view
santos and grindle walk up
heard you didnt make the list for captain man
stephen just shrugs
brian sees jennifer across the room
she looks great
refined as she expertly works the room schmoozing and hugging and calling various politicos by their first name
as she speaks to one a waiter offers a drink
as she accepts a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red syrup
holding bottle interrupting with grenadine right
when i was twenty
oooh very sophisticated
her attention broken the politico has slipped away
annoyed jennifer leads brian aside and speaks low but angrily at him
look im not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a saturday night
this isnt about fun
im working here
carrying swayzaks notebook
let me tell you something
martin swayzak is going to be this towns next mayor
humanitys last hope
how can you work for that guy
why do you think marty came here tonight
because he cares about your department
you dont know how hard he works
you dont know about his programs helping west side all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
martys plan is only about efficiency
ive got two cousins on the job you think id work for him if i didnt believe in it
jennifer instantly cuts off as a well dressed couple passes and switches stunningly into schmmoze mode
to man tom how nice to see you
i know martyll be very happy you came
thanks so much for the donation
to woman marie
hows little kevin
seen the polls
this is the year
they move away
jennifer turns to brian and switches just as fast back to their argument
the thing that really makes me angry is the way your union has brian cant help it
he cracks up
what was that
oh man you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard
yeah well i like to think im just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters
i seem to remember some pretty good nights on jp ii
brian turns and walks away
adcox is talking with another knot of firemen
hes brought a date sally a hot little number that has a habit of standing on her tip toes when she talks
looking at swayzak across room yuck what a scumbag
to santos fuckin city transferred sally three months ago out of parking violations into swayzaks office
now i gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and shes stuck with an asshole
shrugs no but theres more exercise being chased around a desk
theres a commotion at the other end of the bar
a group of firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine
aw i dont believe this shit
somebody get a shovel
you seen this stephen
as they hold it up to stephen we see a photo spread titled the first photo shows brian rushing out of the burning building with seemingly a woman in his
the second photo shows the backs of adcox and tims helmets as they administered aid to the real woman they saved
the implication is its the same woman
reads probationary fireman brian mccaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double check
a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez a seamstress for the north shore clothing company
mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his fathers death
the old photo is there too
brian and his dads helmet
whadda we gonna do about this
stephen glances over the headlines
yknow i think its a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper especially if its bullshit he owes the company a drink
motions to waiter ill have a double
on the hero
the other firemen jump in with drink orders
dozens of them
confused whats going on
tim shows him the magazine
brian reads with horror as alderman swayzak appears beside him
brian mccaffrey right
brian this is my boss alderman swayzak
to swayzak brians a big fan of yours
and im a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
uh i think theres been a mistake
i didnt save that woman
no need to be modest brian
no you dont understand i saved a mannequin
that really was incredibly work you did
you and your brother fighting fires together helluva image isnt it
you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
every little boys fantasy
brian let me come to the point
id like to offer you a job
i have a job
this ones still with the fire department
one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now
we think he could use another pair of hands and youre exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
yeah we got all kinds of traditions like dying young
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone brian
this could be a great opportunity to move
beyond a fire engine
brian looks at jennifer then smiles at swayzak
thanks anyway mr
swayzak but fire engines sorta run in my family
a man suddenly steps between them to pump swayzaks hand
brian shakes his head and walks away
swayzak shoots a concerned glance at jennifer
she catches up with him at the buffet table
boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
cmon jennifer hes just another north side jag off with a mouth
brian do you always have to be so stupid
think about your future for once
so now you suddenly care about my future
look i didnt mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought youd call when you came back
you didnt and
beat dont blow it just because of this garbage between us
hey sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss
but im not gonna be a poster boy for him im trying to do something here
theres five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day
tell swayzak to talk to one of them
across the room stephens at the buffet watching helen dance with her fireman date the drinks hammering him hard
aw man how can she dance with that guy
i hate that guy
hes a dispatcher
i hate his voice
i mean i know women have gotta bang somebody but why that son of a bitch
stephen gives pengelly an icy sideways look
hey stevie hes an asshole
stephen smiles and pushes off the bar right for helen as she dances
uh helen i wanted to talk to you a second about sean
stephen im kinda busy here can we talk about this later
how ya doin stephen
jackson steers her away but stephen isnt done yet
he dogs them
to helen whats wrong with right now
hes your son for christs sake
hes hey stephen what about that dumb ass brother of yours huh
savin a mannequin
how fuckin stupid can a guy get
stephen suddenly punches jackson
you cant talk about my brother like that
sighs here we go
and stephen plows into jackson
another fireman jumps to jacksons aid
and brians there defending his brother punching out a fireman
the crowd finally pulls the two apart
youre crazy man
leave me alone
goddamn it stephen lay off
stephen calms a little you stupid dumbshit you never know when to fucking quit do you
you ever wonder why your careers in the fucking toilet
why youre gonna be stuck a lt
beat i need a drink
stephen takes a step for the bar then suddenly turns and jumps jackson again
brian pulls him off and drags him for the door
you dont need a drink man
you need to get outta here
as jennifer watches brian lead stephen out the door
to swayzak ah those mccaffreys
just hate leaving a party with anyone left standing
brian leads stephen toward his car
leave me alone
stephen pushes brian away and promptly stumbles to the sidewalk
so you got a roid going with jackson or what
nah hes nothin
its just sometimes
sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out yknow
brian stands there and folds his arms
i dont think i can get up
brian lends an arm
look brian a photographer
maybe i can get on the cover of life magazine too
cmon lets crawl home
stephen throws an arm over brians shoulder as he leads him up onto the boat
adcox those guys
they dont get it
it isnt the goddamn promotion
im not my old man yknow
no fires gonna get me
i dont give a shit about being a captain
its just they dont trust me anymore
blows out painful breath they dont trust me anymore
brians flops his brother on the bed
unties his shoes
if youd get out of my fuckin way
i could take my own goddamn shoes off
he clearly cant
brian slips them off
youre such a pain in the ass
youve always been a pain in the ass
theres just a grim wall lamp above stephens face
jesus its too damn bright in here
like a goddamn spotlight
im goin blind
touching light this
brian turns off the dim light
stephens breathing deepens
they dont know
they dont know what i hear in there
brian tucks the blanket around him
this boat could be okay huh
take it out weekends
sean n me
stephens voice drifts off into sleep
brian watches a moment the rare look of peace on his brothers face then leaves
dark and still
brian carrying a roll of hose scales the chain link
is a practice stand pipe
brian counts down to himself then rushes the stand pipe spinning off the cap with a hydrant wrench and attaching the hose coupling
he does it again over and over
the skys gone pink and blue as brian climbs back over the fence
adcox coming out of a donut shop across the street sees him
a truck has jackknifed across the avenue and spilled its contents several thousand baby chicks
theyre scurrying everywhere as brians company tries to round them up
its hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the cheeping cargo into their turn out coats
theres ghetto kids all around grabbing at the chicks grabbing at the fire engine
at kids hey
knock it off
brian stops a beat
rubs his eyes
smiles maybe you should have gotten more sleep last night
brian looks at him
does he mean what he thinks he means
tim is coming out of a small store across the street
he hands a small bag of groceries to adcox
this everything you wanted
everyone grows suddenly silent
a firemans without even saying so petzold on the mailbox engine parked out front
brians alone outside cleaning the diesel fuel off his arms
watching a small kid playing with a toy fire truck in the drive
tim and brian are loading the groceries into the fridge
stephen and grindle are fixing a loose cabinet door as adcox sits caulking a faucet fitting at the kitchen table with a young woman
to stephen can i help you guys at all
nah we just about got it
noticing adcoxs shirt sally must be finally ironing your shirts
its just new
couplea shifts and itll be as thrashed as the rest
the sight of uniform is too much for her
her eyes cloud
adcox reaches out and lets her weep on his shoulder
i miss him
i just miss him yknow
adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette lost in himself watching the little boy play with his toy fire truck
stephens followed him out
this fuckin job sometimes
to buy it trying to go the extra yard man thats one thing but to buy it just because there wasnt any back up
stephen leans down close
yeah its bullshit
fuck em all
we dont go into fires for them
you know that
christ you taught me that
a beat of understanding between them
stephen looks back at the house
you know knowlton pretty well
beat kind of an asshole wasnt he
adcox cant help but smile
biggest in two battalions
beat smiles were gonna be okay man
as brian and tim scrub down the fire engine the rest of the company lies sprawled in watching a weepy soap
schmidt walks through and is snared by the tvs glow
shares the moment
is she going to get the divorce
sighs with honest concern hell if i know man
a ladderman washington walks in with a memo
hey pengelly you made the captains list
everybody clasps pengelly on the shoulder
way to go
all right man
brian turns and sees stephen out on the apparatus floor watching
pengellys younger than him
an expanse of concrete lying out back of the station
built in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training building just wide enough for a stairway and room on each level
twenty yards away brian tim and adcox stand ready beside a pile of coiled hose rolls
looking at watch alright
tim picks up a roll of hose pounds throws it over his shoulder and runs with adcox to the foot of the building
theres a fixed standpipe that adcox ties into as tim drags the other end inside and up a flight of stairs
brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the building
that isnt a football probie
get it on your shoulder
brian runs up two flights to meet tim and connect his end
tim heads down for another roll as brian drags his up another two flights
its a bitch
sweating he barrels back down the stairs passing tim coming up with another roll
having fun fireman
tim flips him off
brian laughs and sprints for another roll
youre not breaking any records brian
brian holds it under his arm and takes off
stephen grabs a roll himself hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside
brian lifts it to his shoulder
pick it up
they come to the doorway
instead of stopping stephen follows brian in and runs alongside up the stairs
without a word spoken its become a race between them
brians face explodes in sweat
his heart pounds as they go up flight after flight
the hose rolls weigh a pounds
neck n neck all the way grunting their throats burning only one flight from the roof stephen stumbles and scrapes his leg
stephens already back on his feet
run damn you
brian does stephen already gaining on him getting ready to pass him when they burst gasping out onto the roof brian the winner by a nose
stephen drops his hose roll sticks his face into brians and laughs
unsure brian starts to join in
stephen stops suddenly
roll the hose
what are you kidding
adcox and tim down below have already disappeared back into the station
you heard me
we see now what stephen apparently doesnt
he was scraped badly his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood
what is it the stairs
christ ill let you win next time
in brians face you got a problem with drilling probie
i dont have a problem with drilling
but lets just have one drill
not one for the company and one for me
roll the hose
stephen turns and walks away
brian stands there watching him in blind fury finally exploding
goddamn you stephen im not gonna quit
you hear me
an awkward beat between them thats interrupted suddenly by the station alarm klaxon
well thank god for fires
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
sequence omitted from original script
smoke and confusion
a mother is screaming hysterically at stephen as he jumps down from the engine
grabbing his coat my baby
my babys still up there
hang on a sec stevie we got a hoseline coming
stephen doesnt even pause and enters the building
brian hesitates a beat then follows
where they bomb up a staircase just as a wall of fire lashes down knocking them on their ass
stephen jumps to his feet with an axe as brian struggles to get up
dont take that kind of shit from it
dont let it know youre scared
stephen with just his axe chases up the stairs at the fire hammering at the flaming boards
the fire retreats into another room slamming the door shut behind it
brian struggles up the stairs
the two of them slide up on either side of the closed door stephen cradling his axe like a swat team shotgun
the door breathes in and out and something animal scratches and snarls on the other side
brian can feel the panic rising in his throat
that thing behind the door that slobbering evil thing
it wants out
christ stephen lets wait for the hose team
listen to it brian
jump when i say
it wont get us
stephen hammers the lock with his axe and kicks the door open
a wall of flame roars out past their cheeks then backwashes in
stephen picks up the door and using it as a shield charges into the flames
brian tries to follow but the fire wells up cutting him off
its that goddamn flame again leering at him
it bucks suddenly dropping brian to his knee
he groans in pain
and now adcox and grindle are coming up the stairs with a hoseline washing down the room
clouds of furious steam bellow out and across the ceiling
nobody could be alive in there
his entire outfit smoldering he emerges from the clouds like a fucking god carrying in one arm a gasping child
most of the firemen have gathered together for post fire coffee and stories
brian sits off alone on the fire engine bumper apart from them
santos walks up
they think shes gonna live
stephen walks up
sits down beside him
i would have fucking waited
thats not what its about brian
the point is there was a kid in there
and what if thered been two
i went in because thats what i do
its my way
its dads way
it isnt everybodys way
where did he tell you that
in a fucking seance
you said you wanted to know something brian
what did you learn today
brian doesnt answer what do you say brian huh
time to move on
brian lingers only a moment before standing
youre right stephen
youre the best man
brian hands stephen his helmet and walks away
theres only six like it in city hall and this one has a view
on intercom brian mccaffrey on line two for jennifer
ill take it in my office
turns to her and smiles go get him
jennifer comes out of swayzaks office and walks down to her own
its a tiny bleak little rat hole
she picks up the receiver
we see brian in his apartment
ive been thinking about what you said the other night
if the offers still on the table id like to talk about it
ill arrange things with your assignment captain
beat martys a good man brian
brian hangs up
he stares at it a moment then slams it against the wall
jennifer stares at the phone with something almost like sadness
stephen drives past the burned out brownstone that fried alan seagrave
he parks in the alley behind walks up the building and pulls off a plywood sheet covering a blown out window
stephen walks through the creepy brutalized silence
back to where rimgale had focused his investigation that night
he searches the floor the wall looking for something
a crumbling one in chinatown
brian checks the address on his slip of paper
he stands there a beat hating himself
its a regular station but for the rear that has been converted into arson squad offices
as brian approaches the office door he can see rimgale sitting at his desk
standing nervously beside it is a fresh faced uniformed probie
to probie so stop me if i get this wrong
the fires almost out
youre upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat
youve been told by your battalion chief your captain by me not to do anything up there until ordered
but now the itch starts and all of a sudden comes the glory boy flash hey im a hero
heroes dont just stand around
so on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation
was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline
the kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation
you couldve crispered half your company with that little stunt but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence i use to prove its arson
youve made my day longer probie
go home and think about that
the kid shuffles off hang dog
rimgales angry gaze falls on brian
uh im brian mccaffrey
your new assistant
your dennis kid
beat i work alone
and rimgale walks into his office leaving brian marooned in the doorway
stepping behind a small partition rimgale changes his shirt
brian can just glimpse from where he stands a horrible burn that has consumed most of rimgales stomach
rimgale catches the look
are you still here
get used to me inspector
im not going anywhere
then go find a corner
i dont want you in my way
i think we should get something straight here
i was assigned to this office by the city
look i knew your father he had a helluva reputation on this job
but that dont mean you get any slack
swayzak sends you down here okay i gotta eat you thats the rules and i got nothing to say about that
but swayzak or no you live with me
step out of line and i dont care who knows you ill swing the hammer
beat you think youre the first
rimgale glances at his watch puts on his coat and picks up a small paper bag
where are you going
and the face of ronald an unremarkable man in his s
unremarkable but for laser eyes and two heavily bandaged hands
go wide and find him sitting in an institutional chair handcuffed actually in an institutional hall
a uniformed guard stands nearby as brian and rimgale come down the corridor
ronald smiles upon seeing rimgale
how ya doin ronald
didnt think youd make it
wouldnt miss this for the world pal
looking at brian whos this
he works for me
is he a fireman
smiles i like firemen
you like everybody ronald
ronalds eyes pick up brians name on his prison id badge
eyes light up happily oh this is really a treat
lost a dad to the animal huh
heating up hey do i know you
you dont know him
i know you
to ronald what the hell are you talking about my rimgale silences brian with a threatening hand
knock it off
tell him about me shadow
ronald here likes telephones
used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton
came up with a whole little thing there didnt you ronald
when you got bored what did you do
you just started making calls
mostly day care centers and retirement homes wasnt it
did he tell you how we finally met
nobody cares ronald
oh but its a good story shadow
youre depriving our famous young friend here
the cop helps ronald to his feet and all four are marching down the hall
it was on state street right
just your basic warehouse torch for the owner
but the animal
turned on me
ol shadow here he shows up whole place is going like hell my hair my hands
couldve just let the animal take me but shadow hes a good camper so he tries to pull ol ronald out
guess he didnt notice the tub of phosphorous next to me
smiles notice youre still a little shy about rolling your sleeves up shadow
show him your stomach yet
ronald in the hot seat before a parole board rimgale and brian on the sidelines
all right the parole board has received mr
bowlands fitness report his id endorsement from his section warden
as supervising psychiatrist i would describe mr
bowlands progress as remarkable
taking into account his disability and the six years already served i recommend parole
bowland do you regret your crimes
i understand now the pain i caused
if released will you commit these crimes again
do you consider yourself ready for society
the parole board shuffles their papers
its a done deal
rimgale suddenly stands and approaches ronald
youre ready alright
surprised excuse me mr
to ronald what do you do with little girls
a tortured look comes over ronalds face
hes holding back
from the paper bag rimgale suddenly tosses a burned baby doll in his lap
what do you do with them ronald
rimgale then lights a cigarette lighter in ronalds face
smiles burn them
and old ladies
and the world the whole world
smiles burn it all
the parole board stares stunned
see ya next year ronald
a pre war theatre closed with a sign under renovation opening xmas
david benton mid forties climbs out of his car and walks to the entrance with some rolled up blueprints
benton walks through the vast theatre and up to a beautiful art noveau office door david benton private
he goes to insert his key
as he reaches down we see a tiny wisp of smoke suck back under the door
benton sniffs as if he smells something then shrugs and inserts his key
itd have been a good story if hed lived longer
the moment he pushes the door open it explodes outward in a later and engine companies have already knocked down the building fire as brian climbs out of rimgales red
opens trunk hey kid cmere at least make yourself useful
he starts handing brian handfuls of equipment cases
loaded down brian follows rimgale into the building
fire crews are at work in here including engine at the other end of the theatre
brians surprised to see them his eyes locking briefly with stephens
an engine company lt
walks up to rimgale
we were lucky with this one
couldve taken out the whole complex but the explosion blew out most of the flame
good for us
looks to body not so good for him
him is our previous owner david benton just his hands and a leg showing from under the collapsed door
rimgale crouches beside it
turn this over
the corpses keys are still in the lock
blown with such force he seems fused with the door
on the doors edge rimgale notices a small patch of melted sticky goo
with his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals it in a glass vial stands and walks into the office
what do you want me to do with rimgale now inside silences him with an outstretched arm
after a beat what are you listening to
rimgale doesnt answer
his eyes drift over the scorched walls as he speaks softly to them
you sneaky little son of a bitch
hide and seek
come on tell me what i want to know
he scratches at some soot
smiles and lifts a small hand recorder
business like into recorder heavy smoke stains observed in entry room
demarkation line high
fire never got hot enough here to cook soot off
it started somewhere else
walks down hall less soot here
they enter back room and very little soot here
to brian get that couch out of the way
brian pulls it aside
the lower third of the wall is completely untouched by soot
to himself so you were happy here
warm and cozy and in no hurry
into recorder soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance
to brian find me some glass
do we have a language barrier here
theres some on the sill of a blown window
brian hands a shard to rimgale who turns it over in his palm
into recorder glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion
lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn
explosion must of come after a slow burn
shuts recorder off you little tease
what were you up to you little bastard huh
what made you that mad
then an idea or scared
switches on recorder it started in this room
took its time hung out
but the air ran out
it couldnt breathe
so it was snuffed
but it wasnt dead
still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
rimgale turns to the wall a section where the plaster is severely damaged
he probes with a penknife
finish coat burned away
severe spawling of rough coat
rimgale follows the damaged wall down down to a melted wall socket
thats our ignition point
dig it out
brian chops it out from the wall
rimgale crouches down peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires
the copper tip is severely melted
rimgale sniffs the plug
into recorder temperature in this room was about degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires degrees
an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
no it couldnt
rimgale shuts off the recorder
stares down brian
i mean youd be right with normal wire
but thats gauge ten in that plug industrial stuff
who knows why they put it in here but it wont melt at less than degrees
and no natural spark short of lightning gets that hot
rimgale just stares in another life i was in high end electronics
rimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside
into recorder have outlet analyzed for any traces of flammable accelerants
rimgale stands and walks out
dont mention it
brian follows rimgale down from the office into the vast theatre
walls hiss and spit
brians surprised to see his former engine mates there tromping and crunching their way through broken glass their flashlights like dancing fireflies
tim passes by
everybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills
to brian check the wall for burn patterns
and rimgales off to another room
brian turns and looks at the wall
to tim so you surviving without me
theres no replacement cause of your boss cuts if thats what you mean
if someone else goes out on an injury were really screwed
swayzaks not my boss
brian looks over the wall
a dirty puddle separates him from it
to brian ooooh like the tie
love the tie
grindle scrape down that wall for me huh
i would myself but the tie n all yknow
grindle stares at him a beat then wordlessly steps into the muck and pulls free a section of wall dropping it on the ground in front of brian
santos and grindle look at each other
uh brian if youre lookin for smoke patterns theres some good ones over here
as brian walks over little to the right
right behind there
hey could you hand me that pike pole
theres a pike pole leaning against the wall
brian pulls it aside
splash the pole had been supporting a small sagging piece of ceiling that instantly collapses dumping twenty gallons of murky putrid black water all over brians civvys
sorry maybe that wasnt it after all
stephen appears around the corner
sees whats happened
thats just about enough guys okay
see ya around brian
brian stands there humiliated
to brian what the hells the matter with you huh
youre steppin in the shit again
you couldve done it
you dont want this
the suit n tie wake up kid
brian burns with shame and anger as adcox walks away
stephen hands brian a towel
dry yourself off
brian snatches it from him
glares at his brother
look you are sorta making yourself fair game
thanks for the insight
brian look just leave me alone okay
brian walks away
stephen calls after him
i dont get half the shit hes talking about but then everybody says the same thing about me
who the hell knows
helen stephens ex wife is sitting at her kitchen when she looks up suddenly at a strange sound coming from the roof
on the short sloping roof stephen stands hammering a shingle back into place
helen sticks her head out the dormer window
stephen what are you doing here
fixing my roof
its not your roof anymore
he stops and tosses the hammer aside
looks at his watch
hes got piano lessons
hows he doing
hes going to be a fireman
give up babe
you cant fight it
believe me my mom tried
beat stephen you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this
i just wanted to i dont know not exactly apologize for the other night especially since i dont remember much of it you remember
i just thought i should say i dont know something
the great communicator
sorry i hit jackson
he deserved it
he was born deserving it
he treats you okay
i treated you better
you treated me like shit
but she smiles
you want some coffee
nah i gotta go
whats wrong stephen
looks at her cmon you only beat up the roof when somethings on your mind
beat hows brian doing
i know hes out but hows he doing
yknow i treated him better than any other probie i ever had
he probably hates my guts but i did the best thing for him
i made him finally look in the mirror
ah stephen thats what this is really about isnt it
you always have to be right
hey im the first one to admit when im wrong
when was the last time
in a fire
beat look im his brother
i care about him yknow
he was going to get himself killed
maybe not today maybe not in a year but it wouldve happened
and i couldnt i just couldnt
you cant keep being his father
stephen sighs deeply
you know what i realized today
i cant remember my dads face anymore
theres pictures of him staring at me everywhere i go but the guy behind them
he sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway
ill see ya around helen
she watches him as he walks lonely up the street
a lab tech ricco leads brian and rimgale through the autopsy area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered in plastic
okay alan seagrave and donald cosgrove
if you say so
brians stomach does a half gainer as hes confronted by two hideously charred bodies
both deaths due to close encounters with stationary objects office door for mr
cosgrove porsche for mr
no non relevant traumas
no significant blood toxicology
attitude of both trajectories consistent with explosions
brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze whistling quietly to himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf
they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers front doors
its a combination of plumbers putty and rayophene gum
burns almost completely away when you light it
on both doors
theres something else kinda interesting
ricco lifts bentons charred shoulder
underneath we see some of his clothes that have melted and co mingled with his flesh
a credit card has been fried right into cosgroves skin about where his back pocket should have been
guess he didnt leave home without it
ricco erupts in a honking laugh then switches instantly back to a business tone
anyway down here take a look
mccaffrey hold this for us
uh i dont think thats in my contract
i just re wrote your contract
with supreme reluctance brian pulls the crispers head and shoulder away from the table
jesus christ he isnt gonna try to sell you insurance lift him
brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher
to rimgale see that patch of shirt
we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro
on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate
nobody around here had ever heard of it
alright its an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents
its pretty rare they stopped making it a couplea years ago
probably got in cosgroves clothes in a gas state from the fire
what the hell was it doing in the fire
thats your job
at that instant cosgroves eyes open and his body sighs
brian drops the body in shock and backs away stunned
i asked you to hold him not feel him up
rimgales fd sedan
brian is still wringing imaginary guts off his hands
rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in his lap
trychtichlorate is a binary structured go to the bottom
under heat properties
during heat episodes of kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates
will consume magnesium
ever burned magnesium
its so hot it takes water molecules and bamm
rimgale claps his hands next to brians head startling him
son of a bitch tears em apart just to eat the oxygen
wouldnt take much at all to melt ten gauge wire
problems burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue
then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder
rimgale looks at brian
hes getting tired of this
look it isnt proof okay
someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in cosgroves clothes
and the putty around the door
even if it was used to seal the air off that doesnt explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft
a guns a helluva lot easier but the right guess on this is arson
i dont guess
some people say you dont do much of anything when it comes to this case
i dont work for them either
brians sitting at a desk
hes finishing up a huge paper clip tyrannosaurus
the phone rings
straightest answer your departments given me all week
we see jennifers calling from her office shes busy signing papers brought to her and okaying campaign posters as she talks
hows it going
boss and i are up to about three words an hour
to secretary green committed to a thousand
to brian theres another fund raising party tonight
martyd really like you to come
i dont know im kinda swamped here
he tosses a paper airplane
i could use a date
well maybe i can fit it in
into phone call ya back
brian hangs up quickly and walks back into rimgales there crouched excitedly beside a trash can thats lids been sealed closed
he tamps a piece of putty on the rim and backs away
take the top off
take it off
brian walks over and rips off the lid
instantly a tongue of flame shoots straight up past his head and blows out
rimgales grinning like a little kid
oh that son of a bitch hes different goddamn it
you see what this tells us huh
our killer doesnt love fire
pulls out file i got it after we talked to ronald
want to fry the whole goddamn world
but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much
the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls
and he made his burns backdrafts
but he killed these guys
but he could have killed everybody there
the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall
the backdraft blew out the flame
thats the reason
whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out
thats why the sealant on the doors
so what have we got a torch with a conscience
no we have a stone killer trying to make a point
are you going public with this
do that and i guarantee youll scare him off
i dont want him running away
a latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against a beautiful chicago skyline
an air horn blows and suddenly the skyline is moving
were on a huge private party boat
brians leaning on the boat railing watching the passing parade of rich and beautiful
across the sea of champagne and brie he spots jennifer talking with her boss swayzak
he has his hand on her back
jennifer spots brian
she smile detaches herself and walks over
eyes on swayzak hey
beat so are you dating your boss or what
if you werent at least the th person to ask me that id probably be pissed
beat sighs boy you sure know its a mans world sometimes
beat are you dating anyone
you think thats really any of your business
well you did invite me here
beat smiles but i wanted you to come to
swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage
it isnt mine
to photographer lets get a picture
swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around brians shoulder
another staffer slaps a swayzak for mayor sticker to brians lapel
jennifer rolls her eyes to brian
seeing someone else larry
sotto to jennifer what does he do again
swayzak leads her off in pursuit
left alone brian turns to the railing stares off at the passing city
you can hear the wind up of a siren
and there it is now an engine company zooming along wacker drive
something digs and kicks inside of brian as he watches it disappear
hows the job going
shes appeared again beside him
boy rimgales as slow as a snail isnt he
no hes more of a dinosaur
guys not a dummy though
hes juggling alot of balls on this one
yeah but it doesnt take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
jesus give him a break
there isnt enough proof yet to go public
sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em and weve maybe figured out why backdrafts but you cant rush this stuff
not till its locked
but rimgales probably going to come around to arson
in a dinosaur kinda way yeah
both of them look up sharply
a woman drunk out of her mind has tipped over in her chair
she laughs her fellow tablemates laugh everybody laughs
jennifer takes brian by the arm in the opposite direction and smiles
the bands completely cut loose now
a wild percussion rhythm that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen
brian and jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through hair crazily askew
the lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful as it slips past
the drums beat faster and harder and the only thing that isnt moving now is their eyes eyes locked on each other
sweaty flushed with the evening and a few drinks brian and jennifer pull up in her car
thanks for the invite
got anything to drink in there
oh there might be something stashed away for emergencies
the regular engine companys gone to bed and the arson squads packed in for the night leaving the apparatus floor quiet and dim as brian and jennifer enter
brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the rear where rimgale has his offices
as they walk jennifers eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets the press tin ceiling
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city
lotta tradition locked up in here
what do you think
see that trap door up there
that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse drawn engines
it was pretty different then
but kinda the same yknow
do you miss it
he doesnt answer you seem like you do
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
then why did you quit
i wanted to be a good one
they walk into the back arson offices
brian pokes through a few drawers one or two shelves
finally he lifts a squat specialized fire extinguisher
the bottom has been hollowed out leaving room for a fifth of bourbon
old firehouse trick
he pours her a glass
jennifer takes a generous sip of hers turns brushes past him and breathes so show me your fire truck
brian escorts jennifer along the side of the behemoth
well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment
this area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose
brian lifts a narrow tapered straight bore nozzle
this is a six inch playpipe cast bronze to keep it firm during hard flows
picks up another item this is our pipe extender used in forward lays
moves on this is our hard suction line
our adjustable insertion nozzle
comes around back of trunk and this is the hose bed
the air cracks between them
and is brushed aside
in an instant theyre all over each other
tangled lips and gulping breaths
jennifer abruptly breaks it off and looks mischievously up at the hose bed with its long curling rolls of soft cotton
brian doesnt remember this precise scenario being discussed at the academy but he improvises admirably popping up onto the hose bed and offering a gentlemanly hand to jennifer
as they tumble into the soft folds engine roars up lights flashing to a high rise
as the crew jumps down tim trips and falls flat on his face
jesus tim if youre going to kill yourself at least wait till the fire its better p
jennifer unbuttons brians shirt
tell me about the playpipe again
she pulls the shirt off his shoulder as we engine walking up to a frazzled security guard in the lobby
where is it
theres alarms going off on three different floors
they climb into the elevator
its cramped on the way up with the bulky coats helmets hose rolls and the tangible nervousness that always goes with this kind of fire
the elevator musak plays strings version of tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
how do we know if the floors going to be on fire
if the doors open and its hot dont get out
brian pulls off jennifers stockings
as she kicks it away
the elevator stops
the door opens
no howling blaze not even any noise but enough hanging smoke that you cant see your hand in front of your face
they fan out gingerly onto the floor looking for the fire
hide and seek in a white fog bank
everybody stops and listens
slowly carefully they feel their way through the haze
on cue something snakes past behind the walls whispers and whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent
grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe
these high rise gigs give me the creeps
lets wait for a back up stephen
were early on this one it hasnt even broke out yet
were one short as it is with brian gone
but stephens on the hunt now
want to learn something
stephen and tim take the lead their axes gripped like shotguns
grindle backs them up with a charged hoseline
adcox go with pengelly and check the other side
it isnt safe man
dont go splittin us up
not with this one
what the hells the matter with you
you always check the other side
i havent got time for bullshit right now okay
we got a job here
let me take the lead stephen
goddamn it adcox
just do your fucking job
with a stricken look on his face he takes his crew down the other way
stephen and tim slowly feel their way
everybody spins around in terror
something inhuman giggles down ahead of them
like a mantra oh youre so very sly but so am to tim listen to it
you can tell when a wall cracks which way its gonna jump
you can hear the doors breathe if theyre hot
tim looks confused
he doesnt get it
they come to a side door
stephen runs his hand down the jam feels for heat
then he steps back takes a deep breath and crashes the door down with one axe blow
brian and jennifer are into the rhythm now breathing deeply
on the wall above them are framed photos of dead firemen
stephen concentrates on the sound of the fire above him then abruptly turns and crashes down another door
brian and jennifer lie in a tight embrace enjoying the moment the lull as suddenly the lights snap on and an alarm klaxon bellows
firemen are coming down the pole now
whats going on
they frantically climb into their clothes
the firemen havent noticed them as they climb aboard
theyve started the engine
what are they doing
and before either of them realizes it theyre suddenly pulling out into the street and wailing off down the block
the winds wild in their hair the siren deafening the flashing red lights blinding staccato and jennifer loves it
she kisses brian fiercely he lets out a war whoop lost in the blast of air and together they hold each other as the night screams past and
engine pulls up into the parking lot of the high rise fire
firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to pull off lengths of hose from the bed
as the folds curl away the fireman is stunned to see a womans stocking come out with it
with equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and grinning brian and jennifer climb calmly down out of the bed
stephen and tim creep along the hall
to tim lotta smoke but it isnt rolling
that means its hiding
one of these doors
tims come to one
to himself easy
youre not going anywhere
stephen bangs down another door
sticks his head in to check
a little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water
tim readies his axe before his door gathers his courage as stephen comes out of the room he was checking
sees tim lifting his axe
did you check the door for heat tim
tim doesnt hear
the axe is already up
tims committed now coming hard at the door
and stephen sees it for just an instant small tendrils of smoke edging lazily around the door then being sucked back in
he rushes for tim as tims axe smacks the door and a whine behind it builds and roars and howls and tims all follow through now hitting the door with
his shoulder as the door explodes outward hurling tim against the opposite wall and for an instant hes okay but he freezes in terror as a shrieking tongue of flame shoots out the doorway and grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames wrap tim like a jealous lover as adcox hears it and screams oh god
oh god no
and tims screaming now too because his helmet his mask his face its all melting and grindle dives suicidally at the monster blasting it with his hose as stephen ignores
the flames and puts his arms around tim as grindle douses them both killing the flames
the monster rolls wounded back into the room into the air shafts as tim whimpers incoherently sliding down the wall as stephen tries to help but oh god you cant
tell whats face and whats mask and helmet anymore
grindle looks back where the fire came from
theres a corpse in there burned and lying between two doors
adcox rushes to tims side sobbing and its the end the end of the goddamn world
brian and jennifer are having the time of their lives when suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a stretcher to an ambulance and brian sees sweet
jesus its tim
jennifer turns away in horror
they load tim into the van as adcox and grindle jump in to ride along
to hold his hand
stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street
frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat and slams it to the ground
he kicks it kicks it till his strengths gone
he turns his wounded eyes finding brian
rimgale walks down the smokey corridor
the charred civilian is there sitting in the short stretch of hall between two blown doors
through the haze rimgale sees stephen crouched in the interior room picking at the debris
lost in himself
stephen stands and looks around the room seemingly unaware of rimgale
he walks wordlessly straight out past him his eyes streaming with tears
brian shoulders his way through the emergency room
he passes a small alcove full of vending machines
adcox is there sipping a paper cup leaning against the machine in deep anguish
further down the hall is icu
grindle and santos are there sitting outside the room raw and weary
grindle nods to brian
everyones still stained and smudged from the fire
everyone but brian
brian looks through a door window into the room
there surrounded by doctors and physicians lies tim
hes been cut out of his uniform
gauze bandages everywhere
as a pair of forceps peel some away brian glimpses what used to be a face now only reds and browns and leaky whites
he turns away
do they think hell pull through
theyre not saying
i should have been there
none of us should have been there brian
voices rise down the hall
turn to shouts
its adcox and stephen tearing heartbreakingly into one another
brian cant make out the words but its ugly emotional
abruptly it ends and stephen emerges from the alcove walking toward them upset
you had to do it didnt you
stephens got other things on his mind
not now brian
had to take on another fire bare handed huh
had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie
is that what happened
is it stephen
i had that fire
he didnt listen
he didnt listen
he was a fucking candidate
he was your responsibility
he shouldnt have been there in the first place stephen
beat you burned him
brian grabs his arm
stephen snaps and roughly pushes brian knocking him against the wall
brian comes off it in a flash and is all over stephen
they go down and its all thrashing and shouting now
a horrible endless draw
grindle and santos are in it pulling them apart holding them up against opposite walls
both brothers glare at one another tears filling their eyes
brian shakes grindle off and walks away
brian sits staring blankly
a newspaper drops in front of him
says its murder
rimgale stands above him
goes on about how the break was made through the discovery of chemical traces and a behavioral link
oh and swayzaks quoted saying the chief investigator is closing in on the torch and expects an arrest any time
brians eyes wince closed
get your stuff and get out
shes pouring some coffee as brian bursts in
you told swayzak about our arson lead
its all over the fucking news
i didnt know it was a secret
there arent supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators bullshit
you knew what i told you wasnt ready for the papers will you please keep your voice down theres people you could have scared the son of a bitch off
we may never bust him now
all for a couples political points
i was doing my job
grabs her arm yeah
and just how much of all this has been doing your job
shakes it off let me ask you something do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills
who the hell are you kidding
i was there remember
i saw you and your brother leave stephen out of this oh yeah hes the real fireman
beat who are you
just another probie working for swayzak i work for the city
you knew what we were asking you to do
dont suddenly pull out a conscience now
the fit isnt right
swayzak appears in the doorway
he looks haggard as if he hasnt slept
theres something haunted in his eyes
in fact i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterdays arson announcement was a fabrication by your office
they loved it
and you know what
you were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight
brian shoulders his way past swayzak and walks out
brian walks up to tims room
stephens sitting there ragged looking
inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and gauze and years of wasted promise
an ekg beeps a respirator hisses and brian gulps down something heavy in his throat
hes gonna live
maybe not much else but hes gonna live
stephen walks away
as rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up
swayzak opens the rear door from inside
cruising through traffic
swayzak is disheveled unshaven fidgety
a man who hasnt slept and had a few drinks before the one hes pouring now
he offers one to rimgale
i usually have breakfast first
swayzak apparently doesnt
when are you going to catch the prick thats doing this don
dont you have any leads at all
no marty i dont
for the first time rimgale sees real fear on swayzaks face
we still havent found a connection between the victims
jesus open your eyes
seagrave cosgrove and now holcomb fried in a goddamn high rise
i didnt know the name of that victim had even been released yet
the sedan stops back at arson hq
theyd gone around the block
rimgale opens the door climbs out lingers
is there a connection between them alderman
just catch the son of a bitch
the door shuts and swayzak roars away
rimgale walks back into his offices
hes surprised to see brian there working at his desk
what the hell are you doing here
im finished with swayzak
ill do whatever you want me to do
i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim
you gotta give me another shot
rimgale stares at brian appraises him
a close up of rimgale popping the molding around the door frame of holcombs burned office
underneath can be seen traces of the same white residue from the other fires
i thought ol marty was acting a little strange
and hes right
rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers
rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body lied between two doors
the backdraft was set somewhere in there
it fried holcomb when he opened the inner door
but the outer door held
and waited for tim
brian steps into the inner office
so find me the fire
brian begins searching probing
he finally stands
youre thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost
brians eyes dont understand
from rimgales coat comes a plastic flask
he pours out of it a liquid onto the floor and lights a match
in a word brian what is this job all about
rimgale drops the match
a small flame explodes to life
its a living thing brian
it breathes it eats and it hates
the fires climbing a wall chewing a corner
the only way to beat it is to think like it
to know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection but because it wants to
it darts west
licks the ceiling
the fire purrs and hisses
stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely
some guys on this job fire owns them
it makes them fight on its level
but the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little just like ronald
brian stares at the flame
a goblin reaching out for him
rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher
in an instant the goblin is gone the genie in the bottle
what the hell are you guys doin
a young womans entered
were the fire department lady
well color me stupid i always thought the fire dept
put out fires
to woman you work here
what do you think the odds are that a non refundable ticket to paris survived this
somewhere between zero and no way
what a mess
you seem real broken up about mr
the darth vader of tax accountants
he was a sleezeball
hopefully a sleezeball that carried some insurance
go talk to the building owner
he was the building owner
our book lists the owner as dekom trust
she looks at him like hes the dumbest human shes met all week
dont investigators come in adult size
sequence omitted from original script
stephens lying sprawled on his bunk his hands pressed over his eyes
theres a voice outside the door
rimgales here to see you
he just wants to im busy goddamn it okay
a beat then rimgale himself enters
what they dont knock on your planet
rimgale takes in stephens room the half empty bourbon bottle
without a word rimgale walks over and pours it out
he sits down beside stephen
i still havent gotten your fire report stevie
a wave of pain rolls through stephen
im working on it
i deal with this stuff every day
but a fireman
you never get used to it
beat what happened up there
he was a candidate
did he pay attention
was he listening
he wasnt listening to the right thing
what do you listen to stephen
you dont know
stephens eyes meet rimgales and hold
it knows us
this one knows us
beat i need that report lt
stephen takes rimgales notebook out of his lap rips out a page and writes angrily in huge block letters
tim went to the fire and now he doesnt have a face
stephen throws the sheet at rimgale stands and walks out
an escher drawing of a place endlessly vast racks spun around an open central core
high up lost among its rows brian is going through rack after rack of dog eared record books as rimgale enters down below
trying to hold it together in his mind hey boss dekom trust is owned by pan illinois
which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics
which is a division of windy city ventures
whos partners are
beat alan seagrave donald cosgrove and jeffrey holcomb
son of a bitch
they knew each other
acres of paper
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants
coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate
they werent very high on seagrave either
nice bunch of guys
who all ended up wearing candles for faces
beat swayzaks up to his ass in this somehow
guy can barely hold a drink in his hand hes so scared
a beat then he looks directly at brian
we need to get a look at his files
sequence omitted from original script
with glowing skyscrapers leaping up in the background its an unexpectedly quiet serene place along the lake
jennifer sits alone at a bench watching an ancient fisherman look for dinner as brian walks up
we still talking
beat look im sorry about the other day swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered
i want to know why he keeps that hidden
i dont know anything about it
you could check
itd be in his files
beat do you know what youre asking me to do
yknow four years ago i was working in a bakery
two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he didnt even know my name
i run that office now
marty believed in me and i believe in him
you want me to just throw that away
your boss is lying jennifer
and it hangs between them two people lonely on the edge of the lake
sequence omitted from original script
at a workbench under a single lamp stephen stands amongst a confusion of tools wire and a wall socket
with a pair of pliers he tugs at something within the socket puts the face plate back on and screws it down
he stares at it and we feel the sudden wave of hopelessness cascading through him
he sets the socket back down and scatters everything aside in a single furious move
sequence omitted from original script
stephens sits quietly against helens back door lost in himself
a light comes on
helen opens the back door
she sits down beside him
beat it used to be when i was a kid what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs
life and death right and wrong
when someone called the fire department we came
those guys dont know how much i love them
you dont leave people hanging
cause thats what its all about
its till death do us part
isnt that what you heard
its you go we go
cause without that its the end of families its the end of the fire department
and when the fire department stops coming
thats the end of the fucking world
beat im sorry i came helen its just
its just theres nobody i can talk to
beat i miss you
the moment lingers grows heavy and grey
stephen and helen in bed holding each other
morning and stephen dressed making eggs for three
seans there lending a hand beaming as stephen tries to show him how to flip an egg
helen enters in her robe
he kisses her
cook and i are almost finished here
have a seat
can i talk to you a second
stephen musses his sons hair and follows her out into the hall
look im sorry i no thats okay
its just sean
hes gettin good on those eggs
and yknow he told me he actually likes the piano
i dont want to confuse him stephen
the blows so long and hard and deep you dont even see it
its just things have changed
youre the same stephen but things are different now
youve got a son
youre the best at what you do stephen you always were but you scare me now
just then sean sticks his head into it
to sean hey
sean man your dad blew it
i forgot i had to work this morning
aw dad cmon
next time huh
well do it up big
helens turned away
then sotto moms crying dad
jennifer enters swayzaks inner office
his chairs turned away toward the window
holding print out latest polls came in marty
he doesnt answer marty
finally the chair turns revealing a haunted man
polls are far from his mind
jesus christ marty whats going on
leave me alone
she sees a fire department file on the murders open on his desk
weve come a long way together marty
ive staked my whole career on you
and now youre sneaking around this office leaking things to the papers behind my back
beat is there something youre not telling me about these deaths
swayzaks eyes are dead metal
and he turns his chair around again
jennifer stands there a beat
then turns to the filing cabinets
brian drives up and parks
hes half way to the staircase when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car
she hands him a manila envelope
what is just take it
thats a dumb thing to say
she starts her car
a cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on jacks
rimgales sedans there the repairman shaking his head in amazement at the undercarriage
what the hell do you do with this thing
rimgales looking through the report brians handed him
this is the copy of swayzaks manning report that was released
everybody on this job knows its bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers
theyre all airtight
he dumps three more reports on rimgale
ive got three different drafts of the same report with different numbers thatre all over the place
looks like they were just making it up as they went along
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report
they did exactly one job swayzaks manpower study
its not even really a company
no employees no directors just a po box
then who wrote the report
it had to be someone who knows numbers
some kind of fancy accountant
but whats the connection
brian hands him something else
swayzak and the other three posing on a fishing boat
time of their lives
i think its time mr
swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk
the red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home
rimgale and brian walk up and knock on the door it creaks open ajar
they push the door open slowly
its dark as they enter
brian and rimgale split up down different halls
its the hiss brian hears first
then the flash of an electrical socket flaring ice cold cobalt blue
suddenly the rooms dimensions are there in frantic strobing shadows
chairs a couch and a figure that jumps brian
the light from the burning plug is a fierce strobe as the figure a confused shadow crashes brian to the floor
the figure grabs brians throat
brian pushes him back against the burning wall plug
the figure shrieks in pain gets his hand on a crowbar and slams brian who crumples dazed
the figure stands just as rimgale tackles him
the figure crashes across a gas space heater snapping the connection off
the figure slams rimgale hard with the crowbar squirms free and stumbles out the door
rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the wall
a baby backdraft wagging its tail
he goes to a dazed brians side lifting him by his armpits and helping him outside
the ruptured space heater pumps gas furiously
rimgale sees that
he also sees a bedroom door ajar on the far side of the house
and through the door a couch
and on the couch a body
rimgale rushes back inside
its swayzak unconscious
rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside brian just as the gas whumps and the doors and windows explode in a howling fireball the shrapnel blowing rimgale off his
brian slowly shakes his head clear
he looks around tries to orient himself
i sorta got a problem here
brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where rimgale lies at a weird angle a piece of wrought iron fence punched through his shoulder
rimgale lies in an emergency room bed
well brian i guess you can say its arson now
how ya feeling
did you pull me out
did i say thanks
i hate hospitals
so goddamn useless
rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger
he kicks it over and over with frustration till something finally snaps off
brian waits lets him vent his frustration
so what do you want me to do
ive been lying here hours
beat were not looking in the right place brian
this one knows us and were not looking in the right place
brians sitting alone in a chair
finally the opposite door opens and in enters ronald
come all this way just to say hi
brian hands him a stack of murder files
but i cant get who it is
so you came to me
smiles well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
as ronald starts to read the files brian still sitting there
watching ronald devour the statistics
the photos of charred bodies
ronald finishes leans back
okay heres the deal
ill tell you a story you tell me one
whos doing this
your first question should be who isnt
it isnt a spark brian
not enough damage
and an insurance pro
wheres the profit margin
then who no no your turn
tell me a story
i dont have a story
sure you do
ronald drops on the table a dog eared copy of that life magazine with brian on the cover
famous story even
just an engine and truck first on scene
what did you feel brian when you first got there
you gotta tell a story too brian
cmon dont think too hard i
i thought it was great
i loved it
it was nothing to these guys
light smoke low roll
couplea civilians hollering medium deal
so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across
what were you feeling brian
brian doesnt answer cmon you promised
brian just stares okay
i wanted to be him
right then i wanted to be him more than anything
smiles very good brian
about your report here
the way to a torchs heart is through his tools
thats how you know him
its the way he talks to the fire
and to you if you listen
thats a probie answer
youre smarter than that brian
so our two heroes adcox and mccaffrey they go back inside
only theres another fire in there nobody sees
and it took your dad didnt it brian
did you see him burn
in a flash brian suddenly reaches across and grabs ronald by the collar
who the fuck is doing this
after it took your dad
did it look at you brian
did it talk to you
and ronald sees something in brians eyes
you see our worlds arent so different
brian releases ronald
quiet whos doing this
the arsonist smiles a creepy horrible grin
who doesnt love fire but knows it better than anyone else
whos around trychticholorate hours a day
a cold shock rolls through brian as he slumps back in his chair
oh jesus christ
not such a far walk after all is it brian
brian climbs up onto stephens boat
he opens the cabin door goes inside and hits the lights
theres cereal bowls in the sink beer bottles on the table and a stack of fire department supplies in the corner
his whole body aching with reluctance brian begins looking through them
solvents armorall a small specialty can of fire dept
theres a label of ingredients on it
way down at the bottom is trychticholorate
nausea wracks its way through brian
oh goddamn it stephen
brian spins around in stone shock as stephen comes into the cabin
hey what are you doing here
just wanted to say hello
brian backs away from the chemicals
well long as youre here you can help clean up a little
ive got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes
youre selling dads boat
yeah its just another memory in my life right now
and i got way too many of them
i really should get back

he kicks the bulkhead wall
its okay stephen i i tried yknow
i dont have all the answers but goddamn it ive got some
beat look youre gonna do what you have to and maybe i shouldnt have gotten in the way
im your brother not your father

brian turns to leave
i saw it
when dad died i saw another fire
i saw it before it got them
i tried to yell but
he asked me to look out for him
and i didnt do it
i let him die
stunned jesus you been carrying that around for twenty years
for christs sake you were seven years old
you think he could have heard you in there
i hate him so much sometimes stephen
you dont know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
maybe i do
sighs what a fuckin mess huh
beat people can change brian
sometimes right when youre looking at them
brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something freezes up inside
stephen catches the look and theres horrible silence between them
oh god stephen whats going on with you
i dont know brian
i dont know
brian stands before the fire station
his brothers and his
brian pries the lock off stephens locker
starts looking through it
adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on starts shaving in a mirror
he doesnt notice brian
adcox turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little
and brians universe caves in
an icy claw tears out his stomach
gulping breaths he forces himself to look at adcoxs back
on it is a small rectangular burn
its fresh and its the size of a wall socket
at that moment adcox turns
the two of them stare at one another just a beat then adcox walks past him
just then the alarm bells ring
brian hesitates a beat confused then turns and runs down to where firemen are scurrying around suiting up
brian looks frantically for stephen sees him out back
breathless stephen wait a minute
i gotta talk to you
its adcox hes what are you doing here
i saw adcoxs back
i saw the burn
i put it there
jesus christ stephen hes been killing people
how do you know
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals
looking for me
what were they doing there
they were for the fucking boat brian
grindles sticks his head out the back door
we gotta roll stevie

theyre waitin man
ill be there goddamn it
grindle goes back in
to brian anything else
what are we going to do about this
ill handle it
we gotta go to rimgale stephen
im his lt
hes my responsibility
ill handle it
stephen turns and walks toward the station
brians eyes go to a window just above it
there watching him watching the whole exchange between brothers is adcox
adcox stares at brian a beat then finally disappears as brian hears the cough of diesel engines
he starts running for the station
its too late
adcox climbs aboard just as the engine company pulls out and whistles down the street
the ladder company is just easing onto the drive
brian hesitates only an instant then runs to the equipment racks pulls off the hooks his helmet coat boots and jumps onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit
as it howls down the avenue stephen turns around and stares at adcox sitting behind
the glimmer of an understanding
the laddermen look confused seeing brian sitting among them
a car suddenly cuts the truck company off
the driver slams the brakes pushing the truck company into a horrible skid
the back fishtails the wheels jump the curb bash a mailbox and then the whole rig rolls onto its side and drags to a stop
its tangled confusion in the rear cab
firemen unhurt piled atop one another
brian slides his way out from under them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise six blocks away
he starts running
flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along the river as brian panting runs up
he searches frantically through the maze of arriving engine companies looking for number
there it is but nobodys home
brian stops a passing captain
where are they
on the roof
brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four stories above him feels the bile of fear in his throat the desperation and begins strapping on an air tank
brian now fully suited up climbs the endless rungs of an extended aerial ladder
tongues of flame rocket skyward through ragged holes
black clouds drift murderously roofing tars bubble and hiss as the roof itself groans like a comatose dinosaur reminding you the whole thing could go any minute and you with
trudging alone across this alien spongy surface brian looks for his company
its almost impossible to tell anyone apart faces hidden behind helmets and masks
suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and theres two firemen near the edge on their helmets
stephen the helmets look up
stephen and adcox
facing each other
adcox cradles an axe
brian starts to move beside stephen but adcox turns tightens his grip on the axe and now all the cards are on the table
a hissing black cloud drifts through
theyre the only three people on earth
adcoxs eyes are clouded with tears
aw man stephen listen to me
what the fuck were you thinking huh
youre a fireman
they were killing firemen man
when sally showed me what was in swayzaks files
they were my friends i had to do it
i had to do it for the department
did you do it for tim
pain to stephen that was an accident
jesus christ why did you have to go in there so fucking early
why didnt you listen to me
brian and stephen are backed up against the roof edge sixty feet up
far below a fireboat has begun pumping a massive stream at the side of the building
you gotta let me finish just come down john
just shut up
your dad would fucking puke if he saw how youve shit on his department
knock it off
to stephen you cant let him turn you against your friends man he killed people you know what swayzak would do to the department if this got out
stephen this is bullshit what he would do to your dads department
you gotta let me finish it and theres a horrible glimmer of confusion on stephens face
youre his lt
beat are you gonna handle it
are you stephen
what do you want me to do stephen
talk to me
what am i supposed to do
beat theres a fire
weve got a job here
lets get on with it
the rest of the crews are totally oblivious to whats happening through the smoke on the other side
grindle and santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them
clear the roof
everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as brian stephen and adcox react as the roof howls and groans and huge splits begin racing along it
and then it goes
the center section drops and in rolling waves of screeching steel the hole spreads outward devouring
adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole races for them swallowing roof
jesus christ brian run
run goddamn it
and brian balls out dashes for the edge
stephens made one corner brian desperately heads for another
at the last instant as the howling flame bellows up to his ankles brian leaps off the roof and falls half a story before crashing onto an exterior fire escape
flames have cut off the fire escape two floors below so brian climbs down as far as possible crawls onto a ledge kicks out a window steps through and falls
blackness and emptiness two stories of it before he crashes into a pool of water at the bottom
hes in a freight elevator shaft thrashing madly drowning
great sheets of water are pouring through an upper doorway and cascading down like monsoon rain
we see its coming from the fireboats rushing stream
the weight of his equipment is pulling brian underwater
struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water still pouring down brian unhooks his air tank
he leans back tries to float on the rising column of water
his coat catches on something yanks him underwater
he struggles feverishly finally tears the coat off
the building groans in earnest
flaming chunks of plaster crash down around brian forcing him to duck underwater
the place is coming apart
ten feet above one of the falling chunks smacks a gas main splitting then igniting it
a white hot jet of flame shoots from one side of the shaft to the other
brians floating okay hes floating right up into the flames
brian tries to flatten himself out to keep everything but his nose below water but hes still moving up the heat becoming so intense his face flares and hes ducking
under water now trying to stay alive trying to decide whether to drown or burn when theres a crash
and suddenly another door on the shaft is tearing open
theres a glint of an axe
brian has about two seconds left
in that time stephen sees the shut off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite
its unreachable a good twelve feet across a horizontal curtain of flame
before we can even assimilate that stephens already jumped
a crazy leap over the fire
he smacks the opposite wall hits the shut off and falls crashing into the pool beside brian
you crazy son of a bitch why couldnt you stay behind a desk where you belong
you never know till the fire stares you down if youre gonna be oh shut up huh
grimaces i think i broke my goddamn arm
brian helps him stay above water
the level continues to rise bringing them finally even with an open doorway they scramble through
it leads to a stairwell thats become a raging torrent of water spilling down it
they push through to the next doorway and out onto the place is full of hundreds of chemical drums
the fire has cracked its way into the room as wump drums begin exploding shooting upward roman candle fountains of glittering flame
brian helps stephen as they snake their way past sweating drums pressure valves hissing madly with desperation
they duck low round a corner and walk right into an axe handle that smacks brians throat knocking him gasping flat on his back
stephen jumps adcox and tackles him on the edge of a metal platform that extends out from the raised flooring
you stupid son of a bitch
what the fuck are you doing
adcox struggles against him heaving and sobbing
let it go
goddamn it let it go
and adcox releases the axe
im so sorry
brians on his feet now coming toward them when a chemical drum below explodes the shock wave buckling the platform and dropping it several feet before it holds
brian cut off is hit with a wall of debris
adcox and stephen are flung across the platform and through the shattered railing
stephen grabs a piece of broken dangling strut and hangs on with one hand
in his other hand is adcox
hanging below him his grip loosening
brians struggling to get out from under the debris
the railing stephens hanging onto is slick his hand slipping along it
but he wont let go of adcox
his eyes bore into his best friends with absolute conviction
you go we go
the towering shots of flame from below have begun to ignite adcoxs pant leg
hes starting to burn
but stephen wont let go
wont let go even as the flames crawl up adcoxs back
and stephens hand is slipping and slipping and then it isnt slipping anymore because its come off
adcox and stephen fall
theres a narrow catwalk half way down
stephen hits with a sickening crunch
adcox falls past it down into the flames
theres an exposed i beam running from the ruined platform out over the catwalk
brian climbs up onto it balances across over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his brother lies battered but still alive
youre gonna be all right man
brian looks down and across the factory floor
there coming through the doorway is pengelly and nightengale with a hoseline
they start for him when another drum explodes flattening them and launching their hoseline into a crazy thrashing arc
the flame has cut them off from the hose
stephen sees what brians thinking
wait for another hose team
but brians already moving for the catwalk ladder
wait for the goddamn hose team
brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and slides down to the factory floor
hes heading for the hoseline when wham
the fire cuts him off
not just any fire
that same one from so many years ago
dont fuck with me kid
im not in the mood
nightengales lost his helmet and its lying near the flames spinning slowly upside down just like his fathers
brian stands there paralyzed as the fire laughs at him
same old little kid with his finger up his ass
then something different comes into brians eyes
theres a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the pole
brian lifts it approaches the fire
you can practically hear the flames laugh at him
brian suddenly turns and slams the neck of the extinguisher against the pole breaking it off before heaving the cannister hissing into the flames where it explodes a cloud of
extinguisher powder that stuns the flames just long enough for brian to dash through and tackle the hose
the fire shakes off the powder rises up to kill just as brian spins and hits it with the stream
and its like a howling train wreck as the two grapple with each other pengelly and nightengale have an opening and theyre dashing for the catwalk ladder up to stephen
because the fire doesnt care it only has eyes for brian now and stephen sees brian tackle the monster and his eyes fill with tears and the fires pushing brian pushing him with the fury of a frightened street bully but brian wont give and now the fires backs broken its whimpering dying
and pengelly and nightengale have climbed up to stephen now pulling him away
thats my brother
thats my brother goddamn it
and the fires just a little gremlin now sighing sadly as brian steps up with the hoseline
another time friend
and whoosh its gone
brian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an ambulance
smiles weak you are such a pain in the ass
as brian jumps in with him paramedics swarm over stephen as the ambulance screams through the night
brians right there holding his hand
dont tell them about adcox
dont let em
im sorry i thought
his brother squeezes brians hand his eyes never leaving him
reading ekg oh shit give him some lidocaine now
beat whos your brother
stephens ekgs begun to falter
the other paramedic fires off an injection into his iv
his pressures fading push some adrenalin
the ekgs become erratic
stephens eyes never leave brians
oh man dont you die
dont you die
hes going south
hes gonna box damn it
they put an ambo bag over stephens face
the eyes never leave brians
goddamn it dont you die now
theyre breathing for him now
the ekg begins shrieking
the paramedics begin scrambling to load the defibrillator pads on stephens chest
but the firemans eyes never waver from brian
they look into his with complete conviction complete acceptance and then they dont
then fade up to a silent quiet street absolutely empty of traffic
then over the crest of chicagos mightiest thoroughfare creeps slowly a fire engine
its emergency lights are on but not the siren
this engine isnt in a hurry today
behind comes another fire engine
ten twenty all of them creeping slowly along
and behind the engines now walk firemen in their dress blues
hundreds of them
walking silently in step behind loaded in the rear of engine
santos drives as grindle brian and the men of ladder company walk behind
the silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed like dress swords
average people stop take their hats off
sequence omitted from original script
two coffins lying side by side draped in the blue and white of the chicago flag
a single fire helmet rests atop each casket
brian stands at attention beside helen
he holds the hand of stephens son sean his eyes clouded with tears as a fire dept
honor guard plays taps
jennifers there too far away to touch
rimgale still wearing a head bandage stands stiffly beside a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary
in the chicago fire department the alarm code signifies that the company has returned home to quarters
we will now ring out that code to welcome home john adcox and stephen mccaffrey
with a small hammer rimgale rings out on the bell
the honor guard folds the flag covering stephens casket and hands it to helen who holds it to her breast as we a sea of blue uniforms drifting across green
as the funeral breaks up
brian hugs helen and sean
lets them go
rimgales there resting against his dept
sedan as brian walks by pauses and leans on it beside him
your brother was a good man
another couple of good men get burned up for their city
is that how its going to read
brian doesnt answer youre the only one that knows
like it never happened
rimgale turns to walk back to his sedan
looks back to brian
want to help me with something
an elevator opens as brian and rimgale walk quickly out down a hall and burst into swayzaks office
the aldermans there giving a press conference from his desk
how ya doin
rimgale sits on swayzaks desk
im a little busy right now thisll only take a minute
theres two cops outside that want to ask you about this rimgale drops the manning report on swayzaks desk
this is just a guess of course but i think theyre gonna want to know why you secretly paid donald cosgrove jeffrey holcomb and alan seagrave to create a phony
to cameras you guysll wait right
the room explodes with questions
through the din brian leans over the desk very close to swayzak
see that glow flashing in the corner of your eye
thats your career dissipation light
and it just went into high gear
brian turns and pushes his way out
at the door he pauses and looks back at rimgale
the investigator nods and smiles just a little
as brian walks down it rimgale appears and calls to him
dont keep looking over your shoulder for the ghost
its gone now
and theres just a beat between the investigator and his probie before brian nods and walks away
brian walks down the hall
he passes jennifers small office
shes in there surrounded by packing boxes
i think your boss is going to need some spin control
i quit two days ago brian
beat whatll you do
i dont have the slightest idea
ill see ya around huh
its a small town
and morning breaking across the avenues and up against the tired brick of firehouse
brian sits staring into his locker lost in thought his equipment stacked up on the bench beside him
the alarm klaxon and firemen scurrying to their equipment on the apparatus floor
theyre climbing aboard their rigs now and the pumpers diesel is coughing to life
at the last moment as it begins to pull out brian comes sliding down the pole in his turn out gear bounces off the floor and climbs aboard as the
engine whistles away
theres a new fireman beside him on the bench
he cant get his coat buckled right
brian leans over does it for him
youre doing it wrong
