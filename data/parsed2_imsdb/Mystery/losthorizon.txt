written by robert previous hit riskin based on the novel by james hilton over the titles we see superimposed the snow capped mountains leading to shangri la
close up of an impressive looking book
the covers open and the pages turn
the first page reads in these days of wars and rumors of wars havent you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security where living was not
a struggle but a lasting delight
the second page reads of course you have
so has every man since time began
always the same dream
sometimes he calls it utopia sometimes the fountain of youth sometimes merely that little chicken farm
the third page reads one man had such a dream and saw it come true
he was robert conway englands man of the east soldier diplomat public hero the fourth page reads our story starts in the war torn chinese city of baskul where robert
conway has been sent to evacuate ninety white people before they are butchered in a local revolution
the fifth and final page reads baskul the night of march
the field is aflare with floodlights on one side is an office building on the other are hangars
the whole field is filled with chinese refugees running around wildly
an army transport is in front of the office building motors going
showing in the distance probably several miles away the effect of a burning city which is baskul
over the shot we hear the steady boom boom of gunfire
in the f
we see the silhouetted figures of chinese running away from baskul and toward the camera their personal packs on their backs
toward office building
conway comes out of the building followed by a small group of white people with frightened faces
they have to fight their way through a horde of milling chinese
as conway and group finally reach the plane where conway forces the white people in
in this he is aided by his brother george a young and vigorous englishman
the pilot sticks his head out of the cockpit
conway we cant take more than seven
conway pulls a passenger out and gives the pilot a signal to start
to passenger all right
there will be another plane in a minute
all right go on
motors roar and the plane starts to move scattering those of the chinese who were unfortunately too close to the ship
conway and george rush back into the office building
there are about thirty white refugees men women and several children
they all lift their panicky faces to conway and george as they enter
a barrage of questions are flung at them
are there any more planes
do you think the bandits will come here
please take my wife next mr
there are plenty of planes coming
now everybody have patience
everything will be all right
he crosses to a back room
you have nothing to worry about
leave everything to my brother
as conway enters to speak to operator
yes sir with seven passengers aboard
get me shanghai
im talking to them now sir
into mike conway speaking
is colonel marsh there
right here conway
as conway continues into mike
colonel i need more planes
ive still about twenty people to get out
where are those planes you promised us
we sent everything we could find conway
they better get here soon or i cant be responsible as george rushes in
i think i hear motors
listening then into mike colonel wait a minute they may be here now
to george say george get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here
he starts for the door
and be sure that none of the natives get in
thanks and take care of that liver of yours
oh ho my word
as conway enters
all right get ready everybody
the planes are here
the people crowd around him pleading for priority
one at a time
where are they
come on now and stand over here
a woman pushes some children forward
wheres the mother
standing nearby theyre orphans mr
directing people aside pulling out an old lady well you come right over here and you and you looking off scene come on what about us mr
gentlemen please wait your turn
a girl slouched in a corner
we meet gloria stone a surly wan looking prostitute
youd better take some of those squealing men with you first
they might faint on you
something of a smile crosses his face
just as you say
just then a terrific explosion is heard in the distance
all the lights go out
everybody starts screaming
dont lose your heads now ill see what it is
he dashes out
conway rushing out meets george coming back
the power house theyve blown it up
the planes cant land without lights
thinking fast come on
well burn the hangar
that will make light for them
he grabs a lantern and dashes off
as they run through the screaming mob toward the hangar
it is filled with chinese refugees clinging to their household goods
conway and george enter
conway speaks to them in chinese ordering them out
some hesitate and they have to push the terror stricken waiting coolies out
when they have all left conway opens the spigots of several gasoline tanks waits for the fuel to spill on the ground then tosses a lantern on the fuel igniting
at the same moment he and george dash for the door
conway and george rush out of hangar
when they are at a fairly safe distance the building bursts into flames
against a background of the burning hangar a plane is just leaving the ground as another one is landing
of conway signalling
all right go ahead
to george we go on to the next plane
bring out any people that are left
shooting toward the burning city of baskul in the distance
we see the bandits coming flashing bayonets in pursuit of screaming refugees
conway emerges followed by gloria and an american barnard
camera follows them to the ship just as the pilot fenner is climbing down from cockpit
broad grin hello conway
having a little trouble
you never mind me
get this gadget off the ground
george is pushing off chinese
bob these are all that are left
to george come on
when conway and others approach george helps gloria stone up while conway faces the mob punching at those who try to wedge their way forward
finally one of them manages to get his foot on the step and conway pushes him violently
who staggers back and falls sprawling
as he hits the ground he yells you cant leave me here you blighter
im a british subject
we meet alexander p
conway looks his surprise and lifts him off the ground
glaring off toward conway picks up a board and starts toward conway
george emerges in time to see the chinese lift the board and about to clout conway on the head
george moves quickly puts out his left hand wards off the blow and with his right he punches the chinese who reels out of the scene
look out bob
a shadowy figure materializes in the cockpit and clubs fenner from behind
he shoves fenner aside and takes his place
conway pushes george up and starts to mount himself
he looks off and what he sees startles him
yells off all right fenner
of what conway sees
several trucks loaded with bandits in makeshift uniforms come tearing up the road come to a stop
some fire toward plane others are setting up machine guns
droves of refugees scramble to cover
already present are barnard an american gloria stone the prostitute and lovett whom we saw dressed as a chinese
conway slams the door shut looks off then cries get down on the floor everybody
go ahead fenner
they all fall on their faces
fenner lets go
of the new pilot setting the controls and lifting the plane into flight
as the plane swings around taxies crazily and leaves the ground accompanied by gunfire of the bandits
the occupants are still on the floor
conway rises and glances out of a window warily
mumbling well i guess were out of range
to others everybody all right
there are murmurs of yes im all right as they raise themselves
that was close
conway starts for the back seat and suddenly sees lovett
where did you come from
im alexander p
why arent you registered through our office
chiming in it would serve you right if you were left behind
high pitched voice how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head
a grave injustice right over my head
oh my word
i tell you those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction
i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape
where were you hiding
hunting i was in the interior hunting fossils
this morning i looked up suddenly i know and a war broke out right over your head
the next time youre in wild country like this keep in touch with the british consul
aha very good freshie
youd better put his name on the list and make out a report later
he proceeds to the back seat
barnard the american who is in front of lovett leans over toward him
barnard and lovett
i beg your pardon brother
what did you say you were hunting
im a paleontologist
blankly a what
oh i see
lovett produces a small box clutched under his arm
i have here a discovery that will startle the world
its the vertebrae from the lumbar of a megatherium found in asia
well what do you know about that
found in asia
when i get home i shall probably be knighted for it
you dont say
do you mind if i take a look at it
proudly not at all
he lifts the lid and barnard peeks inside
wrapped carefully in absorbent cotton is something that resembles a dry chicken bone
barnard reaches for the box but lovett pulls it away from him
this is the only thing i was able to save when those heathens surrounded me
he is allowed to take it out and examine it unimpressed uh huh
you see from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton
wait a minute you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium found in asia
yeah i remember
you said that before
sir henry derwent was knighted and he never got beyond the mesozoic era
barnard stares at lovett unbelievingly
ah poor fellow
lovett glares at him resentfully and snaps the lid shut on his box
yes it just shows taking offense i dont know why im talking to you
i dont know you
who are you
turns away okay brother
dont call me brother
chuckles to himself no offense
gloria sits slumped in her seat looking glumly out
barnard glances at her curiously
finally he makes a friendly overture
gloria turns her head surveys barnard coldly and without responding turns back
i say will you have a cigarette
unabashed say youre an american arent you
irascibly say listen will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates
let me alone
he shrugs his shoulders and slides back into his seat
all is silent for a moment
conway is writing on a small pad which he rests on an uplifted knee
george is rummaging through a closet rear of the cabin
conway still writes undisturbed
george reaches into the closet and emerges with a bottle of whiskey
his face lights up
holds up bottle hello
look what i found
he crosses to conway
just what i needed too
looks up smiling you
just this once bob
i feel like celebrating
just think of it bob a cruiser sent to shanghai just to take you back to england
you know what it means
hands him cup here you are
dont bother about those cables now
i want you to drink with me
holds his cup up gentlemen i give you robert conway englands new foreign secretary
conway watches him amused
george gulps down his drink
after a slight hesitation downing his drink hurray
how im going to bask in reflected glory
dreamily people are going to point to me and say there goes george conway brother of the foreign secretary
dont talk nonsense
give me the bottle
conway takes the bottle from him and pours himself a second drink
thats why theyre sending for you bob
with all these foreign entanglements it was bound to happen
they need you
conway with a poured drink in hand laughs
all right you can laugh if you want to
but who else can they get
who else is there in all of england half the fighter half the diplomat who
has half your knowledge of the foreign situation
they cant stop you now bob
conway moodily pours himself a third
he downs the drink as we we find conway asleep in his seat his head on his hands
george approaches and tenderly spreads a jacket over his shoulders
conway stirs opens an eye
drunkenly hello freshie
did you make that report out yet
did you say we saved ninety white people
hurray for us
did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated
no you wouldnt say that
they dont count
youd better try to get some sleep bob
just you wait until im foreign secretary
cant you just see me freshie with all those other shrewd little foreign secretaries
confidentially screws up face you see the trick is to see who can out talk the other
everybody wants something for nothing and if you cant get it with smooth talk you send an army in
im going to fool them freshie
im not going to have an army
im going to disband mine
im going to sink my battleships im going to destroy every piece of warcraft
then when the enemy approaches well say come in gentlemen what can we do for you
so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think
and what will they think freshie
theyll think to themselves somethings wrong here
weve been duped
this is not according to form
these people seem to be quite friendly and why should we shoot them
then theyll lay down their arms
you see how simple the whole thing is
centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants pause drily and ill be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum
he starts to pour himself another drink
youd better not drink any more bob
youre not talking sense
conway downs the drink and then chuckles cynically
dont worry george
nothings going to happen
ill fall right into line
ill be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be
ill be the best little foreign secretary we ever had just because i havent the nerve to be anything else
do try to sleep bob
oh sure freshie
good thing sleep
he grunts and squirms
george tucks him in
did you ever notice the sunrise in china george
ah you should
he gets settled
george relaxes and leaning back shuts his eyes
it is quiet
all are asleep
camera moves forward slowly until it reaches the glass panel leading to the cockpit
the pilots face turns
instead of fenner we see a strange mongolian face with sharp piercing eyes
a half smile plays across his mouth
flying at high speed against a moonlit sky
we stay on the shot until it vanishes a mere speck over the horizon
the morning sun peeks over a mountain top
from the same direction as if arriving with the sun the ship looms up and comes roaring toward us
all are asleep except lovett who fidgets on his seat
then barnard stirs opens his eyes and stretches
as he does so he sees that lovett is awake
good morning lovey
i beg your pardon
i say good morning lovey
good morning catches himself look here young man
i didnt care for sister last night and i dont like lovey this morning
my name is lovett alexander p
well its a good morning anyway
im never conversational before i coffee
barnard glances out of the window looks around outside thoughtfully
wait a minute
is it a good morning
say were supposed to be travelling east arent we
why of course
well it looks to me as if were travelling west
it certainly is
look here any child knows how to tell direction
i dont care where the child is in the air on the earth or in the sea
if you face the rising sun your right hand is the north and your left hand is the south i always get it twisted because im left handed
well you just reverse it
your left hand is tries to explain gets confused and irritated what difference does it make what hand you are
the north is the north
all i know is the sun rises in the east and were going away from it
now youre irritating and absurd
as he sulks by himself looks around locates the sun in back of him smiles satisfied hes right throws a condescending glance over at barnard then suddenly his face clouds
the whole thing dawns on him
jumps up shrieking oh my word of course yes
boy were travelling in the wrong direction
were going in the wrong direction
conway is still asleep
concerned for conway couldnt you arrange to make a little less noise
i tell you were going west and shanghai is east of here
fenners the best pilot in china
he knows what hes doing
not quite reassured its fenner
he might have lost his way
thats what i told them last night
you cant expect a man to sail around in the dark
during this george has been looking around he rises
all right all right
ill talk to fenner
he crosses to panel leading to cockpit camera following him
when he gets there he knocks on the window
i i say george knocks again
from the cockpit side the small shade suddenly snaps up and george finds himself staring into the face of the mysterious pilot
he takes an instinctive step backward
the pilot turns his head
camera angle widens as george keeps backing up until he gets to conway
george turns to conway and shakes his shoulder
conway stirs in his sleep slowly opens his eyes yawns and stretches
throughout it george speaks
it isnt fenner in the cockpit
conway looks at him glances off toward the others and back at george
dismissing him with a gesture oh stop it
the bloke up there looks a chinese or a mongolian or something
were nowhere near shanghai
were going in the opposite direction
this interests conway and he looks out of the window
were over the desert
then rising he crosses to cockpit
the others watch him expectantly
conway pounds on the panel
the face of the pilot appears in sight
conway tries to ask him something in chinese
the pilot glares at them for a second then a gun is shoved out at them
instinctively they back away
not being funny nice puss to meet in a dark alley
the ship lurches and they are thrown off balance
the panel has been snapped shut
well thats that i guess
wonder whats happened to fenner
and who is he
howd he get there
do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots
thats not possible
if we had landed we all would have been awakened
we never left the air
i know i didnt sleep the whole night long
with finality that fellow got on at baskul
whats he doing
wheres he taking us
he may be a maniac for all we know
george who has disappeared during the above now returns with a monkey wrench in his hand
conway stops him
george what are you going to do
im going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is
what if he refuses
well smash his face in
thats what well do
a sweeping gesture can anyone here fly a plane
there is a general chorus of nonot i etc
takes wrench from georges hand well george thats no good
conway throws the monkey wrench into a corner
i guess were in for it
in for what
i dont know
he must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from fenner
starts for his seat when he lands well find out
you mean to tell me youre not going to do anything until we land
what do you suggest
why you you look here he may dash us to pieces
it might afford you a great deal of relief
sitting now gentlemen im going back to sleep
oh and i was having such a peaceful dream
curling up as soon as he lands let me know
he shuts his eyes and leans back
the others watch him for a second and wander back to their seats
gloria is apparently indifferent to their predicament
as barnard watches her a little bitter smile plays around her mouth
he stares out of the window and is suddenly startled
of the plane with its nose turned downward in a sharp descent
george is on his feet
excited were heading down
were going to land
everyone looks out
george rushes to conway and nudges him
breathlessly bob were landing
pointing out bob were coming to a village
conway sits up and looks out
plane starting toward ground
all we can see are mountain tops
they all stare out of the windows
conway peers intently
from angle in cabin of plane
through the window directly below we see a large open space at the foot of the hills
the plane is headed for it
we see a swarm of strange looking natives scantily attired but bearing bayonets running toward the plane
of george and conway as the ship hits the ground bouncing and swaying perilously
as the plane taxies across the uninhabited space
conway and george ready to get out
as conway turns to open the door he looks off and is startled by something he sees
george follows his gaze and a bewildered expression comes into his eyes too
shooting through door
the strange looking natives have surrounded the plane and are closing in
conway and george both instinctively wheel around toward the opposite side
but from that direction too a horde of natives dash toward them
conway hesitates a second and like a flash springs for the door
but he stops again as he opens the door
to include door of plane
conway finds himself staring into the threatening mouths of half a dozen rifles and quickly shuts the door
what are these people
i dont know
i cant get the dialect
we see the pilot and several natives in single file as they come toward the plane buckets in hand
one of them lowers a bucket into a well in the ground
look theyre loading up with gasoline
the gas is being loaded
natives on horseback dash back and forth shouting and signalling
camels can be glimpsed among the horses
there is tremendous disorder and commotion
the ship leaves the ground
the natives stand around curiously watching
conway is pacing
the occupants sit by their open windows
imagine having all that fuel there waiting for us
he sits down george something tells me our journey is just beginning
where are we going
pointing if you ask me were heading straight for those mountains
we see the plane against the sky
in the b
there is nothing but snow covered mountains
insert a sign reading shanghai municipal airport
a chinese officer is on the phone
a douglas plane from baskul with conway and four others aboard are missing
unreported between here and baskul
quick shots of a switchboard operator besieged by calls
a telegraph secretary furiously typing
newspapers being run off a press
of a high official of the british foreign office
holding forth to his secretary make it very emphatic that his majestys government will hold the chinese government and all chinese governors of chinese provinces responsible for the complete safety
of robert conway
the camera pulls back to reveal other foreign department officials and functionaries arriving in the midst of his speech
good morning gentlemen
ad libbing good morning etc
no news yet sir
the plane couldnt disappear into thin air
turning to secretary of the group and cable lord gainsford at shanghai
leave no stone unturned to find conway
turning back to foreign officials and robertson
better get a postponement of the far east conference
we cant afford to meet those nations without conway
the occupants are hunched up in the corner of their seats
what little clothes they have and what few blankets are bundled around them
all the windows are shut
registering a height of feet
there is silence for a moment before barnard speaks
it cant be kidnapping
they wouldnt be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip
no sense to it
no one responds to his speculation and he lapses into silence
to include george conway and lovett
what do you make of it bob
you must have some idea
i give it up
but this not knowing where youre going is exciting anyway
conway for a man who is supposed to be a leader your do nothing attitude is very disappointing
what do you want him to do
i dont know
im a paleontologist not a foreign secretary
lovett slips back into his corner and pulls his coat over his face
registering above feet
we stay on it as it climbs and climbs to feet
showing the plane high over mountain peaks
against a moonlit sky we see a lone speck the plane as it flies high above the mountains
it appears to be traveling through endless space
the atmosphere is pervaded with a feeling of utter futility
the occupants are still slumped in the corners of their seats
gloria has a fit of coughing
she grabs her throat as she gasps for breath
barnard himself feeble and exhausted glances over at her sympathetically
including lovett george and conway
lovett sits with his chin helplessly on his chest his mouth ludicrously open his eyes popping
george his teeth clenched struggles against a desire to sob
conway looks at him feelingly
conways eyes never leave george who finally unable to control himself emits a sob and rather ashamed slaps his hand over his mouth and turns away
oh george come on
suddenly tensely its not knowing thats so awful bob
not knowing where youre going or why or whats waiting when you get there
george with an effort stifles another outbreak
we got above that storm
at feet and while we stay on it keeps mounting
gloria has her hands to her ears rocking in pain
suddenly her voice rents the air
i cant stand it any longer
she jumps up and moves about frantically
screaming take us down
i cant stand this pain any longer
let me out of here i say
i cant stand it any longer
she runs to one of the ships doors and pounds on it with her fist then tries to shove it open
a blast of frigid air throws her back
george and conway manage to pry her off and pull her away
sobbing pitifully she lets conway steer her back to her seat where she bundles up in torturous pain
for a moment nothing is heard but her stifled moans
take it easy sister
unexpectedly the cockpit panel opens and the pilot tosses something out in glorias direction
grabbing for it its oxygen
he rigs it up for her now take it with your teeth
thats right bite
struggling let me alone
come on now
she resumes her sobbing quietly
of the plane at twilight fading into deepest night
of the cabin at night everyone frozen in despair
all of a sudden there is a loud sputtering noise from the outside
they all react listen for a moment until the noise dies completely
now nothing is heard not even the motor
breaking the silence whats that
immediately on his feet he must have run out of fuel
look down there
the plane gradually tilting downward
the ship sways several seconds and finally rights itself
of what they see from plane
vast snow covered mountain peaks with no sign of a stretch big enough to land
the plane sways perilously in the cross wind
they are all silent waiting prayerfully
conway turns to the others his voice electric with authority
george everybody better get back towards the tail
he may nose her over
into the corner quick
george cushions blankets
they obey his command
we see the plane nearing the ground sailing over some smaller hills
with conway in front of them the others are crouching in the corner
there are ad libs of fearful assurances while they hand around cushions and blankets
just as the ship hits the ground for the first time
the occupants brace themselves for the jolt
the ship hits and bounces several times and finally stops
its nose seems to bury itself in the ground
the people are lifted high into the air where they remain suspended for a few seconds terror stricken
then accompanied by grinding crackling sounds the ship flops back and falls on its side
for a moment there is stark silence while the people do not stir
a look of relief spreads over their faces
everybody all right
the passengers offer dazed replies okay yeah i think so
meanwhile conway has opened the door
a swirling mass of snow greets them so that they have to force their way out
george and conway fight their way down from the plane in the blinding snow
george quickly runs around to the other side
conway crosses to the cockpit and clambers aboard
lit only by the dashboard light
conway sticks his head in from the outside
his eyes which have been flashing with determination suddenly sober
camera pans over to pilot who is slumped over his chin resting on his chest
george pops into view on the opposite side just as conway has found the pilots gun beside him on the seat
what is it
has he fainted
it looks like it
sniffing smell those fumes
conway hops up beside the pilot
george follows suit
handing gun to george here george take the gun
hold the lights
im going to search him before he comes to
while searching we might find something interesting
finds something hello whats this
hands it to george he resumes his search enthusiastically
suddenly he stops
the utter limpness of the pilots body gives him pause
he lifts up his chin stares into his face pulls up his eyelid and then places a hand over his heart
he turns slowly toward george who has been watching his brother intently
george stares unbelievingly
it must have happened the moment he hit the ground
a pause lets take a look at this map
conway holds the map under the dashboard light
he studies it painstakingly and his tense expression changes to one of deep concern
georges eyes are glued on him
what is it
see that spot
thats where we were this morning
he had it marked
right on the border of tibet
heres where civilization ends
we must be a thousand miles beyond it just a blank on the map
afraid to ask whats it mean
it means were in unexplored country country nobody ever reached
george stares at him wide eyed the gravity of their situation slowly penetrating his terrorized mind
conways thoughts are interrupted by a knock on the panel and he looks up
we see the faces of barnard and the others
we hear their voices inquiring hey conway whats happening
where are we
whatd you find out
conway turns to george
george our chances of getting out of this are pretty slim
but its up to us
a nod toward cabin we cant have three hysterical people on our hands
he enters the cabin through the cockpit
as conway enters he is met by a volley of questions
what do you say
whatd you find out
interrupting cheerily everythings all right
the pilot wont trouble us any more
hes hes dead
this is met by a series of exclamations
how did it happen
probably a heart attack
what are we going to do
well theres nothing we can do until the morning
taking in george as he enters from cockpit
his terror stricken eyes look dully before him
he stops in the doorway
the storm will probably die down by then
my suggestion is that we better all try and get a good nights rest
over the shoulders of gloria barnard and lovett as they face conway who sits down
fiercely why dont you tell them the truth
they all wheel around and face george
why dont you tell them were a million miles from civilization without a chance of getting out of here alive
its slow starvation thats what it is
its a slow horrible death
when the significance of this outburst finally sinks into the chaotic minds of his listeners they turn to conway hopefully certain he will refute it
but conway looks beyond them at george
from his noncommittal silence they realize that georges statement is the truth
they slip into their seats
the place is heavy with a fatalistic silence
george slowly crosses to his seat near conway avoiding his accusing eyes
suddenly the air is rent with harsh bitter laughter from gloria
they all look up
well thats perfect
what a kick im going to get out of this
she emits another outburst of semi hysterical laughter
the bitterness of a lifetime in her voice
grimly satisfied a year ago a doctor gave me six months to live
that was a year ago
im already six months to the good
im on velvet
i havent got a thing to lose semi hysterical but you
you the noble animals of the human race what a kick im going to get out of watching you squirm for a change
her voice cracks completely what a kick
she flops into her seat and buries her head in her hands
for quite a while all we hear are her stifled sobs
george throws sidelong glances at his brother feeling his guilt
shooting from front of plane taking in entire cabin
the only sound that comes in on the tragic quiet is the low moaning of the wind outside
a feeling of doom has descended upon the five people
shooting toward the mountains which seem to imprison the valley below
the snowstorm treacherous in its fury seems to threaten the valley with complete obliteration
of the plane tilted over on its side
it is fully covered with snow
camera pans up to lovett and barnard shivering in their blankets as they pace worriedly
george and conway are missing
lovett turns from the window
theyve been gone for three hours
the others appear disinterested in this observation
left us here to rot
thats what theyve done
heroes of the newspapers
all right all right
lovett sees something through the window
george and conway are seen walking briskly toward the plane their few clothes a scant protection against the biting wind
here they come
the others quickly glance up just as conway and george clamber aboard
conway has a serious mien but george is full of vigor and enthusiasm
he holds out his hat which he has been carrying bottom side up
well we found some food
barnard and lovett rush to him
no chance of our starving now
when they see the contents of his hat their faces fall
what is it
its good too
here have some
ive read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff
they grab handfuls
he goes on listen my brother and i have worked out a plan
if we use our heads we should be able to keep alive for weeks until he gets back
wheres he going
he doesnt know
but hes starting out right away in the direction of india
sooner or later hes bound to run into somebody a tribe or something
throughout the previous scene he has been busily occupied making preparations
out of the baggage hold he has brought some blankets and rope and has been wrapping his feet in them
as george speaks he looks up and smiles
now heres the idea
we found a cave over by that small hill
after we bury the pilot were moving in
we can have a fire there
i shouldnt be surprised to see bob back within a week
conways smile dies on his face
we get a feeling he is attempting a futile journey and is fully aware of it
he resumes the roping of his feet his movements mechanical
barnard and lovett all attention as george speaks
gloria off to one side has her eyes peeled on conway intently
you havent got a chinamans chance of getting out of this country alive and you know it
conway stares at her blankly
pointing over by that hill
barnard peers out the plane window
they all look up and glance out
from their angle
in the distance just appearing over the top of a hill we see a caravan of natives approaching
they are not close enough to distinguish who or what they are but that they are human beings is apparent
conway takes in the unbelievable sight
we hear the exultant exclamations of the others
barnard and lovett start out of the plane
looking around where are they
do you see them
do you think theyre cannibals
where george lovett and barnard wait a trifle awe stricken
conway joins them
gloria has stayed inside
the approach of the caravan from the viewpoint of the group
it comprises some twenty tibetans attired in sheepskins fur hats and boots
somewhere in the middle of the single file is chang an elderly chinese
chang steps forward as their leader
as conway leaves his group and meets the oncoming party
he approaches chang and bowing courteously greets him in chinese
chang turns his head slowly and speaks in perfect oxfordian english
i am from a nearby lamasery
holding out his hand my name is chang
george barnard and lovett
why hes speaking english
shaking hands and mines conway
how do you do
youve no idea sir how unexpected and very welcome you are
my friends and i and the lady in the plane left baskul night before last for shanghai but we suddenly found ourselves travelling in the opposite direction at the mercy
of a mad pilot
wed be eternally grateful if you interrupting where is your mad pilot
he must have had a heart attack or perhaps the fumes
when the plane landed he was dead
we were just going to bury him when you came along
preoccupied pardon me chang turns to some of his men and issues an order in a foreign tongue obviously instructions to take care of the pilot
when chang is through so if you will be good enough to direct us to your lamasery favoring chang
i shall consider it an honor to accompany you and your friends
he issues a command to his men and turns to conway
you will need suitable clothes for the journey
it is not particularly far but quite difficult
several men have hopped into the scene while he has been speaking
they come forward with boots sheepskins fur caps etc
as they start to get into these new clothes as the caravan starts its journey back up the hill
all five people are now attired in their newly acquired outfit
showing the party on various stages of what looks like a humanly impossible journey
we see them first climbing then across long vastnesses of flat land
each succeeding time we see them their feet drag more wearily
their breathing becomes more difficult
these pictures finally halfway up a mountainside
the procession is just starting around a hairpin curve
they are forced to travel on a narrow ledge overlooking a deep ravine
as they cling against the rocky sides and glance apprehensively down into the abyss below
close by to barnard
glorias face is wan and haggard
every upward move seems to require a herculean effort
she stops and has a fit of coughing
of the snake like moving party
they have reached quite a height although the peak of the mountain they are ascending towers high above them
the cutting wind moans treacherously as it caroms off the mountainside
a heavy mist envelops them
as the snake like line approaches a narrow treacherous footbridge and makes a slow difficult crossing in heavy weather
of the group
they round a curve and come upon a narrow crevice which opens up into a passageway
one by one they step through assisted by the natives
on the other side they sigh relievedly
oddly the wind has stopped the chill has lessened
they look up to inspect their surroundings and a startled look comes into their eyes
of conway as he glances casually around
what he sees leaves him transfixed
he stares unbelievingly before him for a long time
from angle at mountain top
a sight that is both magnificent and incredible
the eye filling horizon before them throws out a softness and a warmth that is breathless
on the left is a group of colored pavilions that seem as if suspended on the mountainside
down below in the hazy distance is a valley which gives one the impression of a huge tapestry superb in its blending of soft colors
in every direction wherever one might gaze there is a feast of strange and heavenly beauty
as chang approaches conway
welcome to shangri la
conways group and chang
chang smiles as he watches their astonished faces
conway turns from the rare magnificence of shangri la unhampered by the wind and storm they had just encountered and looks backward in the direction from which they came to
assure himself he is the victim of a nightmare
chang watching him answers him before he can express his astonishment
a wave of his hand you see we are sheltered by mountains on every side
a strange phenomena for which we are very grateful
as the group approaches the beautiful and peaceful shangri la
at the foot of a wide marble stairway as the caravan stops
on the group as they look around and feast their eyes on the grandeur of the place
glancing around at his picturesque surroundings
following conways gaze
in an upper window of a tower their faces glued to the pane are two robed lamas who stare down curiously
camera pans over to a very narrow terrace covered almost completely by a floral arbor
in it stands a statuesque woman of rare beauty
she looks down at conway intently
as he returns her gaze impressed by her beauty
come along bob
his eyes still on the girl above
he starts up the steps staring at her then stumbles
laughing at his embarrassment
he smiles up at her
it suggests nothing we might expect to see in this forsaken place
the motif is neither oriental nor religious but rather a delicately appointed room subdued in tones
at the moment no one is present except servants who silently set the table
of lovett peering worriedly toward dining room door
he sees two servants who flank the entrance and steps back hesitantly
barnard emerges from a room across the hall and lovett beckons to him
both are attired in flowing robes not unlike the one worn by chang
barnard i do not like this place
i definitely do not like this place
will you stop squawking
look at me
look at what they gave me to wear
you never looked better in your life
as soon as our clothes are cleaned theyre going to give them back to us lovey
they have reached the doorway of the dining room and halt
two servants bow and scrape and lead them in
something tells me this means food
i just feel as though im being made ready for the executioner
as the servants show lovett and barnard to their places
taking in the food yeah
if this be execution lead me to it
thats what they do with cattle just before the slaughter
youre a scream lovey
please dont call me lovey
at this moment conway and george enter
that was refreshing
oh ho the food looks good
he takes something off the table and nibbles at it
some layout they got here
did you get a load of the rooms
you couldnt do better at the ritz
all the conveniences for the condemned if you ask me
conway looks at him and smiles
dont mind lovey
hes got the misery
conway i dont like this place
i dont like it
its too mysterious
its better than freezing to death down below isnt it
it is in semi darkness
the moon sends a stream of light through the windows
outside we see the outline of towering mountains
spread across the bed her clothes unchanged is the body of gloria her face sunk deep in the pillows
gloria emits wracking coughs
after a few moments she sits up
her cheeks are wet her hair disheveled her eyes bloodshot
we get an impression of someone who has suffered for hours
finally her coughing begins again and unable to stand it she rises and paces the floor then she crosses to the window and looks down camera panning with her and
into her eyes has come a grim determined expression
from glorias point of view
she is staring at the chasm below her
gloria continues to peer below and her coughing resumes
as chang comes down the corridor hears the coughing and stops
chang enters and watches gloria for a moment before speaking
is there something i can do for you
gloria wheels around and glares at him
what do you want
ive offered you some warm broth
i thought perhaps you get out of here
if any of you men think you can come busting in here she cannot finish as she is attacked by a fit of coughing
please calm yourself
youll soon be well if you do
through fits of coughing i dont need any advice from you
get me a doctor
im sorry but we have no doctors here
looks up quickly no doctors
bitterly thats fine
thats just fine
please let me help you
sure you can help me
you can help me jump over that cliff
ive been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain but i havent got the nerve to jump
quietly you shouldnt be looking at the bottom of the mountain
why dont you try looking up at the top sometimes
her voice cracking dont preach that cheap second hand stuff to me
a sob escapes go on beat it
she flings herself across the bed coughing uncontrollably
chang watches her sympathetically for a few seconds
before turning away peace be with you my child
they all look up as chang enters
he is escorted to his place at the head of the table by two servants who stand on either side of his chair
jovially good evening
good evening my friends
oh no no no please sit down
i hope you found everything satisfactory
sees that no one has started you shouldnt have waited for me
wheres the girl
shes remaining in her room
she isnt feeling very well
to others now please go on without me
i eat very little
shooting down the long table toward chang
he sits up straight studying them as the others bend over their food
the meal is over
conway sips from a wine glass
well theres certainly nothing wrong with that meal
and the wine excellent
im glad you like it
its made right here in the valley
now that dinner is over if youll excuse us were very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home
the first thing we want to do is to cable the foreign office
all of england is waiting to hear about my brother
theres a cruiser at shanghai ready to take him back
well as regards cabling im afraid i cant help
unfortunately we have no wireless here
as a matter of fact we have no means of communication with the outside world
george stares at him suspiciously and then turns to conway for his reaction but conway is apparently disinterested in the whole conversation
not even a radio
its always been a source of deep regret but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible
in that event we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately
some means to get us back to civilization
are you so certain you are away from it
as far away as i ever want to be
of course the porters will be very well paid that is within reason
im afraid that wouldnt help
you see we have no porters here
no porters here
what about those men we met this morning
those are our own people
they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning
it is much too hazardous
to intercut with above speech
he has remained quiet throughout the scene apparently interested only in a paper in front of him upon which he has been writing
insert what has been occupying conways interest
it is a picture of chang which he has been listlessly drawing
how do you account for all this
who brought it in
they all turn to chang expectantly
there is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here
that is our only contact with the outside world
every now and again depending upon favorable weather of course they make the journey
how can we get in touch with them
in that respect you are exceedingly fortunate
we are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now what exactly do you mean by almost any time now
well weve been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years
barnard and lovett look shocked
george starts to say something but the words choke in his throat
but i can assure you gentlemen if there is a prolonged delay shangri la will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant as possible
rising and now if you will excuse me it is getting late
i do hope you all sleep well
the servants move his chair back
before he goes however he turns to conway
good night mr
conway a little surprised at the distinction in his behalf nods
good night sir
there is a hushed silence following changs departure
thats what i mean mysterious
conway i dont like that man
hes too vague
concerned we didnt get much information out of him did we bob
it seems to me we should be grateful
we were in a bad mess this morning
a wave of his hand after all this is quite pleasant
why not make ourselves comfortable until the porters do arrive
while he was speaking the muted strains of a violin float into the room
as conway crosses to a balcony door
thats what i say
what do you say to a rubber of bridge
i saw some cards in the other room
not for me thanks
no im too weary
he disappears onto the balcony
george watches him go
slightly effeminate how about you lovey
lets you and i play a game of honeymoon bridge
distractedly im thinking
what about some double solitaire
as a matter of fact im very good at double solitaire
then im your man
starts away come on toots
lovett detests the pet names but follows
george thinks a moment and crosses to balcony
conway is listening moodily to the soulful music
george wanders in beside him
looking out cigarette
lights the cigarette after a pause i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure
weve had plenty of it the last few days
its far from over from what i can see
this place gives me the creeps hidden away like this no contact with civilization
bob you dont seem concerned at all
oh im feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything
moodily i think im going to like it here
you talk as though you intend on staying
turns to him something happened to me when we arrived here george that well did you ever go to a totally strange place and feel certain that youve been there
what are you talking about
back to earth i dont know
youre a strange bird
no wonder gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill
conways point of view studying george
dont you ever want to see whats on the other side of the hill
what could there be except just another hill
in any event im not curious
at the moment it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home
id give anything to be in london right now
of course you would
if ever we get out of this place the thing for you to do is to take that job with helens father
what do you mean if we should get out
evasively did i say if
interrupting thats what you said
well i mean whats on your mind bob
you talk as though were going to have trouble getting out of here
george ive been putting things together
do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot
and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane
chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point
what brought them there
unless it was to meet us
catching on changs first question was about the pilot
there must be some connection between the plane and this place
they must have deliberately brought us here
what reason could they have for doing a thing like that
thats whats on the other side of the hill
shooting over shoulders of two men in f
we see a beautiful picture of the valley below
there is a tranquility here that is beatific
camera pulls back
the two men are revealed as conway and chang
they stand on a terrace of one of the tower rooms
its three thousand feet practically straight down to the floor of the valley
the valley of the blue moon as we call it
there are over two thousand people in the valley besides those here in shangri la
who and what is shangri la
so there are others
who for instance
in time you will meet them all
he watches changs face searchingly then smiles
for a man who talks a great deal its amazing how unenlightening you can be
laughs there are some things my dear conway i deeply regret i may not discuss
you know thats the fourth time youve said that today
you should have a record made of it
evasively shall we go inside
i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures
on a spiral staircase
looking surreptitiously around he backs his way up
camera follows him as he reaches the top of the landing
here he stops and glances around the corner down a corridor
camera follows george as he peers into several rooms searchingly
he finally arrives at one and enters
george enters and looks around
it is dimly lit and apparently unoccupied
he crosses to a desk and picks up several objects scrutinizing them closely
she sits a tapestry board on her lap watching george with keen interest
he opens a book and glances at its contents
maria surveys his back appraisingly
george wheels around startled and stares at her intently
starts backing out excuse me appealingly please dont go
george hesitates at door
tea will be served any moment
he watches her with grave speculation for a long moment then slowly moves toward her
a winning smile wont you come in
george still maintains a serious mien as their eyes meet
my name is maria
wont you sit down
it is a huge room
the walls are lined with impressive tomes
chang is showing conway around
conway has just finished browsing through one of the books
by the way what religion do you follow here
we follow many
a look of surprise spreads over conways face
thoughtfully to put it simply i should say that our general belief was in moderation
we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind even including he smiles the excess of virtue itself
we find in the valley it makes for better happiness among the natives
we rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience
as a result our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy
how about law and order
you have no soldiers or police
oh good heavens no
how do you deal with incorrigibles
why we have no crime here
what makes a criminal
avariciousness envy the desire to possess something owned by another
there can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything
you have no disputes over women
only very rarely
you see it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didnt give a hang if it was good manners or not
smiling well in that event it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her
thats very convenient
i think id like that
youd be surprised my dear conway how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems
conway scarcely hears the last speech for his attention has been caught by the playing of a piano
he stops to listen
chang has walked out of scene
conway locates the direction whence the music comes goes to a doorway where he stops
he realizes conway did not follow him and turns
when he sees conway his face clouds and he starts toward him
conway watches someone through door with grave interest
chang enters scene and follows his gaze
it is a spacious high ceilinged room oddly shaped and except for a piano a harp and several chairs is otherwise sparsely furnished
at the extreme end the room is set off by an alcove of stained glass extending from the ceiling to the floor where it finishes with a deep window seat
at the piano we see an old man and by his side is the girl conway saw last night
they finish playing and both laugh heartily
conway finds her laughter infectious and smiles
in the midst of her laughter the girl sees conway off scene and her face sobers self consciously
chang quickly takes conway by the arm
at some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her
conway turns for one last glimpse of the girl and then turns to chang looking up at his face puzzled and amused
some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me
she continues to stare off toward the door her eyes alight with a keen interest
chang all these things books instruments sculpture do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters
well it must have taken centuries
where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures
of course we have no money as you know it
we do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because well because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it
they have arrived in a small room where they pause
chang reaches into a bowl of large nuts cracks one and hands the nut to conway
then he does the same for himself
during the following scene both are eating nuts from the bowl
that would suit me perfectly
im always broke
how did you pay for them
our valley is very rich in a metal called gold which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world
so we merely
buy and sell
buy and sell
no no pardon me exchange chuckling i see
gold for ideas
you know mr
chang theres something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd guiding intelligence somewhere
whose idea was it
how did it all start
that my dear conway is the story of a remarkable man
a belgian priest by the name of father perrault the first european to find this place and a very great man indeed
he is responsible for everything you see here
he built shangri la taught our natives and began our collection of art
in fact shangri la is father perrault
when was all this
oh let me see way back in i think it was that father perrault stumbled into the valley half frozen to death
it was typical of the man that one leg being frozen and of course there being no doctors here he amputated the leg himself
shocked he amputated his own leg
oddly enough later when he had learned to understand their language the natives told him he could have saved his leg
it would have healed without amputation
well they didnt actually mean that
they were very sincere about it too
you see a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here
theyve never known anything different
so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here
well is it
rather astonishingly so yes
and particularly so in the case of father perrault himself
do you know when he and the natives were finished building shangri la he was years old and still very active in spite of only having one leg
and still active
just a little bowled over thats all
i should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age
climate diet mountain water you might say
but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live
in your countries on the other hand how often do you hear the expression he worried himself to death
or this thing or that killed him
and very true
your lives are therefore as a rule shorter not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide
after a pause thats all very fine if it works out
a little amazing of course
conway you surprise me
i surprise you
now thats news
i mean your amazement
i could have understood it in any of your companions but you who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds
or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it
chang if you dont mind i think ill go on being amazed in moderation of course
chuckles then everything is quite all right isnt it
they exit scene together
on a garden bench gloria slumps languidly
suddenly we hear barnards voice yelling
gloria quickly turns her back
barnard runs into scene
honey its terrific
i just saw something that will make your hair stand on end
you see those hills over there
popping right out of them
tons of it
conspiratorially now look you keep this under your hat because if those other monkeys hear about it theyll declare themselves in
but if i can mine that stuff ill throw a bombshell into wall street
now look ive got a plan and if i gloria begins coughing heavily
barnard notices how pale and haggard she looks
aw say honey you arent feeling well are you
look dont pay too much attention to what those doctors tell you
ive seen an awful lot of people fool them and ive got a hunch that this place is going to be good for you
honest i have
waits for her reaction receives none come on now
you be a good kid and snap out of it and ill cut you in on the gold deal
look im going up and make a deal with chang right now
he enthusiastically exits scene
lovett enters warily sits down at his desk and begins to write in his journal
nd day at shangri la this place is too mysterious
he looks up sees himself in a mirror and gives a start
then chuckling to himself reassuringly he looks around warily and continues to write
it is a bright cheery morning
conway is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings
he comes into the area where the horses are stabled
two men are busily grooming the horses
cheerily good morning
good morning mr
oh you speak english do you
would you like to take a ride mr
not just now
suddenly conway is startled by the sound of hoof beats and looking up is in time to see the girl of the previous sequence sondra fly by him on a
horse screaming delightedly
as she passes him she waves
instantly changing his mind well i think i will take that ride
as he rides off in pursuit of her
showing sondra successfully eluding him as he closes in on her
sondra whizzes by
as we stay on the shot conway rides through in exciting pursuit
showing sondra disappearing behind a mountain waterfall
conway dashes up but she is lost from sight
he wheels around several times and unable to find her looks puzzled
finally giving up he starts slowly back
after a few moments he is startled by her laughter and glances around
from his view shooting upward
high up near the summit of the hill we see sondra waving and laughing
then she swings her horse around and disappears
as he smiles amused and interested
as she swims in a mountain stream apparently in the buff
from a distance we see her climb onto a rock to dry off
as she shakes her shimmering hair
he has caught up to her tethered horse and is skulking around trying to find out where she is
a squirrel near to sondra chatters excitedly
she can apparently understand the squirrels warning
she hurries to dive back into the water and swim to the other side
she comes up spots conway and watches him from hiding behind some bushes
conway has discovered her clothing and is constructing a kind of scarecrow on a bush out of them
as a crowning touch he adds a flower to the effigy his eyes twinkling at his little joke
with one final glance over his shoulder he turns to leave
she stifles her laughter as he vanishes from view
lovett and barnard are at the table waiting for the others
several servants are in the b
george paces nervously in front of the door
lovett and barnard
barnard nibbles at something
running around digging up a lot of old bones
you didnt dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance did you
lovett is about to reply when he realizes he is being made fun of and gives a tentative chuckle
conway is coming down the corridor
george comes out of door to dining room and starts forward
conway walks along in a cheerful mood singing as he goes a cockney song
forces a smile you seem gay
did you find out anything
as they walk back toward dining room door
well i heard that if you want a mans wife shes yours if hes got any manners
nothing about the porters yet
good heavens bob weve been here two weeks and we havent found out a thing
well we havent been murdered in our beds yet george have we
im afraid the porters are just a myth
tensely i guess we never will know why were here or how long were going to be held prisoners
they have reached the door and start into dining room
as conway and george enter barnard calls to them hey hurry up you slow pokes im starved
imitating chang as he takes his chair please
do not wait for me
i eat so very little
barnard laughs heartily
george surily silent enters and drops in his seat
at the same moment gloria comes into the room
the men greet her all rising
well im certainly glad to see that its all finally organized
to servant okay handsome
dish it out and make it snappy
as he sits he looks over at gloria and something in her face arrests him
hey whats happened to you
self consciously nothing
why you look beautiful
doesnt miss stone always look beautiful
featuring gloria barnard and conway
suddenly i got it
its your make up
youve got none on
gloria busies herself with her soup self consciously
and say honey you look a million per cent better
wholesome kind of and clean
you take a tip from me and dont you ever put that stuff on your face again
why its like hiding behind a mask
ha ha who are you to be talking about a mask
what do you mean
youve been wearing a mask ever since we met you
its very strange you know
youve never told us anything about yourself
who are you anyway
why dont you take your mask off for once
unbosom yourself mr
his face has become serious all right i will
ill let my hair down
it cant make any real difference now
after a pause hey lovey were you ever chased by the police
lovett is halted in his tracks soup spoon halfway up to his mouth
believe me its no fun
when you fellas picked me up at baskul theyd been on my tail for a year
skeptical the police
after another pause did you ever hear of chalmers bryant
camera pulls back to include the others
they look shocked
the first one to make the connection chalmers bryant
bryants utilities thats me
george is the only one unconcerned
he is deeply absorbed in thought his food has remained untouched
lovett suddenly explodes
i knew it
i knew i had a reason for hating you
sir youre a thief
he never stole anything from you did he
i have shares of bryant utilities that i bought with money that i saved for years teaching school and now i couldnt sell it for postage stamps
thats too bad
i got a half million shares
my whole foundation
and now look at me
a colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly you the swindler of thousands of people you know thats what makes the whole thing so funny
a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber an ordinary everyday slew footed plumber and by the use of a little brains mind you he builds up
a gigantic institution employs thousands of people becomes a great civic leader
and then the crash comes and overnight hes the biggest crook the country ever had
you are a thief sir and a swindler and i for one will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back
george cant stand it any longer
suddenly hoarsely what do you mean when we get back
the sharpness of his voice startles the others
what makes you think were ever going to get back
you may not know it but youre all prisoners here
we were deliberately kidnapped and brought here and nobody knows why he rises to his feet
well im not content to be a prisoner
im going to find out when were going to get out of this place
whips out a revolver grimly ill make that chinese talk if its the last thing i do
he starts out
before anybody can realize what his intentions are he has bolted out of the room
starts after him
as george strides determinedly out into the hall yelling
suddenly he sees a native servant and his eyes pop insanely
camera pans with him as he strides across to the servant and grabs him by the shirt front
shaking servant violently where is he
where is he
wheres chang or ill blow your brains out
conway has caught up with him and wrestles him away from the servant who stumbles off in fright
george what do you think youre doing
let me go bob
george pushes conway away from him and starts down the corridor
george come back
george spies another servant
come here you
the servant frightened by his voice turns suddenly and starts running
george levels his revolver and sends a stream of bullets after the fleeing servant who miraculously manages to skate around a corner unharmed
conway runs into scene reaching george and with a quick flip of his left hand he smacks him over his revolver arm and with his right he punches him flush
on the jaw
george you idiot
george reels for a moment and slumps to the floor
as the others trail in
had to sock him eh
conway pockets the gun and bending over george a pained expression on his face starts to lift him
conway brings george in followed by the others
he drapes him across his bed
conway stands by his side looking down at him deeply concerned
after a moment conway shakes him and george awakens with a start
let me up
let me up
george groans and turns away
on barnard lovett and gloria
barnard wanders over to conway who appears lost in thought
say conway is it true about us being kidnapped
louder i say is it true about us being kidnapped
conway suddenly is aroused from his reverie by someone he sees off scene
he looks up alertly
chang enters scene beaming charmingly
do you mind stepping in here for a moment
as chang enters
he bows courteously to the others who stand in front of georges bed
conway shuts the door and turns the key
he crosses to a door leading to another room and locks this one also
chang watches him curiously
the others including george who is now alert are puzzled and somewhat impressed
then conway comes to chang
wont you sit down
chang sits his placidity unchanged
conway pulls up a chair in front of him
very quietly mr
chang you have been very kind to us and we appreciate it
but for some reason we are being held prisoners here and we want to know why
as conways voice continues talking to chang personally i dont mind at all
im enjoying every minute of it
dead serious but my brother is not of the same opinion nor are the others
after a pause its time we were told what its all about
conway still continuing we want to know why we were kidnapped why we are being kept here but most important of all do we get the porters and when
much too suavely until we get this information my dear mr
chang i am very much afraid we cannot permit you to leave this room
there is a pause while the eyes of all are centered on changs face
after a pause you know its very very strange but when you saw me in the corridor i was actually on my way to you
i bring the most amazing news
impressively the high lama wishes to see you mr
the high lama
who in blazes is he
i though you ran this joint
chang high lamas or low lamas do we get the porters
the high lama is the only one from whom any information can come
dont believe him bob
hes just trying to get out
sounds like a stall to me
you say the high lama is the only one who can give us any information
the only one
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back
the high lama arranges everything mr
well then hes the man i want to see
to chang will you come along
conway unlocks the door
when he has opened it he turns
better wait here until i get back
well soon know where we stand
with conway and chang
chang walks in a high state of expectancy
conway is grim
they climb a narrow spiral staircase
they proceed up the stairs until they arrive at a large impressively ornate double door which seems to open automatically the moment they approach
chang remains without
the moment conway steps over the threshold the doors swing closed
as the doors swing shut
conway turns and realizes chang is no longer with him
conway stands still glancing around the room which is lit so dimly that nothing definite is distinguishable
to show what conway sees
for the moment practically nothing
as his eyes become adjusted to the darkness he begins to sense the architecture and furnishings of the room
but as yet no sign of life
slow pan shot reveals it to be a dark curtained and low ceilinged room furnished rather simply
very sombre indistinct tapestries drape the back walls
while the camera around a voice is heard
soft and friendly good evening mr
camera quickly swings over to the nethermost corner of the room where scarcely visible sits an old man of indeterminate age
in the gloom only the outlines of his pale and wrinkled face can be seen
it yields an effect of a fading antique portrait
he stares motionless at the eerie vision
please come in
conway comes forward warily until he stands within a few feet of the old man his eyes riveted upon him
sit here near me
i am an old man and can do no one any harm
are you the high lama
as conway expressionless sits down opposite the high lama
i trust you have been comfortable at shangri la since your arrival
personally ive enjoyed your community very much
but my friends do not care for this mystery
they are determined to leave as soon as while he has been speaking his eyes have been gradually taking in the details of the old man
the camera quickly follows his gaze to crutches leaning against the mans throne then looking down to his legs one of which appears to have been amputated
awe and amazement its astonishing and incredible but what is it my son
youre the man chang told me about
youre the first who two hundred years ago reverently youre still alive father perrault
sit down my son
pause you may not know it but ive been an admirer of yours for a great many years
conway evinces surprise
oh not of conway the empire builder and public hero
i wanted to meet the conway who in one of his books said there are moments in every mans life when he glimpses the eternal
the quotation captures conways interest and his eyes widen
that conway seemed to belong here
in fact it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here
that i be brought here
who had that brilliant idea
secretly pleased oh the girl at the piano
she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you as have we all
of course i have suspected that our being here is no accident
furthermore i have a feeling that were never supposed to leave
but that for the moment doesnt concern me greatly
ill meet that when it comes
what particularly interests me at present is why was i brought here
what possible use can i be to an already thriving community
we need men like you here to be sure that our community will continue to thrive
in return for which shangri la has much to give you
you are still by the worlds standards a youngish man
yet in the normal course of existence you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity
here however in shangri la by our standards your life has just begun and may go on and on
but to be candid father a prolonged future doesnt excite me
it would have to have a point
ive sometimes doubted whether life itself has any
and if that is so then long life must be even more pointless
no id need a much more definite reason for going on and on
we have reason
it is the entire meaning and purpose of shangri la
it came to me in a vision long long ago
i saw all the nations strengthening not in wisdom but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy
i saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army
i foresaw a time when man exulting in the technique of murder would rage so hotly over the world that every book every treasure would be doomed to destruction
this vision was so vivid and so moving that i determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that i could and preserve them here against the
doom toward which the world is rushing
pause look at the world today
is there anything more pitiful
what madness there is what blindness what unintelligent leadership
a scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality
the time must come my friend when this orgy will spend itself when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword
against that time is why i avoided death and am here and why you were brought here
for when that day comes the world must begin to look for a new life
and it is our hope that they may find it here
for here we shall be with their books
and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule be kind
pause when that day comes it is our hope that the brotherly love of shangri la will spread throughout the world
pause yes my son when the strong have devoured each other the christian ethic may at last be fulfilled and the meek shall inherit the earth
a long silence ensues during which conway so engrossed is he in all he has just heard scarcely notices the lama who has risen slowly and now stands before him
the lama reaches down and gently touches him on the shoulder
scarcely audible i understand you father
conway kisses the high lamas hand
you must come again my son
conway slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave scene
conway comes through
he walks as if in a trance
camera pulls back as he continues on his way bearing an expression of deep absorption
as conway walks toward an open door at the end of corridor leading to the garden
lovett emerges from one of the rooms and sees him
he beckons to those inside and almost immediately they come out and start toward conway
conway just about to exit when the others catch up to him
we thought you were never coming back
whatd you find out
when do we leave
conway stares at them blankly
what about the porters
didnt you find out anything about the porters
why im sorry but i he starts away from them but they crowd around him
what were you doing all this time
youve been gone for hours
for heavens sake bob whats the matter with you
you went out there for the purpose of george
george do you mind
im sorry but i cant talk about it tonight
he leaves them
shooting toward garden through open doorway
conway walks away from the crowd in f
all staring at him nonplussed
we see conway walk through the garden in b
he stares at his brother off fearfully
of a pleasant and peaceful place
conway is walking along moodily drinking in the pastoral beauty
as he walks along
he comes to a spot where a man and a woman are tilling the soil and stops to watch them
the man looks up and seeing conway makes a friendly bow and doffs his hat
conway also bows
the woman curtsies prettily and smiles
conway doffs his hat in acknowledgement
he is in a cheerful frame of mind and continues his walk camera continuing with him
he greets several other people
upon seeing him they also bow and doff their hats
conway does likewise
conway is walking along a street in the valley
it is a quaint thoroughfare unlike anything we have ever seen before
the small one story huts along its very narrow sidewalk are of singularly varied architecture giving the impression of being homemade
as a result of this no two are alike
only one characteristic about them is similar their cleanliness
something about the atmosphere is fresh and wholesome and peaceful
in front of several of the huts native women sit some weaving on a tapestry board some nursing babies some asleep and some just sitting
the keynote is contentment
with conway walking along
as he passes the women smile at him in the most friendly fashion
from inside these homes soft and soothing music emanates
at the end of the street conway finally arrives at a garden spot
the suddenness of this is startling too because of its beauty
sighing contentedly conway throws himself at the foot of an overhanging tree and leans against the trunk
he throws his head back shuts his eyes in a restful and contemplative mood
he remains this way quietly for a few seconds when he is attracted by the singing of a chorus of childrens voices
he glances around
from conways angle
in the shadow of a row of overhanging trees which form an arch a group of fifteen or twenty children sing a hymn or nursery song in english
sondra the violin girl of previous scenes stands in front of them a baton in hand conducting them
he smiles at the sight and springing to his feet starts in their direction
of sondra and the children as conway saunters into the scene behind her
he finds himself a comfortable place under a tree and sits down
the children still singing have seen his approach and crane their necks curiously
she waves her baton and sings with the children
then she notices they are being distracted and casually turns her head
she is somewhat startled at seeing conway but quickly recovers her composure and smiles wanly
he smiles also
do you mind
to include sondra conway and some of the children
they finish the song and conway applauds
sondra curtsies prettily
she turns to the children
this is mr
in unison the twenty children curtsey
all together sing song good morning mr
how do you do
very well thank you
conway scrambles to his feet and does an exaggerated bow
sondra laughs delightedly
all right children
we will now sing she lifts her baton and the thin piping voices fill the air
he lights a cigarette and leaning against a tree studies sondras face impressed by her beauty
she slyly glances backward and a self conscious smile covers her face
as a child from the ranks breaks and comes to sondra who leans down to listen to the child who whispers in her ear
sondra murmuring of course dear and still waving her baton is for the moment uncertain what to do
then turning to conway holds out the baton to him
do you mind
conway snaps out of his reverie and jumps forward
not at all
he takes the baton from her
and taking the child by the hand she exits
conducting the chorus in all seriousness albeit a trifle awkwardly
he turns his head to watch sondra and when he looks forward again finds himself off beat
to cover his embarrassment he smiles foolishly
they come to the end of the song but conway whose eyes are searching for sondra is oblivious of this and continues to conduct mechanically
the children break into laughter
with sondra as she returns with the child clinging to her
as she turns a bend she looks up surprised
as she laughs heartily
all right children
now teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon so schools dismissed
the children break into squeals and race off
the camera follows them as they cross a footbridge gleefully doff their clothes and with yelps and cries leap into a stream
i hope youre not going to run away this time
extending her hand my names sondra
i hope youll forgive me for he hears curious fluttering music coming from somewhere
looking around you know each time i see you i hear that music
what is it
oh you mean my pigeons
the camera shows pigeons swirling overhead
sondra pulls a miniature flute from one of her pocket
showing him its these little flutes that i attached to their tails
come along with me and ill show you how i put them on
they exit scene
of a large coop where pigeons are bred and raised
the pigeons flutter around landing on sondra and conway as she shows him her collection with pride
she grabs one pigeon and ties one of the miniature flutes to its legs
you see this is how we tie them on
and by varying the size of the flutes i can get any notes i wish
the wind does the rest
heres a little fellow who lost his
she grabs another pigeon ties a flute to its legs
wonderingly was this your idea
hold this pigeon
you suggested my being brought here didnt you
what gave you the idea id fit in
that was easy
i read your books
oh youve read my books
you do more things
what have my books got to do with it
i saw a man whose life was empty
a man whose life was empty
oh i know
it was full of this and full of that
but you were accomplishing nothing
you were going nowhere and you knew it
conway scrutinizes her face intently
as a matter of fact all i saw was a little boy whistling in the dark
a little boy whistling in the dark
do you realize that there is a british cruiser waiting at shanghai smoke pouring out of its funnels tugging at its moorings waiting to take mr
conway back to london
do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that conway is missing
does that look like a man whose life is empty
after a pause yes
good naturedly youre absolutely right
and i had to come all the way to a pigeon house in shangri la to find the only other person in the world who knew it
may i congratulate you
she laughs merrily and shakes his hand
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons
dont worry about the pigeons
from now on you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet
she turns to leave and he follows exiting scene
sondra and conway walking
this spot is on top of a hill overlooking the splendor of the valley below
they walk along silently for a few seconds while conway studies her face speculatively
there are so many questions id like to ask you i hardly know where to begin
ill help you
to begin with youd like to know what im doing here
whether i was born here
well i was almost born here
it took place in that wild country beyond the pass
my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year
when chang found us only father and i were alive
but he was too weak to climb the pass
he died on the way
i was brought up here by father perrault himself
i envy you
i talked to him last night
yes i know
of course i cant quite get used to this age thing
he steals a sideways glance at her
she is greatly amused
satisfying his obvious curiosity im thirty
oh youre going to make life very simple
as they arrive at a scenic overlook
it is getting toward dusk
wonderingly its inconceivable
all of it
father perrault and his magnificent history
this place hidden away from the rest of the world with its glorious concepts and now you come along and confuse me entirely
i thought i was to be the light
but why do i confuse you
am i so strange
on the contrary youre not strange
and that in itself is confusing
i have the same idea about shangri la
the sense that ive been here before that i belong here
im so glad
i cant quite explain it but everything is somehow familiar
the very air that i breathe
the lamasery with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley while its head explores the eternal
all the beautiful things i see these cherry blossoms you all somehow familiar
chuckles to himself ive been kidnapped and brought here against my will
a crime a great crime yet i accept it amiably with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend
can you tell me why
perhaps because youve always been a part of shangri la without knowing it
im sure of it
just as im sure theres a wish for shangri la in everyones heart
i have never seen the outside world
but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy
yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where theres beauty and comfort where they wouldnt have
to be mean and greedy
oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley
then it wouldnt be a garden spot for long
she laughs as they exit scene
barnard is bringing a reluctant lovett along on an excursion into the valley
they pass friendly natives and farmers at work
i dont know why i associate with you mr
barnard or mr
chalmers bryant or mr
embezzler or whatever your name may be
just call me barney
why should i
we have nothing in common
and this trip to the valley
i cant imagine why id allow you to drag me down here
why we dont know anything about these people
were not even armed
theyre very nice people except that theyve got horns
alarmed at first horns
barnard points to sheepherders with their long horns
what kind of horns
lovett sees his point starts to chuckle but still looks wary
they wont hurt you
barnard has encountered some beautiful native girls and they have surrounded him with their hospitality plying him with wine and food
lovett is off scene
okay honey all i want is a glass of wine
thanks very much
please sit down
this is fine
this is swell
no just a drink
ive been walking and im a little thirsty you see
thats all right
i dont just happen to be very hungry
say look all i asked for was a glass of water
look here ive got to have some help with this
looking around anxiously now lovey
where is lovey
of lovett lagging behind and missing out on all the fun
favoring barnard as lovett comes into view
hey lovey come here
lovey i asked for a glass of wine and look what i got
come on sit down
so thats where you are
i might of known it
no wonder you couldnt hear me
you were asked to have a glass of wine
and be poisoned out here in the open
to lovett for me wont you please have a glass of wine
i never drink wine in the daytime
as he is poured a glass anyway there you are
raising the glass to his lips this doesnt obligate me in any way
a merry lovett has had too much to drink
now he is entertaining a group of native children who are huddled at his feet
other natives watch the entertainment
bernard watching from one side is losing patience
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said oh somebodys been sleeping in my bed
and then the mama bear said oh dear somebodys been sleeping in my bed
and then the big papa bear he roared and somebodys been sleeping in my bed
well you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary
im going to sleep in my bed
come on lovey
continuing they were in a quandary and come on lovey
why come on all the time
whats the matter
are you going to be a fuss budget all your life
here drink it up
arent you having any fun
where was i
in a quandary
they all laugh
im telling this story
im telling it
continuing yes the poor little bears didnt know what to do you see because somebody had been sleeping in their bed
who slept in their beds
the one who poured him a drink of wine alluringly who was it lovey
smitten oh you call me lovey eh
to barnard look at those eyes
theres the devil in those eyes
following lovett as he enters unusually chipper singing here we go gathering nuts in may
he is in such a good mood that he improvises the lyrics putting shangri la in with his la la las
after glancing out the window lovett sits down and pulls out his journal
he writes he pauses looks up opens the compact box at his side and looks at himself confidently and admiringly in the mirror
returning to his journal he adds with george as he disconsolately walks
he is startled by the sound of marias voice calling him
camera pans with him as he crosses to a sheltered spot where maria sits on a garden bench
he fumbles for a cigarette
a little hurt you promised to come for tea yesterday
i waited for so long
chagrined to discover he has no cigarettes left i havent even got any cigarettes left
ill make some for you
pleading you will come today
after a pause perhaps
tenderly please say you will
the days are so very long and lonely without you
a whisper please
all right ill be there
happily thank you
suddenly youll tell me some of the things i want to know wont you
youll tell me who runs this place
and why we were kidnapped
and what theyre going to do with us
from the moment he starts to speak her face clouds
georges voice continues without interruption
changs been lying about those porters hasnt he
she runs off frightened
following conway and sondra as they stroll peacefully hand in hand amongst the sculpted shrubbery and rows of flowers
there is a sudden pealing of bells
the two of them look off and pause their gaze momentarily captured by picturesque snowcapped peaks in the distance
im waiting for the bump
when the plane lands at shangri la and wakes us all up
she gives him a pinch
chuckling you see its not a dream
you know sometimes i think that its the other thats the dream
the outside world
have you never wanted to go there
from what you tell me about it it certainly doesnt sound very attractive
its not so bad really
some phases are a little sordid of course
thats only to be expected
oh the usual reasons
a world full of people struggling for existence
well everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself accumulate a nest egg and so on
you know if you keep on asking that were not going to get anywhere
and dont ask me why
i was just going to
its the most annoying word in the english language
did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it
mimicking mothers little darling musnt stick her fingers in the salad bowl
because it isnt lady like to do that
because thats what forks are made for darling
joining in why mother
because mother read it in a book somewhere and if mothers little darling doesnt take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant mothers going to wring her little
sondra laughs heartily
teasingly would you like to wring my little neck
id love it
conway makes a grab for her and she spurts away
he chases her across part of the garden and past the fountain catches up with her
he reaches to place his hands around her neck
laughing im sorry
im very sorry
he hesitates studying her intently
when they break ive thought about it for years
softly i knew youd come
and i knew if you did youd never leave
a whisper am i forgiven for sending for you
a pause you know when we were on that plane i was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it
that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys covering ten times the distance of the plane
it was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed
and ive been thinking that somehow youre that plane and im that silly shadow
that all my life ive been rushing up and down hills leaping rivers crashing over obstacles never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this
earth and into my arms
they kiss again
chang is being visited by lovett who has lost his petrified manner
this place is amazing
and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent
oh ive looked around
ive seen everything
your woodworkers and your cloth weavers they all seem so very very happy
you may not know it mr
chang but right here you have utopia
youve very kind mr
i dont mean it in that sense
i only give credit where credit is due
pauses sincerely er mr
chang im very anxious to have you realize that i never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story
oh im so glad
do you know what i did last night
last night mr
chang i held a sort of a self inventory
i said to myself last night mr
chang i said lovey catches himself looks around mr
lovett i said you are an ungrateful fool
those were my very words to myself last night
here are these people in shangri la doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i havent done one single thing to show my appreciation
now what would you like to do
chang i thought with your permission of course and while im waiting for these porters i would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them
something practical and something useful
you know i was a professor for twenty years
and a very good one
im sure you were
when would you like to start
offering his handshake then its done
oh thank you
conway sits on a bench barnard leans over him showing him a map a twitter with an idea
you get the idea
from this reservoir here i can pipe in the whole works
oh im going to get a great kick out of this
of course its just to keep my hand in but with the equipment we have here i can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there
can rig it up in no time
aghast do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water
a twinkle in his eye its unbelievable
think of it
in times like these
say what about that gold deal
you were going to interrupting oh that
that can wait
nobodys going to run off with it
full of business say ive got to get busy
i want to show this whole layout to chang
exiting so long
dont you take any wooden nickels
we hear him whistling something joyous
probably the old gray mare aint what she usta be as he watches barnard go pleased at the metamorphosis thats taking place in him
suddenly he sees george and jumps up
from conways angle
george has just made his appearance
george keeps on going and conway runs toward him
as conway catches up to georgeand takes him by the arm
sincerely george youre behaving like a child
you havent opened your mouth in two weeks
coldly i dont see that theres anything to say
and releasing his arm he leaves conway abruptly
as a look of deep pain comes into his face
he stands for several seconds looking helplessly and despairingly in georges direction
chang and conway playing chess
conway leans over the board a faraway expression on his face
chang leans over moves a man into position
im afraid that does it
conway looks up aroused from his reverie
he glances over the board
im afraid it does
shall we have another
rises no thanks
not tonight if you dont mind
he crosses to a window and glances out
chang looks up and sees maria in doorway
come in my dear
she seems slightly embarrassed
i didnt mean to interrupt
self consciously i thought mr
conways brother was here
charming isnt she
your brother seems quite fascinated by her
shes an attractive young woman
she arrived here in
she was at the time
she was on her way to join her betrothed when her carriers lost their way in the mountains
the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people
hands in the air amazing
she still doesnt look over
when is she likely to grow old in appearance
not for years
shangri la will keep her youthful indefinitely
suppose she should leave it
leave shangri la
thats not likely
you couldnt drive her out
no i mean about her appearance
if she should leave the valley what would happen
oh shed quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age
shaking his head its weird
a pause chang how old are you
age is a limit we impose upon ourselves
you know each time you westerners celebrate your birthday you build another fence around your minds
they are interrupted by the entrance of george
stridently oh there you are
youre just the man im looking for
as george comes up to them
he is livid with rage
he crosses directly to in front of chang
a fine trick
smart arent you
what a pack of lies you told us about those porters
of course the minute they arrive we can make arrangements to leave
if they take us
but you knew very well youd tell them not to
now my dear boy
you shouldnt snapping at him youve been lying to us ever since we got here
apparently its worked with some people
perhaps its because they lack the courage to do anything about it
but not me chang
youre up against the wrong man
ill get out of here if i have to blow this fantastic place into the valley
ill get outporters or no porters
and with this threat he storms out of the room
you must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey
he could never get through that country alive
tensely i cant let him go alone
he exits abruptly
chang watches him depart deeply upset
conway sits in the same place before the lama
yes of course your brother is a problem
it was to be expected
i knew youd understand
thats why i came to you for help
you must not look to me for help
your brother is no longer my problem
he is now your problem conway
because my son i am placing in your hands the future and destiny of shangri la
pause for i am going to die
there is a pause during which conway cannot conceal his amazement at this simple statement
i knew my work was done when i first set eyes upon you
conway is too awed and impressed to utter a sound
the high lama finally resumes
i have waited for you my son for a long time
i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers
i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices always in hope that i might find you
my friend it is not an arduous task that i bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds
to be gentle and patient to care for the riches of the mind to preside in wisdom while the storm rages without
do you think this will come in my time
you my son will live through the storm
you will preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it a touch of your own mind
beyond that my vision weakens
pause magisterially but i see in the great distance a new world starting in the ruins stirring clumsily but in hopefulness seeking its vast and legendary treasures
and they will all be here my son hidden behind the mountains in the valley of the blue moon preserved as if by a miracle
the voice of the lama toward the last seems to fade out
conway thoroughly engrossed half consciously waits for it to continue
following a protracted silence he slowly turns toward the lama
a breeze blows through the room ruffling curtains on the window
from whose face the glow has faded
there is nothing left but a dark shadowed mask
he stares uncertainly for a long while with a slow realization that the high lama is dead
quite unaware that he is being moved emotionally tears well up in his eyes
while still sitting this way unable to stir he becomes conscious of activity around him
as two servants unbeckoned arrive only to peer solemn faced at the lama
then in intervals of seconds groups of lamas hitherto unseen enter softly and silently and gather around the high lama
we hear indistinguishable murmurs that might or might not be prayers
conway is only vaguely aware of their presence and after a few moments scarcely conscious of what is actuating his movements he drifts away from the murmuring lamas and walks
in the direction of the door
barnard and gloria are on their knees on the floor
before them they have spread a large map or chart
barnard is enthusiastically out lining his plans
we run the pipes through here and we connect with the main water line here
where are you going to get pipes
oh thats a cinch
ill show them how to cast pipes out of clay
this is as far as they get for george at this moment barges in
there you are
barnard youd better get your things together
ive just been talking with the porters
theyre going to take us
weve got clothing food everything
when are you going to start
right this very minute
the porters are waiting for us on the plateau
and that chinaman thought he could stop me
i think ill stick around
ill leave with the porters on their next trip
you mean you dont want to go
well im i see
youre afraid of going to jail eh
you see i got this plumbing business all right
if you insist on being an idiot im not going to waste time coaxing you
to gloria how about you
oh no you dont want to go yet honey
before she can answer shell stick around too
to gloria is that right
beaming if you want me to
dont you worry
ill take care of you
all right suit yourself
but just remember you had your chance
as he starts out lovett enters
how about you
do you want to go
away from here
ive got porters to take us back
oh my dear boy im sorry
why i have my classes all started
irritably i dont care what youve got started
do you want to go
well no i think id better wait
grumbling as he goes youll wait till you rot
glowering after him yes
does a double take barney
lovett immediately dismisses george from his mind and his face brightening he starts toward barnard and gloria
as lovett joins the two on the floor
barney ive just finished translating one of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine
it told me all about the origin of the masonic symbols and thats swell lovey
i want to show you something
he proudly displays his map
oh my isnt that pretty
what is it
im going to run pipes all through the village as all three heads go into a huddle
conway stands in front of a window his arms extended across peering out moodily
he is watching a solemn and slow moving procession of torchlight bearers the funeral rites of the high lama accompanied by cermonial music and drum beating
shooting over his shoulder
getting his view of the magisterial procession
conway as he thoughtfully surveys the surroundings of which he has just become master
george appears in the doorway
he looks around and espies conway
for a moment he stands uncertainly and finally enters
softly bob as conway turns and seeing him evinces no emotion whatsoever
a murmur hello george
george looks at him peculiarly
conways behavior is odd in view of their strained relationship
well you can stop worrying about everything now bob
ive made arrangements to leave
if youll let me close that window i can talk to you
that noise is driving me crazy
he closes the window
i said were getting out of here
back to civilization
i made a deal with the porters
they brought in a load of books or something and theyre leaving tomorrow at dawn
theyre waiting for us five miles outside the valley
come on get your things together
wheres your top coat
you cant leave george
whats going to stop me
pleading you mustnt
youve got to stay here now
sharply stay here
more softly whats the matter with you bob
youve been acting strangely ever since we came here
no response from conway ive never seen you like this
why cant we leave
whats stopping us
conway combats an impulse to tell him the whole story
impulsively something grand and beautiful george
something ive been searching for all my life
the answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime
ive found it george and i cant leave it
you mustnt either
i dont know what youre talking about
youre carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up
if youll only tell me about it
i will george
i want to tell you
ill burst with it if i dont
its weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable but so beautiful
pause well as you know we were kidnapped and brought here
while he is speaking we slowly as conway is concluding his story
and thats the whole story george
he died as peacefully as the passing of a clouds shadow
his last words to me were i place in your hands my son the future and destiny of shangri la
now you know why i cant leave
george listens to him intently his face a mask of apprehension
he stares at his brother for some time and finally rises and walks around for a few moments
running his hand through his hair well i i really dont know what to say
except that you must be completely mad
so you think im mad
what else can i think after a tale like that
good heavens bob things like that dont happen today
were living in the twentieth century
so you think its all nonsense huh
i think youve been hypnotized by a lot of loose brained fanatics
why i wouldnt believe it if i heard it in an english monastery
why should i swallow it here in tibet
how do you know the things they told you are true
did they show you any proof
i dont need any proof
contemptuously i knew there was a reason i hated this place
id give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what theyve done to you
how do you know the things they told you are true
did they show you any proof
all this talk about the lamas being hundreds of years old
how do you know
did you see their birth certificates
some more pacing i cant believe it bob
a bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world
and you bob conway two feet on the ground conway want to join them
is that all my story meant to you
what else could it mean to me
its obviously a lot of bunk
then youd better go george
this is no place for you
its no place for you bob
think of whats waiting for you
do you want to stay here until youre half dead
until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them
i dont want to talk about it anymore
youve got to talk about it
what about me
you said they stole that plane to bring you here
i didnt want to come
you owe me some responsibility
im tired of owing you things
youre free to go
suddenly its that girl that girl has twisted and turned enough
never mind the girl
a tense moment of silence well why dont you go
conway has sunk into a chair
george kneels before him pleading
look here bob ever since i can remember youve looked after me
now i think youre the one that needs looking after
im your brother bob
if theres something wrong with you let me help you
a murmur oh george
besides i i dont feel like making that trip alone bob
george you couldnt possibly stay here could you
id go mad
after a moments hesitation george i may be wrong i may be a maniac
but i believe in this and im not going to lose it
warmly you know how much i want to help you but this is bigger stronger if you like than brotherly love
im sorry george
after a long pause well i cant think of anything more to say
they shake hands warmly
george turns to leave
just as george reaches the door george are you sure of the porters
about their taking care of you i mean
turning back oh yes
its all set
maria made the arrangements
glances up surprised maria
yes the little russian girl
whats she got to do with it
shes going with me
conway looks his extreme amazement
suddenly wild george youre crazy
as he says this he jumps to his feet
george is startled by his tone and manner
wheeling you cant take her away from here
confidently why not
strongly because you cant
do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri la
shes a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved
take her out of this valley and shell fade away like an echo
slowly what do you mean fade away like an echo
she came here in
he laughs hollowly
he runs his hand through his hair
he stares unbelievingly at conway
this would be funny if it wasnt so pathetic
why she isnt a day over twenty
youre wrong george
im not wrong
she told me so
besides she wouldnt have to tell me
id know anyway
significantly i found out a lot of things last night
quickly im not ashamed of it either
its probably one of the few decent things thats ever happened in this hellish place
conway stares at him
cynically so everyone is serenely happy in shangri la
nobody would ever think of leaving
vehemently its all just so much rot
shes pleaded with me ever since i came here to take her away from this awful place
shes cried in my arms for hours for fear id leave her behind
and whats more shes made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters for me
doesnt want to believe it i dont believe it
i dont believe a word of it
ill prove it to you
you believe everything theyve told you without proof
ill prove my story
as he speaks he has crossed to door leading to adjoining room
conways eyes are glued on him
come in a minute
after a few seconds maria appears in the doorway and stands there timidly
she steps forward
shrewdly ive got some bad news for you maria
my brother and i have decided we cant take you along
marias face collapses
small frightened voice you cant take me
she rushes to george and throws her arms around him
but you promised me
you promised to take me with you
over her shoulder george looks victoriously at conway who cannot believe his ears
suddenly maria wheels on conway
its all your fault
it was all arranged until he spoke to you
why cant you leave us alone
do you mean to tell me you want to leave shangri la
ill die if i have to stay here another minute
ive waited a long time for this chance to go and youre not going to stop me now
if i have to ill go alone
it was i who bribed the porters
if it werent for me youd never get out
i thought the porters had instructions from the high lama not to take anyone
the high lama
who pays any attention to him
the porters laugh at the high lama
all they want to know is how much gold he will give them
well i gave them more gold
ive been stealing it for a year
id do anything to get out of this place
to get away from that high lama the one who calls himself father perrault
why hes been insane for years
father perrault is dead
you wont see me shedding any tears over him
pleading oh george you must take me with you
quietly arent you afraid to leave
you dont want to look like an old woman do you
chang told you that didnt he
i thought so
he tells everyone im old
he wants them to stay away from me
he cant stand it when anyone comes near
hes punished me for every minute ive spent with george
if it werent for him i would have been out of here long ago but he always stops me
six months ago i tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room
i nearly went crazy
pause look at me mr
conway do i look like an old woman
is this the skin of an old woman
look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were bob
thrown i dont believe it
i cant believe it
wildly youre lying
every word youve been saying is a lie
come on say it
he has backed her into a corner and is nearly throttling her
youre lying arent you
conway im not lying
what reason could i have for lying
the chances are that well never come out of that horrible trip alive but id rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive than to stay here
one more minute now
thoroughly disillusioned conway emits a few cynical chuckles shakes his head stares blankly for a moment
dead voice you say the porters are waiting for us
alertly yes everything
what about the others
ive already asked them
theyre afraid to make the trip
well have to send an expedition back after them
business like come on
were wasting time
conway dashes around and collects his things
are you taking me
yes of course
they start out the door and we
conway george and maria on their way out of the main building
the funeral procession continues around them
the two men walk together maria behind
george is cheerful and buoyant
it wont be long now before were in london
cant you just see everyone when we pop out of the blue
conways jaw is set grimly
as conway george and maria continue
well have them breathless when they hear our story
while he speaks conway turns his head around looking for a glimpse of sondra
as he hurries out of the building and looks out at them from a roof terrace
as he continues to look back in sondras direction although he keeps in step with george
you had me worried for a while
i thought you were gone completely
conway turns his head away
conway george and maria
george glances up at conway
sincerely grinning lucky thing for me you snapped out of it too
you saved my life
i never could have made it alone
what was that
i was saying cant you shut up
must you go on babbling like an idiot
george looks up startled
sondra has come running out to stand anxiously beside chang
sondra and chang
hes going my child
but he will return
shouting she rushes off and the camera follows her as she races down a long flight of stairs calling out conways name
as she runs calling out conways name and weeping
showing conway george and maria accompanied by a dozen or more porters as they approach the mountain opening where they first entered shangri la
he hesitates at the opening looks back one more time
his eyes show confusion and defeat
george ahead calls out to him to hurry
as she stumbles up the trail to the opening minutes behind
the wind howls on the other side
she cries and weeps calling out conways name but he can no longer be seen
which should be a group of portraits showing the groups seemingly impossible journey back to civilization
these pictures should be accompanied by music in the appropriate mood
accompanied by the porters they trudge laboriously through snow ridden plains
the whole caravan are seen in the distance clambering up a mountain side hoisted by ropes
in the middle of a vast plain
they attempt to put up tents which proves futile as a raging snowstorm rips the canvas from its moorings
the large group are seen lowering themselves in single file down a ledge alongside a ravine
the wind howls
a mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm swiping viciously across their faces
they edge their way pre cautiously across a narrow ledge
suddenly the girl loses her bearings slips screams and is caught by conway just in time to save her from falling down the side of the jagged mountain
maria has one arm around george and the other around conway limping
she has her head down
they trudge silently
the porters are off in the distance leaving them behind
collapsing i cant stand it
i cant go on anymore
ive got to rest
she stumbles and they help her up
george looks off toward the porters helplessly
hysterical how long is this going to go on
i cant stand it i say
of the porters laughing at their distress
bob cant you get them to wait for us
theyre leaving us farther behind every day
theres nothing that would suit them better than to lose us but we must go on
to maria gently come on
no i cant
youve got to let me rest
youve got to let me rest
calling out to the porters hey
of the porters still laughing
the lead porter whips out a gun and fires at them for sport
they are in no danger
the porters are too far off
contemptuously target practice again
one of these days theyre going to hit us
wryly as long as they keep on aiming at us were safe
to maria come now child
they start to move again
of the porters
they are still laughing and now others have drawn out their guns
firing off wildly they trigger an ominous thunder overhead
looking up they see an avalanche beginning
of the avalanche picking up strength and fury as it crashes downhill sweeping over the porters and crushing them to death
an immense silence comes over them
conway and george can only stare dazed and frightened
the only sound is maria sobbing
a scene in which conway carries the girl on his back
george walks behind
the wind continues to howl
staring at the girls face as it hangs over conways back
suddenly his eyes widen
a distorted view of her
youth and beauty seem to be vanishing
his eyes are glued on her
a frightened whisper bob
look at her face bob
look at her face
on the backs of the two men who bend over maria
camera draws back as they straighten up
both stare down aghast at the girl whom we do not see
to include the girl
the only illumination comes from the moon
we cannot get a clear view of her face
but what we see seems to us to be small withered and aged
she is dead
the men stare at her intently
who watch her immobile
george looks despairing
slowly his head turns toward the cliff behind him and his eyes become alert with an idea
his face lights up with great determination
he lets out a piteous howl and breaks away racing out of scene
conway turns sharply and is horrified
george stumbling toward the cliff conway chasing him
george falling head over heels rocking on the edge then plummeting over falling down down into the darkness
conway at the end of the cliff peering starkly downward
as conway soldiers on alone through howling wind and snow
on conway struggling against a cyclonic wind
he tops a rise stumbles falls over and rolls down the mountainside until finally he comes to a stop mounded by snow
slowly he begins to rise and start again
as the sun comes up conway emerges from the whiteness feeling his way forward with a walking stick
he walks with the pain and effort of a blind man and just as he manages to cross a bridge spanning a great chasm the bridge collapses
he stumbles on
conway looking haggard and more dead than alive stumbles out onto more dry and level terrain
he collapses to the ground
a group of chinese in front of huts
they look up see something off and commence shouting excitedly in their native tongue
conways body from their angle
newspaper headlines conway found alive in chinese mission similar headlines follow
newsboys hawk bulletin editions to milling crowds
top level government dignitaries confer
camera moves forward passing a series of desks and clerks until it reaches a clerk who is opening several cablegrams
finally he comes to one which causes his eyes to pop
muttering something under his breath which sounds like good heavens
and without taking his eyes off the cablegram he rises and starts away
as he strides across to the end of the outer office to a glass panelled door upon which we read assistant to the foreign secretary through which he disappears
as the clerk enters full of excitement
cable from gainsford
oh read it
reading leaving today for london with conway aboard s
conway can tell nothing of his experiences
is suffering from complete loss of memory
loss of memory
all right give it to the press
all of it
might as well all of it
ill dispatch a convoy to meet him
more newspaper headlines reporting that conway has amnesia and other details of his homeward journey
another clerk enters with haste bearing another cablegram
conways gone again
listen to this
let me have it
takes it and reads aloud aboard the s
last night conway seemed to recover his memory
kept talking about shangri la telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet
insisted upon returning there at once
locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore
am leaving ship myself to overtake him as fearful of his condition
wrote down details of conways story about shangri la which i am forwarding
more newspaper headlines indicating gainsford has abandoned his pursuit of conway and returned to london
a scattering of men are present some at the bar others at tables
several men are seated
looking off heres gainsford now
they all look off
from their view
we see gainsford standing in the doorway looking around
he spies them and starts forward
as gainsford arrives at the booth
the men rise with extended hands
well its good to see you back lord gainsford
thought you were never coming
will you have a drink
as gainsford shakes hands with them and sits down
scotch and soda
here you are ready and waiting
he pushes on in front of him
were most eager to know what youve discovered
any news of conway
where is he
did you bring him back
all this is said as gainsford drains his glass
setting glass down gentlemen you see before you a very weary old man who has just ended a chase that lasted nearly ten months
do you mean to tell me you never caught up with him
since that night that he jumped off the ship until two weeks ago ive been missing him by inches
you dont mean it
think of it
he was as determined as that to get back
gentlemen in the whole course of my life i have never encountered anything so grim
during these last ten months that man has done the most astounding things
he learned how to fly stole an army plane and got caught put into jail escaped
all in an amazingly short space of time
but this was only the beginning of his adventures
leaning forward he begged cajoled fought always pushing forward to the tibetan frontier
everywhere i went i heard the most amazing stories of the mans adventures
until eventually i trailed him to the most extreme outpost in tibet
favoring the other men as gainsford continues
of course he had already gone
but his memory ah his memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives
the man who was not human they called him
theyll never forget the devil eyed stranger who six times tried to go over a mountain pass where no other human being dared to travel and six times was forced
back by the severest storms
theyll never forget the madman who stole their food and clothing whom they locked up in their barracks but who fought six of their guards to escape
gainsford still continues
why their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him and shuddering at the memory
he led them the wildest chase through their own country and finally he disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not travel
takes a drink and that gentlemen was the last that any known human being saw of robert conway
think of it
by jove thats what i call fortitude
tell me something gainsford
what do you think of his talk about shangri la
do you believe it
thinks a moment yes yes i believe it
sincerely i believe it because i want to believe it
they all watch his face impressed by his tone
as he lifts his glass
gentlemen i give you a toast
here is my hope that robert conway will find his shangri la
they all raise their glasses
softly here is my hope that we all find our shangri la
they are all impressed by the sincerity in his voice and as their glasses come together camera moves up to a closeup of them and as the music starts the
picture moving in front of conway as he walks forward with a steady step his head held high his eyes sparkling snow pelting his face
over his silhouetted back
as he walks away from the camera and we stay with him a long time as he approaches a hill
he has now ascended to the middle of the steep hill his gait unchanged
the camera pans up to the summit of the incline and we see that beyond it the horizon is filled with a strange warm light
