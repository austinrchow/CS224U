written by billy ray matthew chapman credits start on a black screen then they continue during the whole scene at michelles place and they end at the beginning of the
scene at bill capas office
close up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical box
we see michelles hand selecting a lipstick then we see michelle putting the lipstick on her lips seated in front of the mirror of her dressing table
she is dressed in a green frock and her face shows that she is quite disturbed
her apartments decoration is very heavy with a lot of various useless objects and gold plated furniture and many mirrors
she looks for a new dress in her wardrobe and get mad at not finding it
she then goes to a sofa covered with cushions which she throws all around the place still madder at not finding her dress
a cat who was lying on the armrest of the sofa runs away hurriedly from the mad michelle
michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing table
she takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips then on her teeth then all around her mouth
she makes faces to herself in the mirror
she seems more and more disturbed
she takes a chrome plated revolver in her drawer starts to put it in her purse then takes it out spins the cylinder of the revolver and puts the revolver
in her mouth as if she wanted to kill herself
but instead she starts sucking the barrel while she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way
large planes of ground glass
we hear without understanding them some voices and laughs
then a male voice becomes more understandable
so who do you think is the enemy
no no give me a specific answer
then michelle appears on the screen
she is dressed in a green suit she is heavily made up et she still seems very disturbed
the office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich new york psycho analyst
beautiful and good taste furniture
shelves with leather bound books
you are the goddamned enemy capa you and this all tower of psycho babble
you know what i hope
that god gets real pissed off and he shrivels up your cock so that it points straight down to hell where you belongs
during this reply bill capa has appeared on the screen
he is seated
he is wearing a long sleeve shirt a necktie but no jacket
he laughs at michelles last sentence
michelle so you will become his avenging angel and swoop down to finish me off
he stands up
now i finally get it youre are like my ex husband
you think that everything got to be either black or white because you got color blind
but god is on my side now
he knows im not like you well we are pretty much the same michelle
we all do it
we all do what
tend to view our lives as we were looking through a keyhole
is a very limited view of the truth
so we have to fill in the blanks
we invent things
i dont know what you mean
you invent enemies to test your strength against
you invent gods to protect you from these enemies
what a depressing view of life you have that is such horse shit
who is the enemy
one minute you have friends the next moment theyve slipped away
you leave here and i wonder who is michelle really hating this week
i try to remember and i cant bring it to mind
do you know why
no why dont you tell me take a look in the mirror michelle which mirror
tell me what you see
we see michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror
i see your reflection over my shoulder
there is nothing much that i really like
i think i prefer the view outside actually
during this last reply bill standing up is fidgeting with something on his desk
at michelles last words he turns toward her looking alarmed
but he doesnt have time to do prevent her from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside
he yells michelle twice
we see michelles body falling all the way down
capas office must be around the th floor
the body crashes on the street
a police horse who was near the impact rears up in fright
as if the asphalt were translucent we see michelles body from underneath with the blood flowing around it
all right get back there
get back in your car
we see bill with tears in his eyes
he walks to the broken window and look outside
my god it was the reddest blood i ever saw poured around her green dress
then the red disappeared
bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head
he finishes the preceding reply
it was like a vibration of color broadcast from hell
and then the red started to fade away
the ophthalmologist moves the device away
we see bills face and behind him projected on the wall an abstract drawing made of colored spots close together
the red spots start to blink and then they become grey
it is the apartment of an old new york intellectual
a bit messy
a old earth globe on a stand
objects and books everywhere but with an warm atmosphere
larry wears an open shirt and a sweater
bill also is in open shirt with a sleeveless sweater
at the beginning of the scene bill is lying on a couch
youre here for me to pity you
larry puts down the newspaper he was reading
it is the new york post
on the front page a title in large prints patients family sues manhattan shrink hell yes
it doesnt take sigmund freud to figure out i dont care to see the color of my patients blood
im a little surprised that this happened to you
starts to stand up
you always thought i was a cold hearted son of a bitch
not really but there is a kind of arrogance here
do you really believe that youre responsible for her illness
you were a small recent part of her life
yes thats right thats right
but its all too fucking glib for me larry
i cannot dispose of this woman that easily
well you always were a romantic
are you involved with anyone else
larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room
bill is seated on an armchair during the following reply and strokes the grey cat who is lying on the table
i am still a romantic
i just dont have anybody to be romantic with
they want to fuck me or marry me
none of them want to love me maybe you dont want to be loved
you had a happy marriage once
she loved me to death
then she ran off and loved somebody else to death
of course there is something else here
to deny red is to deny emotion
as you know that could be very dangerous
bill stands up
yes yes i know
i know and i have got something broken
i know its gonna take some time to get fixed
he picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on
youre a pretty good therapist
how long does it take a man like you to forgive himself
i see you when i get back from los angeles
during the two last replies bill has walked to the front door
dont run away because of one treatment failure
im not running away larry its just a little trip to los angeles
besides you cant really run away
its all up here isnt it
he shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it
its a package deal
the head goes with me
shot of l
seen from the sky then shot of an airplane landing
on these two short shots we hear ladies and gentlemen welcome to los angeles
please remain seated until the aircraft comes
the end of the sentence is not understandable because it is mixed with the sound of a radio set in a car
just another monday in paradise
there is a fender bender on slowing thing down
the voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver
he wears a french cap and a striped shirt
he has a strong foreign accent which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand
bill is seated at the back of the taxi
he is wearing a black polo shirt jeans and sunglasses
what are you looking at
theres an accident
short shot of the accident
anybody is hurt
anybody is dead
a car bumps into the back of the taxi
bill moves forward and backward and then massages the back of his head
what are you doing
you re looking there and driving here
put the pedal on the metal
bobs office is located in a big modern building in downtown l
a wide sitting room called group room is reserved for group therapy sessions
furniture is modern and functional but with a little personal touch
close up of a womans hand who steals a lighter on a table
then we see sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse
she is dressed in a very elegant way and wears expensive jewels
richie a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt a sleeveless denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head walks behind her without looking at her and gets seated in
we hear voices but we understand only a few words here and there
then a voice becomes clearer than the other ones
it is clarks voice counting the books on a shelf
is the aquarium with it
thats a blue shark
was that an after schock i felt
he is dressed with a very neat grey suit
everything on him is neat not a hair going the wrong way
he is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand
he looks ver artist
he wears his hair tied in a ponytail
he is making fun of clark
casey youre such a weenie
he looks very rough with his uncombed grey hair
he wears a red sweater without shirt and a jacket
leave him alone will you
did you read the paper to day
he take off his jacket
i was just wondering how many fucking pages it had
i fell right into that
we see bob behind the glass on the door of the room
he wears a shirt and a necktie but no jacket
he looks pensively at the group
i care that he is late
i dont get it
i do too
i dont care
because his fathers paying for his therapy
oh my dead husband is paying for mine and i still care
casey is looking for his lighter
we see sondra taping her chin with the lighter then giving it back to casey
bob enters the room
i think we should get started now
he closes the door
we hear bills voice
bob jumps nervously then walks in the corridor toward bill
they hug each other
how you doing
you look great
i sorry im late
i got stuck in traffic on the freeway
were just about to get started
ill just wait out here for a while
why dont you join us

i could use a second look
bob drags him by the sleeve and pushes him into the meeting room
this is my friend and colleague bill capa from new york
why dont you sit down over there bill
he sits next to clark who stands up to give him room
i thought it might be interesting for you and for him if he sat in one of our session
what kind of a shrink are you
im a behaviorist
same as bob
we went to college together
we fought the battle at penn state mental hospital as interns
no one is gonna be offended if you want to say no
she simpers while she talks
nobody wants to say no
how are you bill
fine thank you sondra
im a psychologist and a psycho analyst not a psychiatrist
is from n
so its bill and bob therapy a deux
why dont we begin by introducing ourselves and then saying as much or as little about why we are here as we are confortable with
the secretary closes the door behind bobs back who remains seated and only turns his head slightly
oh thats helpful
very macho of you thats an anti gender remark sondra
sondra whey dont you start us off
she simpers a lot and makes strange faces while she talks
my name is sondra dorio
i always marry older men but
richie looks at bills feet
bill is wearing a red sock and a green sock which makes richie smile
i am single now
and i keep
i want sex all the time
clark looks embarrassed
but i mean
i really do
a real relationship
sometimes i steal thing
i mean theyre little thing
richie put his walkman earphones back on his ears
it doesnt make any sense
its hard to
you know i
is that ok
this will be an event richie
richie doesnt hear a thing because of his earphones
he signals him to take off his earphones
richie takes them off
would you like to tell bill a little something about yourself
if nobody else is going to do it i will
richie has a gender identity problem and social phobia and hes promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group
doctor clark to lay the inventory on
i like that
oh saint christopher rattles his chain
saint michael sir
this is not about you
you know what i am saying
he talks to richie
one feels he has elocution problems
he stutters and looks for his words
open my mouth to talk but nothing
except when i
when i do drugs
how come im here
they say that i
that i blush too
y you c
can say that again
richie jumps on casey
sondra stands up to stop him but she is toot late
richie falls on casey and knocks his armchair down
ill tear your fuckin head off
you fuckin cocksucker
they fight on the floor
buck tries to take them apart
he succeeds in tearing richie away by holding him with both arms and carrying him away
get the fuck off me
richie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room
sondra tries to follow him
bob stops her
its all right
hell come back
what do you think doctor clark
bob straightens up the armchair and casey stands up sneering
was it something i said
you are an asshole
you know guys
a little humanity
talking to bill
oh fucking laugh
were entertaining the shit out of you arent we
why dont you stop feeling responsible for everyone
would you stop wound licking sondra
she seems a bit shocked
thats very nice
i lost my wife
and it just cant seem to pass
how did they die
he starts crying
i cant talk about it
sondra turns her head away she looks disturbed and moved
clark wipes his eyes
he talks in articulating his words in an affected manner
i am casey heinz
i am a painter
i live in a loft downtown and i guess
you could say
at the end of his reply he seems to be ready to cry
he puts his head in his hands then shows his laughing face
cant you ever be serious
does a bear poop in the woods
i sit next to clark he moves to sit behind clark
he lights a cigarette
and then smoke up a storm
my name is clark
im a lawyer
i have a compulsive obsessive disorder
so whats the problem
the problem is that if you and buck are going to smoke in here then the door to doctor moores office must remain opened in minimum of fifteen inches
buck comes and sits next to casey
they smoke together
i cant stand smoke
buck and casey puff clouds of smoke
and i would also like to suggest that you buy one of those ashtrays
how come you dont listen to clark
how come you dont do anything about this bob
that sucks up the smoke and purifies it
they cost nine dollars and ninety nine cents half of which is four ninety nine point five
hes going to open the door
one of you will have to pay an extra penny but im sure you can work that out
hes going to open the door
im going to open the door
several incomprehensible words
we understand only sondras next reply
you smell like an ashtray
you know if you dont act more seriously in groups
richie enters the room
next time you get snot on the doorknob
come sit down here
what would you like to tell us about yourself
richie walks behind bill to reach his seat
i have plenty of problems
the biggest of which right now is jet lag
so i think ill pass for now bob
the end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one
we are now later in the same day
night has come
the atmosphere seems more relax
buck is half lying on a sofa
sondra is finishing her story with a sweet voice and does not simper anymore
shes like a daughter to me
we hang out
he looks at this watch
well thats all for tonight
ill see you all next week
way to go
bob gets up very quickly
everyone does like him but more slowly
bob turns back before he leaves the room
ill be with you in a couple of minutes
bill nods in agreement
bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out
clark remains behind bill in front of the shelves
he puts something back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we dont understand
bill turns toward him
have you read bobs book
no i havent
he puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket and takes a book on a shelf
he gives it to bill
its quite excellent
way to go
im glad to hear you liked it
he wipes his hand with a white handkerchief wipes the handle of his black leather case before taking it and then puts the handkerchief in the pocket of his pants
good night doctor capa
bill holds his hand out but clark does not take it
he just nods in a friendly way and goes out
alone bill flips through the books
bill and bob come out of the building where bobs office is located
bob has his jacket on and bob is wearing a brown leather jacket
he is carrying his traveling bags
alone at last
are you ok
well nobody jumped out of the window
so maybe i am making progress
bobs expensive convertible mercedes starts away
on the back license plate we can read way to go
the roof of the car is open
the rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving through los angeles
you want to get a drink
you want to get laid
so what do you think of my little group
whats bucks story
you mean how did he loose his wife and kid
i dont know yet
hes not talking yet
how about casey
you tell me
i smell money
lots of it
maybe an abusive father
how am i doing so far
daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown and the very expensive artistic life style as long a junior stays in therapy
you got the hair on the back of my neck standing up
yes im a psychic when it comes to masochists
fivell get you ten he likes to whack now and then
where did you get that from
i was born with it
like a tuning fork
what about richie
genuine nut case
dont fuck with a trapped rat
oh i see
trapped rat syndrome with a recommendation of a non fuck with therapy
well can i quote you on that
they have reached a quieter road
yes you may
takes notes therell be a pop quiz later
ok im ready
bob turns on his left to enter his residence
all right if i diagnose a schizophrenia what do you recommend
dont fuck with it
now you got it
a huge sliding metallic door with spikes on the top moves smoothly to let the car enter
bill seems impressed by the residence of his friend
he looks at the security camera
bob stops the car and they get out of it
bill takes his luggage
its all one place
they come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole
a metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in
like peeking through a keyhole
they get down a few steps and reach a lawn
you get a very limited
view of the truth
bill looks with admiration at the pool and at the huge and impressive house very hollywood like
way to go must have gone really well
they enter the house
a beep is heard when bob opens the door
after you wise guy
he laughs looking at the luxury that surrounds him
the best and the most expensive in modern furniture
large expensive paintings hanged on the walls
bob types a secret code on a keyboard
then he switch on a small tv set that shows the pictures from all the security cameras
so how are we as we approach forty
we are in a good shape
really good shape
we finally got divorced
we have some money
he puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked
he takes off his jacket
i dont detect a womans touch
we have a little friend
youll meet her
shes too young for you
he sits behind the bar
always get the cliches and you wont be disappointed
this woman is not a cliche
he has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one to bill
they clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle
good to see you bob
bill plays with a piece of art consisting of an assembly of square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square
the object can pivot on his stand and when you look through it you get a distorted view of whatever is behind it
youre ready yet
ready to what
we see the distorted face of bill through the piece of art or rather several distorted view of bills face seen through each of the individual square of glass
bob pivot the object to have a better view of his friend
so hard to talk about
so hard to talk about
bill pivot the object again to hide behind it
is just a game
dumb deceitful game
so i quit my practice
he gets up
lost you religion huh
he takes a big book on a shelf
there is a picture of sigmund freud on the cover
well i certainly lost my belief in the scriptures
he puts the book back and with his hand makes a masturbation gesture
im sorry buddy
you gonna be in a lot of pain
there is a distinctive absence of pain
i cannot feel the pain that i know that im supposed to be feeling right now
and i think im going crazy
we feel that bill is ready to cry
im lost man i think im going crazy
he has tears in his eyes
you may be
your mind may be shot
in front of bobs residence
the sun is shining
bill is wearing a brown tank top and white jogging pants
bob is wearing a blue cyclist shirt and black pants
theyre both wearing caps
they are ready to go cycling
we hear the voice over of bob finishing the sentence from the preceding scene
but i hope your body isnt
do i get to warm up
two mile any pace you like
they mount their bicycles
lets do ten
they are now on the road in front of bobs residence
too much for you huh
i was thinking of maybe twenty
he starts full speed
they are now on a minor dirt road
we can see bobs house in the background
youll never change
why dont we just drop our pants to see whos got the bigger dick and then we can go back and have a nice civilized breakfast
wouldnt be civilized
youll be sulking
they are going uphill
you dont have hills in new york
he slows down
hang on a second
hang on a second
hang on a second
bob stops and dismounts his bike
what was that
what the hell was that
bill dismounts his bike
bob gets his bike upside down and sets it upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar
he checks the chain
bill is leaning on his bike
what are you afraid of
i got a gear slip here somewhere
thats not what i meant
what with the security systems the security gates looking over your shoulder
ive been getting some threats
what do you mean
pretty sure its somebody in the monday night group i just dont know who
monday night as in last night
i was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that you might have a hunch
no hunch bob
what make you think its somebody in the group
bob spins the pedals to check the chain
only about a dozen things
is been going on for a couple of months now
its funny how it gets you after a while
call the cops
he puts his bike back on the wheels
they say if they had to protect every shrink in l
theyll need an army
but that i should call them if anything happened
they put their sunglasses on
that makes sense
probably itll just blow over
how about you
we see them going very fast on the minor dirt road
a horse rider rides near them
what would you give a suicidal patient thats got everything
they ride even faster while clowning like riding on the back wheel
parachute i heard it already
out here already huh
come on old timer
the heavy metal door is sliding away
bob and bill are getting in
they dismount their bikes with some difficulty
they drop their bikes on the ground
you may have to
you may have to carry me in
they hold each other by the waist and the shoulders
you know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to
well you know
practice and all
how about that learning to loose by doctor bill capa
a beep and the second gate gets open
got a ring to it
they are making those seats smaller huh
they enter the residence
bill is massaging his buttocks
short low angle shot of the whole building before entering bobs workroom
bobs desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles
bob is wearing jacket and necktie
he is just finishing a session with a patient
see you next week
he escorts his patient to the door
enter barbara bobs secretary
im going now
you want me to lock on the way out
thatll be great barbara
she gets out
bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes valet
he then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the music a concerto for piano and orchestra
he sits behind his desk and starts writing in a large notebook
he hears a strange noise and raises his head
he puts his pen down open a drawer and takes his revolver out
a draught flips the pages of his notebook
he seems to feel better puts the revolver back and closes the drawer
then he closes the notebook takes it and goes to the shelves
he seems to be looking for something and feels worried not to find it
he gets out of his workroom
he enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves
he looks around and takes an art book about van gogh
he checks that the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar
he takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his notebook puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was and puts the art
book in the bottom of the shelves
a shadow moves on the shelves and a strange noise is heard
bob a bit nervous goes to the door and opens it
the classical music stops
through the open door we can see bob opening the door of his workroom
he comes back into the meeting room
when he enters the room the light is suddenly switched off
he crosses the meeting room
we can hear someone chuckling and we can see a shadow through the glass on the door
bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room
a man completely covered in black leather jumps through a large ground glass panei and jumps on bobs back
short fight on the floor
bob gets up bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor and falls down
close up of the mysterious mans hand
it is covered with a glove
the hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top of the hand
bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest
he staggers a bit takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of the mysterious man
he misses and the vase crashes on the wall
he is stabbed again in the chest
his staggering increases
he turns around and the man stabs him several time in the back
he stumbles to the front door
another stab in the back
the man grabs him by his hair to bring him back into the workroom
the man stabs him several times
bob is covered with blood
he falls on a glass door
the glass is shattered
bob falls on his back
a big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his stomach
through the window we can see an helicopter flying over los angeles
a car has just stopped in front of the building
the blue revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car
an helicopter is flying above the building
it could be the same that is seen at the end of the preceding scene
officer anderson goes around the car and opens the door for bill
bill is wearing a t shirt a light sweater and jeans
one can tell he had to dress quickly
bills gets out of the car and the car moves away
anderson takes bill into the building
classical setup of a californian police station
the various rooms are separated with glass partitions
an officer enters pushing in front of him a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy clothes
have you thought about
man i didnt do nothing
you know youre very cute
i love you
i love you too
anderson leads bill into a room and leaves him there
bill sits down
enters lieutenant hector martinez
he is wearing a pink shirt with short sleeves
his tie is badly knotted on an open collar
he has a police badge fixed on his belt
he holds a file in his hand
yes im doctor capa
he closes the door puts his file on the desk and sits down behind the desk
youre here because of the dead doctor
i read something about sessions on mondays
tell me about this monday group
theres five patients in the group
i cant really remember their names right now
he taps his head with his right hand a gesture meaning mental illness
he has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his hand
like five cuckoos
four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer
at least thats what bob thought
yes bob moore
four men and one woman
and you sat in one of these sessions right
yes i did
so who did it
anderson enters the room behind bill carrying a plastic cup
hey hey hey hey
this is civilization man
what do think this is
anderson gives bill the cup
dont come into my office like that bro
anderson leaves the room and closes the door
its third world thing
where were we
he blows on the cup
you were probing me about the patients
and i was about to tell you that i really cant help you at all
i dont really know any of these people
but youre a professional like me
you gotta have some kind of suspicion
i really dont have a clue
id like to help you but even if i could there is an issue of confidentiality
he laughs and gets up
youre talking to me about an issue of confidentiality
similar to the miranda oath
he sits down on the desk facing bill
if a friend of mine got killed and the only thing between the killer and me was miranda you know what i will do
fuck miranda up the ass
but dont tell anybody because its a matter of confidentiality
he puts a finger on his lips
im sorry i cant help you
ive only been in los angeles four days
youre sleeping at that
dead guys house arent you
maybe something will come to you in the night you know like dreams and shit
what happens to patients in a situation like this
usually a colleague will offer to take over the group
continue the treatment
he gets up
we see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt
its like one of the vultures dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion
he mimes vultures walking
is that what youre planning
because i really cant handle that right now
sure you can
youve been a week in l
and you already have you own private screwing farm
he sits back on the edge of the desk
how bad can that be
thats a great career move
where were you at the time of the killing capa
he pauses before answering
i was at his house bobs house
you had to think about that
are you going to arrest me lieutenant martinez
you want a lawyer
do i need a lawyer
youre in l
everybody needs a lawyer
he goes back to his seat behind the desk and conspicuously shows his back to bill
you can go home now take a shower
he turns back to bill
and keep your mouth shut
the only thing that i got going for me is that few people know what happened and i dont want the press fucking things up
bill plays with the piece of art made of pieces of glass
he pivots it
we can see bills face duplicated by the object
we then see bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that bob had been putting back in place the first time bill was in the house
then we see him walking pensively around the house
we hear the buzz of an intercom
bill comes out of the bathroom dressed in a white bathrobe
he is drying his hair with a towel
he walks in the corridor looking for the buzzer
he arrives into the main hall near the video security device
on the wall near the tv set two large paintings showing enlarged footprints
on the screen we see hectors face
hector is waiting in front of the gate
he is wearing a grey shirt a beige blazer and a necktie and a police badge on his belt
next to him is bobs car
behind him a uniformed police officer
hector presses the bell
we hear a beep
we see and hear hector via the tv set
are you there
bill takes the remote control
how is it going
we hear bills voice in the intercom
what do you want
i brought the victims car back and i got to search the house
you got a search warrant
what is it with you
dont you want me to find out who killed your friend
no i dont have a warrant
come on in
open the gate
hector waits a little then gets sprayed by a sprinkler located outside the screen field
you got the sprinklers on
we hears the end of hectors sentence
how about that
bill taps on the remote control
we hear a beep
on the tv set we see hector taking his jacket off
hector is searching the shelves on the wall
he quickly looks through the books takes a step back then thrusts his hand behind a row of books and grabs a photo album
while flipping through the pages he goes to the sofa and sits next to bill
bill is wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans
hector goes on turning the pages and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked woman
his ex wife
bill closes the album takes it from hectors hands and gets up
he turns to look at hector
ill tell you said so
he walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found
he looks at hector
im sure it will mean a lot to her
close up of the head of the bed
it is decorated with wooden sculpture of womens faces
hector enters the room followed by bill
he goes to the bed and strokes the sculptures
check this fucking bed
he goes around the bed and sits next to the sculpture which he keeps on fondling
everybody is having fun but me goddammit
hector opens a drawer and takes a revolver out of it
he holds it with his pen stuck into the trigger ring
i do not like guns
hector puts the revolver back in the drawer
you prefer knives
bill and hector are getting out of the house
i need you to do me a favor
they are crossing the garden
hector is still in shirtsleeves and has some papers in his hand
i want you to tell the group about moores death
well maybe one of them wont come in or maybe they will all come in but then you would be able to spot something wrong
i just cant handle it right now
i just had all the mess in his office cleaned up
dont you want to help me find the killer
have a heart
what does that mean
if you dont tell them ill have to tell them
am i the person to break the news to these people
listen up you fucking daffodils your shrink is dead
they have reached the main gate
hector gets out and bill presses a switch
the gate starts sliding between him and hector
which means that all the time effort and love you put in this relationship is wasted
youve got to remain as fucked up as you are or get worse
you are one sinister piece of work
all right ill do it
its better if you do it
we are in bobs car with the roof open
bill is wearing a green polo shirt jeans and sunglasses
he is on the phone while he drives the car but he drives slowly
no you listen to me
you dont understand gene
dont lie just give the family what it wants
no you dont understand
we see bill from the back
in the rear view mirror of the car we see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof open
a young girl is driving
she comes a bit too fast and bumps into the back of bills car
bill jumps and stops his car
i have to call you back
he puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car
he goes to roses car
she is leaning on the steering wheel
he opens the door
she stands back
she is wearing a large beige sweater
it nice to run into me like this
im bill capa
he goes away from the car
i got no insurance
she gets out of her car
i know its against the law and everything
she goes around her car and looks at the damage
dont bust my chops
ill bring the money to you if you just get an estimate
she stoops picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to bill
just give me a break
got a pen
rose goes to her car and bill throws the piece of red plastic away
rose gets into her car looks into her purse and takes a small notebook and a pen
bill takes them but hesitates before writing
rose smiles mockingly
oh poor old brain cant remember its own phone number
i just moved here
from new york
i wrote my address down because i am not sure about this number and how long i gonna be there so maybe you can call me sometimes for the next
couple of days
he goes away from the car
dont you want my address
bill gets into his car
you could lie
he starts his car
bill skip through the pages of a large notebook looking exactly like the one bob had hidden under a van gogh dustcover just before he got killed
he puts his back on the two other ones already lying on the desk
he is wearing a grey t shirt and an open denim shirt
bill enters the room coming from the workroom
who hasnt arrived yet
he is standing up
he is wearing a white t shirt and a grey sweater with a v shaped collar
he is wearing a grey sport jacket with a zipper and a striped t shirt
if its all right id rather wait till youre all here
shes always this late
he is wearing a dark suit very elegant
he is wiping his hand with a handkerchief
depends on who is banging her
she enters very rapidly through the corridor door
she seems very happy
she drops on the armchair next to casey
she is wearing an very close fitting overall which is generously open on her throat
the top of the overall is very colorful and the bottom is black
on top of it she is wearing a pink sport jacket
oh im sorry
class was really really really late
he is sitting in an armchair
he is wearing an grey collarless shirt and a black sleeveless vest
was class was that sondra
advanced cunnilingus for the single woman or a cpr for pleasure and game
christ dont excite her
where is doctor moore
theres something i want to tell you
whats the matter
im trying to pay attention
you should prepare yourself for bad news
bobs been killed
her face is distorted by the pain
she puts her hand in front of her mouth
what are you saying
what are you telling me
he was murdered
he was locking up here late friday night
yes right here in the office
was he shot
have they got a suspect
three days go by and you dont call us
it was easier if you were here together
he stands up
oh i see
so even bobs death is group therapy
hey bob thanks for giving us a chance to grieve together
he gets more and more angry through the preceding reply
he has become very nervous too
what the fuck is going on here
i need to know more
he was stabbed to death
how many times was he stabbed
she jumps up
she goes to clark and hits him
this man was bobs best friend
do you really needed exact numbers now
he takes sondra very gently by the shoulders and brings her back to her seat
get your fucking hands off me
it doesnt make sense to me
many times clark
more than thirty
its all i can tell you
it wasnt a thief i can tell you that right now
he is still very nervous
i mean why stab a guy thirty times
hed piss in his pants if you showed him a knife you know that
she is crying
what are you saying
im saying sondra that you really really have to hate a person to stab him that many times
youre a shrink right
you know what kind of power people hand over a shrink
or maybe sometimes they hand even more than they want to
that is absolutely correct
a thief would not stick around and stab someone thirty times
he sits down
since when did you become such an expert on robbery
its not the robbery hes an expert on its the rage
he has seated himself behind sondra and puts his hand on her shoulder
what are we gonna do now
i mean u
i bet doctor capa has an idea
what does he mean
casey hits his forehead
buck is almost crying
he sits down
i think casey is suggesting that i
may have some plans to replace bob
casey sits down
maybe you should
i cant do that
not right now
one reason is that i am more screwed up than you people are
i was just being obnoxious and loud before
anybody has a fucking xanax
i have a librium
stop with the drugs
it would be a good idea if you stayed
bob isnt cold yet
i mean therell be some connections
she gets up and sits down in front of bill
she takes the cushion which was on the armchair and hugs it
you were bobs best friend
you seem kind of like him
ill be so much easier to trust you
during the following reply richie comes and sits behind sondra
i know what kind of force a group can become in your life
you tell things here
intimate things that
you wouldnt tell your best friend
im very flattered that you would
he seems ready to cry
but the truth is you are the people that make this work
i would be more than happy to try to find someone for you to continue this but i cannot help you
if my opinion counts for anything i would like to ask why it is you feel so inadequate for the task
buck comes and sits next to clark
maybe he just dont like us
no thats not it buck
why dont you step on something
six weeks ago i spoke harshly to a patient
and she committed suicide
right in front of me
clark puts his handkerchief on his lips
perhaps she would have done this anyway
thats what my colleagues say
but i dont know
oh im sorry
he is crying with big tears
and my patient
her name was michelle
she jumped out
of a window in my office
so much blood
and so red
and in right time before my eyes
the red just disappeared
its turned to grey
so i dont see
then i failed
so i cant help you
i dont think that you want someone like me around right now
clark wipes his face again with his handkerchief
he seems to be extremely moved
i think i do
why dont you give us a try for a month
listen if you need anything any free legal advice to help you wrap up bobs affair please dont hesitate to call me
im not with anyone right now
ill be more than happy to help you in anyway
clark gives his business card to bill who takes it
then he gives him a kleenex
bill wipes his eyes
we see through the window light beams crossing in the sky
usual atmosphere of a well known bar
at a short distance from the entrance of the bar a truck with two floodlights the beams of which are sweeping the sky
those beams make the connection with the preceding scene
quick shot on the very noisy orchestra
a long hair bearded guy is playing the drums a girl is playing the guitar
bill dressed exactly like in the preceding scene is looking for someone
eventually he founds him hector who is already seated
bill sits down at hectors table
hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt
you bring me a confession
well you win some you lose some right capa
listen maybe it was not one of the group oh no
hes beginning to like them already
your friend bob moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this
why are we staying here shouting at each other for
whats this place
i used to work in narcotics
they used to come here a lot
i probably fucked and or arrested half of these peoples parents
its a nice place
i like it
look im sorry i havent got anything for you
ill see you around
bill gets up and leaves the bar
hector gets up behind him and follows him
they meet back in the street
so thats it hey
anything you want to tell me
they put back their jackets
yeah its a four door man
hector and bill are walking slowly in front of the bar
so you better shut the group down
who say i hadnt
oh have you or havent you
they ask me to take over the group
i couldnt say no
youre gonna do real well in this town
shut the fucker down
you sent me over there
no i send you there to convey a piece of bad news
a pedestrian bumps into hector
will you give me a break will you man
hector lays the man on the hood of a car and frisks him
i didnt send you there to go trolling for business
hector lets the man go and starts walking again with bill near the bar
you told me you couldnt handle it
well it turns out that i handle it now
you stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once
maybe you wont lose it
you leave it in there its gonna get shewed up at the root
they stop walking
i appreciate your concern for my dick hector thank you
i am being really nice full of concern for your safety in case its one of them hey
shut it down ok
i cant do that
shut it down chingada
dont be an asshole
youll find another set of wombats to exploit
these sudden irrational outbursts hector
did they begin in childhood or in puberty
get out of my face
am i in your face
what an interesting choice of words
would you like me in your face
youre married hector
if you wanna deal with any of these problems ill give you special rates
bill has moved slightly away from hector and turns his back to him
what like frequent flyer miles
hector mime something or someone crashing on the ground
then he walks around his car
let me ask you something
are you really color blind or is that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for you
no unfortunately i am color
did you bug the office
hey for a shrink youre pretty fucking dense
hector gets in his car while the valet is holding the door for him
he closes the door and the car moves away leaving a pensive bill on the sidewalk
bill comes to the keyhole shaped door
we can see his car parked behind him
he dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind the door
he looks cautiously around him before walking further
he presses a switch to close the gate
bill enters the house
it is very dark
he opens a glass door and walks slowly while the door closes behind him
he hesitates a moment then walk more decidedly
and falls heavily on the floor
he stands back up with some difficulty and discovers that the whole floor is flooded
bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on
he takes a big butchers knife in a stand on the table and looks in the corridor
bill wades in the flooded corridor
he seems worried and we see the knife blade shining
he enters the bathroom the door of which is wide open and opens the shower stall
a rush of water runs out of it
an alarm starts sounding
he goes back into the corridor and turns off the garden hose faucet
the alarm has stopped sounding
bill is wearing short pants and he is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn
then he spreads a wet cloth on the back of a seat
several other wet clothes are already drying
we see rose entering through the keyhole shaped door
there she is a little angel dancing on the head of a pin
rose gets down the few steps to the garden
she is wearing a light flowered summer dress
did you get that estimate
nice place you got here
its a little cold
but its kind of tasteful right
you too i guess
cold or tasteful
are we eating in here or you take me out
bill bursts laughing
we still hear bills laugh slowly fading out
we are looking above the main hall of a big luxurious hotel
two attendants are pushing a baggage cart
we move with them to the restaurant room
bill and rose are seated at a table
close up on rose putting lipstick on
not even a shade of pink
cant tell me if its smeared or not
i cant tell you if your eyes are bloodshed
you know what
in respect for your infirmity im gonna give up wearing lipstick
close up on rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water
there is something about me that i bet you find a little strange
in several shots during this dialogue we see bill seated in front of a mirror wall and roses reflection in the mirror behind bills back
what is that
well i havent asked you what you do
you showed a remarkable restraint
well its because id rather guess
you know i actually get upset if someone tries to tell me before i can
figure it out for myself you know
but what if i am ashamed of what i do
why should you be ashamed of being a shrink
who told you i was a shrink
how did you know
the way you looked at me you know
how i look at you
you have this kindness in your eyes
but i think youre using it to keep me away
you know youre trying to play safe
youre trying to think of a case instead of thinking of a female
so you have a tuning fork too
i guess we have a lot in common
we seem to be playing the same game
why do you say im playing a game
because youre the fantasy girl arent you
the face glimpsed across a crowded room
thats exactly what i am
youll be whatever they want you to be
no substance no rules
light as air
so your feet never have to touch those burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on
sort of like
not seeing red
yeah sort of like that
the main hall seen from above
bill is crossing the hall with rose holding his arm
i was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room here
and i might have to decide whether or not to go up with you
rose and bill are leaving the hotel
yes but that was part of my plan
i mean i wanted to
bill gives a ticket to the car valet
oh i need a taxi
no hey hey
wait wait wait
what are you being so tough for
im just beginning to think that maybe iil
rose kisses bill very tenderly and even with some spirit
while kissing bill moves rose to a more discreet place near the entrance
he strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress a bit down
then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her thigh
yo who called a taxi
i am thinking you should just let me take you home and forget about this stupid taxi
rose walks to her waiting cab
well im thinkin you should stay exactly where you are cause
she smiles and looks at bills crotch
in that condition youd get arrested
start another riot
give me your phone number and address
you want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet
whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air
she opens the cabs door and climbs inside
she waves to bill
she floats away on her sweet young legs
waves to him once
drives away without a backward glance
rose closes the door and the cabs moves away
the first sentence of the following dialogue is heard voice over on a wide shot of the modern glass building where bobs office is located
bill sits behind the desk
in front of the desk already seated dale richies brother
he is wearing an open khaki shirt
bill wipes his glasses and puts them on
he is wearing an open light blue shirt
richie is what he is
what exactly is that
he was born back of a van going up route to a grateful dead concert
the first sound he ever heard was beat it on down the line
they both laugh
well it could be worse
how long have you been his guardian
since he was nine or ten
but ive always taken care of richie
so what can i do for you
um i was hoping you would help me
get richie out of therapy
look i know im just his brother but ive been like a mother and a father to him
bill takes his glasses off
and i know i can get overprotective but
why would you want to take richie out of therapy now
what richie needs is normalcy
bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room
normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways
richie has practically been raised by the state
bill sits back
the social workers psychiatrists
forcing him into this um psycho servitude
he is the sweetest kid youll ever meet but he thinks of himself as handicapped
it just isnt right
well hes got legal problems
richie was sentenced by the court to mandatory treatment
every kid gets into trouble
and thats why i need you to help get him out
you know dale its hard to tell when someones feeling pain
but i want you to know
if richie feels pain
then i feel pain
pretty much in tune with him
i just wish youd give us a chance
let me check out richies status
then uh ill give probation a call
bill gets up
dale gets up and shakes bills hand
i really appreciate it
youre welcome dale
you either lift weights or work with your hands
yeah uh i make furniture
bill sits back but not dale
yeah i made this desk for bob to remind him of new york
we called it the chrysler desk
you ever see his bed
tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman tied with ribbons
we hear the phone ringing
the answering machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties
she is hung upside down with chains and ropes
this is casey
i cant get to the phone right now so uh leave a message
a beep ends the message
the tracking shot moves on to a motorcycle looking old then to another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a bustier a garter belt and hoses all red
she is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains
we hear bills voice leaving a message on the answering machine
casey this is bill capa
its around noon
your father sent me a check for the private sessions you were having with bob
should i send the check back or do you want to continue
let me know okay
a click ends the message
during bills message the tracking shot moves to a giant plastic statue with walt disneys plutos head on a human male body
then the tracking shot moves more quickly to another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close fitting sexy black overall
then a close shot on a painting of a woman wearing a harness with spikes
further away we see another painting showing a redhead woman being whipped
at the end of bills message the tracking shots ends on casey lying supine on a weightlifting bench
his writs are tied to the vertical bars where a dumbbell is resting
i think i want to continue
we hear the crack of a whip
since the shot is showing only caseys head and chest we dont see who is whipping him
another whip crack
i called you a bitch
the tracking shot starts moving backwards but with a larger angle
caseys voice is softer
medium long shot on the room
almost hysterical laugh
we see bill bare chest wearing sneakers short pants and cap running toward us
his t shirt is hanging at his side partly stuck in the elastic band of his shorts
bill stops running when he reaches the mailbox hesitates one moment comes two steps back and opens the box
close up on the box inside of which a coiled rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue
the snake rattles then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box with its mouth wide open
bill falls on the road where he remains seated without moving
the snake with the back half of his body still in the box doesnt seem to know what it must do next
a car arrives at a high rate of speed
since a pick up is parked on the other side of the road the car must zigzag and it barely avoid driving on bill
yelling to the driver
the car honks
we get a close up of the driver when the car comes very close to bill
bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing dead leaves on the bank of the road
he yells to the city worker but with the loud noise of his power blower the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his work
bill crawls back a little then he eventually stands up
he crosses the road and takes a big shovel in the pick up truck
he crosses the road back
the snake is back in the mailbox
bill hits the box very hard with the shovel
snake and mail fall on the road
bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the road
i am not goin back to new york you hear me
youre stuck with me
bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road
he looks at the envelopes
we see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the road
bill with his back to the road is getting ready to enter the house
a car stops and honks
bill turns around to face hector
he comes back to the car
he looks very angry
oh thats perfect
thats really perfect
just like a cop
youre never there when you need one
what did i do now
somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox hector
bill is washing his arms in the sink
you scared the shit out of me outside
oh i scared you huh
what the hell are you doing here
i could use some assistance some of your professional wisdom
im really flattered
everyone in the group has an alibi
except for casey
he says he was alone in his loft
what does that mean
he dries his arms with a dishcloth
what do you make of casey
hes a good kid
youre an asshole capa
bill turns the water off throws the dishcloth on the sink
hector walks in the room while wiping his hands with another dishcloth
should we analyze that statement hector
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
who is our man
youre the cop
figure it out
he gets out of the kitchen followed by hector
you know what i think
i think it was you
youve got the look
yeah i been talking to people who knew you both
everyone says there was a weird competitive thing going between you
they have come to the hall where the security tv screens are located
they stop walking
yeah thats right
i admit it
he was on the way up
and i was on the way down
he whistles miming with both hands something crashing down
it unhinged you
i bet youve seen every episode of columbo huh
sound of a buzz
the two men look at the security screen
who is it
bill taps on the remote control and rose appears on the screen
its me rose
the old fender bender
bill taps again on the remote control to open the gate and rose leaves the tv screen
thats a very young girl to be going around
bill puts the remote control down and follows hector to the main gate
hector is walking to the exit
as he reaches the bottom of the steps rose is going down
bill standing behind a low wall looks at her coming
here she comes
weightless hanging from the sky
wearing a short dress of indeterminate color
its red poor thing
rose takes his hand
i was thinking
maybe i should see a shrink
i can recommend someone
i feel better already
close up on their kissing
god i missed you
they are now at the edge of the pool
this time you wont miss
they fall fully dressed in the pool
they keep on kissing in the water
bill takes her dress off
she wears nothing underneath
we can see a rose tattooed on her buttock
she slips bills short down to his ankles
we get a brief view of bills penis
above water shot
they are now in the water up to their waists
bill is kissing roses breasts
they are back underwater
bill is kissing roses legs and moves slowly up to her crotch
she has trimmed pubic hair but with some left
still kissing bill moves up along her stomach and reaches hers breasts which he kisses greedily
above water shot
bill is leaning his back against the edge of the pool
rose is lying on him
they are still in the water up to their waists
rose is kissing bills chest et goes slowly down his stomach then along one of his legs
we get another brief view of bills penis
we notice that it is not erected certainly to avoid being x rated
multiple shots of bill and rose making love seen through the piece of art
then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each other
shot on the bedroom window and two hand glider in the californian sky
back to the lovers couple
they are sweating profusely
their position and their movements suggest without actually showing it that bill is inside rose
bill turns rose around to put her lying on her stomach
rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very tightly
it is suggested that bill could be sodomizing her
they both moan
the moaning increases with a suggestion of an orgasm
still holding the bedposts
she speaks with a breathless voice
i want you to get dressed up
get dressed up
she turns around to face him
i want to get dressed up
through the window we notice that the night has fallen
bill seated behind the table is wearing brown suit and necktie very elegant
on the table wine and water glasses and two chandeliers with a lighted candle
in front of bill a plate with food
rose enters the field carrying another plate which she sets on the other side of the table
in the plate a piece of grilled beef noodles et vegetables
rose sits behind her plate
as the table is made of glass we see that rose is naked
youre not eating
dont you like my food
id like your food five inches to the left
rose moves the plate to her left showing her naked body though the glass table
but if you dont like this
i have something else for you
i think its ready
she stands up laughing
fade out on the next scene
long scene on the couple making love standing under the shower
fade out on the next scene
bill wakes up naked and alone in the bed
one of his hand is cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap
an archives room congested with shelves from floor to ceiling
on these shelves hundreds and perhaps thousands of files stacked not too cleanly
bill is leaning on one of the shelves
the archivist a forty year old lady appears from behind another shelf apparently coming down some steps
bill stands up
its a miracle
i found it
she starts walking between two rows of shelves
bill follows her putting his glasses on
here he is
legal guardian dale dexter
thats his brother
kids were put under care lets see about six years ago
he tries to read above her shoulder
does it say why
the children were assigned to a uh
she flips a page in the file
niedelmeyer in pasadena
a child psychiatrist
bill tries to come back to the preceding page but the archivist looks angrily at him silently meaning he is going a bit too far
no foster parents
looks like the doctor retired a couple years after that
then we lost track of the kids until recently
what do you mean lost track of them
she closes the file and keeps on walking between the rows of shelves followed by bill
like on a radar one minute a blip the next no blip
this is the lost souls memorial wing
children of l
county of the s cases in here and theres two more down the hall
the room is decorated in quite a luxurious way but with a lot of good taste
paintings on the walls
bed covered with an embroidered bedspread and many cushions
at the foot end of the bed a small upholstered bench
two women enter the room laughing and carrying many parcels which they throw on the bed
nobodys like your ex husband
thats for sure
thats for sure
bonnie takes one of the parcel a large white box
okay okay okay
she takes a white dress out of the box
for the first time we see a close up of her face and we discover she is rose different hairdo a lot of almost vulgar make up but still she
here it is
oh sondra it is so beautiful
isnt it great
look at all these bags
she shamelessly takes off the dress and as she wears no bra she stands naked save for her panties in front of sondra
oh the man that was staring at you in the shop
was so funny
sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend
i think i should have got it in green or something
she has put the white dress on
what do you think
she seems very moved
you look beautiful
come zip me up
she gets up from the bed to zip up roses dress
oh this is so tight
i need to find a new husband
they both laugh
sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking through the parcels
i need some more money
who needs them
have you seen my earrings anywhere
she waves the earrings in front of roses face
yes ive got them
rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by the earrings sondra just gave her
oh my god
i love these
arent they pretty
theyre so gorgeous yes
try yours on
sondra doesnt move feeling very embarrassed by the idea of undressing in front of her friend
she eventually gets up an starts taking off the belt from her suit
rose is putting her jacket on
a long silence sondra looks more and more embarrassed
she snickers stupidly
rose looks at her without really understanding whats going on
she sits back on the bed
i feel embarrassed
the way youre looking at me
do men look at you like that
but its different
she bends to her
you know sondra
it doesnt have to be any different at all
the phone rings
rose starts laughing
you better get that
she takes the phone
oh h hi
she seems embarrassed
rose is making funny faces
um mmm okay
she stammers a little
my trainers coming at but thats
she goes to the window and moves the curtain aside
we see bobs car in the street
um oh there you are
ill see you in a minute
bill drives and holds his car phone on his ear
bill hangs up his car phone
she is looking at herself in the full length mirror
thats my analyst
hes coming to visit me
when she hears sondras last reply roses carefree face becomes very anxious
oh my god
hes coming over
oh thanks a lot
whats the matter
she starts gathering her belongings
if you dont know i thought we were just going to have a nice afternoon together
maybe have dinner
she puts the telephone back on its stand and takes roses arm
well we can
oh dont worry
dont be upset
you can stay here
she closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder
you just dont understand do you
nobody appreciates you the way that i do
people just use you and you dont even see it
oh dont be upset
she turns to rose to look at her face
rose kisses sondra tenderly on the lips
thats more like it
she leaves the room
sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss
she puts her hands on her chest
oh my god
rose gets quickly down the stairs
rose gets large sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before opening the front door
she opens the door to face bill whom she almost jostle to get outside as fast as possible
through a low window we see her going down the stairs to the street
we discover the sitting room next to the hall
good taste expensive furniture nice paintings concert piano
sondra gets down the stairs
bill who was looking around him turns to her
someone just let me in
i didnt just walk in on my own
she closes the front door which had remained open
that was my um
that was my girlfriend bonnie
please come in
thank you very much
he enters the sitting room followed by sondra
this is a really lovely place you have here
he sits on a cushions covered sofa
you think so
she sits on a small sofa without back
a lot of nice nice things
a lot of nice art
she simpers a little
what did you come here for
well i feel like i have so much
so much catching up to do with all of you
and i know that youre very close with richie
and i was wondering if you could tell me anything that might help me
understand him a little better
my little baby
his brother dale thinks that your little baby
should be taken out of therapy
he gets up
i think its a mistake too
he goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park
that dale is a dangerous bastard
but he obviously seems to care for richie a great deal
theres a big gap in richies life up until about a year ago
did he ever mention a dr
niedelmeyer to you
i dont have much to tell
did you know that he was
molested as a child
she has tears in her eyes
no i didnt know that
he comes back to her
its sticking out all over
he sits on the bench of the piano
she laughs nervously
i mean it pays well
at least you know you can write a book go on oprah
that was quite a show he gave us in group
you think richie has a violent streak
lets cut to the chase
richie did not kill bob moore
its really swell
snooping around here
she gets up
sniffing for blood on other peoples hands
while pretending to help your patients
you really think that i dont care about richie
she gets upset
richie wouldnt hurt a fly
why dont you take a look at someone dangerous
why dont you take a look at someone who could do it
why dont you take a look at clark
she gets more and more upset
clark is a sneaky lying button down son of a bitch
who pretends to be this gentle creature
i heard him screaming one night at bob
it made the hairs on my neck stand up
i hope that they fry
whoever did it and it takes a really long time
and then a fuse blows
they have to start all over again
she sits back
bill has been listening to her outburst without reacting
we hear the front door chimes and sondras expression changes immediately
her angry face becomes suddenly softer
she snickers and puts her tongue to her lips
thats my trainer
she gets up and sniffs a bit
i gotta go
i gotta get the door
she goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young man wearing a sleeveless t shirt
this is my trainer chris
chris just nods his head
bill gets out
as soon as the door is closes sondra literally jumps in chris arms and starts giggling
i dont feel like lifting weights today
lets do something else
she bursts laughing
through the low window we see bill going down the stairs to the street
he stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple
bobs car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building on a desert parking lot
the building could be an old factory reconverted by dale into a workshop to make his furniture
a very high chimney above the building
bill dressed in jeans and light colored shirt gets out of the car and walks toward the building
he passes a board that indicates the location of the office
he knocks at a door with a window and a grating and a sign that says beware of the dog
the dog starts barking
bill knocks again
he tries to look through the door window
the dog keeps on barking
bill comes back the way he came toward the office
he stops in front of a window and bends to try to see something inside
he knocks on the window
he turns around and we catch a quick glimpse of someone behind the window
bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men are unloading
is this dale dexters shop here
one of the men nods and shows the main door to bill
entrance of the workshop
the door opens and bill appears
he takes off his sunglasses puts them in the pocket of his shirt and gets in
the workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated
on the roof of a small structure perhaps the quoted office sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to watch bill
bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks
someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood
bill looks around him looking a bit anxious
several men are working
he approaches one of them wearing a sleeveless t shirt and who is welding with a protection mask covering his face
the man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding
he raises his mask its dale
did you go to the house
nobody was home
i would have phoned a
dale shuts his blowtorch off
i would have phone ahead but uh i dont have your phone number in our file
he takes off his mask then his protection gloves
so uh did you make up your mind
niedelmeyer did richie get another psychiatrist
no we moved
dale goes around a huge geometrically shaped metallic structure
richie went to school
everything was fine
thats the problem dale
i look at richie and i dont see that everything is fine
i see a kid thats on the brink
he starts working on the metallic structure but stops to look at bill
a person uh gets a bullet in the head
sometimes they just leave it there cause
to fuck around in the brain is gonna paralyze the person
whats the bullet
whatever it was i got him away
he has taken protection glasses to work
you want to talk about that
i want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs
let the demons rest
you dig around in richies head hes gonna blow up in your face
you think hes violent
not with me
i think youre making a mistake dale
this is not the time to take richie out of therapy
if you dont like me lets get him someone else
one of you is the same as another
bill gets out of his car
he is wearing light colored pants a shirt and a very elegant leather jacket
he walks up a few steps toward the house
he crosses the garden then reaches the very impressive main door of the house
above the door two similar faces are carved in the stone
probably doctor niedelmeyers face
a small panel opens in the door and edith niedelmeyers face appears
hi im bill capa
im a doctor
i tracked you down through the psychiatric institute
how very enterprising of you
she slams the panel shut
a few seconds then she opens the door
actually i was wondering if i could speak to dr
my husband died last year
if it makes you feel better he suffered a lot
well anyway it made me feel better
im treating a young man that was a patient
niedelmeyers when he was a child
his name is richie dexter
why dont you leave me alone
if i could just ask you a few questions
you get out of here before i call the police
she angrily slams the door shut
just a few questions
voice over through the door
get out of here
bill sighs then walks away from the door
the camera moves above the door and ends up on a close up of niedelmeyers carved face who seems to sneer at bill
night is falling on l
clark in the foreground is counting books
behind him richie buck and casey are seated casey in his favorite hand shaped armchair
sondra is standing up
now if im not mistaken
last week there were books on the shelf and this week there are only books on the shelf somehow
whats the ashtray situation
sondra sits down and casey sits in another armchair
not four as recommended
there are three chairs and five assorted sofas
he just came in and is standing by the window
he is wearing his glasses jeans open shirt and a light grey jacket
he turns around to speak to the group
okay lets get started
finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not understandable
an emotional tar baby
today id like to focus on a most enlightening
and challenging topic
she is a bit lasciviously sprawled in her armchair
more or less
you see the primary romantic relationship
in our life is often a symptom of our illness
he has seated himself in the hand shaped armchair
glad i wore my rubber pants
we keep making the same neurotic choices over and over every time we choose a new mate
if you had a magic wand
if you uh had a wish list
and could change your partner
sondra how would you make them different
you need a minute to think about it
shes totally forgot her rolodex
well i dont have an attachment in my life right now
the last one sort of went to pieces
if you enjoy sex
a man thinks youre doing it with everybody
he was jealous
he gets ups walks to a cupboard opens its door and takes a cup
and i was as good as gold
well theres a good chance that he was the one that was sleeping around
and projecting his fantasies and desires onto you
this guy had a major projection and he couldnt keep it in his pants
the whole group laughs
bill smiles while pouring himself a coffee
anyway i do have this girlfriend
she really makes me laugh
a wish list
she was a guy
he comes back with his cup in his hand
casey what do you got for us
he is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a skull
he waits a few seconds and puts the statue down before speaking
i met this girl about a month ago
ive painted every inch of her in detail
shes the best model ive ever seen
does whatever i ask no matter how
ill bet she does
thats right buck
see but this is where the problem comes in
its what you see beneath the skin
when you study somebody endlessly the way an artist does
i see a transcendental beauty there
beyond anything i could ever ever imagine
how does this woman feel about you
she thinks im the living end because ive got talent
but i mean whats talent
kick a garbage can
starving artists crawl out right
but theres only one unique her
and uh i think its love you know
i dont know what to do about that
he is suddenly moved on the verge of tears
do you think she loves you
do you care casey
i dont know
i dont know
hes a romantic
he loves the suffering
maybe being who i am
i have no choice
very good casey
thats good stuff
buck what do you got
oh nothing to talk about not compared to that
its not a contest
he lights a cigarette
hey yard sale you want to share the ashtray
casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent buck from using it
thanks a lot
he gets up
you want to share something share the ashtray
he sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on it
i got something in my life something new
you know shes young
pretty as hell
i see her on weekends
he picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable armchair
i dont think shed sleep with a man unless she was married to him
he has taken his glasses off
anything else youd like to tell us
she doesnt mind the gray you know
its like shes running through my fingers
two people i loved died
i never thought that i could feel anything
how bout you
he is playing with the statue of the monkey
i dont have really relationships
i have m my brother
you want to talk about him
h he worries a a lot about me
and he l loves me
i wish he didnt
love me so m
so much sometimes
i wish l i had more of a l life
he puts the statue down and gets up
and i know that everyone h here thinks that im gay
but im im not
a and i dont want to be
richie opens the cupboard takes a can of pepsi and opens it
what would you like to be
id like t to be a w woman
have you seen a doctor
so the next step is the chop
he cuts him very curtly
thank you buck
anything else youd like to tell us richie
what would you change about your partner
he is manicuring with his handkerchief
um i think ill pass
you think youre gonna pass today
dont you think thats kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group
i mean were all sitting here sharing our most intimate thoughts
and youre just gonna pass today
well sondra i have my little problems
but i dont s see how its your business
your little problems
to decide when im gonna share in group and not
ah i see
is that a smile
you think this is funny
she gets up from her armchair
look at you
just look at you
look at your hair
who do you think you are
you think youre gods gift to women
let me tell you something
you are nothing
nothing but a shallow rigid
self protective anal coward
and ill tell you what your little fucking problems are
he gets ups looking angry
oh shut up
shut up shut up
you promiscuous cunt
and if you must know i do have somebody in my life
black emotional hole unattractive me
he walks nervously to the door
sondra remains standing looking a bit embarrassed
you can say that again
he slams furiously the door
fuck all of you
is this what you call treatment failure
well its not a total loss
he left without counting everything
he puts down the file he was holding in his hand
a quiet little street surrounded by houses an buildings of good standing
children in roller skates are playing hockey on the pavement
hey right here
bobs car arrives in the street
the children moves away to let it pass
while bill is parking the car we hear in voice over the beginning of the conversation between bill and clark
bill is wearing a light colored shirt and beige pants
so pretty soon the relevant numbers werent enough
i had to know all the irrelevant numbers
like the numbers of pages in each deposition
walls are white furniture modern but with good taste
everything is meticulously clean and tidy
bill sits in an armchair
clark is standing by the window
so you were fired
he takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his shirt pocket
he is wearing disposable gloves
he puts his glasses on
just please please dont come back
he sits down and sighs
i do apologize for my outburst in group
youre screwing sondra
he puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket gets back up and start walking in the room
im very fond of sondra
more than that perhaps
a very warmhearted woman but
while talking he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants
cds put back in the rack without cases
frying pans with coagulating grease
i mean my god the cotton balls that woman used
unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the shower
chewed gum in the ashtrays
i made a list
there were items i couldnt take
it must be difficult to find someone
to measure up to your keen sense of order
i found someone
this woman thinks im messy
she comes she goes
i dont even know shes been except for the faint smell of perfume
and what does sondra think of this woman
take a look at this
he goes to a closet from which he gets a paper bag
from the bags he takes out a tattered piece of clothing
sondra tried to do this to my clothes
while i was wearing them butcher knife in hand screaming
the next day she came back did this to my friends dress
im terrified to go near the woman
cars on the freeway
among them bobs car
the car phone is ringing
bill picks up the phone while he keeps on driving
he is wearing sunglasses
hello this is bill capa
giggly voice sounding like a childs voice
hey puke face
cant you see me
im in the red car
bill looks around him on the freeway and sees a red car on his right
you got doo doo in your eyes
or caca on the brain dr
strange sounding giggles
does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket
suck my tinkertoy you faggot cretin
after you suck my scalpel doctor
bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red car which is still following him
the red car catches up with him and bumps into him
bill jumps up
the red car bumps into him a second time and looses part of its radiator grill
bill is now out of the freeway and on a road downtown
the two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars
lot of honking
without warning bill turns on a side street on his right and gets honked by the other cars
in spite of the very dangerous driving of bill among the other cars the red car keeps on following him
to follow bill the red car must take a vey sharp left turn and bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the pavement
the chase goes on
the red car is dented everywhere
it catches up with bill overtakes him and bumps violently into bills car right side
the red car hits him on the right side twice in a row
bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it
they move together and bill tries to bring the red car as close to the curb as possible
get the fuck
the red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open door of a parked car and then knocks down the shopping caddie of a woman
fortunately the woman is able to move away but all her shopping items are scattered on the pavement
the two car bump again into each other and arrive into a main road
when the red car wants to hit bills car again bill stands on the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars
the truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic
the last car on the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road
bill barely avoids it
another car gets loose from the truck and causes a pile up on the road
bill zigzag out of the pile up and comes to a crossing with a railway
a train is approaching
the red car is still behind bill
bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway then starts moving backwards
he hits the front of the red car and keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the railway itself
the train keeps on honking to move the cars away
you wanna die
you wanna die
we see the driver of the train working madly on his brake and looking to the red car with terror in his eyes
just before the train reaches the crossing bill jumps his car forward and the red car quickly moves backward
bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back
we see the train moving behind him
a mexican bar where hector is a regular
the first shot shows two hands playing the harp
then we get a larger shot and we see hector and bill talking together
bill is carrying his jacket on his arm and hector is wearing his necktie very loose
there is quite a crowd in the bar some people dancing others drinking and some are seated to eat
electric lines with colored bulbs are hung in the trees
in the back the orchestra keeps on playing
i told you to stay the fuck out of it
he kisses a passing mexican woman
i almost killed somebody out there
i mean i had that car wedged right on the railroad tracks
its a spooky feeling
like mainlining adrenalin huh
the rush is really something huh
youre my kind of guy
he takes him by the shoulders
they walk out of the field and we see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat
the puppet is dressed in a cops costume
hector and bill come to the buffet table
he gets a notebook from his pocket
you want to hear what i found out about your famous monday group
can stand a little more pain
he takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet
he takes a tray and starts reading
a woman is serving him from the buffet
well clarks wife divorced him
after he put her in intensive care
whatd she do
spill some wine on the rug
then sondra she stabbed her father with a knife
and a fork
she must have been having dinner
one of her husbands died of unnatural causes
probably lost some body fluids
and that that kid richie
that richies been busted for drugs
and casey hates his father so much
he set the house on fire
so what do you think of that
i think its good
they should learn to assert themselves
a very bright light coming from above suddenly shines on the bar
hector and bill raises their heads
we hear the engine of a helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker
hey the house is surrounded
come out with your hands up and your legs spread
what the hell is this
we see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight
happy birthday hector
hey martinez come on out
we got something for you
we get a better view of the helicopter
the word police is written on its fuselage
two uniformed cops are standing on the right skid
one has a megaphone
martinez happy birthday man
the crowd starts singing accompanied by the mexican orchestra
for hes a jolly good fellow
for hes a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
which nobody can deny
bill and hector come in front of the crowd and look up
for hes a jolly good fellow
for hes a jolly good
people yell and whistle
one of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman
she gets her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd
another cop on the other skid has another megaphone
people scream when they see the female cops buttocks
if i had known it was your birthday id have come by tomorrow
the helicopter flies away
large shot on the orchestra singing
estas son las mananitas
que cantaba el rey david
in a corner of the bar bill and hector are eating quietly
thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling
the two men get up to find a shelter
oigan ivengan a buscar el cake
better get your cake
ivengan a buscar el cake
people stop dancing and run to find a shelter
how come you didnt mention buck
there wasnt anything on him
bill drives with lights on and roof closed
on the side of the car we can see the dents from the chase with the red car
bill stops in front of a big vehicle
he switches off the car lights gets out of the car and pulls the collar of his jacket up
he stops near a car parked in front of bucks house
he goes round the vehicle
there is a bullet hole in the windshield
bill touches the bullet hole
he then walks toward the house and stops in front of the open garage door
inside is a red car
bill enters the garage to have a better look at the car
when he gets up after inspecting the car we see buck standing behind him
bill turns around
buck has a gun in his hand
you caught me at a bad time
can we get in out of the rain
slowly buck starts walking toward the inside of the house
bill starts walking too in front of buck
they enter the house
they get inside the house which is lit only by the street lights and a unique lamp above the desk
typical bachelors place
the furniture is simple and practical
we hear the storm rumbling in the distance
have a seat
buck gets into the bathroom the door of which is wide open and grabs a towel
he dries himself and throw the towel to bill
bill sits down
buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan rug
bill dries his face
he looks at the gun still in bucks hand
i dont like guns
buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of his seat
he lies back in his armchair which rocks a little
bill takes his jacket off
a lightning floods the room with a very bright light
buck puts his hands on his face
was it raining like this that night
we were drivin
me my wife my daughter
this guy comes out wavin stop
so i slow down
my wife said no not here buck
its a bad neighborhood
besides the babys asleep in the back
and i said bad neighborhood nothing
so i stopped
never even made it to the other car
i could hear the shots being fired but my eyes wouldnt open
buck puts his hands on his head
the rain brought me around
this heavy heavy rain
and im on the sidewalk and i crawl over
and pull my way up and
there are two lateral shots
to the head for my wife
and a single shot through the heart for my daughter
oh jesus god
they got uh
the rain nails me every time man
did they ever find out who did it
i think it was some kind of payback for something
but thats a long story
the rain has stopped but the ground is still wet
the garage door opens slowly and bobs car enters the garage
the roof is still closed
bill is on the phone
a telephone rings in an empty office separated by a glass partition from the corridor
the door is open and anderson comes running in with a ready cooked dish in his hand
he picks up the phone
what can i do for you
low angle shot of the office showing the high ceiling with a vintage decoration contrasting with the modern and functional furniture
oh yeah yeah
the bob moore murder case
the car has stopped but bill still holds the phone
i need to talk to you
same low angle shot
i hope youre an early riser
i get off at
he puts the phone down gets his car keys and his jacket and leaves the car
bill gets out of the car and seems very intrigued by the fact that the keyhole shaped door is open
he shuts his car door and walks quietly toward the house
he looks around him in the garden seeming more and more anxious
finally he enters the house
still anxious bill walks along the corridor
bill enters the kitchen
a lot of cooking ingredients scattered on the table
a noise makes bill turn around
rose who was kneeling behind the table stands up
she smiles when she sees bill
the only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel room maid white apron
can i get you something
bill doesnt react at all
he looks shocked
she crosses the room to get something in a drawer showing her naked buttocks
all of a sudden she seems to remember she is naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on her buttocks
i forgot about that
she laughs then comes back to the stove where she moves a dish
bills face still looks very shocked
how did you get in here
last time i was here i stole the key
it was by the door
what about the alarm
i never thought about that
it didnt go off
um did i make a mistake
you have someone in the car
no goddamn it there isnt someone in the car
people are getting killed around here
you walk around like its goddamn disneyland
what if something were to happen to you
she seems not to understand bills anger
i just thought that it would be a nice surprise thats all
you dont look too happy to see me
he waits a few second before he cools down
this is my happiness mode
she is crying
bill comes to her and takes her in his arms
baby im sorry
this is a very nice surprise
he gives a quick look at her naked body
ill never take a risk like that again
why dont you take the biggest risk of all and give me
your phone number
she laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking
i cant have people tying up the phone lines
im trying to run a business here
bill with his shirt completely open eats spaghettis in front of a lighted candle
rose also eats spaghettis still dressed only in her white apron
bill drinks from a glass of white wine
rose bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way
under the glass table we can see bills naked foot stroking roses foot
with her other foot rose moves bills pants up
rose slides down on her chair so bill can reach her feet with his hands
then rose slides completely out of her chair and under the table
a toy remote controlled tank is moving on roses naked legs
the shot gets larger and we discover that rose is in a bathtub full of foaming water
general patton comes out of the foothills
the tank moves on roses pubis then on her stomach
oh hes in the swamp
oh oh hes in the deep abyss
the tank skid on roses naked skin and doesnt succeed in climbing on her breast
we then see she is lying on her back on bills naked body who is also lying on this back in the bathtub
oh hes having a problem
hes up in the swiss alps ladies and gentlemen
they both laugh
we see bills hand holding the remote control
a direct hit
the tank skids into the water and stops
voice ironically disappointed
oh our our tank fleet is crippled
its goin away
she turns around and we guess she is grabbing bills penis under water
hows the submarine fleet
hey hey hey hey please please
i gotta get some sleep
oh youre chicken
i gotta be up
i gotta be up at in the morning
she turns around to kiss him
youre chicken chicken
tracking shot down a high glass building until it reaches the entrance of the grand central market
we hear anderson and bill in voice over
nobody told me buck was one of your patients
nobody like martinez
thats the same nobody who didnt tell me buck was a cop
the camera is now on street level and we see bill and anderson crossing the street towards the main gate of the market
they pass a truck delivering fresh meat
thats a can of worms you dont want to mess with
what about buck
they enter the market
hey look you gotta promise
if i tell you what i know about this shit it stays between me and you
and you never heard it from me okay
they walk in the market alleyways
anderson stops near a stall and starts talking to a stall holder we do not see
two uniformed cops are walking between the stalls
anderson raises his voice to them
because cops are vindictive sons of bitches
he throws a chicory to a cop who catches it
the cops are gone away
anderson lowers his voice
i dont want to spend the rest of my career getting pissed on from above okay
he laughs nervously
martinez was nailin bucks wife
both these guys were in narcotics
and those guys usually stick together like shit on a shirt
so who knows how long its been going on
anyway one day it came out
in the station they had this big fight in front of everybody
anderson takes two little wrapped packages from the unseen stall holder and gives one to bill
two days later bucks wife gets blown away
he follow anderson between the stalls
was there an investigation
of course there was an investigation
martinez was a suspect
buck was a suspect
i mean nobody figured buck forgiving her
for a while half the station was a suspect
what do you think
i think buck and martinez had a lot of enemies on the street
this was just payback for both of em
they have come to a fishmonger stall
the fishmonger wraps a fish for anderson
casey is lying on an exercise bench and lifting weight with a pulleys and cables device
the phone rings
casey doesnt move
hi this is casey
cant get to the phone right now but please leave a message
a beep then bills voice
casey its bill capa
i got your message and sure i can make it today
are you there
a hand appears holding a leather collar which the hand wraps around caseys neck
what the hell are you doing here
listen casey y you sounded a little upset
just hang in there okay
let me get this huh
ill be by this morning
so ill see you in
well you think you can do it in
he snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck
bobs car stops in front of the building
bill wearing sunglasses gets out of the car and walks toward a three story impressive but a bit dilapidated brick building
evidently it is an old workshop changed into an artists loft
we can still read nate starkman son on the front of the building
bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom button
he tries again
he raises his head to the above windows
he walks a few steps back to get a better view of the building
casey is still lying on his exercise bench
both his hands are tied to the weight lifting device and his mouth is gagged
he groans through the gag
he puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder
he comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several times
he raises his eyes and notice a folded fire exit ladder
he test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of the doors
it seems strong enough for him to climb it
he reaches the ladder which he brings down
bill is now on the roof of the building
he jumps down in a sort of yard in which are scattered various objects plants modern furnitures and a full size very realistic plastic sculpture of a cow
bill remains crouched a few second pats the cows snout stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of the yard
he notices he is above caseys workshop
he walks along the glass wall to a closed window from which smoke is coming out
oh jesus christ
bill succeeds in forcing the window open
a big cloud of smoke gets out of it
he walks through the open window
bill walks on the upper gallery coughing with the smoke
he takes off his sunglasses
down he sees flames around the mantlepiece
he gets very quickly down the steps to ground level
he goes to the mantlepiece
what looks like pieces of paper are burning on the floor around the mantlepiece
he first tries to put the flames out with his foot then he takes a small shovel and shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece
a curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop flooding the room with bright light
bill walks to the center of the room and notice that paintings have been lacerated
on each one it is the face of a red hair woman which has been taken away
bill runs back to the mantlepiece where he picks up a piece of what he first thought was a piece of paper but which is actually a piece of canvas
from the paintings
on the half burned piece of canvas the face of a woman who is heavily made up but looks slightly like rose
he puts the piece of canvas down and notice a slimy liquid on the floor
he turns around to try to find out more about this slimy liquid
he pulls a rope and the painting hooked on an horizontal cable line start moving toward him
behind the paintings hooked on the same cable comes caseys body hanging upside down
he looks dead and sill have the gag on this mouth
the half naked body is covered with graffitis
the slimy liquid on the floor is caseys blood
suddenly the blood which was grey seen through bills eyes turns red
sondra is driving
rose is on the passenger seat with her bonnies hairdo and make up
the car radio is playing a song
i love this song
two thirty year old men in an open convertible red car
you girls want to go dancing
were going to a party
rose bends over sondra and kisses her tenderly
well pardon me
the two men look disappointed
their car speeds up and goes away
the two women start laughing
rose stands up through the open roof of the car
she waves to the passing cars
she then sits down and moves tenderly very close to sondra
what are you doing
rose takes sondras hand and guide it under her skirt toward her crotch
sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away
rose keeps on cuddling sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving
music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption
the two girls are dancing in front of the mirror
sondra is wearing a tight fitting black dress and rose a skirt and a short top which shows her belly
out all night lady did
when nobody else would
lady did and she did it real good
once was not enough
tell me katie what would your mama say
oh im gonna go change the music
while sondra moves away to change the music rose goes to the window
in the house across the street she sees a couple kissing
the music stops
sondra come here
oh come here
she comes near rose
oh my god

they do this all the time
she bends down under the window sill and get sondra down too
theyre gonna see you

the two girls start cuddling each other
sondra strokes roses naked stomach then her face
close up on the mirror which shows the fire in the mantelpiece between the girls legs
sondra through the window
the camera remains on the mirror which shows the two girls climbing on the bed to get a better look
oh what are they doing now
i cant tell
are they gonna do it
we see the couple in the house across the street
she is only wearing panties and her breast is naked
he is only wearing his trunks
they flirt on the couch
its gonna happen right now
back to the mirror shot
the two girls still standing up are slapping each other buttocks
rose raises sondras dress
oh im sorry
she sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass
sondra comes and sits next to her
rose gives her her glass
sondra gives the glass back to rose who puts it on a furniture
the two faces come very close and the two girls start exchanging tender little kisses
then rose moves sondras dress down and takes her own top off showing her breast
sondra seems very moved by what she sees
she strokes roses face
their lips are getting very close
we see sondras hand going down roses back and slipping under the top of her skirt showing her buttocks
we see the tattooed rose
she moves her face away from sondra
no no sondra
sondra im a jinx
we can cancel each other out
she sobs a little
im not who you think i am
oh god im in love with somebody and its all falling apart
look the sky isnt falling down
yes it is
lets get that silly thing off your head
i love your brown hair
she strokes her hair
bill sleeps on a leather couch dressed with a western style shirt and jeans
there is a gun on the low table near his head
we hear a buzz
bill wakes up gets up and looks at the security tv set
he takes the remote control to change the camera
who is it
after two unsuccessful pictures rose appears on the screen
she is wearing very short pants a flowered blouse knotted under her breast and a small backpack
bill opens the gate and looks through the window at rose crossing the garden
here she comes
wearing a backpack on her back
making her look even younger than she is
rose enters the room puts her backpack down and falls in bills arms
she falls into his arms
and they kiss
im so glad that youre here
i didnt know if youd be in
i dont have to be anywhere until this evening
she opens her blouse
she doesnt wear a bra and her nipple appears
so what color are my nipples
they both laugh
she covers and uncovers her nipple
they kiss tenderly
to be normal like this all the time
oh god this is better than normal
this is much better than normal
its just driving me crazy thats all
i mean i dont really know you
who you are
what you do
if youre safe when youre coming by
you have all the power
i just sit around here and wait for you
i mean other things happen but
in the what i wait for department youre it
time has elapsed
they are now seated next to each other
bill is bare chest and rose is wearing one of bills denim shirts
they look at a photo album
rose puts her finger on the pictures and bill tells her who it is
my ex wife
pretty fucked up
rose flips the page
a picture of bob
i forget that hes dead
she kisses him tenderly to comfort him
she flips the page
he looks so young here
god how long ago were these taken
ten years ago
do you have anything more recent
he gets up and goes to the shelves
he start looking for another album
i dont know why he kept this hidden back here except maybe
because it had a picture of his wife naked which leads me to believe that
the relationship wasnt as dead as they were pretending
he sits back next to rose and start looking at the new album
i dont know who these people are
she seems very worried all of a sudden
i dont want to see anymore
lets go outside
lets pretend its sunday
bill looks at her a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction
we hear the birds chirping
by the poolside bill is lying on his back on a mattress
he is wearing sunglasses and is naked except for a white towel spread on his pelvis
rose is lying on her stomach head to foot with bill
she is naked but is wearing one thick woolen sock on one foot
one of my patients was killed last night
he was murdered
she seems very disturbed by the news
she has tears in her eyes
were you there
a little bit after
what did you see
you dont want to know
he takes off his sunglasses and start getting up covering his crotch with the towel
about a half hour before group
im gonna get a shower
you gonna be okay out here
bill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on
then he gets out of the room
bill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on without underwear
rose has dressed up
she enters the room and goes directly to the shelf where the photo album was hidden
she gets it and starts turning the pages
bill comes out of the dressing room and into a gallery above the sitting room
he sees rose looking through the album taking a picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it was
he hides behind a wall for her not to see him
she is looking inside a photo lab envelope
bill comes out of his hiding
she drops the envelope picks up her backpack and runs out of the room
rose runs to the keyhole shaped door
the gate opens and rose runs out
bill runs down the stair from the upper gallery
he is bare chest with his shirt in his hand
rose gets out of the residence and runs to her car a small orv
she climbs in and starts very fast
bill gets out of the house
he jumps into his car without opening the door
bobs car gets out of the residence
we see bill driving his car
he chases rose whom we then see in her car
tires screech with the high speed driving
bill comes closer to rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers
the chase goes on
rose drives very recklessly bill too
he drives through the cross roads without slowing down
a man who was seated on a low wall has to climb on it to avoid bills car which is driving on the sidewalk
bill stops near him
we hear the voice of an angry woman
stupid crazy bastard
theyll give anybody a license
outside night has fallen and it is raining
he is very smartly dressed and even wears a bow tie
he counts the books on the shelves
five and six are
seven seven that makes
and that will remain and every single time you count it it will be no matter what
and then this is five and that makes
and nine is
now thats odd
thats really odd
now theres again
he has just come into the room
well last week
there were books on the bookshelf where there is always
and i mean always books and this week there are again so i dont
he turns toward sondra
which one sondra
she is very smartly dressed too in a white suit with black collar
i didnt read any of it
i felt so bad when i got it home
i couldnt help myself
he moves rapidly to the shelves
which one sondra
the van gogh
but i didnt read any of it
honestly i promise
bill takes the book and moves away from the shelves
sondra signs menacingly to clark
what did i do
bill has seated himself and he looks through the book
sondra tries to read above his shoulder
close up of the book
it is bobs diary
close up on one paragraph
we hear bobs voice reading the paragraph
i was right about the threats from the monday group
this cycle of pain
yesterdays victim becomes tomorrows monster
todays the day
buck enters the room
buck starts closing the door but richie comes in
buck sits down
is not gonna be joining us tonight so i think we should get started
buck puts his hands on his head
richie looks at him
buck are you all right
its none of your fucking business
you know i cant stand this arguing
id like to start if i may
id like to apologize to the group and sondra
while he is talking bill keeps on looking through his friends diary
a photo is stuck between two pages
it is a photo of rose naked
everything that you said last week in group was right and thats why i lost my temper
uh the young lady that i mentioned last week
that relationship has been terminated
no reason and no hope
she just just called
and told me and thats it
he reads what is written on the back of the photo
the sociopath lacking the restraints that
hold a normal character together can become anything
amorality frees her to be universally perfect
a charming chameleon with a scorpions tail
do any of you recognize
recognize this woman
he gives the photo to sondra
she laughs and brings the picture to her chest
oh my god
this is my girlfriend
this is bonnie
he tears the picture away from her hands
give me that
he looks at the picture and turns to her
this your bonnie
this is your bonnie
the one youve been boring the living shit out of us with
this is the one thats saving you from yourself
your shopping mall hag
the one that makes you smile
the one that you wish was a man
what are you getting at buck
is that it
thats right thats it
thats right thats right
this is my bonnie
she bursts laughing but she has tears in her eyes
i dont believe you
bill looks intensely at her
sondra has started sobbing
he tears the picture away from bucks hands
let me see that
he puts his head in his hands
he looks at the picture
well yes of course
this is the woman that ive been talking about
this is my bonnie
buck tears the picture away from his hands
goddamn it buck

hey hey hey
they are ready to fight
sondra comes between them
the three of them are talking together
youre lying to me
why are you lying to me
stop acting like an
like an emotional child
goddamn tar baby
youre making it up

nobodys making anything up
and stop it stop it stop it
during this heated verbal exchange richie has picked the fallen picture from the floor
youre crumpling the picture up
i want you to stop showing off
youre a little brat
you have the emotions of a styrofoam cup
we see richie putting the picture away and leaving hurriedly
you calm down and you stop
wheres the picture
lightning thunder and the pictures appears close up in a hand
it is hectors hand who looks at them all sneering
how in the name of god
could all of you be going out with the same woman and not know
not have a clue
including you mr
psycho fucking analyst
not to mention bob moore
who probably took this amazing picture himself in front of his expensive painting
im gonna call the guinness book of world records
because i think this woman deserves credit
and im gonna make sure that all of your names are included
so you can all share in the glory
well you should know something about sharing huh hector
i mean you and buck must have shared some very tender moments
discussing his wife
why didnt you tell me the truth
what truth is that
why didnt you tell me buck was a cop
not to mention a suspect in a murder case
not to mention you goddamn it
im not your patient and i dont have to tell you shit
he jumps on hector
bucks tries to take them apart
thats right you dont have to tell me shit

he has succeeded in taking them apart
get the fuck out of here
one fuckin thing
can you do that buck
you really know how to pick your women you know that
i know you cant
you lyin sack of shit
he wants to jump again on hector
buck holds him back
you cant fuckin do it
after my wife died i wanted to slaughter this cock sucker
but i realized we both loved her
it became a sort of a bond between us
isnt that right hector
i never got the chance to forgive her
so i forgave him instead
so much for the famous fucking monday group
now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no address
now the cops need your help
what about the car
anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers
the license plates numbers
we didnt even
bill looks at hector but says nothing
well i didnt think to to to write it down
revolving door of the entrance of the hotel
people are coming incessantly in and out
among them we see bill coming in
the following dialogue is in voice over on the shot of the revolving door
hey welcome back to l
put my bags in my room
ashland from new york with the psychiatric convention
in the health club
larry dressed in tracksuit is working with one of the fitness devices
bill is standing in front of him
i dont think she is a sociopath
well then how about something simple and snappy like a multiple personality disorder
youve fallen into a trap
you are not well
she is not well
and to you iit feels like a bond
he gets up and starts walking in the room
bill follow him
shes been acting this thing out as if
its the only way for her to have a life
larry is sitting in a whirlpool
hot water is bubbling all around him
bill is seated by the pool side
you really want to go on seeing her do you
yes i want to see her
in a a nonprofessional sense
in every sense
i dont have your magical tuning fork
all i know is that two people are dead
and she seems an excellent suspect
bill salmon swim upstream to mate and die
and so do men
is that what im doing
anderson is walking in the street a coffee paper cup in his hand
he is wearing suit and sunglasses but also a very flashy necktie
bill dressed in open shirt and sunglasses walks toward him
i need your help with something
hey man how ya doin
they start walking together in the street
im sitting in a restaurant last night and im looking out the window
watching this woman trying to back out of a space right in front of mine
a beautiful woman
anyway the next thing i know she busted out the headlight on my car
drives away right
i dont even think she knew what she did
but youd like to meet her
bill answers with a silly smile
all right um ill see what i can do
you got the license number
he gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to anderson
the two men split up
anderson walks into the police office
bobs car still dented all over starts with open roof and bill driving
he is wearing sunglasses
as the car passes a crossroad we see coming on its right the red car also dented all over
it starts following bill
bill parks his car on a parking lot at the bottom of a parking building
the red car climbs to the roof of the building
bill cuts the ignition off takes his keys and gets out of the car
he starts walking along the building the red car following him from the roof
the red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof then starts pushing the car
the car breaks the guardrail and falls down to the ground
bill raises his head sees the car coming down jumps away and falls flat on the ground just avoiding the falling car which crashes on two other parked cars
we see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken guardrail
bill bangs his fist on the ground while pieces of broken cars are flying all around him
a very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries
on one of the galleries anderson walks toward hector who is pointing a menacing finger to him
i ought to shoot you
i came to make amends
so make em loudmouth
full shot of the building
very typical l
architecture looking almost like a movie set
anderson and hector are leaning against the bannister of one of the upper galleries
i just spoke to bill capa
this license plate might belong to our mystery lady
close up on anderson and hector
anderson gives to hector the piece of paper bill had given to him
hector reads the paper
bill runs to the door of the house
he knocks repeatedly and forcefully
edith niedelmeyer opens the small panel in the door
she looks furious
you leave me alone
get away from here
i need your help please
why are you torturing me like this
edith closes the small panel
several heavy blows on the door which eventually crashes open and gives access to bill
the house is very heavily decorated
i need you to listen to me
my best friend was killed
he was stabbed with a knife
you get out of my house
times in the chest
you you go away
he follows her through the sitting room
they arrive near a bay window behind which we can see a large swimming pool
another patient was bled to death
i think that i might be next
i dont have anywhere else to go mrs
what are you hiding from me
what is it
why wont you tell me the truth
edith picks up a cordless phone on a table
bill tears the phone away from her hands
put that phone down
im calling the police
put the phone down
put the phone down
she falls on the armchair in which bill has pushed her
what kind of twisted creature are you
ive never done anything to you
my patient richie is involved
why in gods name are you doing this horrible joke
if you just help me
richie dexter is dead
he killed himself four years ago
because he couldnt stand
what my husband was doing to him
she gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door
she leans against the frame of the door
he hung himself with a belt
i didnt know
i mean how could i know
what about the family
he is survived by his brother dale
if richie dexter were alive today
hed be years old
he also had a sister rose
bill stands still for a few seconds
he has just understood the truth
then he sighs and rushes out of the house
he runs near a impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling its tongue out
bobs car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of dales workshop
the atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than during the day
lightnings in the sky
there are lights evenly placed all along the high chimney
several windows are lit on the first floor of the building
bill parks the car in front of the building gets out the car and runs toward the building
he enters using the door with the sign beware of dog
bill gets in the living quarters of the dexter
it is quite dark
in one corner a large kitsch statue of christ of the sacred heart
a sink with two cabinets with glass doors
bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop
bill walks between statues being worked on
he bumps into a small cage hanging from the ceiling
he opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with spiderwebs
something liquid drops on his hand
bill raises his head
though a gate in the ceiling he sees the crying face of richie
he gets out of the small room takes a big piece of carved wood on a table and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the workshop
when he arrives in the upper gallery he menacingly waves the piece of wood and walks very cautiously
richie is seated with his back to him
he has blood on his t shirt
he gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down
when he is close to richie he sees that his t shirt is badly torn down and full of blood
he wants to touch it but richie starts moaning
bill kneels near him
what did he
what did he do to you
he can hardly talk and stammers even more than usual
w what i
y you shouldnt be here
get away from me
i have to see rose
he takes off richies glasses
i need her
he takes off richies wig and roses face appears
she has gone back to roses voice and doesnt stammer anymore
get away from me please
youll make it worse
l i dont know but hell be back
l i dont know where he is
he is also crying
was this your idea to become richie
l it happened
it just happened
what happened rose
i need to know
when richie died
dale buried the body and then he said richie come here
and i told him i told him my name is rose
he slapped me so hard i couldnt get up
a and he he made me dress in these clothes
and h he did things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore
i was richie from then on
what happened to rose
after a while i forgot about rose
then richie got busted
and you had to come to group
they were our world
they were our family
but then what
rose started coming back
rose rose was too scared so bonnie came out
bonnie was first
help me please
rose moves her eyes down and bill follows her eyes
he discovers that roses hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the armchair
oh my god
bill stands up
he goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and start looking for an appropriate tool
he finds a big hammer
that crazy bastard
with the forked end of the hammer he raises the nail
she cries and yells
bill gets the nail off
rose cant breathe anymore
her eyes are rolling upwards
he feels that she is going away from him
she goes back to richies voice and face
she starts stammering again
get away f from me
rose come back
richie leave her alone
still talking like richie
i never get to be out a anymore
roses head stands up she is gone back being rose
and then i met you and the fog
started to lift
bill takes off the other nail
come on lets go
he helps her to stand up and then to walk
here we go
they start going down to the workshop
here we go
here we go
we hear the sound of a nail gun and a nail clicks on a piece of metal near them
several nail gun shots
nails are getting stuck in the various wooden objects around them
shot from behind dale
he holds a nail gun and keeps on shooting nails
he sticks a nail in bills shirt
bill remains nailed against a carved wooden panel
she yells and holds bill tightly
no dale dont
quick tongue slow wit
bill tries to take the nail off
the nail must have gone through his flesh because there is blood on his shirt
dale raises his nail gun slowly but hector appears from behind a wall holding a real gun
you fucking daffodil
put that toy down
put it in the toolbox
caliber nails in this gun
what are you doing here martinez
he talks to bill who is behind him but without taking his eyes away from dale
arent you glad im here
anderson snitched you out
thats what happens when you try to outsmart a cop
let that be your psych lesson for the day
at the end of his sentence hector slightly turns his head toward bill
immediately dale shoots him
hector bends down a little because of the pain and stands back up to shoot dale
but dale is faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood panel
get over there
get over there
dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in hectors fingers
bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm
he runs away with rose
we follows them through the workshop
as they reach a staircase we hear an engine starting
then a whole block of shelves falls in front of them
we see dale in a small glass cabin his hands on the controls of a handling machine
bill moves rose away from him
just as a huge piece of furniture falls on bill who falls down stuck under the furniture
dale appears behind bill and wraps a leather belt around his neck
he tightens the belt
dale pulls him by the belt across the workshop
he puts him inside a metal cage
he ties the belt on the top of the cage
bill tries with both hands to move the belt away from his throat
you fucking son of a bitch
dale takes a small electric saw switches it on and tests it on the bars of the cage
sparks spring up
you really fucked it up didnt ya
got your little brother killed
you let old niedelmeyer do it to him
no i saved him
you knew what was happening
i didnt know
because it happened to you before
would you goddamn shut up
could have saved your little brother but he killed himself
he is getting angry
shut the fuck up
you failed dale
and you made rose become richie
he calms down and smiles
oh youre smart
youre really smart
bob moore was smart but i put a stop to that
yeah you did
whyd you kill casey dale
why are you head shrinkers all alike huh
y you cant keep your fucking hands off of us
always pokin and pushin
while talking he keeps on switching his saw on and off
whyd you do it dale
that little bitch rose she started sneaking out
playing like bonnie modeling for him night after night
christ bill he was lookin right through her
gonna recognize richie in group
well i might have missed old niedelmeyer
but i sure as hell got bob
he starts his saw
sparks spring up on the edge of the cage
im gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off
the inspiration of madness dale
the tyranny of normalcy bill
he starts his saw again and slowly moves it close to bill
we hear the sound of the nail gun and a nail gets stuck in dales shoulder
the saw stops
dale walks back a few steps to face rose holding the nail gun pointed on him
my name is
my name is rose
he rushes on her
she shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of his forehead
dale falls down
rose starts screaming
bill tries to get the belt off his neck
rose raises the gun to her throat and presses the trigger
but it doesnt work
she tries again
it still doesnt work
the gun must be empty
bill eventually succeeds in getting free but rose after she has thrown the gun away starts running through the workshop
he runs after her
rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the chimney
bill follows her and yells
rain is soaking both of them but they keep on climbing
thunder is rumbling
a long distance shot shows the whole chimney with rose and bill climbing on it
for gods sakes dont jump
she has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney
he reaches the platform
rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform
just stay there
its too late
ive gone too far
i cant go back
if you go i go
i swear to god
i swear to god
why would you do that
please god just come over here
i dont want you to die
just give me your hand
take a risk
theres no risk in dying
she puts her hand out to bills strutted hand
we hear the sound of a high gust of wind and rose looses her balance and starts falling backward
bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the platform
his momentum makes him swing and he catches roses arm just as she was falling from the outer ring
with his other arm he holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth
they eventually reach the chimney ladder
rose grabs one of the rungs followed by bill who pushes her up
they move back to the platform and as soon as they reach it they hug each other very tight
bill looks at the beacon on the top of the chimney
from white the beacon becomes red which is its real color
bill smiles he sees red again
he hugs rose even more tightly
while the camera pans away from the platfom showing the whole platform with bill and rose holding each other we hear hectors voice
listen up you fucking daffodils
you gonna leave me hanging here all night huh
bill starts laughing
get me down you goddamn cuckoos
get me some fucking band aids
bill keeps on laughing
rose starts laughing too
come on you fucking daffodils
get me out of here
during the credits we hear the following song you and i moving in the dark bodies close but souls apart shadowed smiles secrets unrevealed i need to know the way
