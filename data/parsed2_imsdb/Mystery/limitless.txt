written by leslie dixon based on the novel by alan glynn december they found me
being pounded in
whoevers trying to get in is serious
the door shudders but doesnt give
its state of the art residential protection
i might have five minutes
we hear the whrrrrr of power tools going to work on his door
these people are determined
ill never know how they got past security in a half billion dollar building
the sleek lobby is deserted
we see through the glass lying on the floor the barest glimpse of the feet of what are presumably two dead security guards although their bodies are largely hidden behind
their massive curly walnut desk
all the security monitors are black the feeds clearly cut
theyve become sophisticated
before they couldnt have done this
the camera rises breathlessly in a blur up all floors of this stunning new building coming to rest on
s lean and stylish standing on the exterior ledge of his multimillion dollar terrace
new york city looms around him beneath him
his hands are outstretched
he is calm but fatalistic
hes clearly going to jump
i will never let them touch me
his attention is caught by the sounds of a commotion in the next apartment
he looks over at
through the gauzy curtains of the window two men force a middle aged man towards the windows
there is arguing
my neighbor mustve heard the noise
opened his door to complain
two muffled shots the neighbor drops
the door is pounded again
it doesnt give
he bought me half a minute
i wish he hadnt
last thoughts are self pitying and mine are no exception the waste
the waste of it all
i mean how many of us ever know what it is to become
the perfect version of ourselves
id come that close
to having an impact on the world
the pounding intensifies
and now the only thing id have an impact on
he looks over the railing
was the sidewalk
his smile is bitter as we cut to not so long ago this was me
eddie is walking down the street messily eating a street falafel
his hair is longer his clothes schlumpier his face rounder hes out of shape
a belly bulges against his belt
he wears jeans and that worn out corduroy writers sport coat the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the salvation army
i was a writer
two years after my copywriting job at dexter kerr came to a non mutual end i had in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy bullshitted my way into my first
this was it eddie slumped in his desk chair is playing computer now at last i was ready to write
quick cuts eddie sprawled on the couch eating takeout and watching tv the sink in the foreground full of dishes
eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop
gearing up thats all
eddie sleeping in his bed sacked out the clock beside him clicking to a
eddie sitting on the john playing a game on his childhood game boy
a few days did pass this way
maybe a few months
eddie at his desk
he glances at his land line
the message light is unblinkingly green
no ones called
his pov pans to the foot high stack of unpaid bills next to the answering machine
and banks became attentive
but just in case you think nothing ever happened to me
a female hand slides a key across the counter to eddie
eddie stares in disbelief at his now ex girlfriend lindy an attractive real looking girl late s
shes dressed in a professional suit
she looks very sad
i dont think i can keep this
eddie is broadsided
just like that
she shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy
i was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just if i didnt care maybe id be able to stand to watch you do this
look im going to give pages to mark on friday
if you could just wait see what he says stop
you think i dont know what you do all day
ive loved you
i know the good stuff and i know the shit
and its all shit to you now
youre the one living it
dont think i dont know its worse for you
then you know i could use a friend
he tries to push the key back
he cares about her but hes also working her sympathy which she instantly smells
dont you dare try that shit on me
she pierces eddie with a look
doesnt take the key
well whatll work then
they both almost laugh
they know each other so well
but she looks away steeling herself
i see where its going
youll lose your apartment
and then what
youll move in with me not with that enthusiastic invite and then itll go on this way and ill rag on you and finally boot you out and then what
i mean have you run the film
she knew what was beckoning the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in newark
wed even had sex on it once
and it was a thing to be pitied and avoided
drops the glib tone
looks at her finally mustering the honesty she deserves
i really thought i had it in me to do something
i wasnt getting around it but it was fucking there
and now i ah
dont think it is
lindy looks at him clear eyed seeing him as he is and loving him anyway
you know what
id have had you move in anyway
she looks away
its hard for her to admit this
if it was me you wanted
and not melissa
i never think about melissa
we are in eddies mind in his pov and we are seeing a lovely willowy brunette wearing an undershirt bending seductively over him
from eddies eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh
she shakes her head looks away
its clearly over
she gets up
i have to get back
hey well wait you didnt tell me what happened yesterday
we can see on lindys face that shes still vulnerably pleased that eddie remembered to ask
i got it
you got it
ill have my own assistant
you believe that
you deserve it lindy
she smiles weakly breaks eye contact
no good to keep looking
eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check which lindy grabs
he knows she knows he cant pay
eddie is walking home eying the homeless on the street feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck
she was right
i was almost
no one talks about potential at
i had missed the on ramp
soon id be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom
my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory
hes interrupted by a voice calm amused eddie
vernon gant looks him over with condescending bemusment
hes wears an expensive suit looks like he comes from money
of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs is there any more useless than
the ex brother in law
its gotta be years
but whos counting
taking him in hey you
he genially whacks the sides of eddies arms
eddie halfheartedly whacks back
vernon sizes eddie up
jesus eddie pack it on why dont you
eddie didnt need that
hes very self conscious about his weight
sedentary job you know
so youre still trying to write
as a matter of fact ive got a book contract
vern looks half suspicious half impressed
how about you
still dealing vernon
do i look like im still dealing
eddie sizes him up the suit shoes watch haircut
come on lets get a drink
i wanna hear about this book
nah i should go you cant tell me youre a health nut now
not with that tire enticing invitation
vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from eddies upper jacket pocket
cmon cmon one beer
or i wont give em back
he holds the cigarettes just out of eddies reach
its one oclock in the afternoon vern
whens that ever stopped you
a bartender brings beers to eddie and vernon who sit at the bar
eddie clearly wishes he were elsewhere
thats why you agreed to the beer
im making conversation vern
well i dont know how melissa is
melissa naked silhouetted in the bathroom door
back to how dont you know
youre her brother
i dont see her
she lives upstate now shes got some kinda internet home sales kinda job
a couple of kids
this is unfathomable to eddie
he tries to keep his voice casual
a couple of kids
melissa her lovely face over a mirror doing lines
back to whos the husband
what are you jealous
its just a question vern
vernon can sense his emotion
walked out on her if you really want to know
but what do you care
you guys werent even married six months were you
i mean it was just a coke thing right
is that what she said
a coke thing
it unexpectedly hurts eddie
maybe its just a bummer day
or theres a deeper wound than he knew
but i wanna know about this book
hows it going
considering the question hows it going
im behind on my book and its pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know
how much have you written of it
not one fucking word vern
creative problem huh
vern appraises him
i think i have something that can help you
he reaches into his pocket
eddie thinks he knows whats coming
oh no no no no you dont even know what it is
youre still dealing
no yeah will you listen
this isnt recreational
ive been doing some consulting for a you mean a lab in some little yalies basement
give me a no this is an exclusive product coming on stream next year theyve had clinical trials and its fda approved
a long beat
okay what is it
vern reaches into his jacket produces a tiny plastic sachet with his right hand tapping something out into the palm of his left
he holds this up for eddie to see
a tiny white whats in it
vern puts the little white tablet on the bar
just take it
get you over the hump
im too old for this vernon
look theyve identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits and you know how they say you can only access like percent of your brain
well what this does vernon
look at me
do i look good
i smoke too much my chest is sore
a fucking corpse has more energy than i do ive got weird aches possible lumps rashes maybe theyre a condition or a network of conditions
one of these days theyre all going to hold hands light up and ill keel over dead
my lifes in the crapper and i dont think its going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if i do some brand new shiny designer drug
verns phone rings
he holds up his index finger shh
and takes the call
beat getting agitated when
i know but when
looking at his watch tell him we cant do that
he knows thats out of the question
we absolutely cant do that
vern is edgy
he continues no im not going to tell him
you tell him no now
he turns off his phone gets up
im afraid im going to have to leave you here eddie
but lets hang out again have another beer
he takes out his business card and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench
by the way thats on the house
i dont want it vern
vern smiles at him
dont be ungrateful now
you know how much these things cost
eddie shakes his head
eight hundred bucks a pop
he pats eddie on the shoulder and goes
eddie is still looking at the pill
which seems to be looking back at him
eddie makes his way home a little tipsy and filled with self loathing
all the way home she was back on my mind
a memory melissas face as shes talking laughing
shed been so smart
smarter than anyone around her
and oh how she loved to provoke people
melissa sparkling beautiful surrounded by people in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types
oh please you think professional women mentor one another
you think theres some mutually supportive empathetic touch feely network of kindly pie bakers
those bitches hate each other
quick who was the worst boss you ever had
a woman right
we cant delegate we cant command i mean theres a reason were not generals
the men gasp shocked and titillated
the women are furious
melissa smiles to herself shes trying not to crack up
i thought by now shed be curing cancer directing movies running for the senate
we hold on melissas lovely confident face as her voice fades down and eddies fades in
what had happened
her life made no sense
i mean i could see a direct plausible link between this eddie broke and buzzed at three oclock in the afternoon and an earlier eddie
getting splattered by some ochre liquid from an offscreen source
vomiting on his boss desk during a presentation
a younger thinner eddie rifles through a bureau an old lady in bed sleeping behind him an oxygen mask on her
shes clearly terminal
or stealing his dying aunts percocet
eddie walks pensive
but there was no link between my melissa and this upstate melissa dumped cold calling people from her living room
an edgy neighborhood on the furthest edge of lower manhattan
this block may never be gentrified
long blocks later i was home
he digs in his pocket for the keys and comes up with
its a former tenement fourth floor walk up
eddie trudges up the old stairs the tiny tiles worn away in spots the victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years of paint
eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough a horrible smokers cough that makes him double over
he sounds like hes years old
he finally gets it under control gets a glimpse of himself in the storefront window
he looks bad and he knows he looks bad
he reaches into his pocket
the pill sits teasingly in the palm of his hand looking up at him
there was less than nothing to lose
quickly impulsively he swallows it
as eddie passes a neighbors door swings open
eddie tries walking faster
i didnt want to see anybody
valerie and attractive emerges dressed to go out
especially not my landlords nasty young wife
she is immediately soured at the sight of eddie
eddie knows what shes thinking
look enough okay
just tell him steve handles the rents
so feed your fucking bullshit to him
i suddenly had extra reason to get away from her
i had thoughtlessly ingested a substance
valeries tirade fades up or down depending on when were hearing eddie
like the rents not low enough
i had gotten remarkably little information from vernon about what this drug would do
you could be a bike messenger and come up with that
eddie continues up the stairs
but she follows getting in front of him
what if it was a hallucinogen
oh my god
listening to her rag if i were tripping
id jump out a fucking window
valeries voice fades up
look im just telling you hes been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out ive told him not to do that but hes
we push in on eddies face into his eyes
where we see his pupils contract just slightly
i felt it
the room is changing
springing into sharper focus
levels more layers more d more
but the same
just the depth and beauty
there seems to be more definition more dimension a little more light he can see more clearly
the sound drops out for a moment he can see valeries face mouth contorted continuing to heap the abuse but theres something in her eyes thats not mean
he looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence
shes taken aback
his eyes go to the book bag in her arms
i was blind but now i see
on a gut instinct eddie takes a shot pushing his words forward with a new sharp penetrating intimacy articulateness
you dont like me and i dont blame you you see a schlumpy energy sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband
youre hoping ill blow my brains out
but my existence shouldnt make you this upset
what is it
hes hit a nerve
look thats none of your something wrong at school
how do you know im in school
his eyes flick down at her bag
people who arent dont usually carry dry academic constipated out of print books about dorothea lange
are you some kind of creep
have you been following me
i just saw the book you can only see a corner of it
how did you know
he looks down
shes right only a corner of the book is visible
eddie realizes ive seen it before
it was true
a slightly younger eddie is flipping through the lange book
sitting on the couch of a t
i was trying to make waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom
hoping shed have a condom
somehow my unconscious had served that up
a memory id never even recorded
or was it there the whole time
and all i needed
was the access
as it sinks in vern was right
this was no recreational drug
eddies eyes flick to the laptop in her bag his manner suddenly intimate confident
if youre writing a paper thats not the book id use
well who asked y cal berkeley has her oral history
id start there
her son is still alive
you could google him
sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents
youd get something no one else has and youdve gone the extra mile a nice little apple for the professor
during this speech music comes up and the sound goes down
eddie and valeries mouths are moving
shes asking questions
hes supplying answers lots of them
information from the odd museum show a half read article some pbs documentary was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful
valeries whole posture is relaxing the look in her eyes becoming
she didnt have a chance
a mirror image of eddies but considerably nicer
we hear the sounds of two people valerie and eddie having wild mutually satisfying sex from the other room
wed really worked on her paper too
in minutes it was a polished gem
she was pleased
we see the laptop set up books scattered then obviously abandoned for a more pleasurable pursuit
one nice little side effect
i stayed hard for hours
we hear female groans of pleasure
a dishevelled eddie opens the door to his apartment
he enters looks around
happy and sore i returned home
its the first wide shot weve seen of it and it hammers home what a mess
books scattered across the floor dirty dishes broken venetian blind sashes
the nest of a slob
but it couldnt be my home could it
who would live like this
montage speeded up shots of eddie sifting through his books and tapes
cleaning up the kitchen
picks up books
he starts moving the sofa
quick cuts the living room rapidly whipped into shape
if not stylish habitable
final shot hes sitting on the repositioned couch
what was this drug
i couldnt stay messy on it i hadnt had a cigarette in six hours
he stares at the pack in his hands
it looks alien
abstemious and tidy
what was this a drug for people who want to get anal
he gets up
i wasnt high wasnt wired just clear
what i needed to do
and how to do it
his eye falls on his computer
the montage continues eddie flipping through research books typing onto his keyboard the printer printing doing internet searches
pages and pages spit out of the printer
eddie in his underwear is sleeping soundly
he stirs rolls over cracks open an eye
he gets up schlumps to the mirror looks at his unshaven face
the penetrating gleam is no longer in his eyes
the next morning i sent a little probe down into my brain
no surge of brilliance came up to greet me
i felt thick and stupid a shuffling zombie without my coffee and cigarette
close up eddies underwear is tossed at the hamper missing it by about a foot
the underwear remain on the floor
i was back
eddie lies on the couch
already the room shows signs of being messed up again
his eye suddenly falls on his desk
but something remained
eddie drops a stack of fresh pages on the desk of mark sutton
mark looks skeptically at eddie then the pages
words have appeared on paper
written by you
eddie knows hes on thin ice
thats all you have to read
if you read them in the next hour and you dont want to keep reading ill give back the advance
eddie standing on the street the crowd flowing around him
he turns this way and that clearly anxious impatient
where to go
what to do to kill the time
eddie orders a pretzel from a food cart
he is having to dig into his pockets to come up with the change
the vendor becomes so impatient he wont give him the pretzel and serves another customer first
eddie looks at his cell phone
makes sure its on
eddie sits on a stoop slowly nibbling on his pretzel his eye glued to his phone
eddie tosses the finished pretzels wrapper and shakes his phone in frustration
eddie jumps up fumbles with his phone just as a passing male wall street shark pulls out his phone and answers
the ring wasnt for eddie
eddie comes in then notices somethings different
his answering machine has a blinking red light
eddie clicks the button breathless
give me a call when you get in
beep the second message is from mark too
eddie im pages further in
its a little grandiose but im still reading
a third message beep
okay how did you do this
id uh id really like to shit just call me the minute you get in call
eddie jumps up gleeful he knew it
then his smile fades
but how would i finish
it was enhanced eddie who displayed all that brilliance
eddie holding verns card buzzes the buzzer
theres no answer
eddie buzzes again and again
bad time okay
vern last night pages just wrote themselves
i totally chucked the novel i pitched them i suddenly saw vern how this whole societal economic class struggle and its solution didnt have to be futuristic or fictional it
was actually achievable here in our lifetime and i could just lay it out like like a manifesto or something like mein kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck
no response realizing okay i wont talk any more about this if you let me in
the buzzer buzzes
the door opens
and eddie is taken aback
vern has been beaten up
really worked over
his lip is split his face puffy and bruised
his right hand is bandaged
well that was fast
leaving the door open vern turns around and motions at eddie with his left hand to come in
the place is all mismatched antique furniture the possessions of someone who collected once with enthusiasm but whos letting it all go to hell
vern sits keeping his injured arm elevated
i guess youre interested after all
that stuffs amazing
it works better if youre already smart
eddie cant get over how bad vernon looks
you dont want to know
and eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened
whats it called
it doesnt have a street name yet because it doesnt have a street profile
and thats the way we want it to stay
the boys in the kitchen are calling it mdt
the boys in the kitchen
vern that doesnt sound fda approved
fda approved thats a laugh
did you really believe that shit
eddie stares at vern as he pours himself a coffee
okay so what did we have here
some unknown untested possibly dangerous drug scammed out of some unidentified lab somewhere given to me by a highly unreliable guy i hadnt seen in years
so you want some more of it
he knew it
well talk about it
but first maybe you can do me a little favor
eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there but vern clearly has him by the balls
you can see im in no shape to go out right now
will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit
and maybe pick me up a little breakfast
vern tosses him a set of keys
as the plastic wrapped clothes spin towards us
it was amazing how quickly it all slotted back into place
as two eggs are flipped over easy
the dealer client dynamic
and here comes eddie carrying vernons suit and greasy bag of breakfast
the easy sacrificing of dignity for the guaranteed return of a dime bag or a gram or in this case a little pill that was going to cost me a
he arrives at vernons door
he takes out the keys vern gave him but he doesnt need them
the door is ajar
as eddie pushes the door open he can see vernon sitting quite normally on the couch
as he enters the room though he sees that the place has been ransacked
eddie wheels back to ask vern what the fuck
and then sees it
in the center of his forehead is a neat little bullet hole
is no tough guy and sweat springs to his brow
he starts shaking
then seized with horror that they might still be in here he edges to the bedroom
we hear the pounding of his heart as he peeks in
its been ransacked too
torn to shreds bureau drawers opened and dumped pillows ripped open with knives
but no one is there
eddies shaking hand can barely hold the phone
i need to report a murder
he puts down the phone puts his head in his hands
various cuts of eddie sitting
shifting his butt in various positions
holding a baseball bat hes found just in case they come back
it took them forever
and the longer i sat there the clearer i saw
vern had known whoever had done this
hed opened the door
and one guess what theyd been looking for
eddie cleverly wearing kitchen gloves is now furiously tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind the scattered clothes under the bed
eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet nothing but tylenol
eddie sits on the couch with dead vern staring at him as if a corpse could give up a secret
he looks down at verns at least you got your last meal
there are lots of takeout containers around
you never did like to cook
eddies eye falls on verns stove
unlike the rest of the kitchen area its pristine
eddie jumps up
eddie opens it
the inside is as clean as the outside
we hear sirens now the cops are finally coming and eddie must rush
eddie pulls out taped to the inside is a large brown padded envelope
slowly eddie pulls out the package reaches into it
he is holding about twenty thousand dollars in cash
but thats not all
he reaches in again
theres something else inside
eddies hand pulls out a little black address book
but theres still something else
he reaches in again
and now eddies hand pulls out a plastic container with an air lock seal
he pries the seal off
inside are five hundred eddie hears the thud of approaching feet voices
making a decision he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket jumps down from the chair
just as a cop pushes through the door
he sees eddie spins points his gun right at him
let me see your hands
eddie throws his arms in the air
im the one that called you
eddie sits making his statement to an overweight detective
no ex wifes brother
i just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to you know
the detective looks at him suspiciously
buy some drugs
whatre you okay fine what did this guy do
he was i dont know i heard he was sort of an antiques dealer
close on the envelope hidden in his jacket burning a hole in his side
eddie tries to stay calm
viennese kind of
sort of curlicue leg kind of things the phone is ringing
the detective picks it up
that is correct
an edward morgan
mysteriously the detective hands the phone to eddie
the victims sister
eddie sees young beautiful melissa laughing in the surf
eddie cant believe it
he stares at the phone then finally speaks into it
you were there
i hadnt heard her voice in years
id just run into him on the street
this is all so weird
melissa you dont think i had anything to do with no no no eddie i know that
i wish i was more surprised
involved in some stuff
i better not say any more
not on this line no
eddie still cant believe hes talking to her
a deep breath
do you want to
meet somewhere or
he lets it hang in the air for a moment
eddie ive got to do the funeral
and god knows what else
we cant meet okay
ill see you at the funeral
i dont want that please dont
ill call you at some point when this is over
melissas voice is wan vulnerable
shes hung up
eddie turns back to the detective whos staring intently at him
something doesnt jell here
eddie tries not to look panicked
the cop looks up taking in the entrance of three newly arrested high class hookers
they are young
they are blond
they are wearing very short skirts and fuck me heels
the cop eyes them appreciatively
but i knew when his attention wandered to something more pressing that he was going to let me go
eddie walks down the stairs shaken up but profoundly relieved
even a little giddy
then he stops
only then did it occur to me that someone could have followed me from verns apartment
eddie walks trying to cast inconspicuous glances over his shoulder
is this guy following him
they all look innocuous
they all look threatening
he has no idea
worth the risk
eddie enters and casting a surreptitious look around closes the door behind him
the cash the address book and the bottle of pills are all laid out on the table
eddie sits looking at them realizing that his life is now about to be jump started
worth the risk
a smile twitches at the corner of his mouth
eddie is walking down the street a brisk confidence in his step that penetrating gleam of intelligence back in his eyes
we know right away that hes on mdt
back on mdt it was obvious what i should do
eddie is being fitted for a sharp looking jacket
the camera moves to the mirror and we are suddenly continuous shot in a hip pretty girl is giving eddie a haircut
the camera continues to pan
but instead of finding him the chair we are
eddies doing crunches getting in shape
combined with an unprecedented surge of motivation
the camera pans to the mirror
but sees a reflection of
he sits at his computer a salad beside him
his printer spits out page after page of manuscript
enabled me to finish the book in four days
eddie puts down a thicker manila envelope on marks desk
mark is astonished
it contains ten tablets of mdt
eddies fingers reach in take one
a tablet a day
kept the torpor away
and what i could do with my day
eddie surveys paintings
i now had cultural appetites
eddie sits attentively in the audience reading the score along with the music
learned to read music in a week
eddie runs earphones on his head
we hear dimly french phrases
even half listening to any language i became fluent
eddie becomes aware that theres another runner a powerful looking man gaining on him closer behind than makes him comfortable
eddie flicks a glance over his shoulder
the only cloud was the nagging feeling i was being followed
with a surge of effort eddie speeds up sprinting across the street just after the light changes
whizzing traffic cuts the mysterious runner off stops him from following
he remains panting at the light
or did mdt create paranoia
the focal point of my existence quickly became
protecting my stash
close on the plastic baggie of pills being duct taped inside the top of eddies broiler
he slams the broiler closed
call it a homage
eddie stands there in his new clothes holding court
he has an entirely new aura
i had a new improved game
he banters flirtatiously with a beautiful woman
so youre saying that any author whos commandeered adjective status orwellian dickensian
which means a prosaic authors work rests on a foundation of acclaim so youre saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement that the greatest hits cd cannot possibly contain
that shakespeares catchiness belies mediocrity
she breaks off shrugs smiles
well then id guess youd rather not hear about what i personally think could launch a thousand ships
he puts a finger under her chin
he means her face of course
the woman smiles and blushes
fish in a barrel
tight shot legs only of this regal upscale womens panties down around her high heels and eddies legs between hers pumping
a vase shatters to the floor beside their feet spilling its pricey orchids
and it wasnt just women
i was for the first time in my life a presence
the camera circles around a european looking crowd
thats clustered around eddie
hes finishing a long story in french
of course all this seemed to work better with people i didnt know
than with people who knew me
eddies mother and father working class schlubs sit on the floral sofa staring at their now dapper son who is waving some paperwork in their faces
so mom your k is totally mis invested these guys are have done only the most pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the
stock realizing theyre lost okay remember when i explained default flops
did any of that stick
his parents stare at him
they dont know what to make of any of this
i quickly returned to the unfamiliar audience
a sizable crowd is around eddie including finance types in suits
sure you get a short term spike but wouldnt that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years
a well dressed broker kevin doyle shakes his head
no no there are safeguards
against aggressive over expansion
there arent because there are no safeguards in human nature
eddies tone isnt aggressive its genial amusing
were wired to overreach you look at history i mean all the countries that ruled the world
with its big butch navy
all thats left is salt cod and cheap condos the brits
now they just sit on their dank little island fussing over their suits
nobody stops and thinks hey were doing pretty well weve got poland and france and a big swiss bank account lets not invade russia in the winter
lets go home and pop a beer and live off the interest
the crowd laughs
eddie takes a swallow of his drink
smiles gets it yeah
itll all happen again
eddie toasts him
hey i want in on it
kevin doyle wishing eddie was right clinks his glass
my brain was just pouring this stuff out
everything id ever read heard seen was now organized and available here it is here you go
eddie leaves with several people
kevin doyle presses a card into eddies hand
you must have a portfolio but if you dont id be very interested in working with you
eddie politely takes his card
thank you so much
i must have a portfolio
very well if i must i must
eddie pulls out the broiler and removes the envelope of cash hes taped in there
its much thinner
but verns cash was low
and it takes cash to make cash
eddie stands opposite marks desk
but it takes cash to make cash
another elegant man is there too marks boss dunham
id like to re negotiate my advance
sit down well be discussing that
i want to apologize eddie if i in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities
eddie smiles coolly
its mark whos a little nervous
dunham has read your pages and were prepared to make you what i hope will be a very exciting offer
what would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road
eddie holds there gaze expressionless but says nothing
after an uncomfortable moment dunham continues
we think this could be an important title maybe one in a series
i have to say you came out of nowhere but the good ones always this isnt going to work
whats not going to work
eddie we take you very seriously as a writer
eddie sounds almost regretful
yes but i now see that writing as a profession is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else
sutton thinks eddies kidding
he laughs nervously
no i mean it look at the life
incarceration loneliness burrowing down into your own psyche increasingly insulated from any truth because youre not in the currents of the world any more youre rattling around inside the cage
of your brain self cannibalizing
dunham realizes hes losing eddie and jumps in
you dont think a best selling author would disagree
oh if youre good theres some remuneration eventually after paperbacks but at best your careerll be oozing along like a snail a few thousand more copies whoop dee doo youre
developing a readership for what
so you can end up in phoenix on a saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten
half of them there for the wine and cheese
yes but if your goal is to have a i dont think any goal will be really achievable mark until im sitting on a large pile of cash
the mens mouths open
financial reading material covers every square inch of floor
eddie now has three monitors operating side by side in his living room all spewing forth financial information as he works the keyboard
i would have to start very very small
in a down market
no one was making money
but no one had eddie stands behind a day trader whos spewing out an explanation of his work
youve got your quantitive analysis quants
algorhythms to find minute price discrepancies
youre looking at numbers only
price and volume patterns
eddie is staring at the screen blocks of information forming and connecting in his mind
eddie now sits riveted to his laptop keying
armed with verns last dollars i made in a day
it was too slow
eddie differently dressed surrounded by stacks of research again keying away
still too slow
i needed more capital
eddie sits across from a sinister looking young russian in his early s
this is gennady
the two men stare at each other
because i dont see you before
and i dont fucking like you already
why do i give you thousand dollars
because i quintupled my money four days in a row
gennady barely glances at the papers eddie pushes in front of him and snorts half amused before pushing them back
its not luck
okay you tricked their computer you got some fix on the game
eddie now sees that its better not to admit that he came by the money legally
so youre a crook
and thats a problem for you because
gennady laughs for a second
eddies not wrong about that
gennady looks in eddies eyes for a moment calculating
you people all get caught
and what if i do
you think i keep detailed records of my investors
youll have your money back long before they figure out what happened
gennady just looks at eddie thinking it over
eddie sits on a bench waiting
hands eddie a large paper bag
eddie reaches for it gennady holds it aloft for one last second
okay you take this
you dont pay you know what we do
we cut you around the waist peel your skin pull it up over your head and tie knot in it
and you dont die from that
he lets the full picture sink in for a moment
then cubicle after cubicle of guys all guys at computers rolling the dice on the stockmarket
my new friend kevin doyle showed me how you could leverage two and a half times your cash at a day trading firm
eddie alone in a stall
he takes two mdt tablets out of his wallet downs them
id been upping the dose for over a week
it seemed to cut my learning curve
overlapping dissolves of eddie working at a furious pace
another trader stands behind eddie watching
second shot three traders are watching
third shot nine traders are watching him awed
it was instinct
but informed instinct instinct based on huge amounts of research which thanks to mdt was conducted more rapidly and comprehensively than anyone at lafayette day trading would ever know
why are you buying that
the ceo just got indicted
but not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into
thats still on
should be announced in a week
the trader shakes his head
how did eddie know that
at the end of the week my brokerage account contained
over a million dollars
as still more people drift over to where eddie is sitting
id heard the old metaphors about the stock market it was a collective nervous system a global brain a numerical representation of the will of god
eyes taking in data fingers reacting on the keyboard
whatever it was i was jacked in booted up my mind was living tissue inside the greater functioning whole
by the end of the second week i had
in the bank
eddie at the computer soaking up information making trades
kevin doyle stands behind eddie flabbergasted as he watches
the word quickly got out
quick cuts of eddie playing back his messages you have
four job offers
my bank raising my line of credit
listen return my call mr
morgan this articles about yous gonna get written with or without your cooperation
all my new friends
you stupid shit i be there thursday for the money ten oclock
eddie makes a jerk off motion crosses to his window looks down
there is a mysterious black car just sitting at the curb in front of his building
no one gets in or out
eddie turns back to his machine
and finally kevin doyle trying to sound casual
eddie i was having drinks with a friend of mine and
ah you wont believe this
lindy eddies ex girlfriend is sitting across the table from eddie
she peers at him confused
is this dapper stranger really her shlumpy ex
carl van loon wants to meet you
apparently he does
she is pleased for him but flabbergasted
but youre not in the finance game
what can you do for carl van loon
shaking her head eddie i the beautiful hostess appears at eddies side
they have a brief conversation in italian
lindy stares confused as the hostess leaves
since when do you speak
what happened to you
self improvement month
someone gave me a wake up call
god eddie i felt so bad about that
it stuck didnt it
lindy eyes him half pleased half apprehensive
he seems so different
you didnt do all this for me
who says i didnt
so what its not getting over
is that it
lindy looks away blushes
all right all right boy you are really begging for it
begging for what
im proud of you
this is so unexpected
more than proud
im a little
eddie waits for her words happily expectant
they smile at each other
a lot of affection flooding back
of course we started up again
eddie is making out with her on her couch
his apartment has been seriously transformed
of course its nothing but a renovated tenement but there are some new furnishings rugs lighting the total effect is now one of stylish prosperity
she and eddie sit on the rug in front of the coffee table drinking expensive wine
eddie and lindy dressed to the nines are clearly returning from a fancy party
and passionately entwined at the point of having hot sex driver or no driver
eddie stands naked at the window looking out
what are you doing hon
he walks back over to her looks down
she is snuggled up in eddies pillow looking very pretty and vulnerable
what you think somebodys watching
hes not sure
is there anything you want to tell me eddie
nows the time
he looks back at her eyes unreadable
with success comes enemies
old chinese proverb
you should sleep
isnt your van loon meeting tomorrow
eddie nods sighs turns away from the window
he turns pale
eddie takes a step
hes across the room
a skip in time
i found myself at the door
with no consciousness that i had moved
he puts his hand on a table steadies himself
he catches a look in the mirror of this lean handsome dapper shark he has become
are you all right
he doesnt look all right
when was the last time you ate something
dully the realization penetrates eddies fog it had been three days
eddie sits at a table discreetly wolfing a few appetizers
kevin doyle arrives looking a little nervous
he sits launches in
hell be here in ten
now look since we have a minute be warned van loons mercurial
one minute your best friend the next
youre a leper
and he needs direct answers
anything tentative and youve lost him forever
i think we should rehearse a few scenarios
im eating kevin
there is so much quiet authority in eddies tone that kevin just shuts up
but a moment later looking at the sweat on eddies brow kevin is pecking at him again
you up for this
because ive got a little bit on the line have a toast point
brazening it out again
because eddie isnt sure he can pull this off either
there is that little stir from the hostess and staff that can only mean the entrance of a very rich and powerful man
the martini is put down on the table
we tilt up to carl van loon a young no less vital and intense than the hungriest year old shark on the make
but he affects geniality
he sits the middle aged man with him pierce does the same
he looks eddie directly in the eyes
whats your secret
eddie looks at him back directly in the eyes
im on special medication
and van loon laughs
eddie is in mid spiel van loon listening intently
yes thats partially what im pattern recognition
so thats your snake oil
look if theres one thing we all understand its understanding itself thats how the business works
of course not everyone can understand the patterns
kevin sucks in his breath
pierce is annoyed
van loon is mildly amused but not necessarily impressed
eddie continues with his unstoppable mdt fueled insights look theres no time for human judgement anymore
you see a chance you blink and its gone
we entered the age of decentralized online decision making with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world people who dont even know each
other making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze
until they werent
same rules even in a panic
its not understanding how companies work
its understanding how mass psychology works
and you have a formula
well from thousand to two point eight million in ten days yes
i do have a formula mr
delusions of grandeur
i dont have delusions of grandeur
a beat as we push in on eddies face
i have an actual recipe for grandeur
kevin stares in horror
van loon still says nothing
eddie simply stands there coolly kevin is nervously saying goodbye to van loon and pierce making small talk
and oh you know shes on the wait list
rosemarys pretty devastated
my daughter went there
ill call the school for you
kevin blubbers with gratitude
van loons car pulls up
kevin pumps his hand
van loon looks past kevin to eddie
its the first real acknowledgement that hes taken eddie seriously
eddie and van loon regard each other
finally van loon speaks
i dont know who you are eddie or what your game is but im sure of one thing you dont work in this business
im up to my ass in investment guys and you dont have their half cocky half terrified line of bullshit
which is not to say i like yours any better
he picks up a file hands it to eddie
but you obviously pick your stocks in a way i havent seen
so tell me
were thinking of acquiring these companies
take a few minutes
whats your take on them
van loons limo pulls up
eddie snaps the file shut hands van loon back his pen flashlight
but these companies arent the question are they
what do you mean
well youre upmarket energy what do you want with these little solar windmill hippie outfits
van loons gaze is expressionless
unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence control the whole energy enchilada
but these wouldnt get you there in emerging markets
he eyes van loon who is sitting up straighter
eddies hit a nerve
he smiels whistles
this must be some big ass merger youre contemplating
a flicker in van loons eyes
and theres really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with van loon associates
have you been talking to somebody
carl its just rationalization
he says it like its the simplest thing in the world
which to a person on mdt it is
van loon grinds his teeth
wanting to talk about it but too skittish
is hank atwood going to go for it
a long beat
you are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man
come on the two of you together
the world would have to come to you begging for energy like oliver twist with his little bowl of gruel
a beat as the two men stare at each other
you realize that if the press got one whisper of i cant fucking believe im even discussing this it doesnt matter
it wont come off
now van loon chuckles amused by eddies audacity
the word brazen does not even begin to go there
youd have to back off libya
hes come this far eddie suddenly pulls back the bait
i dont think youd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home
youre a gusty little prick eddie
now youre curious
i must admit
youve hit a couple pretty big buttons
tell me what you think
its getting late
van loon laughs
you get your shot
come to my office tomorrow at ten and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re structure this deal
and you better be prepared
im at your disposal
eddie opens the car door
van loon eyes his building scoffs
you dont really live here
the spartans werent big on amenities
and they eventually got their asses kicked
he gets out
van loon drives off
i didnt go in
eddie keeps walking by his building
i wanted to walk move digest ingest
his stride picks up buoyantly
there are moments in life moments when you know youve crossed a bridge your old life is over
van loon was my bridge
one week two weeks from now i would be hobnobbing with ambassadors flying to dubai for meetings blowing off supermodels vacationing in medici villas
and that too was only a bridge
he steps off the curb
eddie is stepping off another curb god knows where
there was another skip
he stops rocked
how had i gone that last blocks
i got another ten
in mid step
eddie is walking past the metropolitan museum
i was back uptown
eddie is suddenly sitting at a bar picking up a drink people around him
what bar was this
was it harlem
eddie is dancing with a beautiful black woman
how long had passed
he breaks away from her starts for the door
eddie comes to in the act of banging the beautiful black woman savagely against the stall door
and it happened again
a large black man crumples in front of eddie goes down hit blood pouring from his nose
could he be the boyfriend of the girl eddies just banged
eddie stares at his bloody fist
eddie sits on a plush sofa with several middle aged international types some chattering in italian
he has a drink in his hand
there are paintbrushes paints and canvasses strewn around
a live work space
and now the images are speeding up eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an attractive middle aged latin woman we saw at the artists loft
now its just flashes skimming stones of consciousness a wine cork being popped
a plate of mussels swimming in wine sauce
a blur of motion bodies a swirl of riotous color a dog leash abandoned in a puddle
no rhyme no reason just image image image
and then blackness
eddie is walking now with a limp
the familiar postcard view of manhattan is ahead of him looking like it always looks
when it finally stopped i couldnt account for the last eight hours of my life
he notices his foot hurts when he puts it down
he has a limp
there was nothing to do but walk home
he turns around and limps back towards the island
eddie is sleeping in all his clothes
it was my first sleep in two days
eddie looking very groggy is holding a thick packet marked van loon associates by courier
the files carl van loon sent
sitting on the dining table is an mdt tablets
he stares at them
would i start skipping time again
he pushes the tablets away
doesnt take them
eddie is sitting in his reading chair exhausted going through the paperwork
even off mdt i decided to give van loons files a shot
eddie leafs through them
pieces of paper charting corporate growth covered with charts graphs and mind numbing statistics
push in on eddies face as he realizes
they were fucking hieroglyphs
the phone rings
kevin doyle picks it up
what are you talking about
and we cross cut between them i cant make the meeting im uh
its a lame excuse it sounds lame as he says it but then hes off mdt
yeah well you cant have the fucking flu right now hell never give you this chance again
i need to ah analyze this data we see the two men continue to talk kevin growing more agitated eddie growing more sheepish as we hear already i recognized it
the thick tongue the leaden synapses
it was regular eddie the eddie that now was unbearable to be
we fade up the sound on the two men dont you get it
this is your test
well i cant pass a fucking test right now
and how am i going to look if you dont
eddie looks pretty bad
he massages his temples
he hands up on a still yammering doyle
he picks up the mdt pill looks at it
it was my first morning off mdt in a month
the beginnings of a headache was curling around my head like a big fat greasy python
again he looks at the mdt tablet weighing his options
but the time skips had me scared
he puts the tablet back down on the table
eddie walks in much more tentative in his stride fear in his eyes
this is the real eddie the non mdt eddie and he feels suddenly out of place with the curly maple paneling antique persian carpets
my thought such as i had one was to tap dance with van loon until i could find out more about eddie sits on a couch pierce on another chair
van loon opposite watching him
what do you know about hank atwood
owns um a lot of colorado
so this is prepared eddie
he shoots eddie a look of withering contempt
eddie holds the stare and shoots a look back
what is this atwood
everyone knows about atwood
where was he two years ago
a flash of panic in eddies eyes
whats the right answer
an agonizing pause
then van loon nods
two years ago forbes didnt even have him on the radar
yeah his great leap forward
eddie is faking it
pierce is looking at him intently
but eddies staying afloat
the guy comes on out of nowhere so fucking strong he has me on the run
beat me out of two properties invests in bumfuck countries with no oil places i wouldnt go near sextuples his money
eddies glance flicks to the tv behind the bar
a womans picture flashes on the tv screen and he recognizes it
its the italian woman he met last night
always picks green technologies invests in them and a year later he owns them
eddie strains to hear the anchorwomans voice
found dead in her hotel room last night victim of foul play
eddie tries to keep his face immobile
van loons voice drones on distorted now as we hear eddies heart pounding
billion if he has a nickel
and i have to convince him somehow that i can raise his game
an unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene
anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities
eddie bolts upright
you cant tell me hes in this to improve the fucking planet
he owns a ball team
eddie is pale sweaty faint
theres only one thing to do excuse me
eddie dashes out
van loon and pierce look at each other
eddie bursts from the door vomits into the gutter
i couldnt have
he leans against a street sign trying to right himself
he gasps for breath
or could i
eddie comes in breathing wildly panicked
if i could walk talk conduct business seduce a woman fight with no memory
could i kill someone
was it even me
who was immediately the phone rings
he nearly jumps out of his skin
he cant answer
he sits on the couch head in his hands rocking as it rings
finally the machine picks up
listen call me back as soon as you eddie lunges for the phone picks it up
surprised he picked up eddie
melissa i want to talk to you
meet me somewhere
were talking now
nonono at charlies across the street
you cant see me eddie
melissa its important please come you have to tell me what youre talking about
but shes already hung up
eddies hands rummage through everything
i realized that there were other people who might know about mdt
his hands find what theyre looking for
vernons little vernons other clients
eddie sits on the bed the black book open on his knees
eddie looks at the page then reaches for the telephone
picks it up
hears strange clicks over the dial tone
he puts down the phone fear on his face
eddie walks slipping through the crowd trying to suppress his limp
he looks nervously behind him
is that man in the tan raincoat following him
he tries to walk faster but it makes his limp more pronounced
he turns the corner
he seems to have lost the guy
eddie sits on a park bench making calls on his cell phone
hello may i speak to paul kaplan please
who is this
im a journalist
from electronics today magazine
my husband died three days ago
eddie is floored
im so sorry
eddie has dialled another number
i ah may i speak to jerry brady
jerrys in whos this
uh bill johnson
jerrys in the hospital
and hes really sick
oh my god
whats wrong with him
we dont know
he just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago
then uh last wednesday he collapsed at work
eddie turns to the last page of vernons book
of all the people i called three were dead and the rest were sick
eddie dials the last number
instantly there is a ring
we rack focus to the man in the tan coat sitting a discreet distance from eddie
his phone is ringing
eddie turns white
the man takes out his cell phone and answers
the man suddenly looks up
locks eyes with eddie
knows that he knows
eddie leaps up begins to run
the man leaps up and follows
eddie runs desperately as fast as a person off mdt possibly can
he still has the limp from his blackout escapade too
he cant run fast
tan coat is gaining
eddie collides with pedestrians steps on street sunglass displays sends a saxophonist sprawling
in the end my stupidity saved me
eddie panicked not looking runs for the crosswalk
is barrelling unstoppably right towards him
eddie is frozen
the truck swerves up on the curb
tan coat must dive out of the way knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins as the truck hits a streetlight mangling it then is whacked twice by two cabs piling
up behind it
when tan coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians his last glimpse is of disappearing down into a subway entrance
swallowed by a crowd
hesitates but knows that he cant catch up
eddies given him the slip
eddie limping enters looking around anxiously
what was i dealing with
who could tell me
i hoped against hope
that melissa would show
not one person in it could possibly be melissa
turns to go
eddie turns back
there sitting at a booth is a thick waisted short haired brunette middle aged woman wearing a large shapeless sweater
eddie had looked right at her
and not recognized her
she bears no relationship to the siren melissa of his memories
eddie tries to hide the shock on his face
he goes to her sits
yes its the same person but dramatically tragically changed
her face is puffy her pallor blotchy
there are lines under her eyes and around her mouth lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years
eddie tries to conceal his shock
how are you doing
melissa responds with a cynical shrug
then she eyes him
dont tell me i look good because i know i dont
i didnt want you to see me this way
you look good
i guess i lost some weight
yeah well mdtll do that to you
they regard each other for minute unsure of where to start
i know youve been doing it
i just read the post
short selling stocks
second guessing the markets
eddie doesnt know what to say
since when do you read the post
these days the posts about all i can read
melissa what do you mean
i mean i did it too
and i only took nine or ten hits
vernon didnt tell you any of this did he
melissa snorts as if to say typical
well when he told me about this amazing new drug
i was like down the hatch
and it was amazing
i read brian greenes the elegant universe in minutes and understood it
my work rate increased
just insanely overnight
my boss started to hate me they offered me his job
and then i got scared
im not stupid
i mean nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash
i stopped taking it
i got sick
headaches throwing up
i went back to vernon to see if i maybe shouldnt take another hit or half a hit and then he told me about
about the people who were dying
one guy didnt die but hes a vegetable his mother has to sponge him down every day
how much have you been taking eddie
a long beat as they look into each others eyes
well maybe theyve worked out the bugs
maybe this isnt the same batch
eddie hates the look in her eyes
his hands are at his temples
youre off it right now arent you
are you getting a headache
finish your story
well i didnt take more
and i didnt die
but after a while i found i couldnt concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes
i missed deadlines
i got lazy
put on weight
the magazine let me go
my husband checked out
get out of here
she leans back looks him in the eyes
that was two years ago and i havent been the same since
i cant read any more i mean the fucking new york post
eddie feels ill physically ill hearing this
after this im going to have a migraine for three days
and ive got to pee
which is another thing
she gets up
goes to the ladies room
and now eddie sees she wears a leg brace
like a kid from the old days with polio
how many times had i thought of her my first real love
we see flashes of young melissa
but that melissa had unraveled in time and space she was a ghost now
i was never going to see her again never bump into her in the street
the tears gather behind eddies eyes
he cant help it
he puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions
eddie leaves with melissa
he is controlling his tears barely
you have some left
go home and take it
take the dose down but dont just stop youll die if you just stop
try to taper off
otherwise the headaches just the beginning
i have to go eddie indeed is rubbing his temples
but when i run out i dont know
i have to go eddie catches her arm
who invented mdt
i dont know goodbye eddie
he lets go of her arm
a puffy crippled woman about to cry
she turns her back and moves away from him stiffly limping without looking back
no one seemed to be watching my apartment maybe i could chance it
he glances around the coast is clear and sets off across the street
he looks weak ill his breathing labored
he stumbles catches himself i was getting sicker by the moment
luckily i had one pill on me
he pulls it from his pocket
hes pushed up against the wall of his building
not by tan coat
by gennady the russian
you fucking forget about me
eddie is stunned gennady whacked his head against the building pretty hard
he still clutches the mdt tablet tight in his fist
and you not here
eddie tries to catch his breath
im here now
they come into his apartment eddie using all his energy to stay upright
ill get you a check
gennady turns to ice
you out of your fucking mind
what you think we are some financial institution
eddie realizes his brain isnt working of course gennady cant take a check
gennady look i cut your balls off
i wasnt thinking
look we just need to go to my bank oof
gennady has punched him in the stomach
harder than hes ever been punched
eddie gasps for breath
holds his fist to his body protecting the pill
what you got there
gennady grabs eddies wrist and wrenches his hand open
gennady snatches the pill away from him
dont look like no aspirin i ever see
his voice drips with crude contempt
what is it
something good eh
in one swift motion gennady pops it in his mouth and swallows it
eddie is mute with shock
eddies shaking hands are handing gennady a thick envelope
thats the whole thing plus twenty
he looks desperately ill
he can barely stand
gennady meanwhile is coming on to mdt
i feel good
what in that shit
aspirin and vitamins
you fucking full of shit morgan
i know you lie about the movie script too
he wants to hit eddie again but thinks the better of it with all the bank cameras
we see gennady give the camera a gay little wave then turn and walk out
eddie lurches along the street staggering like a drunk barely able to walk
people avoid him veering away
i had to get my stash
lindy clearly has a mid level executive job her office is better than a cubicle and she has a bit of a view
there is a knock
a female assistant appears in the door
i wouldnt have let him in but i know you know him
eddie appears in the door looking deathly ill
its all right lisa
the girl goes
lindy sensing something dire leaps up and closes the door
eddie immediately collapses on the floor
lindy kneels down to help him competent trying to stay calm
eddie what is it
im sorry im sick
i wasnt going to make it home okay
okay ill get you to a it wont help
i need to get its very simple i need my pills
what kind of pills
for my headaches
what are you
beat realizing are you on some drug
so all this energy of yours all this focus
has been some drug eddie
the way you
you need a doctor
that wont eddies phone rings
he and lindy look at each other
he answers it
valerie is on the phone
and we cross cut between them what the hell are you doing up there
there are indeed loud noises coming from above her
are you tearing up your floor or something
understanding in eddies pained eyes
he clicks off the phone
i knew what was going on
male hands are ripping the place to pieces
pulling the toilet from the wall
cutting open the mattress
taking apart eddies computer
a smart drug
it was supposed to be legal
i have a supply
knows whats coming no
i just need
to get it
and im supposed to just go
in the middle of my work day
to your apartment to get you more drugs
the male hands have found eddies hiding place
they lift the old broiler of the stove
the mdt is not there
the broiler is slammed down in anger
not to my apartment
i moved it
i was smart
i was on mdt
then where did you keep it
he looks at her guiltily
oh you prick
she walks to a square end table takes the lamp off it
the table is actually a box she lifts the lid
she reaches in
and pulls out the packet you asshole
in my fucking furious she stuffs it into her purse and goes for the door
as she leaves we see that we are in the pov of
across the street
he clicks open a cell phone
there is a knock on the door
lying on the floor trying to breathe eddie ignores it
his phone rings again
it takes a lot of effort just to answer it
hi have you got it
and we cross cut between lindy is on the phone
her voice is tense terrified
eddie theres someone following me
are you sure
he got into the cab behind me and theyre making every turn im making
dont get out
what the fuck did you put me in the middle of
call the cops
were slowing down
to the driver go around him
were stopped dead
hes getting out eddie hes walking over here eddie helpless on the floor can do nothing
lindy bolts from the cab just as tan coat puts his hand on the opposite door
she takes off into central park
and hes after her like a shot
lindy veers off the path through the trees zig zagging trying to find a place not to be seen
zig zags too not far behind her
begins to scream desperate help
up ahead miraculously a cop on horseback
he steps the horse toward her
she races over and presses her body against the side of the horse
shes so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak
he has a long tan the cop seems to be paying attention then suddenly grunts and twitches his eyes flutter glaze
and he topples off his horse to the ground
revealing tan coat on the other side of the horse
the blade in his hand is bloody
tries to lose herself in a wedding party
comes to a section of huge decorative boulders and rocks
dives behind one of them
ahead she can see the outdoor ice skaters couples families enjoying the ice
it seems surreal
several yards behind her is tan coat looking behind every tree every trash bin
lindy picks up the phone keeping her voice low although shes hyperventilating
are you still there
and we cross cut between yes
im hiding but im stuck
hell find me
just be still stop talking
he killed a cop what
hes going to kill me eddie
listen to me
can he see you
you fucking asshole
can he see you
i dont know what to do
what do i do
there is something
listen to me
reach into the bag and take one of the pills
s swallow one of those things
tan coat is getting closer
you will know what do to lindy
take one and youll know
hes got a knife i cant think my way out of a knife
youll come on in thirty seconds
and yes you will think your way out thats what it does
are you taking it
she swallows the pill
hes getting closer
i love you
are you there
we push in on lindys eyes
which are changing
growing more steely
i feel it
she hangs up
eddie is left looking at the phone
tan coat is perhaps five yards behind lindy and getting closer
but shes not crying any more
shes looking at the ice skating rink and the skaters whirling across the ice
she knows what to do
suddenly she bolts from her hiding place behind the rock tearing down the hill as fast as she can
tan coat is behind her like a shot
lindy races down the hill pushing past the line of people and onto the ice
tan coat is clearly desperate he doesnt give a shit who sees him chasing her
in a flash hes on the ice after lindy running and sliding
people collide with him he pushes skaters aside sending them sprawling
just as hes closing in on lindy
lindy wheels around grabs a six year old girl under the arms and hoists her into the air swinging her legs at tan coat as hard she can
the little girls skates arc through the air whoosh
and connect cutting tan coats face
he sinks to his knees hand to his cheek welling blood
people scream and scatter
lindy keeps her wits about her
she runs sliding across the ice and leaping the fence with surprising grace
as an mdt pill is put into it
a wider shot shows eddie swallowing it with a glass of water
sits across the room looking at him her expression cool and composed
they look at each other a look of understanding
eddie finishes checking in lindy beside him
he seems completely restored to his sharp snappy self
the desk clerk gives him a key
he puts his arm around her leads her to the elevators
eddie takes lindys hands sits her on the bed
well stay here for a couple of days
well be powered up well be able to think our way out of this
he kisses her hands
looks into her eyes
lindy looks at him for a long moment
whos back eddie
i can take care of you now
that was never what i wanted
a lots going to happen for us
and everything that i will have
i will share with you
i will love you
lindys head comes up
she looks at him steely
you were always smart
you could have done this
but some of these things
maybe a third of these things
without any smart drug at all
a third of all this
to most people
would be plenty
she gets up turns away from him
i understand that stuff now eddie
and i dont blame you for taking it
no one could ever tell you till you take it what it can do
invincibility in a bottle
and i know im going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life
theres eerie quiet to her tone that eddie hasnt heard before
a matter of fact chill
but once you can see everything that way mapped out like that on a grid
and always be right
whod want to wing it
whod want to fuck up
whod want to be human
she heads for the door
i just came up to say goodbye
i dont ever want to see you again
im not even going to stay in new york
dont try to find me and dont try to help me
he knows theres no point in stopping her
shes done with him
eddie at the window looking down
he sees lindy briskly walking away
rack focus as lindy passes
leaning against a sign post
lighting a cigarette
and looking up at eddies hotel
gennady stands there looking up at the hotel
so hes a little surprised to find eddie walking right up to him
looking for me
gennady quickly gets aggressive
you think you can run out on me
you think i dont know where you are
i was under the impression that our business was settled
something is jammed into eddies ribs
something under gennadys coat
eddie doesnt blink
gennady walks him around the corner down some stairs to the deserted ground entrance of someones apartment
eddie remains cool
so now youre going to rob me
i thought you were a businessman
i want some more of that shit
he whacks eddie hard across the face
eddie stoic on mdt doesnt react
well so do i
you took the last one
so you get me more
i cant get more the dealers dead
now gennady smiles
too bad for you
because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog
eddie doesnt like that gennady knows anything about his business life
but he stands his ground
make some calls
one hundred pills
a hundred cant happen
the dealers dead i have to call three people to even get a line on the gun barrel is brought up beneath eddies chin
you know i dont really do this
so clean like this
what i do to you i do in stages
be able to get ten
fuck your ten
holding his ground ten
and no guarantee theres more
gennady looks at him for a long menacing moment
oh i think guarantee
but hes accepted the ten
he pushes eddie against the wall hard knocking the wind out of him
self pity and mdt were not compatible
one has to go on
being put into gennadys hand
a wider shot reveals eddie watching gennady with contempt as he grabs a fistful of nuts off a bar table as he goes
patch up whats left
i wont deny you pissed me off eddie
i was sick
i shouldnt have gone to the meeting
i tried to cancel but kevin imploded on me van loon looks at eddie penetratingly
i didnt know who or what i was talking to
a hundred and five is what you were talking to carl
look there cant be any instability
not when youre playing at this level
i sent over my revised projections i didnt ask for your projections
i know but i think if you look at i already have
a long beat as the two men size each other up
van loon looks away but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth
as a matter of fact there were firings over your projections
some things my team missed
so oddly enough i find myself
needing to fill a position
eddie stays cool
two months after i started mdt i was helping broker the most important merger in corporate history
eddie sits with van loon pierce and several powerful looking men conferring
they look at an elaborate chart graph that eddie is sketching
even pierce his detractor looks impressed
eddie is eating a luxurious room service dinner going through files and projections
i found that if i maintained an even dose
remembered to eat
drank no alcohol
the blackouts didnt recur
eddie shakes one mdt pill into his hand downs it
eddie is back on the trading floor a crowd around him
i was quickly back up to speed
eddie is being fitted for new suits
is it possible to construct an
the tailor nods makes a note
hes certainly not going to ask any questions
i would never again stash my mdt not in an apartment not in fort knox
eddie buzzing with charismatic authority speaks to two beefy men who are professional muscle
note one has very elaborate tattoos on his fingers
i dont want it known that i have any security
you wont precede me youll follow me never less than ten steps behind
inconspicuous doesnt begin to describe you
youre not there
youre a ceos wife youre wallpaper
the men nod
eddie straightens his tie
then opens his suit jacket reaches in and pulls along a seam
an invisible pocket safer though my stash now was i was not sitting around until it ran out
the place is state of the art but its an after hours furtive meeting eddie is having with a technician who passes back a small plastic envelope to eddie
in it we see several tablets of mdt
well its nothing you can cook up on a stove top
whoever made it its a real pro act
can you make more
can i combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities
but the exact method of delivery to the brain
darts at a dartboard
guinea pig people
thats too long
its what it is
or youll kill people
you need twelve eighteen eddie tosses the envelope back at him gets up
two million dollars if you do it in six
he holds up the packet
the guy considers
then slowly reaches for it taking the mdt back
eddie is having lunch with several power players
they are listening mesmerized to what eddie is saying
it was all going to work out
his eyes flicker upwards
his two security men are seated at the bar
the camera pans to find
also seated at the bar is the detective who questioned eddie at the police station
eddie gets up casually wanders over to where the detective is sitting pretends to order another drink
he does not make eye contact with the detective or look like hes talking to him
i thought we straightened this out detective
this isnt about vernon gant mr
fear begins to prick the back of eddies neck
but he strives for casual annoyance
what is it about
the detective hands eddie a magazine
it is turned to the middle and there is a picture of eddie candid on the trading floor
that fucking article
a witness identified the donatella alvarez suspect as this person
you want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of june
eddie keeps his cool does not look scared
wanders back to the table says a few cool words and strolls back to the detective
the detective gets up
shall we go
luckily i could now afford morris brandt the best lawyer in new york
eddie walks down the steps with a beautifully dressed shark lawyer morris brandt s
time was bought and i was released for now
eddies two security guys waiting fall into step ten paces behind him
youre lucky somebody wiped the room
weak circumstantial at best
just between us were you there
i dont remember
hes heard it all and doesnt really care
carl van loon and hank atwood remained unaware that soon i would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer
eddie is making a presentation to the van loon associates and a skeptical looking older guy hank atwood
well a unified front between van loon and atwood would be lethally effective and not a moment too soon
sycorps andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out
how do you know this
well the governmental bribe structure is in itself corrupt so of course information about its inner workings like anything can be bought
and there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates
i have a list here in descending order of threat
atwood rubs his temples seemingly distracted
but then he looks at eddie piercingly
the meeting has broken up
atwood is leaving surrounded by minions
van loon leans into eddie
whats your read
of course hes not going to tell you right now
van loon notices atwood is using a cane
he seems frail
might be an act
yeah doesnt track
hes not even
van loon looks at eddie
what are you going to do
when this is over
i dont know
you havent given me the answer
van loon eyes him
eddie is only half kidding
you havent asked the question
if all this comes off
whats my take
you should have pre negotiated
i trust you
eddie returns van loons look coolly implying that it really might be in van loons best interest to trust him
well given the scale of my contribution it cant be anything lese than forty
lets say forty five
forty five thousand dollars
both he and eddie start to laugh
forty millions plenty eddie
theres plenty more where this came from
he tries to read eddies smile which is removed far away
but youre not going to continue working for me are you
eddie opens his mouth
youre already bored
onto the next
van loon didnt get to where he is for nothing
i would really love to know what after a forty million dollar payout is next to you
but youre not going to tell me that either
and im not sure i want to know
might singe my ego
he shakes eddies hand
ill open a line of credit for you
even a tough nut like yous going to want a few toys
eddie is being shown the apartment by a thirty something female realtor
the apartment is still under construction brand new and enormous with a wall of floor to ceiling windows in the living room showing off spectacular views
three restaurants health club of course a private screening room wine cellar walk in humidor
unparalleled three tier security system
eddie looks out over the city feeling a surge
what is the asking price
twelve point five
eddie has to look away from her biting his lip
he cant show her any sign of sticker shock
the face he turns back to her is composed even blase
he shrugs no problem
we see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes
it was as it turned out a good moment to move
eddie comes in
the room has been completely ripped to pieces just like eddies apartment
eddie just smiles
because there was nothing for anyone to find
no one knew or would ever know that i now carried the pills with me at all times
eddie stands waiting his two security guys lurking steps behind
gennady appears now with two russian thugs of his own
this is new and eddie wasnt expecting it
gennadys security guys eye eddies security guys and vice versa
gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated
eddie hands gennady a small envelope
gennady takes it
in his eyes is a penetrating intelligence
right away it was obvious he was on mdt
gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a cigarette
his movements are elegant refined
i require twenty pills
you can fuck yourself
not that youll feel anything
gennadys eyebrow goes up
gennadys security guys reach into their jackets
so do eddies guys
gennadys eyes flick over the situation motion to his guys to keep still
gennady laughs an unpleasant sound
i dont think your forbes new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police
gennady turns with a flourish and walks off
over his shoulder with smug confidence thursday
you have them here
gennady turns walks to the curb where a new black town car is waiting for him and his boys
obviously this could not go on
but there is very little on this earth that million dollars cant solve
and tomorrow at nine atwood would sign the papers
eddie van loon and associates are all waiting in the conference room
the clock on the wall reads
van loon looks glum
a long silence
well you want to call it
there was all last night to tell us that
van loon pushes the intercom
okay the decision could have changed that makes sense but the discourtesy doesnt
its still on
oh based on your graphs and projections
i saw his eyes its on
you know remind me who the fuck exactly are you
im sorry carl im about at the end with this unqualified posturing little pull it back pierce
since when is this little pisher the fucking delphi oracle
van loon mrs
atwood is here
eddie and van loon look at each other
van loon nods at eddie the two men get up
pierce starts to get up too
pierce you can stay
pierce looks bitter chastened as van loon and eddie go
van loon and eddie enter to find mrs
hank atwood a well dressed well preserved and beautiful standing at van loons desk
i wanted this to be as confidential as possible
van loon and eddie cant imagine whats coming next
my husband experienced some pain and dizziness this morning
hes at lenox hill undergoing tests
she speaks with great dignity distraught but tightly controlled
obviously it wouldnt be in our best interests for this to be reported by the press as it might put some of his interests at risk
i just want you to know that we have every intention of signing the contract and as soon as he is able we will proceed
eddie and van loon flank mrs
atwood walking her to her car
i realize that this is a useless platitude but
if theres anything we can do
obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible
thank you so much
i rely on your discretion
she shakes both of their hands
a driver has the door open for her she gets in now out of earshot
you think theres a proxy
cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney
eddie shakes his head
the two men look at each other darkly
the driver closes her door turns and now eddie can see his face
its tan coat
with a huge angry scar slashed across his cheek
eddie and tan coat look at each other
a steely moment of recognition
tan coat turns away gets in the drivers side
van loon watches the car pull away
hed better get better
we push in on eddies face
who now knows
but atwood wouldnt get better
because atwood was out of mdt
eddie beautifully dressed walks
ten paces behind walk his security guys
he is thinking
why be surprised
how many other meteoric rises might be explained by mdt
at least i had some my life wasnt in jeopardy
only my money
and my liberty
eddie stands with his favorite police detective and his lawyer in an anteroom leading to an institutional door
his lawyer talks to him low
ive been all over them
we cant allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the lineup theyre as close to your clones as i could possibly get away
with its going to be one big handsome blur to this guy a female cop approaches eddie
i need you to change your jacket
oh thats me
i want everyone in the same shirt better for the blur factor
another beat of hesitation
then eddie hands brandt his jacket takes off his shirt puts on the blue shirt
and stoically follows the female cop through the grubby door
please turn to the right
eddie and four other dark haired guys turn to the right
eddie looks at the black one way window
who was out there
the womans husband
was some bellboy i undertipped about to end my life
not the dimmest clue
he was dithering
eddie blinks at him
maybe the third from the right
no not him
here you go
he hands eddie back his jacket
re the jacket thing of beauty
you had it made
eddie just nods his eyes steely
the lawyer feels the molten stare and hands the jacket back
theyd kept me all day
eddie rushes down the steps two at a time looks at his watch
id missed my meeting with gennady
gennady wearing a gorgeous cashmere coat waits now with gennady looks at his watch then says something low and sinister in russian to his associates
but i had more important business
eddie hurries into the room
van loon doesnt look up
hes watching a monitor which has a live news feed to a financial channel
and the dow has been yo yoing all day amidst speculation that van loon associates and hank atwood have negotiated a merger
van loon turns to eddie furious agitated
have you been talking to anyone
not a word carl
where have you been eddie
this is the second time youve turned to
personal time carl
youre not telling me theres been any movement
atwoods in a coma
black looks between them as the newscaster continues
it had gotten out somehow
but i felt thick stupid tired
a small pain was starting behind my eyes
id been unable to take my mdt and i was overdue
he shoots van loon a glance
van loon is miserably fixated on the tv
eddie stands in a stall
reaches into the lining of his coat
unfastens the opening of the compartment
there is nothing inside
panicked feels again
the mdt is simply not there
he begins to hyperventilate
spin in place
push against the stall walls trying not to scream
was it brandt
or someone else
the police station
a coat room
he bursts from the stall alone in the bathroom
stares at himself terrified in the mirror
in an hour id be useless
in two id be sick
eddie bursts from the bathroom
trying not to look too wild eyed
this came for you
eddie looks at a large box on van loons desk
indeed his name is on it
eddie mystified approaches it
as van loon continues to stare at the tv disinterested in the box eddie gingerly opens it
inside are the severed hands of eddies security guys
one black hand one with the distinctive tattoos
clearly these guys are dead
eddie grabs the box and starts from the room
what are you doing eddie
but eddies gone
people are leaving for the night
eddie shoves past them still holding the damning box frightened jacked up desperate shoving people out of the way to get to the elevators
eddie sits in the back seat the box freakishly sitting beside him
i couldnt think
his brow is beaded with sweat
only mdt could help me
i had no mdt
push in on eddies eyes
was there anywhere
we begin to rewind
in eddies mind
through many images weve seen in this movie
stopping briefly at all the places eddie has stashed his mdt
anywhere at all
i could have left one pill
we stop at the end table in lindys apartment peer inside
we stop at the underside of the grill on eddies old stove
we continue to rewind but every image we stop on reveals
i had to keep thinking
eddie sits at his huge new steel dining table the evil box on the table in front of him head in his hands
the room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a chance to unpack
the tv is on in the background
its a financial channel
we see mrs
hank atwood is giving a statement
there is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger
my husband is having some tests this is a difficult time and i would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney
she motions at the gentleman next to her
who is also eddies attorney morris brandt
the one who was so helpful with the police
the one who held his jacket
bitter amusement in eddies eyes
at least he knows
the apartment buzzer buzzes
looks at the door
it buzzes again
it wasnt downstairs security alerting me to a visitor
it was my inner door
someone was in the building ten feet away right now
eddie walks to his phone picks it up
pushes the button puts it to his ear
he pushes the on button again and again
the buzzer buzzes again
eddie rushes to the door opens the coat closet
in the closet is a state of the art security monitor
gennady and two men are outside his door
suddenly the monitor goes black
eddie flicks the switch on the monitor
eddie flicks the switch again
someone somewhere has figured out how to disarm it
the buzzer buzzes again
eddie backs away from the door
we hear eddies shallow panicked breathing
he lunges for his briefcase pulls out his cell phone
it reads no signal
the first slam on the door begins
the door holds but eddie begins to back away in horror
we slowly fade to black
and fade in on and so
here i am
and now we pick up eddie where we left him standing on the ledge
i knew they would kill me slowly and horribly
but this choice would at least be mine
we now hear the zzzzzzzz
of some major power tool drilling at the door punctuated by more bams
one way or another theyre going to get in
eddie takes a breath tries to jump
but were instinctive creatures
we want to live
so my foggy brain tried to remember
where one tablet of mdt
we push in on eddies eyes
we are still rewinding in eddies mind
images of where weve seen him keep mdt
we stop at the sugarbowl on eddies dining table
then go forward no wait
rewinding stopping again on the sugar bowl
pushing in on the sugar bowl
eddie spins around looks back into his apartment eyes intense
it was possible
and possible was enough
eddie is tearing through boxes as the pounding and drilling become deafening
he rips open a box labeled kitchen its full of books
jump cuts as he rips open other boxes
his hands frantically scattering cds cutlery cans of food
the door begins to give
under the deafening more jump cuts as eddie hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly shaped objects
the sugar bowl
with sugar still inside
eddie rummages frantically among the sugar cubes as the door gives a few inches groaning and we glimpse blurred faces on the other side
pokes wildly among the cubes
pushing them aside revealing at the bottom of the bowl one mdt tablet looks back up at him
its really there
eddie grabs it just as with a splintering crash
the door goes down
eddie steps back brings the pill up to his mouth
but as he steps he trips on a soup can hes scattered
he falls backwards
his hand hits the side of the coffee table
the mdt tablet goes flying
also in slow motion gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room
the mdt tablet
towards a grate in the floor a heating vent and hits it
before disappearing forever down the grate
eddie knows thats it
his life has ended
he sucks in his last breath then with a yell he rushes back for the terrace
for his suicide leap
thug is quicker
gets to the door first
eddie will not have the luck to be able to jump
hes trapped between the two thugs
i told you i want more
you dont listen
maybe you think im joking
he reaches into his coat pocket
but im down to this last one
and pulls out a syringe
see i dissolve pill in solution
you shoot it goes straight into blood and to brain
works much better
he pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle
jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid
where do you keep yours
eddie is backed to the wall
nowhere to go
im plum out
gennady just smiles that was an unfortunate choice
he gives an order to the thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment
we hear them starting to tear things up
gennady and eddie are alone
they will find it
or i will make you tell me
which is quicker
we see huh
he clicks open a black attache case
it is filled with sinister looking silver instruments and knives
thug has found behind a bureau a safe
he calls excitedly in russian to the other room
gennady calls back in russian
then picks up a particularly delicate yet sharp looking knife
this is a waste of my time you know that
i am getting out of this part of the business
starting import export company
very exciting stuff
a lot on my plate
i need to learn to delegate
eddie is backed up against a table which is covered with stuff hes scattered which includes a butcher block with a knife in it
gennady starts arranging his instruments
first i will cut skin from you flay you
you stay alive nice long time
then maybe we cut meat from you steaks
or maybe softer parts
i get inspiration
he looks up smiles to see the effect his words have on eddie
staring back at gennady hard a fuck you stare
we cant see behind eddies back but we can see the butcher block and the knife is gone
senses something is not right
looks at eddie quizzically
eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can right into gennadys stomach
gennady gasps in surprise chokes writhes
eddie drives the knife home harder grabbing gennadys other hand which lashes at eddie with the fillet knife
the men fall to the floor in a death struggle
eddie exhausted off mdt but determined not to let go
gennady writhes flails but doesnt cry out
hes already choking on blood
eyes shocked surprised
eddie turns the fillet knife back on gennady slashes at his other arm blood spurts
but its not necessary
gennadys eyes are glazing
his gurgling gets quieter
hes quite dead
eddie lies alongside him panting arm grazed and welling blood from where gennadys filleting knife slashed him suddenly weak and exhausted
from the other room comes the brrrrrrr
sound of the drill the boys oblivious are hard at work on the safe
eddie tries to get up then falls back
not much of a triumph was it
hes got the shakes
no more of a convulsion
he sinks back to the floor
because i would die here too
there is a break in the convulsion
then another one starts
only mdt could help me and the last of it was in this fucks bloodstream
gennadys blood wells around gennadys body in a crimson puddle
a puddle thats creeping closer and closer to eddies face which is lying convulsing on the floor
between convulsions suddenly looking
looking at the blood
it creeps closer to eddies face
eddie is trying to move trying to push his face closer to the blood
and now he turns his face down into the blood
and begins to lap it up
the thug finally gets the safe open
inside is only one item the tattooed security mans severed hand
and its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck you
the thugs are not amused
the thugs are coming down the hall muttering angrily
mouth smeared with blood eddie is dragging himself by the elbows across the room
they burst into the room see gennady dead on the floor
the camera whip pans around
eddie lies panting
and then it hits
we push in on eddies eyes
he feels it
his old friend
look up at a noise
just in time to see eddie bolting out the front door of the apartment
they come thundering out see a flash of eddie disappearing we are in jittery handheld thugs pov shot as they burst back in barreling by rooms looking in them pressing
on to more rooms
thug blasts his gun
the man crumples the glass doors behind him explode
the man goes down
revealing eddie standing behind him hes been holding up his neighbors body and just as this registers whack
eddie gives thug a savage shot with a fireplace poker
thug goes down unconscious
the gun skitters across the floor
thug dives reaches for it
eddie grabs a piece of the shattered glass and in a vicious swipe brings it down on the thugs hand
but this guy is not a tough russian motherfucker for nothing
bleeding profusely he doesnt let go of the gun
his bloody hand comes up tries to aim
eddie dives backwards through the broken glass door to the patio
the thug stumbles after him
eddies hand still holding glass cuts the awning rope holding up the awning
the awning comes down on the thug a huge canvas curtain dropping between the thug and eddie
several holes appear in the canvas as the thug tries to shoot eddie anyway but eddie has leapt out of the way
as he wrestles it off
he sees eddie on the ground prone just watching him calmly
he starts to smirk
eddie touches a match to the ground
the flame shoots across the floor to the thug who now realizes hes standing in a puddle the overturned can of bbq fluid next to him
in an instant his legs and pants are on fire
now the man screams
is out of bullets
he rushes at eddie screaming on fire in animal rage
eddie brings up a wrought iron patio chair to meet him catching him squarely in the ribs
he gasps bends over
looks up at eddie beaten
the face that looks back is without pity
we are looking up at the penthouse
a shape is dropping fast towards us the shape of a man
the mans head explodes against the railing like a pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down out of sight
later it would be noted that my neighbor was in the music business
one of his drug deals had obviously gone bad
and the night was still young
a man is on a gurney
a nurse puts a sheet over his head
before our view of his face disappears we realize its hank atwood
tan coat is sitting stoic and red eyed in a chair
he senses something
slowly turns his head and looks
eddie is sitting in the chair next to him
the two men look at each other for a moment
then im sure youre curious about whats happened to your boss
i certainly am
if my attorney was really working for mr
atwood to save his life then why is he dead
at what point was the pony express supposed to ride in with the life saving medication
or did the pony decide that he should be running his own pony show
minus the dog
tan coat stares at him his face without expression
an upperclass housewife enters in sweats from the gym
immediately notices something is not right
the place has been ransacked
she rushes in
we see her husband morris brandt tied up and gagged struggling on the floor
next to him a smashed picture
it once covered a wall safe which is now open
the safe is empty
i would not go back
i would not be stopped
title eight months later
desks employees volunteers ringing phones
reuben late s sharp a james carville type sits on a desk with casual authority is on the phone
actually no theres no more tickets
yeah i know an overbooked fundraiser theres a first well here he comes ill ask him edward
we see eddie striding down the corridor wearing a sharp suit looking more dignified than weve ever seen him more adult
the snap and crackle of something new power is in his step
two male aides flank him
reuben approaches falls into step with them
i think were looking at a second overflow event theres a wave of donations coming in and i dont think theyre even going to try a second debate dont go
yet i have a lunch
they have arrived at eddies office
reuben nods at the closed door
john steadmans in there
look theyre your biggest contributor give him his two shitty little minutes
eddie sighs capitulating
puts his hand on the door
what are they research
eddie shoots him a look
eddie comes in to find john steadman s well dressed and gentlemanly waiting
nice to see you
he shakes steadmans hand but steadman doesnt get up
in fact steadman looks uncommonly relaxed almost slouched in his chair looking up at eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that eddie doesnt recognize
we appreciate everything youve done for us well youve done most of it for yourself
he says this with a kind of casual prescient authority
and suddenly we know hes right
eddie will win
i mean everything from heres a technicality isnt it eddie
again that smile
eddie doesnt know what this guy is about
and nobody calls him eddie any more
i think we both know where its heading
you can maintain
eventually youll run out
i just want you to know were here to help you
eddie blinks at him
did he just say what eddie thought he said
what are you saying
weve gotten most of the bugs out
its longer lasting youll only have to take one a week
eddie is now dead silent
a long beat
is it possible
is he really talking to someone who makes mdt
have you been watching me from the beginning
those of you who indulged
distinguished yourselves very quickly
you made yourselves clear to us
steadman just smiles waves the question away
you went the furthest with it the fastest so of course to us youre the most interesting
how did it get on the street
that was never our intention
we took care of it
meaning they took care of vern
it will never again be on the street
it will never publicly exist
obviously i dont need to detail the advantages for you
a long beat
eddie doesnt trust this guy not a bit
and what about for you
why dont you take it
we dont have to
youll take it for us
and in return
i do what
just keep on doing what youre doing
we wont bother you much at first
what will you be bothering me with
well given where youre heading some of our ideas are
but i think achievable
eddie takes that in
and if i dont like your ideas
then well say godspeed
and your candle will have shed a brief but lovely light
eddie knows now
they own his ass
but lets not even go there
right now you should feel relieved your problems are over
we just want to keep you healthy
luckily i can do that myself
well no ah that wont be the case
we shut your lab down this morning
steadman doesnt blink
all of them
steadman suddenly chuckles not at all concerned by this
we were right about you eddie youre gonna go all the way
lets not do anything to jeopardize that
theres no downside here were offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects
i think youll be pleased with the arrangement
come on lets get some lunch
he heads for the door
eddie remains still
tell me something
steadman stops looks back at him
did i kill that woman
steadman looks puzzled that eddie would ask
do you really want to know
no he doesnt
eddie and steadman exit come down the steps eddie looking thrown
he drifts along half a step behind steadman deep in thought
its not so bad is it
eddie doesnt answer
doesnt every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind drag of compromise
a black limo waits at the curb
overall well all be better off
foreign policy the courts even the constitution could stand a little tweaking
they descend the last few steps
steadman opens the limo door for eddie
but eddie hesitates
doesnt get in
eddie gestures for him to get in
all right then
he gets in
and eddie closes the door after him
stands outside the limo looking back at steadman through the rolled down window his face a cold mask
dont underestimate us
dont underestimate your own creation
steadman looks at him quizically
i mean you invented it
what does it do
it puts me steps ahead of you fucks
you think i didnt spend my days on mdt devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the israelis
you think theres not people with a bead on you right now right in this building
you think this conversation is private
you dont know the caliber of enemies youll be making
you want to push that button
ill show you my silos if you show me yours
youll run out
or ill think of something
isnt that what mdt does
makes you think of something
might even tell me how to get off it
a flicker in steadmans eyes
what if i just ask the drug
how to tell the drug
how to fuck itself
i mean isnt it like the ball
steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away
it always answers
as the limo recedes into the distance eddie finally exhales
and only then do we see it
