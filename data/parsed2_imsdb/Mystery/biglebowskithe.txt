b if window
href b b we are floating up a steep scrubby slope
we hear male voices gently singing tumbling tumbleweeds and a deep affable western accented voice sam elliots perhaps a way out west there was a fella fella i want to
tell you about fella by the name of jeff lebowski
at least that was the handle his lovin parents gave him but he never had much use for it himself
this lebowski he called himself the dude
now dude thats a name no one would self apply where i come from
but then there was a lot about the dude that didnt make a whole lot of sense to me
and a lot about where he lived like wise
but then again maybe thats why i found the place sdurned innarestin
we top the rise and the smoggy vastness of los angeles at twilight stretches out before us
they call los angeles the city of angels
i didnt find it to be that exactly but ill allow as there are some nice folks there
course i cant say i seen london and i never been to france and i aint never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says
but ill tell you what after seeing los angeles and thisahere story im about to unfold wal i guess i seen somethin ever bit as stupefyin as yad see in
any a those other places and in english too so i can die with a smile on my face without feelin like the good lord gypped me
it is late the supermarket all but deserted
we are tracking in on a fortyish man in bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case
he is the dude
his rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep
he is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates
now this story im about to unfold took place back in the early nineties just about the time of our conflict with sadm and the eye rackies
i only mention it cause some times theres a man i wont say a hee ro cause whats a hee ro
but sometimes theres a man
the dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk
he sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs
and im talkin about the dude here sometimes theres a man who wal hes the man for his timen place he fits right in there and thats the dude in
she waits arms folded
a small black and white tv next to her register shows george bush on the white house lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him
this aggression will not stand
this will not stand
the dude peeking over his shades scribbles something at the little customers lectern
milk beads his mustache
and even if hes a lazy man and the dude was certainly that quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county
the dude has his ralphs shoppers club card to one side and is making out a check to ralphs for sixty nine cents
which would place him high in the runnin for laziest worldwide but sometimes theres a man
sometimes theres a man
long shot of the glowing ralphs
there are only two or three cars parked in the huge lot
wal i lost mtrain of thought here
but aw hell i done innerduced him enough
the dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot
next to him walks a mexican carry out boy in a red apron and cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk
the two mens footsteps echo in the still of the night
after a beat of walking the dude offhandedly points
its the lebaron
the dude is going up the walkway of a small venice bungalow court
he holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other
he awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door
the dude enters and flicks on a light
his head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit
we track with him as he is rushed through the living room his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body
going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it leaving a hole
the dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small bathroom the satchel once again taking away a piece of doorframe
his head is plunged into the toilet
the paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor
the dude blows bubbles
we want that money lebowski
bunny said you were good for it
hands haul the dude out of the toilet
the dude blubbers and gasps for air
wheres the money lebowski
his head is plunged back into the toilet
wheres the money lebowski
the hands haul him out again dripping and gasping
its uh its down there somewhere
lemme take another look
his head is plunged back in
dont fuck with us
if your wife owes money to jackie treehorn that means you owe money to jackie treehorn
the inquisitor hauls the dudes head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor back against the toilet
the dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand
looming over him is a strapping blond man
beyond in the living room a young chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug
ever thus to deadbeats lebowski
he starts peeing on the rug
the dudes hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses
dont do you see what happens
you see what happens lebowski
the dude puts on his dripping sunglasses
look nobody calls me lebowski
you got the wrong guy
im the dude man
your name is lebowski
your wife is bunny
he holds up his hands
you see a wedding ring
does this place look like im fucking married
all my plants are dead
the blond man stoops to unzip the satchel
he pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native
the fuck is this
the dude pats at his pockets takes out a joint and lights it
obviously youre not a golfer
the blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile
the chinese man is zipping his fly
wasnt this guy supposed to be a millionaire
they both look around
what do you think
he looks like a fuckin loser
the dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them
at least im housebroken
the two men look at each other
they turn to leave
fuckin waste of time
the blond man turns testily at the door
thanks a lot asshole
scattered by a strike
music and head credits play over various bowling shots pins flying bowlers hoisting balls balls gliding down lanes sliding feet graceful releases ball return spinning up a ball fingers sliding
into fingerholes etc
the music turns into boomy source music coming from a distant jukebox as the credits end over a clattering strike
a lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench
hot damn im throwin rocks tonight
mark it dude
we are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of bud
he has dark worried eyes and a goatee
hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts
he also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt
this is walter
he squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he addresses the dude at the scoring table
the dude also holding a large plastic cup of bud wears some of its foam on his mustache
this was a valued rug
he elaborately clears his throat
this was uh yeah man it really tied the room together this was a valued uh
donny the strike scoring bowler enters and sits next walter
what tied the room together dude
were you listening to the story donny

and he has the wealth uh the resources obviously and there is no reason no fucking reason why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on

yeah this is the guy this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug
i mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug
thaaats right dude they pee on your fucking rug
we pull back from the name jeffrey lebowski engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque from variety clubs international honors lebowski as achiever of the year
reflected in the plaque we see the dude entering the room with a young man
we hear the two men talk and this is the study
you can see the various commendations honorary degrees et cetera
yes uh very impressive
please feel free to inspect them
im not really uh
we are panning the walls looking at various citations and certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen thats the key to the city of pasadena which mr
lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic uh
thats a los angeles chamber of commerce business achiever award which is given not necessarily given every year
given only when theres a worthy somebody especially hey is this him with nancy

lebowski with the first lady yes taken when lebowski on the right

lebowski on the right mrs
reagan on the left taken when hes handicapped huh
lebowski is disabled yes

reagan was first lady of the nation yes yes

you never went to college
well yeah i did but i spent most of my time occupying various um administration buildings heh heh smoking thai stick breaking into the rotc yes heh and bowling
ill tell you the truth brandt i dont remember most of it
our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed life magazine cover which is headlined are you a lebowski achiever
oddly the dudes sunglassed face is on it we realize that under the magazines logo and headline the display is mirrored
we hear the door open and the whine of a motor
the dude wearing shorts and a bowling shirt turns to look
so does brandt the young man weve been listening to
he wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin
entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair jeff lebowski
okay sir youre a lebowski im a lebowski thats terrific im very busy so what can i do for you
he wheels himself behind a desk
the dude sits facing him as brandt withdraws
well sir its this rug i have really tied the room together you told brandt on the phone he told me
so where do i fit in
well they were looking for you these two guys they were trying to ill say it again all right

the dude minds
this will not stand ya know this will not stand man
i mean if your wife owes my wife is not the issue here
i hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance which is ample but if she doesnt sir that will be her problem not mine just as
your rug is your problem just as every bums lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame
i didnt blame anyone for the loss of my legs some chinaman in korea took them from me but i went out and achieved anyway
i cant solve your problems sir only you can
the dude rises
ah fuck it
thats your answer
tattoo it on your forehead
your answer to everything
the dude is heading for the door
your revolution is over mr
the bums lost
as the dude opens the door
my advice is do what your parents did
get a job sir
the bums will always lose do you hear me lebowski
the bums will always the dude shuts the door on the old mans bellowing to find himself in a high coffered hallway
brandt is approaching
how was your meeting mr
the old man told me to take any rug in the house
a houseman with a rolled up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn past a swimming pool to a garage
brandt and the dude follow
manolo will load it into your car for you uh dude
its the lebaron
tracking toward the pool
a young woman sits facing it her back to us leaning forward to paint her toenails
beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool
well enjoy and perhaps well see you again some time dude
yeah sure if im ever in the neighborhood need to use the john
arcing around the womans foot as she finishes painting the nails emerald green
the young woman looks up at him
she is in her early twenties
she leans back and extends her leg toward the dude
blow on them
the dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them
she waggles her foot and giggles
the dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot
you want me to blow on your toes
i cant blow that far
the dude looks over at the pool
you sure he wont mind
the man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out
he is thin in his thirties with long stringy blond hair
he wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket open shirtless exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin
one arm trails off into the water next to it an empty whiskey bottle bobs
dieter doesnt care about anything
hes a nihilist
the young woman smiles
youre not blowing
brandt nervously takes the dude by the elbow
our guest has to be getting along mrs
the dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away still looking at the young woman
ill suck your cock for a thousand dollars
brandt releases a gale of forced laughter ha ha ha ha
very free spirited
were all very fond of her
brandt cant watch though
or he has to pay a hundred
ha ha ha ha ha
he continues to lead away the dude who looks back over his im just gonna find a cash machine
scattered by a strike
donny calls out from the bench grasshopper dude theyre dead in the water
as the dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to another team in black bowling shirts the cavaliers that shares the lane
your maples carl
walter just arriving is carrying a leatherette satchel in one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other
way to go dude
if you will it it is no dream
youre fucking twenty minutes late

what do you mean brought it bowling
i didnt rent it shoes

hes not gonna take your fucking turn dude
he lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier
it scoots around the bowling table sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail
hey man if my fucking ex wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu id tell her to go fuck
why cant she board it
first of all dude you dont have an ex secondly its a fucking show dog with fucking papers

over the line
smokey turns from his last roll to look at walter
over the line smokey
thats a foul

so his toe slipped over a little its just a game

yeah but i wasnt over
gimme the marker dude im marking it an eight
walter takes out a gun
smokey my friend youre entering a world of pain
hey walter mark that frame an eight youre entering a world of pain

a manager in a bowling shirt style uniform is running for a phone
look dude i dont hold with this
this guy is your partner you should walter primes the gun and points it at his head
the pomeranian is excitedly yapping at walters elbow making high body twisting tail wagging leaps
walter theyre calling the cops put the piece away
walter all right
there it is
its fucking zero
he points frantically at the score projected above the lane
you happy you crazy fuck
this is a league game smokey
walter and the dude walk to the dudes car
the pomeranian trots happily behind walter who totes the empty carrier
walter you cant do that
these guysre like me theyre pacificists
smokey was a conscientious objector
you know dude i myself dabbled with pacifism at one point
not in nam of course and you know smokey has emotional problems
you mean beyond pacifism
hes fragile man
hes very fragile
as the two men get into the car huh
i did not know that
well its water under the bridge

they watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot

well just take t easy man

wavin a gun around
smugly calmer than you are
his irritates the dude further
just take it easy man
walter is still smug
calmer than you are
a large brilliant persian rug lies beneath the dudes beat up old furniture
at the table next to the answering machine the dude is mixing kalhua rum and milk
dude this is smokey
look i dont wanna be a hard on about this and i know it wasnt your fault but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and
i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round
or maybe forfeit it to us shit
so like i say just thought you know fair warning
lebowski this is brandt at uh well at mr
please call us as soon as is convenient
lebowski this is fred dynarski with the southern cal bowling league
i just got a an informal report uh that a uh a member of your team uh walter sobchak drew a loaded weapon during league play we hear the doorbell
it swings open to reveal a short hairy muscular but balding middle aged man in a black t shirt and black cut off jeans
dude i finally got the venue i wanted
im performing my dance quintet you know my cycle at crane jacksons fountain street theatre on tuesday night and id love it if you came and gave me notes
the dude takes a swig of his kalhua

the voice continues on the machine
serious infraction and examine your standing
lebowski brandt again
please do call us when you get in and ill send the limo
let me assure you i hope youre not avoiding this call because of the rug which i assure you is not a problem
we need your help and uh well we would very much like to see you
we are pushing brandt down the high ceilinged hallway
distantly we hear a dolorous soprano
brandt talks back over weve had some terrible news
lebowski is in seclusion in the west wing
brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors
the music washes over us as we enter a great study where jeffrey lebowski a blanket thrown over his knees stares hauntedly into a fire listening to lohengrin
jeffrey lebowski waves the dude in without looking around
i can look back on a life of achievement on challenges met competitors bested obstacles overcome
ive accomplished more than most men and without the use of my legs
what makes a man mr
i dont know sir
is it being prepared to do the right thing
whatever the price
isnt that what makes a man
that and a pair of testicles
lebowski turns away from the dude with a haunted stare lost in thought
but perhaps youre right
the dude thumps at his chest pocket
mind if i smoke a jay
he turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks
she is the light of my life
are you surprised at my tears sir
strong men also cry
strong men also cry
he clears his throat
i received this fax this morning
brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the dude
as you can see it is a ransom note
sent by cowards
men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play
men who will not sign their names
lebowski looks soulfully at the dude
brandt will fill you in on the details
he wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire
brandt tugs at the dudes shirt and points him back to the hall
the sopranos singing is once again faint
brandts voice is hushed mr
lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money
why me man
he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who uh soiled your rug and youre in a unique position to confirm or uh disconfirm that suspicion
so he thinks its the carpet pissers huh
well dude we just dont know
crash scattered by a strike in slow motion
still in slow motion
we are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall thin hispanic bowler displaying perfect form
he wears an all in one dacron polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side
on the dude sitting next to walter in the molded plastic chairs
the dude is staring off towards the bowler
fucking quintana that creep can roll man displaying great slow motion form as the dude and walters conversation continues over
yeah but hes a fucking pervert dude
the man is a sex offender
with a record
spent six months in chino for exposing himself to an eight year old
we see quintana in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell
the voice over conversation continues
when he moved down to venice he had to go door to door to tell everyone hes a pederast
the door swings open and a beer swilling middle aged man looks dully out at quintana who looks hesitantly up
whats a pederast walter
shut the fuck up donny
scattered by a strike
wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air
stitched above the breast pocket of his all in one is his first name jesus
they have been joined by donny
how much they offer you
and of course i still keep the rug
just for making the hand off
he slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket
they gave dude a beeper so whenever these guys call what if its during a game
i told him if it was during league play donny has been watching quintana
if whats during league play
life does not stop and start at your convenience you miserable piece of shit
whats wrong with walter dude
i figure its easy money its all pretty harmless
i mean she probably kidnapped herself
what do you mean dude
rug peers did not do this
i mean look at it
young trophy wife
marries a guy for money but figures he isnt giving her enough
she owes money all over town that
its all a goddamn fake
like lenin said look for the person who will benefit
and you will uh you know youll uh you know what im trying to say i am the walrus
that fucking bitch
i am the walrus
shut the fuck up donny
vladimir ilyich ulyanov
what the fuck is he talking about

well there isnt a literal connection dude
walter face it there isnt any connection
its your roll
have it your way
the point is its your roll the fucking point is its your roll
are you ready to be fucked man
they both look up
quintana on his way out looks down at them from the lip of the lanes
over his polyester all in one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and jesus stitched on the breast
he is holding a fancy black and red leather ball satchel perhaps a sylvia wein
behind him stands his partner obrien a short fat irishman with tufted red hair
i see you rolled your way into the semis
deos mio man
seamus and me were gonna fuck you up
yeah well thats just ya know like your opinion man
quintana looks at walter
let me tell you something bendeco
you pull any your crazy shit with us you flash a piece out on the lanes ill take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull
the fucking trigger til it goes click
you said it man
nobody fucks with the jesus
jesus walks away
walter nods sadly
eight year olds dude
we are looking down at the dude who is prone on the rug
his eyes are closed
he wears a walkman headset
leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter
in his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled venice the dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane
on its impact with the pins the dude opens his eyes
a blonde woman looms over him
next to her a young man in paint spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier
the sap catches the dude on the chin and sends his head thunking back onto the rug
a million stars explode against a field of black
we hear the la la la la of the man in me
the black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug
the rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of los angeles at twilight moving below us at great speed
the dude is flying over the city his arms thrown out in front of him the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt
he looks up
ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away riding on the dudes rug like a sheik on a magic carpet
she is outpacing us growing smaller
the dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand
his bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight abruptly snapping his arm down and him after it
he is falling
from a high angle we see the dude hurtling down toward the city dragged by the ball
a reverse looking up shows the dude hurtling toward us out of the inky sky his eyes wide with horror
led by the bowling ball he zooms past the camera leaving us in black
we hear a distant rumble like thunder
dull reflections materialize in the darkness
they are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball
we pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us overtaking us
the dude looks up up up at the looming ball its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face
the gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us finger holes
the largest thumb hole rolls directly over us engulfing us once again in black
the black rolls away and we are spinning spinning down a bowling lane our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball
we see the receding bowler spinning away
it is the blonde woman performing her follow through
floor spins up at us and then away ceiling spins up and away the length of the alley with pins at the end floor ceiling approaching pins again and again
we hit the pins and clatter into blackness
we hear pins spin hit each other and drop
we hear an irritating insistent beeping
we are close on the dude upside down
as the picture fades in the bowling noises continue but filtered and faint
they come from the dudes walkman the headset of which is now askew with one arm off his ear
as the dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around
his head is now resting against hardwood floor not rug
he raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw
the beeper on his belt is blinking red in sync with the continuing irritating beeps
an end table is upset but otherwise the furniture is in place
the rug is gone
the dude looks around
the bowling sounds continue
the beeps continue
the phone starts to jangle
we push brandt down the familiar marble hallway
again there is a distant aria
brandt throws out a wrist to look at his watch
they called about eighty minutes ago
they want you to take the money and drive north on the
theyll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes
one person only or id go with you
they were very clear on that one person only
what happened to your jaw
oh nothin you know
they have reached the little desk outside of the big lebowskis office brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case
he hands this to the dude along with a cellular phone in a battery pack carrying case
heres the money and the phone
please dude follow whatever instructions they give
her life is in your hands
oh man dont say that
lebowski asked me to repeat that her life is in your hands
her life is in your hands dude
and report back to us as soon as its done
we pan off the dude driving to his point of view through the front windshield
the headlights play over walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of sobchak security
though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter
he also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper
the car stops in front of him and he opens the dudes door and hands in the briefcase
take the ringer
the dude takes the briefcase and slides over
the ringer dude
have they called yet
the dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling
what the hell is this
my dirty undies
agh he closes the briefcase
walter im sure theres a reason you brought your dirty undies thaaaats right dude
the ringer cant look empty
walter what the fuck are you thinking
well youre right dude i got to thinking
i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand we
what the fuck we
you said you just wanted to come along my point dude is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million
am i wrong
yes youre wrong
this isnt a fucking game walter it is a fucking game
you said so yourself dude she kidnapped herself yeah but the phone chirps

but theyre amateurs
the dude glares at walter
into the phone dude here
okay vee proceed
but only if there is no funny stuff
so no funny stuff
hey just tell me where the fuck you want us to go
it flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car
that was the sign
walter wrestles the car onto the two lane road
so as long as we get her back nobodys in a position to complain
and we keep the baksheesh
but you havent told me how we get her back
where is she
thats the simple part dude
when we make the handoff i grab the guy and beat it out of him
he looks at the dude

the dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat

and there goes the ringer
he flings it out the window

walter points across the seat at the paper wrapped bundle
you didnt think i was rolling out of here naked
walter please walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road
this is it dude
lets take that hill
walter rolls out with his parcel giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement
the car swerves and lurches and the dude cursing takes the wheel
walter tumbles onto the shoulder and rat tat tat tat
muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper
the car rocks and the dude wrestles with the wheel
the car clunks and screams around in a skid
the dude is thrown forward as the car hits something
as the dude struggles out holding the satchel of money
the front of his car is crumpled into a tree
the car body saps back to the left where the rear wheel has been shot out
walter is just rising from the ground massaging an injured knee
the dude runs up the road toward the bridge frantically waving the satchel in the air
there is a distant engine roar
a motorcycle bumps up onto the road from the ravine under the bridge and tires squealing skids around to speed away in the opposite direction
it is closely followed by two more roaring motorcycles
we have it
we have it
the dude and walter stand in the middle of the road watching the three red tail lights fishtail away
ahh fuck it lets go bowling
a ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins
he turns from the lane to where the dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs
the dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap
it is ringing

the three bowlers stopped at the edge of the lot stare out at an empty parking space
who has your undies walter

you dont know walter
you seem to know the answer to everything else
well we were in a handicapped spot
it uh it was probably towed
its been stolen walter
you fucking know its been stolen
well certainly thats a possibility dude aw fuck it
the dude walks away across the lot
the portable phone starts ringing again
where you going dude
im going home donny
your phones ringing dude
thank you donny
the dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses
facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman one middle aged the other a fresh faced rookie
at the cut the portable phone in the dudes lap is chirping
the dude waits for the rings to end
when they do pontiac lebaron
some brown or uh rust coloration
and was there anything of value in the car
couple of creedence tapes
and there was a uh
in the briefcase
you know my papers
and what do you do sir
most people were working nights they offer us coffee
there is silence
dude continues to stare at a spot on the floor
the older cop stares at him
me i dont drink coffee
but its nice when they offer
also my rug was stolen
your rug was in the car
the dude taps the floor with his foot
the dude stares at the floor
snap out of it son
the home phone starts ringing a ring distinct from the chirp of the portable
the dude makes no move to answer it
finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks on
you find them much
dudes voice on machine the dudes not in
leave a message after the beep
it takes a minute
i wouldnt hold out much hope for the tape deck though
or the creedence tapes
and the uh the briefcase
lebowski id like to see you
call when you get home and ill send a car for you
my name is maude lebowski
im the woman who took the rug
well i guess we can close the file on that one
we are moving through the open living area of a large downtown l
a huge unfinished canvas lit by standing industrial lights dominates one wall
the furnishings are spare given the space
on the floor is the dudes brilliant rug
we hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball
the dude standing in the middle of the loft looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space
something huge and white hurtles towards the dudes head
as it roars overhead he ducks and spins to watch it pass
we see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor
she is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other with which she flicks paint down at the canvas
the dude turns again as he hears running footsteps
two young men in paint spattered shorts t shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push
ill be with you in a minute mr
she rumbles by in another pass
all right well do the blue tomorrow
help me down
the two men help maude out of her sling
she is naked except for leather harness straps which ring her breasts and wrap her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix look
does the female form make you uncomfor table mr
is that what thats a picture of
in a sense yes
elfranco my robe
my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal
which bothers some men
the word itself makes some men uncomfortable
yes they dont like hearing it and find it difficult to say
whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his dick or his rod or his johnson
this to elfranco who has handed her a robe
all right mr
lebowski lets get down to cases
my father told me hes agreed to let you have the rug but it was a gift from me to my late mother and so was not his to give
as for this
yes i know about it
and i know that you acted as courier
and let me tell you something the whole thing stinks to high heaven
right but let me explain something about that rug do you like sex mr
the physical act of love
do you like it
i was talking about my rug
youre not interested in sex
you mean coitus
i like it too
its a male myth about feminists that we hate sex
it can be a natural zesty enterprise
but unfortunately there are some people it is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy
lebowski these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word
our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these
listen maude im sorry if your stepmother is a nympho but i dont see what it has to do with do you have any kalhua
take a look at this sir
she is aiming a remote at a projection tv
the screen flickers to life
a title card the dude is at the bar a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway to his glass
from the television set we hear a doorbell ring and then a door opening
on the tv screen the door opens to reveal a sallow faced man in blue coyer alls
it is dieter the floater in lebowskis pool
nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable
shit i know that guy
hes a nihilist
and you recognize her of course
the girl answering the door is bunny lebowski
bunny the tv is in here
za okay i bring mein toolz
bunny this is my friend shari
she just came over to use the shower
grimly the story is ludicrous
mein nommen iss karl
is hard to verk in zese clozes maude switches off the set
you can imagine where it goes from here
he fixes the cable
dont be fatuous jeffrey
little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography nor that she has been banging jackie treehorn to use the parlance of our times
i am one of two trustees of the lebowski foundation the other being my father
the foundation takes youngsters from watts and shit yeah the achievers
little lebowski urban achievers yes and proud we are of all of them
i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this abduction but i tell you it is preposterous
this compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride
yeah but my im getting to your rug
my father and i dont get along he doesnt approve of my lifestyle and needless to say i dont approve of his
still i hardly wish to make my fathers embezzlement a police matter so im proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to
well sure i could do that if you successfully do so i will compensate you to the tune of of the recovered sum
thousand yes bones or clams or whatever you call them
yeah but what about your rug yes well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that dont have sentimental value for me
and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw
the dude fingers his jaw where the lump from the sap has all but disappeared
oh thats okay i hardly even heres the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you
you will receive no bill
hes a good man and thorough
thats really thoughtful but i please see him jeffrey
hes a good man and thorough
the dude sits in back holding a white russian listening to the chauffeur a man of about the same age from whose livery cap a ponytail emerges
so he says my son cant hold a job my daughters married to a fuckin loser and i got a rash on my ass so bad i cant hardly siddown
but you know me
i cant complain
fuckin a man
i got a rash
fuckin a man
i gotta tell ya tony
he takes a sip of a freshly mixed white russian which leaves milk on his mustache
i was feeling really shitty earlier in the day id lost a little money i was down in the dumps
aw forget about it
i cant be worrying about that shit
life goes on
the limo has rolled to a stop
the dude gets out still holding his drink
home sweet home mr
whos your friend in the volkswagon
his eyes on the rearview mirror tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder
he followed us here
the dude turns to look
halfway up the block a volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb
in the drivers seat we see a fat mans shape
when did he the dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half nelson by another uniformed chauffeur
into the limo you sonofabitch
as he is frog marched towards another limo the dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it
theres a beverage here
the waiting limos back door is flung open
the dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear
the door is slammed behind him
start talking and talk fast you lousy bum
weve been frantically trying to reach you dude
brandt sits catty corner from the dude directly across from the dude is the big lebowski a comforter across his knees
wheres my goddamn money you bum
well we i dont they did not receive the money you nitwit
they did not receive the goddamn money
her life was in your this is our concern dude
no man nothing is fucked here the dude takes a hurried sip from his drink
cmon man whore you gonna believe
those guys are we dropped off the damn money i the royal we you know the editorial i dropped off the money exactly as per look ive got certain information
certain things have come to light and uh has it ever occurred to you man that given the nature of all this new shit that uh instead of running around blaming me that this whole thing might just be not you know not just such a simple but uh you know
what in gods holy name are you blathering about
ill tell you what im blathering about
i got information new shit has come to light and shit man
she kidnapped herself
lebowski stares at him dumbstruck
the dude is encouraged
well sure look at it
young trophy wife i mean in the parlance of our times owes money all over town including to known pornographers and thats cool thats cool but im saying she needs
money and of course theyre gonna say they didnt get it cause she wants more man shes gotta feed the monkey i mean hasnt that ever occurred to you
lebowski that had not occurred to me
that had not occurred to us dude
well okay youre not privy to all the new shit so uh you know but thats what you pay me for
speaking of which would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash
i gotta check this with my accountant of course but my concern is that you know it could bump me into a higher tax brandt give him the envelope
well okay if youve already made out the check
brandt is handing him a letter sized envelope which is distended by something inside
we received it this morning
the dude frowning untucks its flap takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it
since you have failed to achieve even in the modest task that was your charge since you have stolen my money and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust
the wadding undone reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside
the dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package
i have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you jeffrey lebowski
and with brandt as my witness tell you this any further harm visited upon bunny shall be visited tenfold upon your head
between thumb and forefinger the dude holds up the contents of the package a little toe with emerald green nail polish
by god sir
i will not abide another toe
the dude and walter sit at the counter both staring off into space both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises
that wasnt her toe
whose toe was it walter
how the fuck should i know
i do know that nothing about it indicates the nail polish walter
as if its impossible to get some nail polish apply it to someone elses toe someone elses where the fuck are they gonna you want a toe
i can get you a toe believe me
there are ways dude
you dont wanna know about it believe me
but walter ill get you a toe by this afternoon with nail polish
these fucking amateurs
they send us a toe were supposed to shit our selves with fear
my point is theyre gonna kill her walter and then theyre gonna kill me well thats just thats the stress talking dude
so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes what about the toe
a waitress enters
could you please keep your voices down this is a family restaurant
oh please dear
ive got news for you the supreme court has roundly rejected prior restraint
walter this isnt a first amendment thing
sir if you dont calm down im going to have to ask you to leave
lady i got buddies who died face down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant
all right im leaving
im sorry maam
dont run away from this dude
goddamnit this affects all of us
the dude has left frame walter calls after him our basic freedoms
he looks defiantly around
finishing my coffee
he stirs the coffee bopping his head in time to the muzak affecting nonchalance
finishing my coffee
a dripping noise
the dude sits in the bathtub staring stuporously a joint pinched in one hand a washcloth draped over his head
we hear the phone ringing in the other roam
the dude is staring at his toes which protrude from the soapy water splayed against the far side of the tub
after the dudes outgoing message we hear mr
lebowski this is duty officer rolvaag of the l
the dude looks stuporously up his head swaying
weve recovered your vehicle
it can be claimed at the north hollywood auto circus there on victory
far fuckin out
youll just need to present a the message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds as of someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine
he looks blearily at the open doorway
a tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is striding across the living room towards the bathroom
this is a private residence man
the man has entered the bathroom and in stride swings the cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light
two other men are entering behind him
the room is dark now except for spill from the living room the men are backlit shapes
one of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor
the dude looks curiously at the small nattering animal
the man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it screaming into the bathtub
the dude screams
the marmot splashes frantically biting at the dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression
vee vant zat money lebowski
the dude screaming grabs the lip of the tub and starts to hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his head and squishes him
back into the water
you think veer kidding und making mit de funny stuff
vee could do things you only dreamed of lebowski
ja vee could really do it lebowski
vee belief in nossing
he scoops the marmot out of the water
it shakes itself off spraying the dude
vee belief in nossing lebowski
the marmot back on the floor is skittering around shaking itself and convulsing in little sneezes
tomorrow vee come back und cut off your chonson
the three men turn to leave
over their retreating backs just sink about zat lebowski
ja your viggly penis lebowski
ja und maybe vee stamp on it und skvush it lebowski
a policeman with a clipboard is leading the dude through a large parking lot
youre lucky she wasnt chopped mr
mustve been a joyride situation they abandoned the car once they hit the retaining wall
they have reached the dudes car
the drivers side exterior has been scraped raw
the policeman hands the dude a door handle and an exterior rear view mirror
these were on the road next to the car
youll have to get in on the other side
the dude climbs in the passenger side
my fucking briefcase
its not here
yeah sorry i saw that on the report
youre lucky they left the tape deck though
my fucking briefcase
jesus whats that smell
probably a vagrant slept in the car
or perhaps just used it as a toilet and moved on
the dude tries to roll down the drivers window but it will not go he bellows through the glass when will you find these guys
i mean do you have any promising leads
the policeman laughs agreeing broadly
ill just check with the boys down at the crime lab
theyve assigned four more detectives to the case got us working in shifts
the dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels his raucous laughter muffled by the glass
the dude walter and donny sit at the bar the dude with a white russian walter with a beer and donny eating beer nuts
and then theyre gonna stamp on it
oh for christ will you shut the fuck up donny
i figure my only hope is that the big lebowski kills me before the germans can cut my dick off
now that is ridiculous dude
no one is going to cut your dick off
not if i have anything to say about it
bitterly yeah thanks walter
that gives me a very secure feeling
dude that makes me feel all warm inside
now dude this whole fucking thing i could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug
walter sadly shakes his head
they were nazis dude
come on donny they were threatening castration
are you gonna split hairs
no am i wrong
well theyre nihilists
they kept saying they believe in nothing
walter looks haunted
say what you like about the tenets of national socialism dude at least its an ethos
and lets also not forget lets not forget dude that keeping wildlife an amphibious rodent for uh domestic you know within the city that isnt legal either
whatre you a fucking park ranger now
no im who gives a shit about the fucking marmot
were sympathizing here dude fuck your sympathy
i dont need your sympathy man i need my fucking johnson
what do you need that for dude
you gotta buck up man you cant go into the tournament with this negative attitude fuck the tournament
fuck you walter
there is a moment of stunned silence
fuck the tournament
i can see you dont want to be cheered up
cmon donny lets go get a lane
they leave the dude sitting morosely at the bar
as he stares another caucasian gary
friends like these huh gary
thats right dude
the pop song on the jukebox has ended someone puts on tumbling tumbleweeds
a man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that walter vacated
he is middle aged amiable craggily handsome sam elliot perhaps
he has a large western style mustache and wears denims a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat
dya have a good sarsaparilla
we recognize the voice of the stranger whose narration opened the movie
sioux city sarsaparilla
the stranger nods
thats a good one
waiting for his drink he looks amiably around the bar
his crinkled eyes settle on the dude
how ya doin there dude
the dude still staring down at his drink shakes his head
ahh not so good man
one a those days huh
wal a wiser fella than mself once said sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar wal he eats you
absently uh huh
that some kind of eastern thing
far from it
the bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of the stranger who touches his hat brim
he looks back at the dude
i like your style dude
well i like your style too man
got a whole cowboy thing goin
just one thing dude
dya have to use smany cuss words
the dude looks at the stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is
the fuck are you talking about
the stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar
okay have it your way
he brushes his hat brim with a fingertip
take it easy dude
he is gone
tumbling tumbleweeds is ending as we hear an offscreen voice breaking the spell dude
tony the unformed limo driver is at the door of the bar beckoning
she strides toward us naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut
paint flecks her skin
jeffrey you havent gone to the doctor
no its fine really uh do you have any news regarding my fathers money
money yeah i gotta respecfully you know tender my resignation on that matter cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all
she most certainly was not
hey man why dont you fucking listen occasionally

im telling you i got definitive evidence from who
the main guy dieter dieter hauff
well yeah i guess her co star in the beaver picture
you mean vagina
i mean you know him
dieter has been on the fringes of well of everything in l
for about twenty years
look at my lps
the dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf
that was his group they released one album in the mid seventies
the dude stops between two albums
a u t o
their music is a sort of ugh techno pop
the dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve
on it is the groups name autobahn the album name nagelbett and a picture back hair gazing upward in thin lipped epiphany
they are wearing severe but modishly retro suits
each has his name under his picture dieter kieffer and franz
a bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cyc
i miss vinyl
is he pretending to be the abductor
yeah look jeffrey you dont really kidnap someone that youre acquainted with
you cant get away with it if the hostage knows who you are
i know that
so dieter has the money
well no not exactly
its a complicated case maude
and a lotta strands to keep in my head man
lotta strands in old duders do you still have that doctors number
no really i dont even have the bruise any more i she is scribbling
i dont want to be responsible for any delayed after effects
delayed after eff i want you to see him immediately
she is picking up a telephone
ill see if hes available
hes a good man and thorough
his eyes are closed a headset on his shirt off
leaking tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of comin up around the bend
behind him cropped so that we see only a little of his torso a white smocked figure taps at the dudes back
after a moment the figure circles to one side out of frame
his hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the dudes ear and as he does so the music issues more strongly
could you slide your shorts down please mr
the dudes eyes open
no she she hit me right here
i understand sir
could you slide your shorts down please
the dude is driving home
a creedence tape plays
the dude is sucking down a joint
he glances at the rear view mirror and noticing something looks again
a volkswagon bug is following a lone fat man driving
his eyes still on the mirror he absently takes the joint between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it out the drivers window except that the window
is not open
the butt bounces off the glass and around the car showering sparks
the glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs
the dude screams
the car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to make way horns blaring
the car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll
the dude frantically grabs at his door which wont open and then slides over to push at the passenger door which also wont open
but he is sitting on the passenger side now away from the lit butt
he looks around for it
smoke is wisping up from between the drivers seat cushion and back cushion
he takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions
there is a hissing sound
but there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions
the dude pulls it out
it is lined spiral notebook paper slightly singed and dripping beer covered with handwriting
in the upper right hand corner is the name lawrence sellers and under that mrs
jamtoss th period
the theme is titled the louisiana purchase
in red ink is a large circled d and some handwritten marginal comments misspelled words are circled in red throughout
we are behind walter the dude and donny facing the stage in the background where allan the dudes balding landlord is performing a dance moderne
as walter talks to the dude he leans in to him his voice hushed so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience
he lives in north hollywood on radford near the in and out burger the in and out burger is on camrose
near the in and out burger those are good burgers walter
shut the fuck up donny

the dude and walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot
parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red corvette
fuck me man
that kids already spent all the money
hardly dude a new vette
the kids still got oh to thousand depending on the options
wait in the car donny
walter rings the bell
it is opened by a matronly spanish woman
my name is walter sobchak we spoke on the phone this is my associate jeffrey lebowski
may we uh we wanted to talk about little larry
may we come in
they enter a dim living room and stand looking about as pilar larry
dat mang is here
there is a rhythmic compressor sound walter places it and nudges the dude
at the other end of the living room a man lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless steel bubble
it is an iron lung artificially breathing with distinct hisses in and out
thats him dude
and a good day to you sir
see down please
thank you maam
he and the dude sit on a sagging green sofa
in a lowered voice to pilar does he uh
is he still writing
he has healt problems
i just want to say sir that were both enormous on a personal level branded especially the early episodes has been a source of uh inspir there are footsteps on
larry a fifteen year old looks at the two men
see down sweetie
these are the policeman no maam i didnt mean to give the impression that were police exactly
were hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police
he adopts his command voice in turning to larry but that is up to little larry here
isnt it larry
walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework which is now in a ziploc bag
he holds it out at arms length displaying it to larry
is this your homework larry
larry does not respond
is this your homework larry
look man did you dude please

walter is still holding out the homework

throughout walter has been staring at larry with the homework extended towards him
have you ever heard of vietnam

youre going to enter a world of pain son
we know that this is your homework
we know you stole a car and the fucking money
and the fucking money

youre gonna kill your father larry
ah this is pointless
as he shoves the homework back in the attache case all right plan b
you might want to watch out the front window there larry
he is heading for the door
the dude puzzled rises to follow him
this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass larry
walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman
without looking back at the dude who follows fucking language problem dude
he pops the dudes trunk flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron
maybe hell understand this
he is walking over to the corvette
he swings the crowbar into the windshield which shatters
he takes out the drivers window
lights are going on in houses down the street
distant dogs bark
a man in a sleeveless t shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar
he wrestles the crowbar away from the startled walter
walter cringes before the enraged mexican
the man looks about wildly
he runs over to the dudes car
thats not glass rains in on a terrified cringing donny
we are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway
wind whistles through the caved in windows
the dude drives his jaw clenched staring grimly out at the road
walter beside him and donny in the back seat munch on in and out burgers
creedence music plays above the bluster of wind
as the dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two by four into the floor just inside and parallel to the front door
i accept your apology
no i i just want to handle it myself from now on
that has nothing to do with it
yes it made it home im calling from home
no walter it didnt look like larry was about to crack
he finishes hammering rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby
well thats your perception
well youre right walter and the unspoken message is fuck you and leave me the fuck alone
yeah ill be at practice
he hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced against the two by four thus wedging the
door closed when the door is opened outwards
the chair clatters to the floor
woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in kicking the chair away
pin your diapers on lebowski
jackie treehorn wants to see you
and we know which lebowski you are lebowski
jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski
youre not dealing with morons here
out of the blackness something is falling toward us
it is a woman falling in slow motion her limbs flailing her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy
she is topless
she falls past the camera leaving blackness then after a beat reappears rising into the night sky
a crowd of mostly tanned middle aged men with blow dried hair wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire are blanket tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow
it is a party lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters
s mainstream jazz of the mancini brubeck school has been piped down to speakers on the beach
in long shot now the woman rises squealing disappears into darkness descends into light rises again
a man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light
he is handsome fiftyish wearing cotton twill pants and a turnbull asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck
behind him the woman rises and falls appears and disappears
hello dude thanks for coming
im jackie treehorn
the dude is looking around at the s modern decor
this is quite a pad you got here man
whats your drink dude
white russian thanks
hows the smut business jackie
i wouldnt know dude
i deal in publishing entertainment political advocacy and which one was logjammin
regrettably its true standards have fallen in adult entertainment
its video dude
now that were competing with the amateurs we cant afford to invest that little extra in story production value feeling
he taps his forehead with one finger
people forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone on you maybe
he hands him the drink
of course you do get the good with the bad
the new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software
wave of the future dude
well i still jerk off manually
of course you do
i can see youre anxious for me to get to the point
well dude here it is

but she hasnt run off shes been treehorn waves this off
ive heard the kidnapping story so save it

okay jackie done
i like the way you do business
your money is being held by a kid named larry sellers
he lives in north hollywood on radford near the in and out burger
a real fuckin brat but im sure your goonsll be able to get it off him mean hes only fifteen and hes flunking social studies
so if youll just write me a check for my ten per cent
of half a million
he is getting to his feet but sways woozily
ill go out and mingle
jesus you mix a hell of a caucasian jackie
the dude shakes his head tries to focus
a fifteen year old
is this your idea of a joke
jackie treehorns image starts to swim
he is joined on either side by woo and the blond man all three men looking grimly down at the dude
no funny stuff jackie
the kids got it
kid just wanted a car
all the dude ever wanted
was his rug back
he squints at jackie treehorn who swims in and out of focus
tied the room together
he tips forward spilling his drink off the table
looking up at the dude as his face hits the glass and squishes
darkness warshed over the dude darkern a black steers tookus on a moonless prairie night
there was no bottom
we hear a thundering bass
the title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls
the bending bass sound turns into the lead in to kenny rogers and the first editions just dropped in
the dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable repairman
the dudes face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley
in the center of the alley stands maude lebowski singing operatic harmony to the kenny rogers song
she wears an armored breastplate and norse headgear has braided pigtails and holds a trident
the dude stands behind her and pressed up against her helps her with her follow through as she releases a bowling ball
the lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini skirts their arms akimbo busby berkley style their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the
pins at the end
but it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs it is the dude himself levitating inches off the lane the tools from his utility belt swinging free
he is face down his arms torpedolike pressed against his sides
his point of view shows the lane rushing by below the little ball guide arrows zipping by
the dude twists his body around performing a barrel roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face up
now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines
the dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face down
he looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair
coming at us as we go through the last few pairs of legs are the approaching pins
we hit the pins scattering them and rush on into black
a body drops down into the blackness in slow motion a topless woman squealing her legs kicking
as she drops out of frame leaving blackness again three men are entering from the background emerging into a pool of light
it is the germans advancing ominously wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor
the dude now standing in a field of black reacts to the advancing germans
he turns and runs fists pumping
the scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of car bys
the field of black is punctured by headlights
the dude is running blearily down the middle of the pacific coast highway
cars rush by on either side horns blaring
with the bloo whup of a short siren blast a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up
the dude sits in the back seat his head lolling with the motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of branded he was innocent
not a charge was true
and they say he ran awaaaaaay
the dude is hurled against the chiefs desk which he bounces off of to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair
his wallet is tossed onto the desk
the chief leans forward takes the wallet and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity
this is your only i
he is looking at the ralphs shoppers club card
i know my rights
you dont know shit lebowski
i want a fucking lawyer man
i want bill kunstler
what are you some kind of sad assed refugee from the fucking sixties
treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party that you were drunk and abusive
that guy treats women like objects man
treehorn draws a lot of water in this town lebowski
you dont draw shit
we got a nice quiet beach community here and i aim to keep it nice and quiet
so let me make something plain
i dont like you sucking around bothering our citizens lebowski
i dont like your jerk off name i dont like your jerk off face i dont like your jerk off behavior and i dont like you jerk off do i
make myself clear
the dude stares
im sorry i wasnt listening
the chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the dude
it hits him in the forehead with a thud the scalding coffee splashing everywhere
the chief is already up off his chair rounding the desk
the chief slaps him twice
stay out of malibu lebowski
he kicks the chair out from under the dude and then starts kicking at him
stay out of malibu deadbeat
keep your ugly fucking goldbricking ass out of my beach community
the dude in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump is gingerly touching at sore spots on his face and scalp
peaceful easy feeling is on the radio
the back of the driver a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap
jesus man can you change the station
fuck you man
you dont like my fucking music get your own fucking cab
ive had a i pull over and kick your ass out man
had a rough night and i hate the fucking eagles man thats it
outta this fucking cab
the cab screeches over towards the curb
another car oncoming its radio blaring metallica speeds by
it is a red convertible
the driver singing loudly and badly along with the radio her hair blowing in the wind a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along higher than a kite
is bunny lebowski
on the accelerator her right foot in an open toed bright red high heeled shoe has five painted toes
when she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch
five more toes
the dude staggers in the open front door one hand pressed to a lump on his forehead and looks around
the place is a wreck
furniture has been overturned upholstery slashed drawers dumped
the door to the bedroom starts to creak open
the dude cringes
maude emerges from the bedroom
she is wearing a bathrobe
she pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches
the dude is stupefied
thats my robe
after a beat a long sigh and then a voice from the blackness tell me a little about yourself jeffrey
not much to tell
a match is dragged across a headboard the dude is lighting himself a joint
he shakes the match out to restore blackness except for the glowing tip of the joint
i was uh one of the authors of the port huron statement
the original port huron statement
not the compromised second draft
and then i uh
ever hear of the seattle seven
click the dude turns on a bedside lamp
he and maude lie next to each other in bed
lets see i uh music business briefly
roadie for metallica
speed of sound tour
bunch of assholes
and then you know little of this little of that
my careers uh slowed down a bit lately
what do you do for fun
oh you know the usual
the occasional acid flashback
he climbs out of bed but maude remains in it
she wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap
she pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised
what happened to your house
jackie treehorn trashed the place
wanted to save the finders fee
he thought i had your fathers money so he got me out of the way while he looked for it
its not my fathers money its the foundations
why did he think you had it
and who does
larry sellers a high school kid

hence the slut
well so did he is that yoga
throughout maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in
it increases the chances of conception
the dude spits some white russian
well yes what did you think this was all about
fun and games

yeah okay but see the dude look jeffrey i dont want a partner
in fact i dont want the father to be someone i have to see socially or wholl have any interest in rearing the child himself
something occurs to him
what happened to your face

the dude is staring off into space thinking
his answer is absent
no the uh police chief of malibu
a real reactionary
so your father
oh man i get it
the dude is leaving the bedroom
yeah my thinking about the case man it had become uptight
your father the dude finishes punching a number into the phone

he emerges on his front stoop pulling on a shirt
his attention is caught by something down the street
a car is parked halfway down the block
we can see the shape of a fat man in the drivers seat
striding purposefully down the street
the fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the cars ignition coughing but the engine will not turn over
more whines and coughs no start
the man hurriedly fumbles in front of him
he brings up a newspaper which he holds before his face
as he gets to the car
he reaches through the open drivers window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground
he is revved with nervous energy
get out of that fucking car man
the man nervously complies
the dude flinches at the mans movement as he gets out
the man cringes reacting to the dudes flinch
he is wearing a cheap blue serge suit
he is bald with a short fringe and a mustache
the dude shouts to cover his fear who the fuck are you man
come on man
no physical harm intended
who the fuck are you
whyve you been following me

the dude is stunned

bunny lebowski man
her real name is fawn gunderson

he is fumbling in his wallet
the dude looks at the picture
it is probably a school portrait unmistakably bunny but fresh faced much younger looking with a corn fed smile and straight partridge family hair and bangs
jesus fucking christ
ran away a year ago
he is holding out another picture
the gundersons told me to show her this when i found her
the family farm
a bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow swept landscape
outside of moorhead minnesota
they think itll make her homesick
how ya gonna keep em down on the farm once they seen karl hungus
he hands back the picture

or maybe not but shes definitely not around
yeah it sucks
well maybe you and me could pool our resources trade information professional courtesy compeers you know we hear distant yapping growing louder with the hum of an approaching car
yeah i get it
fuck off da fino
and stay away from my special la from my fucking lady friend
the dude steps out to meet walters car as it pulls up its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping
four people sit at a booth dieter kieffer franz all in black leather and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed
sleeveless tee shirt worn thin with age
she is apparently braless and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms
notable is her camera side leg which ends in a bandage swaddled foot
dried rust colored blood stains the tip of the bandage
the four are arguing loudly in german
they seem very unhappy
a waitress enters with a checkpad and pen
you folks ready
the german shouting stops
dieter looks sourly up
i haff lingenberry pancakes
sree picks in blanket
the woman speaks to dieter in german
walters eyes are on the road as he listens driving to the dude whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat
i mean we totally fucked it up man
we fucked up his pay off
and got the kidnappers all pissed off and the big lebowski yelled at me a lot but he didnt do anything
well its sometimes the cathartic uh
im saying if he knows im a fuck up then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife
because he fucking doesnt want her back man
hes had enough
he no longer digs her
its all a show
but then why didnt he give a shit about his million bucks
i mean he knew we didnt hand off his briefcase but he never asked for it back
whats your point dude
his million bucks was never in it man
there was no money in that briefcase
he was hoping theyd kill her
you throw out a ringer for a ringer
okay but how does all this add up to an emergency
im saying i see what youre getting at dude he kept the money but my point is here we are its shabbas the sabbath which im allowed to break only
if its a matter of life and death walter come off it

taking care of her fucking dog
going to her fucking synagogue
youre living in the fucking past
three thousand years of beautiful tradition from moses to sandy koufax past
what the hell happened
he is looking off as the car slows
the dude looks where walter is looking
walters car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the dude get out
both are gaping off at the front lawn
tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a palm trunk
through the french doors at its far end we can see bunny naked briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing into the illuminated pool outside
heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool
brandt approaching stoops and straightens stoops and straightens picking up the discarded clothes that run the length of the hall
he cant see you dude
we pull the dude and walter as they approach the doors to the great study
walters dog follows stiffly waving its tail
whered she been
visiting friends of hers in palm springs
just picked up and left never bothered to tell us
but i guess she told dieter
he never even kidnapped her
whos this gentleman dude
im a fucking veteran
you shouldnt go in there dude
hes very angry
bang the dude and walter push through the double doors into the big lebowski turns at the sound of the door
his wheelchair hums as he spins it around
bitterly well shes back
no thanks to you
wheres the money lebowski
the dog yaps
who the hell is he
ill tell you who i am
im the guy whos gonna kick your phony we know the briefcase was empty man
we know you kept the million bucks yourself
well you have your story i have mine
i say i entrusted the money to you and you stole it
you thought bunnyd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear
all you needed was a sap to pin it on and youd just met me
you thought hey a deadbeat a loser someone the square community wont give a shit about
all right get out
both of you
look at that fucking phony dude
pretending to be a fucking millionaire

ive seen a lot of spinals dude and this guy is a fake
a fucking goldbricker
he is crossing to lebowski
this guy fucking walks
ive never been more certain of anything in my life
stay away from me mister
walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits
walk you fucking phony
the big lebowski waggles helplessly his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a raggedy anns
the pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps
put me down you son of a bitch
its all over man
we call your fucking bluff
sure ill put him down dude
he shoves the big lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor weeping
sobbing youre bullies
cowards both of you
walter is abashed
the big lebowski flails about on the floor
he cant walk walter
yeah i can see that dude
help me put him back in his chair
walter moves to comply
shit sorry man
stay away from me
you and these women
you wont leave a man his fucking balls
walter you fuck
shit dude i didnt know
i wouldntve done it if i knew he was a fucking crybaby
were sorry man
were really sorry
the dude has picked up the big lebowskis plaid lap warmer and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and batting the dog away
there ya go
walter puzzled hands on hips stands over the big lebowski
he didnt look like a spinal
scattered at the cut
each with a beer at the scoring table
sure youll see some tank battles
but fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle
i mean nam was a foot soldiers war whereas uh this thing should be a fucking cakewalk
i mean i had an m jacko not an abrams fucking tank
just me and charlie man eyeball to eyeball
thats fuckin combat
the man in the black pyjamas dude
worthy fuckin adversary
whos in pyjamas walter
shut the fuck up donny
not a bunch of fig eaters with towels on their heads tryin to find reverse on a soviet tank
this is not a worthy the dude and walter look
quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane and is restrained by obrien
whats this day of rest shit man
walter looks at him innocently
what is this bullshit man
i dont fucking care
it dont matter to jesus
but youre not fooling me
you might fool the fucks in the league office but you dont fool jesus
its bush league psych out stuff
i wouldve fucked you in the ass saturday ill fuck you in the ass next wednesday instead
he makes hip grinding coital motions as obrien leads him away
you got a date wednesday man
walter his head cocked and the dude peeking over his shades watch him go
donny walter and the dude emerge from the alley each holding his leatherette ball satchel
a tree of life dude
to all who cling to it
they react to the droning synthesizer based technopop coming from a boom box
dieter kieffer and franz in shiny black leather stand in a line facing them in the all but deserted lot
behind them orange flames lick gently at the dudes car which has been put to the torch
the orange flames glow on the mens creaking leather
next to the car are three motorcycles parked in a neat row
the dude looks sadly at the burning car
they finally did it
they killed my fucking car
vee vant zat money lebowski
ja uzzervize vee kill ze girl
ja it seems you forgot our little deal lebowski
you dont have the fucking girl dipshits
we know you never did
so youve got nothin on my johnson
the men in black stunned confer amongst themselves in german
under his breath are these the nazis walter
walter answers also sotto voce his eyes still on the three men theyre nihilists donny nothing to be afraid of
the germans stop conferring
vee dont care
vee still vant zat money or vee fuck you up
ja vee still vant ze money
vee sreaten you
he pulls an uzi from under his coat
it glints in the firelight
fuck the three of you
hey cool it walter
walter ignores the dude addresses the germans theres no ransom if you dont have a fucking hostage
thats what ransom is
those are the fucking rules
zere are no roolz
his girlfriend gafe up her toe
she sought wed be getting million dollars
iss not fair
whos the fucking nihilist hey cool it walter
listen pal there never was any money

the germans confer again in german
donny is visibly frightened

they wont hurt us donny
these men are cowards
vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen
the dude is digging into his pocket
come on walter were ending this thing cheap
walters eyes burning with hatred are locked on dieters
whats mine is mine
come on walter
louder to the germans as he looks in his wallet four dollars here
he inspects the change in his palm
tremulously i got eighteen dollars dude
grimly whats mine is mine
with a ring of steel dieter produces a glinting saber
coolly come and get it
come and get it
show me what you got
dipshit with a nine toed woman
in a rage dieter charges
hurls his leather satchel
watching dieters charge is caught off guard
the bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet
he falls back his uzi clattering away
twists away as dieter reaches him grabs dieters head in both hands draws dieters head up to his mouth which closes on dieters ear
he rushes franz but draws up short as franz sends out karate kicks his leather pants squeaking and popping
franz gives a loud cry with each kick the dude leans back throwing his arms up evading the kicks
his jaw is still clamped on dieters ear
dieter draws his saber against walters side drawing blood
walter doesnt react to the wound
growling as dieter screams he worries his ear waggling his head with his jaws clamped
dieter drops it
awkwardly circling evading franzs kicks
still worrying the ear
with a tearing sound his head and dieters separate
walter spits his ear into his face
the dude and franz both now panting heavily have yet to establish body contact
franz continues to kick
draws back his fist
a powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops dieter for the count
with a piercing shriek franz finally summons the nerve to charge the dude hands raised to deliver karate blows
as he reaches the dude whhap the boom box swings into frame to smash him in the face
its volume shoots up
walter bashes him a few more times over the head
the music screeches to static then quiet
laid out now franz too is quiet
walter panting looks around
weve got a man down dude
with a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to donny who lies gasping on the ground
the dude also panting rises and trots over
they shot him walter
they shot donny
donny gasps for air
his eyes wide go from the dude to walter
one hand still clutches his eighteen dollars
there werent any shots
its a heart attack
call the medics dude
donny hurry dude
id go but im pumping blood
might pass out
the dude runs into the lanes
walter lays a reassuring hand on donnys shoulder
rest easy good buddy youre doing fine
we got help choppering in
they sit side by side forearms on knees in a nondescript waiting area
walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other
a tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters
he eyes the dudes bowling attire and sunglasses and walters army surplus but doesnt make an issue of it
you are the bereaved
pleased to meet you
the dude actually
is what uh
i understand youre taking away the remains
we have the urn
he nods through a door
another man in a black suit enters to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop
and i assume this is credit card
he is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk to whomever wants to take it
he takes it opens it puts on reading glasses that sit halfway down his nose and inspects the bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration
the dude smiles at donnelly
donnelly gives back a morticians smile
at length walter holds the bill towards donnelly pointing
that is for the urn
dont need it
were scattering the ashes
yes so we were informed
however we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle
this is a hundred and eighty dollars
it is our most modestly priced receptacle
well can we a hundred and eighty dollars
they range up to three thousand
yeah but were can we just rent it from you
sir this is a mortuary not a rental house
were scattering the fucking ashes
walter sir please lower your voice hey man dont you have something else you could put it in
that is our most modestly priced receptacle
it is a high wind swept bluff
walter and the dude walk towards the lip of the bluff
parked in the background is one lonely car walters
walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic lid
when they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly for a beat
finally ill say a few words
the dude clasps his hands in front of him
walter clears his throat
donny was a good bowler and a good man
he was one of us
he was a man who loved the outdoors and bowling and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern california from redondo to calabassos
and he was an avid bowler
and a good friend
he died he died as so many of his generation before his time
in your wisdom you took him lord
as you took so many bright flowering young men at khe san and lan doc and hill
these young men gave their lives
and donny too
who loved bowling
walter clears his throat
and so theodore donald karabotsos in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of
walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can
the pacific ocean which you loved so well
goodnight sweet prince
the wind has blown all of the ashes into the dude standing just to the side of and behind walter
the dude stands frozen
finished eulogizing walter looks back
shit im sorry dude
he starts brushing off the dude with his hands
heretofore motionless the dude finally explodes slapping walters hands away
you fucking asshole
dude im sorry
the dude is near tears
you make everything a fucking travesty
dude im it was an accident
the dude gives walter a furious shove
what about that shit about vietnam
dude im sorry what the fuck does vietnam have to do with anything
what the fuck were you talking about
walter for the first time is genuinely distressed almost lost
shit dude im sorry youre a fuck walter
he gives walter a weaker shove
walter seems dazed then wraps his arms around the dude
awww fuck it dude
lets go bowling
we watch each of them glide across the floor release follow through gracefully
we have never seen them bowl before
they are quite good
each wears a black armband on his bowling shirt
the dude walks up to the bar
two oat sodas gary
good luck tomorrow
sorry to hear about donny
well you know sometimes you eat the bear and uh
tumbling tumbleweeds has come up on the jukebox and the stranger ambles up to the bar
howdy do dude
oh hey man how are ya

the strangers eyes crinkle merrily

the bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter
take care man i gotta get back

gazing after him the stranger drawls savoring the words the dude abides
he gives his head a shake of appreciation then looks into the camera
i dont know about you but i take comfort in that

he brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull back
catch ya further on down the trail
as we pull away the stranger swivels in to the bar
as his voice fades say friend ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla
