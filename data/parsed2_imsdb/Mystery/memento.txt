b if window
href b b memento shooting script a polaroid photograph clasped between finger and thumb a crude crime scene flash picture of a mans body lying on a decaying wooden floor
a bloody mess where his head should be
the image in the photo starts to fade as we super titles
the hand holding the photo suddenly fans it in a rapid flapping motion then holds it still
the image fades more and again the picture is fanned
as titles end the image fades to nothing
the hand holding the photo flaps it again then places it at the front of a the camera sucks the blank picture up then the flash bursts
the polaroid camera is lowered revealing the sweaty heavy breathing face of leonard mid s
there are droplets of blood across his face
leonard stares satisfied at something on the ground in front of him
there is wet blood on his blue shirt and beige suit
his hand opens and catches a handgun which leaps up into his grasp
still staring he crouches down and pulls a body off the floor by the wet hair of its bloody head
he slowly inserts the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth should be
a deafening roar as wet red leaps off his face and suit and head with a spasm reassembles itself into the face of teddy s moustache and we close on
he rolls them to one side then turns his head
so where are you
leonard lifts his head
he is lying on a queen sized bed
leonard contd youre in some motel room
a late model jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and approaches a large clearly abandoned derelict building
leonard is driving
he wears a beige suit and blue shirt no blood
next to him is teddy
leonard stops the car next to a pickup truck sitting outside the derelict building
leonard kills the engine staring at the pickup
looks like somebodys home
teddy looks from leonard to the pickup and back
that things been here for years
leonard gets out of the jaguar and moves to the pickup
he inspects it with a methodical practiced eye
i think youre wrong
these tracks arent more than a few days old
leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the interior
on the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds six bullets
leonard picks two of them up and studies them
he drops them onto the dashboard then shuts the door
leonard contd lets take a look inside
leonard walks towards the house patting his jacket pockets
teddy leans on the pickup uneasy watching leonard
leonard stands in the dimly lit decaying former hallway
he pulls a stack of polaroid photographs out of his pocket and leafs through them as teddy starts walking towards him
leonard finds a photo showing teddy with a shit eating grin standing in front of the pickup truck
on the broad white strip beneath the photo is handwritten leonard flips the photo over
on the white strip on the back in the same small handwriting
memento pink revisions
ive finally found him
how long have i been looking
leonard stuffs the polaroids back into his pocket reaches around to the back of his waistband and draws a handgun keeping it out of teddys line of sight
teddy enters wary
didnt think so lets go yeah
leonard neither replies nor turns around
teddy worried affects a casual air shrugging dismissively teddy contd fuck this
teddy turns and heads for the door
leonard leaps on him pistol whipping him furiously as he shouts teddy is down
leonard drags him back deeper into the dark house
leonard is in a frenzy
he dumps teddy at the end of the hall and stands over him
teddy spits blood
you dont have a clue you freak
leonard crouches down and grabs teddy by the lapels
beg my forgiveness
beg my wifes forgiveness before i blow your brains out
leonard you dont have a clue whats going on

teddy gestures towards the basement door in pain but enjoying leonards growing anxiety
teddy contd intimate cmon lenny well take a look down there together
then youll know
youll know what you really are
leonard glances fearfully at the door then looks at teddy
he thrusts the barrel of his gun into teddys mouth and we are at the shot from the end of the opening sequence
teddy panics shaking his head trying to talk around the metal but gags just as leonard pulls the trigger
a shot rings out as we leonard lies on the queen sized bed
he lifts his head
so youre in some motel room
he gets up surveys the room as if for the first time
he wears boxers and a plaid work shirt
leonard contd you dont know how long youve been there or how you got there
there is a room key on the dresser
the plastic tag identifies it as the key to room
leonard opens drawers in the room
leonard contd just some anonymous motel room
wont tell you anything
nothing in the drawers but you look anyway
he reaches for the bedside table drawer
leonard contd nothing except the gideon bible
he opens the drawer to find a gideon bible
of fingers rifling bills in a wallet
leonard counts out some money and hands it to the fat sweaty middle aged man behind the counter
burt takes the money spotting something over leonards shoulder
that guys here already
burt taps the polaroid photograph of teddy which is sitting on the counter
leonard picks up the photo and turns to see teddy approaching the glass door of the office
leonard watches carefully as teddy shambles up to the office door
a bell chiiies as teddy enters and breaks into his shit eating grin
leonard slips the photo into his pocket
leonard nods in apparent recognition wary
like i told you before
teddy pretends to think hard
i musta forgot
smiles i guess ive told you about my condition
teddy grins and holds the door open for leonard
only every time i see ya
memento pink revision
teddy starts for a grey sedan
leonard pauses behind him
teddy glances back in surprise
this is your car
shakes head youre in a playful mood
leonard holds up a polaroid of a late model jaguar
leonard contd shouldnt make fun of somebodys handicap
teddy smiles and heads for the brand new jaguar parked several cars further down
just trying to have a little fun
leonard drives teddy admires the new car s interior reaching down around the seats exploring the car with his hands
roll your window up will ya
leonard hits his window button
a few fragments of safety glass rise out of the door remnants of a broken window
teddy looks curious
i can get that fixed for you
teddy contd so where are we going sherlock
memento pink revisions leonard fishes a note out of his pocket
memento pink revisions
i got a lead on a place
leonard checks the note then hands it to teddy
surprised at the note what the hell you want to go there for

smiling i dont remember
the jaguar crosses the railroad tracks and approaches the derelict building
leonard stops the car next to the pickup truck and kills the engine staring at the pickup
looks like somebodys home
leonard wearing boxers and plaid work shirt takes the gideon bible out off the open bedside table drawer
nothing except the gideon bible
he leafs through a couple off pages then drops the bible back into the drawer and shuts it
he notices a message written on the back off his hand leonard contd sammy jankis had the same problem
he tried writing himself notes
lots of notes
but hed get confused
leonard licks his thumb and rubs at the writing
to leonards surprise it does not even smudge
he notices his bare legs
there is a note taped to his right thigh with a handwritten message memento pink revisions
leonard pulls the note off studying it carefully
close on the polaroid of teddy
leonard flips it over
on the back are the messages leonard writes another message beneath these two he sticks the photo of teddy between his teeth as he holds his handgun up and checks
that it is loaded
he sticks the gun in the back of his waistband the photo in his jacket pocket slings the polaroid camera over his shoulder

he notices that burt is staring at him as if he were an exotic insect
leonard contd ive told you this before havent i

you dont remember me at all and we talked a bunch of times
burt contd whats the last thing you remember

leonard raises his eyebrows in enquiry
burt contd well like

burt contd that guys here already

leonard in boxer shorts and plaid work shirt rips the note from his thigh
the note says shave
leonard enters sees a white paper bag on the counter by the sink
on the bag is a handwritten message leonard looks into the bag then pulls out a can of shaving foam and a pack of disposable razors
he runs the hot water steps back and lifts his foot onto the sink
he is awkward and uncomfortable
he notices an ice bucket by the sink
leonard sits on the bed applying shaving foam to his thigh
the ice bucket sits on the bedside table steaming
leonard starts awkwardly shaving his right thigh
the phone rings and leonard flinches nicking his leg
he looks at the phone then reaches for the receiver
leonard in beige suit and blue shirt flushes the urinal then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands
he notices a message written on the back of his hand
he stares at the message for a second thoughtful then tries to scrub the writing off his skin
to his surprise it is indelible
leonard looks at it quizzical then notices some markings on his wrist pulling his sleeve back to get a better look
he can read the start of a message leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the restroom door opens and a man enters
leonard dries his hands then exits the rest room
nto the waiting area of a crowded restaurant
he glances around lost then pulls out his polaroids flipping through them
someone taps him on his shoulder and he turns to see the smiling face of a waiter
you left these at your table
leonard looks down
the waiter hands him a brown envelope and a motel room key discount inn room
on the envelope is a handwritten message leonard looks at his polaroid photograph of the outside of the discount inn motel
there is an address written beneath it lincoln street
the waiter glances at his polaroid

memento pink revisions
leonard drives consulting his polaroid photos
leonard brown envelope in hand finds the door to room
leonard enters looks around as if for the first time
an anonymous motel room except that tacked to one wall is a hand drawn chart showing the layout of some streets and stuck to the edges of the chart are
polaroid photographs with arrows drawn from each photograph to a spot on the map
leonard inspects the photos
some are buildings some are people
all have the handwritten notes on the broad white strip underneath the image
leonard gets polaroids out of his pocket
the first one is of the discount inn
he sticks it onto an already squashed lump of blue tack at the end of an arrow drawn from a location on the outskirts of town
the second photo is a blurred shot of a brunette turning in a doorway
the name natalie is written under the picture
leonard flips it over
on the back are two handwritten messages
the first one has been completely scribbled over but the other one reads leonard nods then sticks the photo to the chart
he steps back looking over the polaroids one by one natalie burt discount inn teddy
leonard sits at the desk and opens the brown envelope
he takes out a photocopy of a car registration and a drivers license
both are in the name of john edward gammell but when leonard looks at the picture on the license he recognizes the face
leonard moves back to his wall chart finds the polaroid of teddy and compares it to the license photo
this guy told me his name was teddy
he turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the back
it says only memento blue revisions
he goes to the phone and dials the number on the polaroid
a couple of rings then its answered
lenny is that you
lenny its teddy
look stay there okay
im gonna be right over

leonard hangs up thinking
he looks at the writing on the back of his hand then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words leonard removes his jacket then starts pulling off his shirt
he has writing tattooed all over his chest stomach and arms
messages in different styles of writing some crude some elaborate
the messages run in all directions some upside down some backwards
leonard examines his tattoos methodically
from leonards pov the most striking is an upside down tattoo on his belly which says on one forearm it says on the other forearm memento pink revisions
leonard pulls down his trousers
on his right thigh crudely lettered and immediately below this in elegant neat lettering leonard takes out the registration document and examines it
holding the photo of teddy and the registration document leonard checks off his tattooed facts leonard contd under his breath white

he looks do at the tattoos all over his chest stomach leonard contd so i cant remember talking to you
what did we talk about
nods sammy jankis
yeah i guess i tell people about sammy to help them understand
sammys story helps me understand my own situation
leonard touches the tattoo on the back of his hand
leonard contd sammy jankis wrote himself endless notes
but hed get mixed up
ive got a more graceful solution to the memory problem
im disciplined and organized
i use habit and routine to make my life possible
sammy had no drive
no reason to make it work
leonard can see his reflection in the mirror
he studies the tattoo across his chest leonard contd me
i gotta reason
memento pink revisions
leonard parks the jaguar gets out stops outside the door to a restaurant checking its name against a note written on a small paper bag from a pharmacy
the note says he sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his polaroid photographs
he flips through them until he finds natalies
leonard flips the picture over
on the back are two handwritten messages
the first one has been completely scribbled over the second reads leonard enters walking slowly down the aisle looking at all the customers
he makes eye contact with a woman brunette s sitting alone wearing sunglasses
her face betrays nothing
leonard walks past
she sighs and grabs the back of his jacket as he passes
leonard spins around
leonard slips into the seat opposite her
natalie is pretty but has bruising around one eye and a mark on her lip
you dont remember me
friendly smile sorry i should have explained
you see i have this condition you did explain lenny
leonard shifts uncomfortably
please call me leonard
my wife called me lenny

leonard raises his eyebrows then smiles
memento pink revisions
then i probably told you how much i hated it
could you take off your sunglasses
its just hard for me natalie takes them off to reveal her bruises
so you have information for me
is that what your little note says
must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper
mix up your laundry list and your grocery list youll be eating your underwear
natalie contd but i guess thats why you got those freaky tattoos
leonard is surprised
it is tough
im sorry i cant remember you
its not personal
natalies smile fades
she takes a brown envelope out of her handbag
natalie contd i do have information for you
you gave me a license plate number
i had my friend at the dmv trace it
guess what name came up
memento pink revisions natalie contd john edward gamme
memento pink revisions
you know him
but the photo on his license looked familiar
i think hes been in the bar before natalie slides the envelope towards him but stops short
natalie contd this is a copy of his registration license photo and all
are you sure you want this
have i told you what this man did
then you shouldnt have to ask
but even if you get your revenge you wont remember it
you wont even know its happened
annoyed so ill take a picture get a tattoo
calms the world doesnt disappear when you close your eyes does it
my actions still have meaning even if i cant remember them
my wife deserves vengeance and it doesnt make any difference whether i know about it
tell me about her again
because you like to remember her
i want to see you enjoy yourself
she was beautiful
perfect to me memento pink revisions
dont just recite the words
close your eyes remember her
leonard smiles and shuts his eyes
random images of a woman s black hair plain
jump cuts of details a smile eating tucking her hair behind her ear pulling on a pair of trousers watching tv shouting in anger
sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear she turns as leonard pinches her thigh
you can only feel details
bits and pieces which you didnt bother to put into words
and extreme moments you feel even if you dont want to
put it together and you get the feel of the person enough to know how much you miss them and how much you hate the person who took them away
leonard opens his eyes
natalie is looking at him
she nods and hands him the brown envelope
i wrote an address in there too
might be useful
its this abandoned place outside of town
i guy i know used to use it for his bigger deals
what do i owe you
i wasnt helping you for money
its not your fault
see you have this condition
natalie reaches into her purse and pulls out a motel room key
natalie contd are you still at the discount inn
you left this at my place
leonard pulls out a polaroid of the discount inn
the discount inn yeah
natalie leaves the key and gets up from the table
they treating you alright
smiling dont remember
you know what we have in common
natalie contd were both survivors
take care leonard
leonard watches natalie leave
he sits at the table looking down at the brown envelope and the motel room key room
leonard rises and heads to the restroom
leonard flushes the urinal then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands
he notices a message written on the back of his hand he stares at the message for a second thoughtful then tries to scrub the writing off his skin
to his surprise it is indelible
leonard looks at it quizzical then notices some markings on his wrists pulling his sleeve back to get a better look
he can read the start of a message memento blue revisions
leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the restroom door opens and a man enters
leonard dries his hands then exits the rest room
leonard in boxers bandaged arm talks on the phone
he resumes shaving his thigh
i met sammy through work
i was an investigator
id investigate claims to see which ones were phony
leonard dips the razor into the steaming ice bucket
leonard contd i had to see through peoples bullshit
it was useful experience because now its my life
when i meet someone i dont even know if ive met them before
i have to look in their eyes and just figure them out
my job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk
montage leonard wearing a cheap dark suit and tie sitting opposite various different people in an interview situation
throw in the occasional why
but just listen
and watch the eyes the body language
leonard watches the peoples movements carefully
we see close ups off fiddling hands neck scratching etc
contd its complicated
you might catch a sign but attach the wrong meaning to it
if someone touches their nose while theyre talking experts will tell you it means theyre lying
it really means theyre nervous and people get nervous for all sorts of reasons
its all about context
memento pink revisions
leonard contd i was good
sammy was my first real challenge
the jaguar pulls up
leonard gets out and heads to the office
burt is behind the counter reading a magazine
im sorry i think im checked in here but ive misplaced my key
looks up hi leonard
burt puts his magazine down and gets up sighing
burt contd probably in the room
burt swinging a pass key on a chain leads leonard along the ground floor to room then unlocks it
leonard enters and scans the room
burt picks his nails in the doorway
leonard moves to the unmade bed
there is a pile of bloodstained tissues
on the bedside table is an ice bucket
next to it is a disposable razor and a can of shaving i dont see my key
burt looks up
he realizes something
burt tries to shepherd leonard out of the room
memento blue revisions
this isnt your room
i fucked up
this isnt my room
no lets go
then why is this my handwriting
leonard picks a white paper bag up off the floor
handwritten on the side is a message leonard contd better tell me what the fucks going on
burt looks uncomfortable
this was your room
youre up in now
when was i in here
then i rented you another one on top of this
business is slow
i told my boss about you about your condition
he told me to try and rent you another room
why didnt you clean it out
shrugs youre still paying for it
its still your room
leonard shakes his head smiling
memento blue revisions
so how many rooms am i checked into in this dump
leonard walks out past burt
well at least youre being honest about cheating me
yeah well youre not gonna remember anyway
you dont have to be that honest burt
burt contd always get a receipt
im gonna write that down
leonard fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket
there is a message on it which he reads
it says leonard looks up at burt
leonard contd what time is it
the jaguar speeds along
leonard checks the restaurant name against the note
he gets out his polaroids flipping through them until he finds the one of natalie
memento blue revisions
leonard walks through the restaurant checking the patrons
he makes eye contact with natalie but walks past her table
she sighs and grabs the back of his jacket
leonard in boxers bandaged arm shaves his thigh talking on the phone
id just become an investigator when i came across sammy
mr samuel r
jankis strangest case ever
guys semi retired accountant
he and his wife had been in this car accident
nothing too serious but hes acting funny he cant get a handle on whats going on
a doctor examines sammys head
sammys wife looks on
the doctors find some possible damaqe to the hippocampus nothing conclusive
but sammy cant remember anything for more than a couple minutes
he cant work cant do shit medical bills pile up his wife calls the insurance company and i get sent in
sammy sits smoking smiling at leonard cheap suit and tie
my first big claims investigation i really check into it
sammy can think just fine but he cant make any new memories he can only remember things for a few minutes
sammy watches a commercial on t
memento pink revisions
hed watch t
but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing he couldnt remember how it began
he liked commercials
they were short
sammy rolls a small glass bottle between the palms of his hands
jankis rolls up her sleeve
leonard watches as sammy takes a syringe and pushes the needle through the rubber of the bottle
the label is marked insulin
contd the crazy part was that this guy who couldnt follow the plot of green acres could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before
sammy inverts the bottle and syringe draws the insulin into the syringe withdraws the needle holds it up to check for bubbles tapping it delicately
and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing
sammy wipes a spot on mrs
jankis arm with a swab then gently pinches the skin and confidently inserts the needle
mrs jankis winces
sammy looks up worried
mrs jankis smiles at him
sammy pushes the plunger withdraws the needle and presses the swab against the skin lookinq into mrs jankis eyes and smiling back
jankis opens the front door to leonard
leonard shakes hands with sammy who smiles at him in apparent recognition
the doctors assure me that theres a real condition called korsokoffs syndrome short term memory loss rare but legit
but every time i see him i catch a look of recognition
just a slight look but he says he cant remember me at all
memento pink revisions leonard contd i can read people and im thinking bad actor
now im suspicious and i order more tests
memento pink revisions
leonard dabs at some blood on his thigh with toilet paper
his wife has to do everything
sammy can only do simple stuff
he couldnt pick up any new skills at all and thats how i got him
leonards jaguar pulls up at a red light
suddenly teddy is banging on the window
i thought youd gone for good
what brings you back
leonard looks at teddy sizing him up
what made you think i wasnt coming back
you said you were leaving town
so i see
its good to see you
my names teddy
guess ive told you about my condition
grins only every time i see ya
come on ill buy you lunch
teddy pours ketchup all over his steak
leonard plays with his food
shrugs its my condition
i never know if ive already eaten so i always just eat small amounts
you dont have to remember to be hungry
its weird but if you dont eat for a while then your body stops being hungry
you get sort of shaky but you dont realize you havent eaten
have i told you about sammy jankis
i heard enough about him
tell me about john g
you still think hes here right
the guy youre looking for johnny g
thats why you havent left
am i right
teddy licks his fingers and frowns
teddy contd leonard you need to be very careful
well the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up
get you to kill the wrong guy
yeah well i go on facts not recommendations okay
lenny you cant trust a mans life to your little notes and pictures
because youre relying on them alone
you dont remember what youve discovered or how
your notes might be unreliable
leonard contd no really
memorys not perfect
its not even that good
ask the police eyewitness testimony is unreliable
the cops dont catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff
they collect facts make notes draw conclusions
facts not memories thats how you investigate
i know its what i used to do
memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car
its an interpretation not a record
memories can be changed or distorted and theyre irrelevant if you have the facts
you really want to find this guy
he took away the woman i love and he took away my memory
he destroyed everything my life and my ability to live
just for revenge
thats what keeps me going
its all i have
teddy considers this
well find him
where are you staying
leonard reaches into his pocket and takes out a polaroid
dont know what room havent got my key
probably left it in your room
memento blue revisions
the jaguar pulls up
leonard gets out and heads to the office
burt is behind the counter reading a magazine
im sorry i think im checked in here but ive misplaced my key
looks up hi leonard
leonard in boxers bandaged arm shaving foam on thigh strides the row talking on the phone and gesticulating with a disposable razor
so sammy cant learn any new skills
but i find something in my research conditioning
sammy should still be able to learn through repetition
its how you learn stuff like riding a bike things you dont think about you just get better through practice
call it muscle memory whatever but its a completely different part of the brain from the short term memory
so i have the doctors test sammys response to conditioning
sammy sits at a table
a doctor sits opposite pointing out various metal objects sitting on the table
just pick up any three objects
amused thats a test
where were you guys when i did my cpa
memento pink revisions
sammy picks up an object and gestures to the doctor for applause
sammy goes for a second object but gets a shock which makes him recoil in pain
leonard to substitute sammy contd ah
what the fuck
sammy looks accusingly at the doctor
its a test sammy
some of the objects were electrified theyd give him a small shock
they kept repeating the test always with the same objects electrified
the point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects
not by memory but by instinct
leonard opens his eyes naked in bed
he looks around confused
with a start he realizes that someone else is in the bed a brunette with her back to him
leonard leans right over her to get a look at her face
it is natalie
the bruise on her eye and the mark on her lip are worse than before
she opens her eyes and is startled by the sight of leonards hovering face
its only me
leonard flops down
natalie wakes up fully and relaxes
she looks at her bedside clock
memento blue revisions
i gotta be someplace
she gets out of bed wearing pajamas
leonard swings his legs out of the bed and realizes that he is wearing trousers and socks
he looks at his tattoos as if he has never seen them before
natalie contd pretty weird
she is smiling at him in the mirror
leonard smiles shrugs
you never write a phone number on your hand
through mirror i should be able to talk to my friend about the license plate today
yeah the license plate
smiles john gs license plate number
you have it tattooed on your thigh
natalie leaves the room
leonard pulls down his trousers to reveal two tattoos leonard runs his finger over fact then pulls his trousers up and looks around the room
he spots his suit jacket hanging over the back of a chair
he checks the pockets pulls out his polaroids flips through them a jaguar the discount inn natalie
he flips natalies picture over and looks at the back
there are two messages but the first one has been completely scribbled over
the other one reads leonard stuffs the photos back into his pocket grabs a white shirt of f the chair and pulls it on
natalie comes back in and starts to apply her makeup
memento pink revisions if its registered in this state itll just take seconds to pull up his license and registration
ill call when ive spoken to him
why dont we just arrange a meeting now
im not too good on the phone
natalie takes her eye pencil and writes a note on a small bag from a pharmacy
leonard puts his jacket on
natalie offers him the note
it says memento pink revisions
leonard contd leading its great that you would
that youre helping me like this
smiles im helping you because you helped me
natalie contd so will you remember me next time you seo me
leonard shakes his head and reaches for the note
natalie grabs his lapel and pulls him down to her kissing him gently on the mouth
natalie contd i think you will
smiles im sorry
leonard heads for the door
amused lenny before you go can i have my shirt back please
she tosses him his blue shirt
leonard looks down at the white shirt which he has put on
it is way too small
the jaguar pulls up to a red light
suddenly teddy is banging on the window
i thought youd gone for good
what brings you back
leonard in boxers bandaged arm strides the room shaving foam on leg razor in one hand phone in the other
memento pink revisions
they kept testing sammy for months always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge
sammy sits across the testing table from the doctor
sammy goes for a metal object and recoils in pain from a shock
what the fuck
its a test sammy
as before but sammy is dressed differently
he goes for an object and is shocked
what the fuck
its a test sammy
test this you fucking quack
sequence of jump cuts of sammy extending his middle finger and recoiling in shock from the objects
even with total short term memory loss sammy shouldve learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects
all previous cases of short term memory loss had responded to conditioning in some way
sammy didnt respond at all
it was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical
leonard contd we turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasnt covered for mental illness
sammys wife got stuck with the bills and i got a promotion for rejecting a big claim
leonard looks into the mirror
leonard contd conditioning didnt work for sammy so he became helpless
but it works for me
i live the way sammy couldnt
habit and conditioning
acting on instinct
leonard pulls up in his jaguar gets out rings the front doorbell
it is opened by natalie
natalie nods wary of leonards barely concealed anger
leonard thrusts a polaroid photo in her face
leonard contd who the fuck is dodd
the photo is of a man who is bound gagged and bloody
on the back of the photo natalie takes the picture and examines it
guess i dont have to worry about him anymore

she tries to rip the picture
leonard watches her try
the plastic is too strong
you have to burn them
natalie scrunches it up and throws it down
leonard and natalie sit down on the couch
you decided to help me
trust your own judgment
you can question everything you can never know anything for sure
there are things you know for sure
i know the feel of the world
reaches forward i know how this wood will sound when i knock
raps knuckles on coffee table i know how this glass will feel when i pick it up
handles glass certainties
you think its knowledge but its a kind of memory a kind you take for granted
i can remember so much
runs hands over objects i know the feel of the world beat and i know her
shes gone and the present is trivia which i can scribble down as notes
natalie stares at leonard thinking
relax a little okay
take off your jacket
leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the couch patting the pockets as he does so
its not easy to be calm when just relax
she reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff revealing the end of leonards tattoos
natalie contd you dont seem the type
she pushes back the sleeve trying to read the tattoo
leonard watches her
natalie contd come on
she starts to unbutton his shirt
natalie gasps as she opens leonards shirt and pulls it back over his shoulders
she tilts her head trying to read the different messages
natalie contd its backwards
she pulls him up and turns him around in front of the mirror to read the backwards tattoo across his chest
natalie touches the blank area of skin above leonards heart
natalie contd here
leonard looks down at the blank patch then at natalie vulnerable confused
it must be for when ive found him
she looks at leonard
natalie studies leonards chest avoiding his eyes
memento pink revisions natalie contd ive lost somebody
memento pink revisions
natalie picks up a photograph from off a messy desk in the corner
she shows it to leonard
the picture shows natalie smiling and hugging a smirking young man jimmy
natalie looks up at leonard to see his reaction
his name was jimmy
he went to meet somebody and didnt come back
who did he go to meet
natalie studies leonard
a guy called teddy
leonard does not react to the name
what do the police think
they dont look too hard for guys like jimmy
natalie puts the photo down
she reaches out to leonard spreading her fingers over the blank part of his chest
natalie contd when you find this guy this john g
what are you going to do

i know a lot of people
natalie eyes closed has her head on leonards chest
he is shirtless lying on top of the covers
memento pink revisions

its like ive woken up in bed and shes not here because shes gone to the bathroom or something

natalies eyes are open
leonard contd i know i cant have her back but i want to be able to let her go
i dont want to wake up every morning thinking shes still here then realizing that shes not
i want time to pass but it wont
how can i heal if i cant feel time
leonard bends his head around to see if natalie is awake
she closes her eyes
leonard gingerly slides from underneath her and moves silently out of the bedroom
leonard enters the dark room
he goes to the couch and picks up his shirt and his jacket
he notices the photograph which natalie showed him on top of some papers on a desk in the corner
he holds it in a shaft of light from the streetlamp outside studying the photo of natalie and jimmy
natalie eyes open slides her hand over to where leonard was lying feeling his residual warmth
natalies living room night leonard has his polaroid photograph of natalie out
he takes a pen out of his jacket rests the photo against the wall in a patch of light and writes on the back underneath the message which has been
scribbled out memento pink revisions
leonard enters deposits his jacket and shirt then slides into bed next to natalie
leonard lies on the bed in boxers bandaged arm talking on the phone
he wipes the excess shaving foam from his thigh and feels the smoothness of the clean shaven skin
sammys wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the companys decision but it wasnt the money that got to her
jankis comes into the room
sammy is seated watching t
he looks up at her with a smile
she smiles back tense
i never said that sammy was faking
just that his problem was mental not physical
she couldnt understand
she looks into his eyes and sees the same person
and if its not a physical problem
sammys wife starts shouting at sammy
he should just
snap out of it
sammys wife throws her drink in sammys face puts her head in her hands sobbing
sammy wipes his face on his sleeve
leonard talking on the phone empties the white paper bag onto the bed beside him two cheap ball point pens scotch tape a pack of needles and a file card
memento pink revisions
leonard contd so good old leonard shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt just like he gave it to the doctors
but i never said that sammy was faking
i never said that
leonard takes a needle out of the packet
we move along a hallway towards a closed door
an ominous rumbling builds
a glass bottle shatters against black and white ceramic tiles
a sudden movement glimpsed through a water beaded clear plastic shower curtain
the shower curtain pulls taut across a gasping female face
leonards reflection in a mirror which shatters
leonard opens his eyes frightened
he is lying on the bed in his beige suit and blue shirt
he rolls his eyes to one side
contd where am i
he lifts his head and surveys the room
contd motel room
he rises from the bed looking at the room as if for the first time
he starts looking in the dresser drawers finding nothing
contd some anonymous motel room
nothing in the drawers but you look anyway
memento pink revisions
he grasps the handle of the bedside drawer
contd never anything but the gideon
leonard pulls the drawer open and pauses at what he sees
in the drawer is a gideon bible
resting on top of it is a leonard turns looks over the rest of the room
he moves to the bureau and opens drawers
he goes to the closet and opens it
inside is a bound and gagged man on the floor knees against chest
his mouth is taped up with silver electrical tape stained with dried blood from his swollen nose
he looks up at leonard blinking in the sudden bright light terrified
leonard shuts the closet door confused
the man in the closet starts grunting and bumping the closet door
there is a knock at the door
leonard looks through the peephole
a fish eye teddy grinning and waving
leonard looks around trying to think
teddy knocks harder
the man in the closet bumps and groans
leonard reaches into his pocket and pulls out some polaroids

leonard tweaks his broken nose
the man groans
leonard contd your name

leonard replaces the gag and shuts the closet

leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying his pockets
he pulls a polaroid out of his inside jacket pocket
leonard contd here we go
the polaroid shows dodd sitting on the bed bound gagged and bleeding
the name dodd is written below the picture
leonard flips it over

the landcruiser pulls over and stops
the grey sedan pulls up behind
leonard gets out of the landcruiser and it pulls away at speed

leonard pulls his polaroids out of his pocket and finds the one of teddy
he places it on the dash face up next to the one of natalie which is still face down on the dash
leonard reads the message he has written on the back of natalies picture he flips teddys picture over like a croupier turning a card at blackjack
on the back it says leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration
he grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of natalies picture obliterating the words he flips natalies picture over and considers her blurred image
he looks up at her house then picks up the beer mat reading the address teddy has given him
i need my own place
leonard starts the engine

where hed hidden the stuff
she wasnt a cruel person she just wanted her old sammy back
the tearful mrs
jankis gives leonard a determined look
shelby you know all about sammy and you decided that he was faking mrs
jankis the companys position isnt that sammy is faking anything just that his condition cant be shown im not interested in the company position mr

we shouldnt even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal
im not appealing the decision
then why are you here
shelby try and understand
when i look into sammys eyes i dont see some vegetable i see the same old sammy
what do you think its like for me to suspect that hes imagining this whole problem
that if i could just say the right thing hed snap out of it and be back to normal
if i knew that my old sammy was truly gone then i could say goodbye and start loving this new sammy
as long as i have doubt i cant say goodbye and move on
jankis what do you want from me
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds and tell me if you really think that sammy is faking his condition

leonard lowers the camera and takes out a pen resting the picture against the truck about to write on the white strip beneath the developing picture
leonard contd im sorry is it officer or lieutenant gammell
teddy coughs and looks at the picture
dont write gammell please
leonard raises his eyebrows
teddy contd im undercover
hell be heading there now
memento pink revisions
teddy pulls a note out of his pocket and hands it to leonard
youre not coming
wouldnt be appropriate
leonard climbs into the truck
teddy taps on the window
teddy contd leonard
leonard cranks it down
teddy looks at leonard with something like fatherly affection
teddy contd make him beg
the pickup truck speeds along past strip malls and gas stations heading into more desolate industrialization
the pickup truck bumps across the railroad tracks then pulls up in front of the large derelict building
leonard gets out of the pickup looking around
he heads into the house down the dimly lit decaying former hallway treading carefully on the loose rotten floorboards
he notices a door at the end of the hallway
he opens the door to see that it leads down to the basement
leonard hears a car approaching
he slips into the kitchen and looks out the dirty broken front windows
the jaguar is approaching fast
it parks next to the pickup truck and the driver emerges a young man in his s smartly dressed in beige suit and blue shirt
this is jimmy the young man from natalies photograph
he looks at the truck then at the house
leonard steps back into the shadows of the crumbling kitchen
jimmy approaches the doorway peering into the dark hallway
memento pink revisions
jimmy steps cautiously inside
leonard emerges from the kitchen
what the fuck are you doing here
do you remember me
laughs yeah i remember you
you jimmy grantz
expecting any other jimmys out here memory man
where the fucks teddy
leonard comes out of the gloom stopping in front of jimmy studying his face
leonard has a jack handle in his hand
jimmy contd well
leonards wife head wrapped in a water beaded clear plastic shower curtain thrashing around gasping for breath
leonard hits jimmy around the head with the jack handle
jimmy goes down but struggles as leonard drags him deeper into the dark hallway
leonard bends over the groaning jimmy frisking him finding nothing
jimmy contd you fucking retard you cant get away with this leonard holds the jack handle above him
memento blue revisions
jimmy starts taking off his suit
youre making a big fucking mistake
my associates are not people you want dont say anything else
i knew i couldnt trust that fuck quiet
jimmy drops his shirt
leonard contd pants too
i dont want blood on them
sudden fear wait
did he tell you what i was bringing
look theres two hundred grand stashed in the car
just take it
leonard shoves jimmy to the ground
you think you can bargain with me
take the money and walk away
i dont want your fucking money
what do you want from me
leonard looks up
leonards wife smiling
leonard is losing it
i want my fucking life back
jimmy swings at leonard with a broken floorboard striking his shoulder
the jack handle goes flying
jimmy swings again misses
leonard grabs him taking him down
the two of them struggle on the floor
leonard gets on top of jimmy choking him
jimmy tries to speak but can only make gurgling noises
as leonard watches jimmy fight for air we leonards wife thrashes her head from side to side struggling to breathe though the clear plastic shower curtain
jimmys arms thrash his hands catching leonards face scratching his cheek
leonard tips his head back and increases his efforts
jimmy stops struggling
leonard keeps his hands around jimmys throat until he is confident that he is dead
leonard breathes as he stands up
he nods to himself with satisfaction
he looks around for his polaroid camera
he snaps a flash picture of jimmys body and stares intently at the polaroid as it begins to develop
we see the image of the strangled jimmy appear colour post leonard stands above jimmys body examining the picture he has just taken nodding to himself catching his breath
leonard grabs jimmy s body by the legs dragging him back towards the basement
he opens the door and backs down into the darkness pulling jimmy behind him
leonard backs down the stairs dragging jimmys body head bumping down each step
in the middle of the room leonard drops the legs
moving fast leonard pulls the beige suit trousers from the body removes his own scruffy jeans and plaid work shirt
leonard dresses in jimmys blue shirt and beige suit
he grabs the polaroids from his plaid work shirt and sticks them in his suit jacket pocket
he dumps his old clothes onto jimmys body
a faint rasping comes from jimmys throat
leonard frightened bends down to listen
barely and audible rasp sammy
leonard is shocked
jimmy is silent
the sound of a car outside
leonard jumps to his feet
leonard looks out to see teddy getting out of his grey sedan
leonard leafs through his polaroids finding the one of teddy
there is nothing on the back
he sticks his polaroids back in his pocket pausing at the one of the strangled jimmy
what have i done
leonard emerges to find teddy trying the jaguars doors
i need help
teddy looks up
theres a guy in here hurt bad
we gotta get him to a doctor
teddy moves towards the house
leonard leads him in
memento pink revisions
teddy follows leonard down the darkened hall
panicked he might have fallen down the stairs i dont know i dont know whats going on im confused
i have this memory thing do i know you
dont worry im a cop
everythingll be okay
is he still breathing
they go down into the basement
teddy follows leonard down the stairs
jimmys body dressed only in boxers lies in the middle of the floor
so what were you doing here
teddy moves to the body and crouches down to examine it
i dont know

well i hope its not as serious as his cos this guys dead
leonard cracks teddy over the head with the floorboard
teddy contd fuck lenny

leonard frisks him pulling out a gun and a police badge
leonard contd youre a cop
a fucking cop
memento yellow revisions yeah and i helped you find the guy you were looking for get up
teddy crawls to his feet rubbing his head
memento yellow revision
leonard pushes teddy out of the basement
i think youve got the wrong idea leonard grabs teddy
who was that
hes not the guy
he knew me
sure he did
he raped your wife and fucked up your brain
his names james f
grantz john g
check your tattoos
so what was he bringing the two hundred grand for
what what was it for
a load of amphetamine i told him i had
this is a drug deal
that and your thing
memento green revisions
teddy contd jimmys your guy leonard
i just figured wed make some money on the side
but how did he know me
the discount inn he deals out of there
the guy at the front desk lets him know if anybody comes snooping around
he called jimmy as soon as you took a picture of that dump
youre using me
teddy looks at him offended
beat you get half
leonard throws him against the wall
he knew about sammy
why would i tell him about sammy
chuckles you tell everyone about sammy
everyone wholl listen
remember sammy jankis remember sammy jankis
gets better every time you tell it
so you lie to yourself to be happy
nothing wrong with that we all do
who cares if theres a few little things youd rather not remember
what the fuck are you talking about
memento green revisions
theatrical shrug i dunno
your wife surviving the assault
her not believing about your condition
the doubt tearing her up inside
the insulin thats sammy not me
i told you about sammy like youve told yourself
over and over
conditioning yourself to believe
learning through repetition sammy let his wife kill herself
sammy ended up in an institution
sammy was a con man
i never said he was faking
i never said that
you exposed him for what he was a fraud
memento green revisions
i was wrong
thats the whole point
sammys wife came to me and sammy didnt have a wife
leonard freezes staring at teddy
teddy contd it was your wife who had diabetes
leonards wife sitting on the edge of the bed
she feels a sharp pain and turns to leonard just as we have seen before
leonard has a syringe in his hand
leonard shakes his head clearing his head of the image
my wife wasnt diabetic
are you sure
leonards wife on the edge of the bed
she feels a sharp pain and turns to leonard
memento green revisions
leonard is playfully pinching her thigh
leonard shakes his head smiling
she wasnt diabetic
you think i dont know my own wife
what the fuck is wrong with you
shrugs i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true huh
like ol jimmy down there
but hes not the right guy
he was to you
come on lenny you got your revenge just enjoy it while you still remember
memento green revisions
chuckles what difference does it make whether he was your guy or not
it makes all the difference
youre never going to know
yes i will
no you wont
somehow ill know
you wont remember
when its done ill know
itll be different
i thought so too
i was sure youd remember
but you didnt
leonard looks at teddy questioning
off look you know when we found your guy and killed him
off look thats right the real john g
over a year ago
i helped you find him
hes already dead
why do you keep lying to me
i was the cop assigned to your wifes death
i believed you i thought you deserved the chance for revenge
i helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night
the guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife
we found him and you killed him
memento green revisions teddy contd you didnt remember so i helped you start looking again looking for the guy you already killed
so who are you saying he was
just some guy
does it even matter who
i stopped asking myself why a long time ago
no reason no conspiracy just bad fucking luck
a couple of junkies too strung out to realize that your wife didnt live alone
when you killed him ive never seen you so happy i was convinced youd remember
but it didnt stick like nothing ever sticks
like this wont stick
leonard looks at the polaroid of himself
teddy contd thats the picture right
i took that right when you did it
look how happy you are
before you forgot
i wanted to see that face again
sarcastic thank you
fuck you i gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help
you lie to yourself
you dont want the truth the truth is a fucking coward
so you make up your own truth
memento green revisions
teddy contd look at your police file
it was complete when i gave it to you
who took the pages out
you took them out
why would i do that
to set yourself a puzzle you wont ever solve
you know how many towns how many guys called james g
or john g
shit leonard im a john g
your names teddy
chuckles my mother calls me teddy
im john edward gammell
cheer up theres a lot of john gs for us to find
all you do is moan
im the one that has to live with what youve done
im the one that has to put it all together
you just wander around playing detective
youre living a dream kid
a dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life
a romantic quest which you wouldnt end even if i wasnt in the picture
leonard sticks the gun in teddys face
i should kill you
brushes the gun away youre not a killer lenny
thats why youre so good at it
leonard searches teddys pockets still holding the gun on teddy
leonard finds teddys car keys
he gets off teddy and moves towards the light
memento green revisions teddy contd hey where are you going
you know what time it is
leonard stares at teddy mystified
teddy contd its beer oclock
and im buying
our work here is done
leonard turns away and walks out into the light
leonard in beige suit and blue shirt comes out into the daylight throws teddys car keys into some bushes then heads to his pickup truck and climbs in
teddy goes to look for his keys in the bushes
memento green revisions
leonard opens the revolver and empties the bullets onto the passenger seat
he flips through the photos until he finds the one of the strangled jimmy
im not a killer
leonard reaches into his sports bag grabs a lighter and sparks a flame
leonard holds the photo in the flame until it catches light melting and blackening
the flames go out having destroyed the entire image but for an arm resting on a floor
leonard sticks the remnants into his jacket pocket
he looks in the rear view mirror at teddy who scrabbles around in the bushes
but right now i need to be
teddys grey sedan is parked in front of leonard
leonard looks at the sedan then reaches into his sports bag for a pen and a file card
he writes on the file card leonard looks from the card to teddys sedan
contd maybe im not finished yet
maybe i need to be sure that you wont ever use me again
leonard rips up the file card and takes out another
contd youre a john g
fine then you can be my john g
leonard writes on the file card leonard v
contd do i lie to myself to be happy
leonard looks up at teddys sedan and copies down the license number
the license number of teddys car is sg iu
contd in your case teddy
yes i will
memento green revisions leonard grabs the sports bag and gets out of the pickup truck
he goes to the jaguar and opens the passenger door dumping his sports bag onto the seat
teddy sees this and runs over
leonard walks to the back of the jaguar and holds up his camera
hey thats not your car
leonard snaps a polaroid of the jaguar
it is now
you cant just take it
leonard unlocks the trunk turning to teddy as he does so
memento yellow revisions
you just killed the guy who owned it
somebodyll recognize it
leonard pulls teddys empty gun out of his pocket
id rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer
im gonna hang on to this
leonard tosses the gun into the trunk
it lands on piles of banknotes stuffed in the trunk
teddy reacts to the sight of the money
leonard glances at teddy then the money shakes his head then slams the trunk
teddy jogs back to where he was looking for his keys
leonard starts the engine
through the rear view mirror leonard stares at teddys retreating form
leonard pulls out onto the road
as the jaguar cruises along leonard places the file card on the dash
it says leonard drives heading back into town
he looks at his hand on the steering wheel reading remember sammy jankis
i have to believe in the world outside my own mind
i have to believe that my actions still have meaning even if i cant remember them
i have to believe that when my eyes are closed the worlds still there
leonard closes his eyes driving blind
stay on leonard not seeing the road ahead hearing cars whip past
contd rising tension but do i
do i believe the worlds still there
move in on leonard as cars fly past horns blaring
memento blue revisions
contd is it still out there
leonard opens his eyes straightening up the car breathing
his eyes dart from the strip malls to the gas stations as if leonard v
contd we all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are
im no different
from the bewildering blur of urban signage leonard suddenly glimpses a tattoo parlor in a strip mall
he slams on the the tyres scream as the car screeches to a halt and we leonard v
where was i
the following is jonathan nolans short story memento mori the inspiration for his brother christopher nolans screenplay for the film memento by jonathan nolan what like a bullet can undeceive
herman melville your wife always used to say youd be late for your own funeral
her little joke because you were such a slob always late always forgetting stuff even before the incident
right about now youre probably wondering if you were late for hers
you were there you can be sure of that
thats what the pictures for the one tacked to the wall by the door
its not customary to take pictures at a funeral but somebody your doctors i guess knew you wouldnt remember
they had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there next to the door so you couldnt help but see it every time you got up to
find out where she was
the guy in the picture the one with the flowers
and what are you doing
youre reading the headstone trying to figure out whos funeral youre at same as youre reading it now trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door
but why bother reading something that you wont remember
shes gone gone for good and you must be hurting right now hearing the news
believe me i know how you feel
youre probably a wreck
but give it five minutes maybe ten
maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget
but you will forget i guarantee it
a few more minutes and youll be heading for the door looking for her all over again breaking down when you find the picture
how many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body other than that busted brain of yours starts to remember
never ending grief never ending anger
useless without direction
maybe you cant understand whats happened
cant say i really understand either
thats what the sign says
your guess is as good as mine
maybe you cant understand what happened to you
but you do remember what happened to her dont you
the doctors dont want to talk about it
they wont answer my questions
they dont think its right for a man in your condition to hear about those things
but you remember enough dont you
you remember his face
this is why im writing to you
i dont know how many times youll have to read this before you listen to me
i dont even know how long youve been locked up in this room already
neither do you
but your advantage in forgetting is that youll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause
sooner or later youll want to do something about it
and when you do youll just have to trust me because im the only one who can help you
earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand printed sign taped right above his head large enough for him to read
from the bed
an alarm clock is ringing somewhere
he reads the sign blinks reads it again then takes a look at the room
its a white room overwhelmingly white from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread
the alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains
at this point earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter
he is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers
he lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again
it says in crude block capitals this is your room
this is a room in a earl rises and takes a look around
the room is large for a hospital empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions
two doors and a window
the view isnt very helpful either a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two lane blacktop
the trees except for the evergreens are bare early spring or late fall one or the other
every inch of the desk is covered with post it notes legal pads neatly printed lists psychological textbooks framed pictures
on top of the mess is a half completed crossword puzzle
the alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers
earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown
he pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light
he rifles the papers on the desk looks quickly through the drawers
eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window
another sign is taped just above the box
it says in loud yellow letters cigarette
check for lit ones first stupid
earl laughs at the sign lights his cigarette and takes a long draw
taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed your schedule
it charts off the hours every hour in blocks p
is labeled go back to sleep
earl consults the alarm clock
given the light outside it must be morning
he checks his watch
he presses the watch to his ear and listens
he gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock
according to the schedule the entire block from to has been labeled brush your teeth
earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom
the bathroom window is open
as he flaps his arms to keep warm he notices the ashtray on the windowsill
a cigarette is perched on the ashtray burning steadily through a long finger of ash
he frowns extinguishes the old butt and replaces it with the new one
the toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste
the tap is of the push button variety a dose of water with each nudge
earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet
the shelves are stocked with single serving packages of vitamins aspirin antidiuretics
the mouthwash is also single serving about a shot glass worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle
only the toothpaste is regular sized
earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash
as he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet
he spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down
he closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the mirror
who needs half an hour to brush their teeth
the paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth graders love note
earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror
it reads earl stares blankly at the paper then reads it again
he turns it over
on the back it reads earl reads both sides again then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste
maybe then he notices the scar
it begins just beneath the ear jagged and thick and disappears abruptly into his hairline
earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scars progress
he traces it with a fingertip then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray
a thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom
he is caught at the door to his room one hand on the knob
two pictures are taped to the wall by the door
earls attention is caught first by the mri a shiny black frame for four windows into someones skull
in marker the picture is labeled your brain
earl stares at it
concentric circles in different colors
he can make out the big orbs of his eyes and behind these the twin lobes of his brain
smooth wrinkles circles semicircles
but right there in the middle of his head circled in marker tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot is something different
deformed broken but unmistakable
a dark smudge the shape of a flower right there in the middle of his brain
he bends to look at the other picture
it is a photograph of a man holding flowers standing over a fresh grave
the man is bent over reading the headstone
for a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity the one man bent over looking at the smaller man bent over
reading the headstone
earl looks at the picture for a long time
maybe he begins to cry
maybe he just stares silently at the picture
eventually he makes his way back to the bed flops down seals his eyes shut tries to sleep
the cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom
a circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten and it starts ringing again
earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand printed sign taped right above his head large enough for him to read
from the bed
you cant have a normal life anymore
you must know that
how can you have a girlfriend if you cant remember her name
cant have kids not unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesnt recognize them
sure as hell cant hold down a job
not too many professions out there that value forgetfulness
politics of course
your life is over
youre a dead man
the only thing the doctors are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies
and theyll probably never let you go home wherever that would be
so the question is not to be or not to be because you arent
the question is whether you want to do something about it
whether revenge matters to you
it does to most people
for a few weeks they plot they scheme they take measures to get even
but the passage of time is all it takes to erode that initial impulse
time is theft isnt that what they say
and time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue
conveniently cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance
time steals your nerve
if time and fear arent enough to dissuade people from their revenge then theres always authority softly shaking its head and saying we understand but youre the better man for
letting it go
for rising above it
for not sinking to their level
and besides says authority if you try anything stupid well lock you up in a little room
but they already put you in a little room didnt they
only they dont really lock it or even guard it too carefully because youre a cripple
a vegetable who probably wouldnt remember to eat or take a shit if someone wasnt there to remind you
and as for the passage of time well that doesnt really apply to you anymore does it
just the same ten minutes over and over again
so how can you forgive if you cant remember to forget
you probably were the type to let it go werent you
but youre not the man you used to be
not even half
youre a fraction youre the ten minute man
of course weakness is strong
its the primary impulse
youd probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry
live in your finite collection of memories carefully polishing each one
half a life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic insects
youd like to live behind that glass wouldnt you
preserved in aspic
youd like to but you cant can you
you cant because of the last addition to your collection
the last thing you remember
his face and your wife looking to you for help
and maybe this is where you can retire to when its over
your little collection
they can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of your life in the past
but only if youve got a little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him
you know im right
you know theres a lot of work to do
it may seem impossible but im sure if we all do our part well figure something out
but you dont have much time
youve only got about ten minutes in fact
then it starts all over again
so do something with the time youve got
earl opens his eyes and blinks into the darkness
the alarm clock is ringing
it says and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be he early morning
earl fumbles for the lamp almost knocking it over in the process
incandescent light fills the room painting the metal furniture yellow the walls yellow the bedspread too
he lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling
he reads the sign two maybe three times then blinks at the room around him
it is a bare room
there is a desk over by the window
the desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock
earl probably notices at this point that he is fully clothed
he even has his shoes on under the sheets
he extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk
nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there or ever had except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall
no pictures no books nothing
through the window he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass
earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at the two keys taped to the back of his hand
he picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers
in the left pocket of his jacket he finds a roll of hundred dollar bills and a letter sealed in an envelope
he checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom
bits of tape cigarette butts
earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and moves back toward the bed
he lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it
the sign reads get up get out earl closes his eyes
they tried to teach you to make lists in grade school remember
back when your day planner was the back of your hand
and if your assignments came off in the shower well then they didnt get done
no direction they said
so they tried to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent
of course your grade school teachers would be laughing their pants wet if they could see you now
because youve become the exact product of their organizational lessons
because you cant even take a piss without consulting one of your lists
they were right
lists are the only way out of this mess
heres the truth people even regular people are never just any one person with one set of attributes
its not that simple
were all at the mercy of the limbic system clouds of electricity drifting through the brain
every man is broken into twenty four hour fractions and then again within those twenty four hours
its a daily pantomime one man yielding control to the next a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight
every week every day
the angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man and in turn to the sex addict the introvert the conversationalist
every man is a mob a chain gang of idiots
this is the tragedy of life
because for a few minutes of every day every man becomes a genius
moments of clarity insight whatever you want to call them
the clouds part the planets get in a neat little line and everything becomes obvious
i should quit smoking maybe or heres how i could make a fast million or such and such is the key to eternal happiness
thats the miserable truth
for a few moments the secrets of the universe are opened to us
life is a cheap parlor trick
but then the genius the savant has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips
and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic
the only way out of this mess of course is to take steps to ensure that you control the idiots that you become
to take your chain gang hand in hand and lead them
the best way to do this is with a list
its like a letter you write to yourself
a master plan drafted by the guy who can see the light made with steps simple enough for the rest of the idiots to understand
follow steps one through one hundred
repeat as necessary
your problem is a little more acute maybe but fundamentally the same thing
its like that computer thing the chinese room
you remember that
one guy sits in a little room laying down cards with letters written on them in a language he doesnt understand laying them down one letter at a time in
a sequence according to someone elses instructions
the cards are supposed to spell out a joke in chinese
the guy doesnt speak chinese of course
he just follows his instructions
there are some obvious differences in your situation of course you broke out of the room they had you in so the whole enterprise has to be portable
and the guy giving the instructions thats you too just an earlier version of you
and the joke youre telling well its got a punch line
i just dont think anyones going to find it very funny
so thats the idea
all you have to do is follow your instructions
like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase
one step at a time
right down the list
and the secret of course to any list is to keep it in a place where youre bound to see it
he can hear the buzzing through his eyelids
he reaches out for the alarm clock but he cant move his arm
earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him
the man looks up at him annoyed then resumes his work
earl looks around him
too dark for a doctors office
then the pain floods his brain blocking out the other questions
he squirms gain trying to yank his forearm away the one that feels like its burning
the arm doesnt move but the man shoots him another scowl
earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the mans head
the noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the mans hand a gun with a needle where the barrel should be
the needle is digging into the fleshy underside of earls forearm leaving a trail of puffy letters behind it
earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view to read the letters on his arm but he cant
he lies back and stares at the ceiling
eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise wipes earls forearm with a piece of gauze and wanders over to the back to dig up a pamphlet describing how to
deal with a possible infection
maybe later hell tell his wife about this guy and his little note
maybe his wife will convince him to call the police
earl looks down at the arm
the letters are rising up from the skin weeping a little
they run from just behind the strap of earls watch all the way to the inside of his elbow
earl blinks at the message and reads it again
it says in careful little capitals i raped and its your birthday today so i got you a little present
i would have just bought you a beer but who knows where that would have ended
so instead i got you a bell
i think i may have had to pawn your watch to buy it but what the hell did you need a watch for anyway
youre probably asking yourself why a bell
in fact im guessing youre going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it in your pocket
too many of these letters now
too many for you to dig back into every time you want to know the answer to some little question
its a joke actually
a practical joke
but think of it this way im not really laughing at you so much as with you
id like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and wonder why do i have this bell
a little part of you a little piece of your broken brain will remember and laugh like im laughing now
besides you do know the answer
it was something you learned before
so if you think about it youll know
back in the old days people were obsessed with the fear of being buried alive
you remember now
medical science not being quite what it is today it wasnt uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a casket
so rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes
little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up when they werent supposed to they wouldnt run out of oxygen
now they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout yourself hoarse through the tube but it was too narrow to carry much noise
not enough to attract attention at least
so a string was run up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone
if a dead person came back to life all he had to do was ring his little bell till someone came and dug him up again
im laughing now picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast food restaurant reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and wondering to yourself where it
came from why you have it
maybe youll even ring it
happy birthday buddy
i dont know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem so i dont know whether to congratulate you or me
a bit of a lifestyle change admittedly but an elegant solution nonetheless
look to yourself for the answer
that sounds like something out of a hallmark card
i dont know when you thought it up but my hats off to you
not that you know what the hell im talking about
but honestly a real brainstorm
after all everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are
youre no different
the little mechanical voice pauses then repeats itself
it says the time is a
this is a courtesy call
earl opens his eyes and replaces the receiver
the phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard that stretches behind the bed curves to meet the corner and ends at the minibar
the tv is still on blobs of flesh color nattering away at each other
earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself older now tanned the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares
the mirror on the ceiling is cracked the silver fading increases
earl continues to stare at himself astonished by what he sees
he is fully dressed but the clothes are old threadbare in places
earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch but its gone
he looks down from the mirror to his arm
it is bare and the skin has changed to an even tan as if he never owned a watch in the first place
the skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on the inside of earls wrist pointing up his shirtsleeve
he stares at the arrow for a moment
perhaps he doesnt try to rub it off anymore
he rolls up his sleeve
the arrow points to a sentence tattooed along earls inner arm
earl reads the sentence once maybe twice
another arrow picks up at the beginning of the sentence points farther up earls arm disappearing under the rolled up shirtsleeve
he unbuttons his shirt
looking down on his chest he can make out the shapes but cannot bring them into focus so he looks up at the mirror above him
the arrow leads up earls arm crosses at the shoulder and descends onto his upper torso terminating at a picture of a mans face that occupies most of his chest
the face is that of a large man balding with a mustache and a goatee
it is a particular face but like a police sketch it has a certain unreal quality
the rest of his upper torso is covered in words phrases bits of information and instructions all of them written backward on earl forward in the mirror
eventuallyearl sits up buttons his shirt and crosses to the desk
he takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer sits and begins to write
i dont know where youll be when you read this
im not even sure if youll bother to read this
i guess you dont need to
its a shame really that you and i will never meet
but like the song says by the time you read this note ill be gone
were so close now
thats the way it feels
so many pieces put together spelled out
i guess its just a matter of time until you find him
who knows what weve done to get here
must be a hell of a story if only you could remember any of it
i guess its better that you cant
i had a thought just now
maybe youll find it useful
everybody is waiting for the end to come but what if it already passed us by
what if the final joke of judgment day was that it had already come and gone and we were none the wiser
apocalypse arrives quietly the chosen are herded off to heaven and the rest of us the ones who failed the test just keep on going oblivious
dead already wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score still optimistic about the future
i guess if thats true then it doesnt matter what you do
if you cant find him then it doesnt matter because nothing matters
and if you do find him then you can kill him without worrying about the consequences
because there are no consequences
thats what im thinking about right now in this scrappy little room
framed pictures of ships on the wall
i dont know obviously but if i had to guess id say were somewhere up the coast
if youre wondering why your left arm is five shades browner than your right i dont know what to tell you
i guess we must have been driving for a while
and no i dont know what happened to your watch
and all these keys i have no idea
not a one that i recognize
car keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks
what have we been up to
i wonder if hell feel stupid when you find him
tracked down by the ten minute man
assassinated by a vegetable
ill be gone in a moment
ill put down the pen close my eyes and then you can read this through if you want
i just wanted you to know that im proud of you
no one who matters is left to say it
no one left is going to want to
earls eyes are wide open staring through the window of the car
smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across the street
the crowd gathering around the body in the doorway
the body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain
a stocky guy facedown eyes open
balding head goatee
in death as in police sketches faces tend to look the same
this is definitely somebody in particular
but really it could be anybody
earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb
whos to say
maybe its a police cruiser
maybe its just a taxi
as the car is swallowed into traffic earls eyes continue to shine out into the night watching the body until it disappears into a circle of concerned pedestrians
he chuckles to himself as the car continues to make distance between him and the growing crowd
earls smile fades a little
something has occurred to him
he begins to pat down his pockets leisurely at first like a man looking for his keys then a little more desperately
maybe his progress is impeded by a set of handcuffs
he begins to empty the contents of his pockets out onto the seat next to him
a bunch of keys
scraps of paper
a round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl seat
earl is frantic now
he hammers at the plastic divider between him and the driver begging the man for a pen
perhaps the cabbie doesnt speak much english
perhaps the cop isnt in the habit of talking to suspects
either way the divider between the man in front and the man behind remains closed
a pen is not forthcoming
the car hits a pothole and earl blinks at his reflection in the rearview mirror
he is calm now
the driver makes another corner and the metal lump slides back over to rest against earls leg with a little jingle
he picks it up and looks at it curious now
it is a little bell
a little metal bell
inscribed on it are his name and a set of dates
he recognizes the first one the year in which he was born
but the second date means nothing to him
nothing at all
as he turns the bell over in his hands he notices the empty space on his wrist where his watch used to sit
there is a little arrow there pointing up his arm
earl looks at the arrow then begins to roll up his sleeve
youd be late for your own funeral shed say
the more i think about it the more trite that seems
what kind of idiot after all is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story
and how would i know if i were late anyway
i dont have a watch anymore
i dont know what we did with it
what the hell do you need a watch for anyway
it was an antique
deadweight tugging at your wrist
symbol of the old you
the you that believed in time
its not so much that youve lost your faith in time as that time has lost its faith in you
and who needs it anyway
who wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future in the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something powerful
living in the next moment in which they feel nothing
crawling down the hands of the clock away from the people who did unspeakable things to them
believing the lie that time will heal all wounds which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us
but youre different
youre more perfect
time is three things for most people but for you for us just one
like youre the center of the clock the axis on which the hands turn
time moves about you but never moves you
it has lost its ability to affect you
what is it they say
that time is theft
but not for you
close your eyes and you can start all over again
conjure up that necessary emotion fresh as roses
time is an absurdity
the only thing that matters is this moment
this moment a million times over
you have to trust me
if this moment is repeated enough if you keep trying and you have to keep trying eventually you will come across the next item on your list
