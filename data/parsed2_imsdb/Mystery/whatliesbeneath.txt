by clark gregg june moving through a murky haze
dark blues and greens shafts of prismed purple
a pale shard appears in the distance
gliding closer a group of tiny fish dart before the camera
arriving at the form it finally sharpens into focus
its a womans body submerged in dark water arms floating lazily at her side
the face is obscured by flowing hair
all that is visible is a pair of cold staring green eyes which blink closed
then open as blue eyes as a different face emerges from water
claire spencer awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub
she pivots the large brass shower head the kind that moves up and down on a pipe off to one side reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound
of a plug being pulled
a hazy shape accompanied by a whirring sound
a steam covered mirror is cleared with a blow dryer
claire starts to come into focus
the dryer stops
she presses the red g
button on the socket
a big blue spark shoots out
claire pulls her hand back
and the dryer starts whirring again
she clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook
she regards herself in the mirror and attractive elegant looking woman around forty
claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable scar above her left eye then slowly drops the hand to her cheek as if confirming her existence
claire now dressed presses her face against a door listening for the sounds of stirring from within
she quietly pushes open the door
claire makes her way past half filled boxes and duffels to a window then pulls the curtains to reveal a lovely wooded lake
it couldnt be more picturesque
a sailboat is moored at the dock and an old stone lighthouse sits on a point across the lake
the sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from a figure still shrouded by covers
claire sits beside the sleeping form
she scans the room briefly taking in a greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year old girl at camp
she gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face now a waifish pretty seventeen year old with chopped hair and tiny nose ring
claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter caitlin
she places her hand on a cheek
the girls eyelids flutter softly
caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly
or well never leave on time
from out of the pillow comes caitlins voice
muffled im totally ready
claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes
come on ill make you some waffles maybe well squeeze in a trip to the mall
claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is caitlins behind
claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor then folds and neatly stacks them on a box
caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow
youre such a morning person
claire turns at the door
it is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic
she starts to leave
caitlin calls out
claire smiles as she closes the door behind her
claire bends down to pick up one of caitlins socks
when she stands something catches her eye out a window
she gazes down transfixed
through a stand of trees over a high wooden fence a young couple is in the midst of a heated argument next door
claire watches as the husband a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old buick
she tries to get a glimpse of the woman but all thats visible is the back of her blond head
a tan sinewy arm encircles claires waist
she lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast
its claires husband dr
norman spencer nibbling gently at her neck
hes older than she pushing fifty with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach
than the prominent academic that he is
claire however cant take her eyes off the scene below
they at it again
christ thats twice in
when did they move in
i think three
she continues to gaze downward
the man leans over the hood murmuring darkly at his wife though for claire and norman the scene is entirely silent
whats their name
feur i think
theyre all psychotic
feur turns and walks toward his house
norman begins once again to nuzzle claire
her eyes close but then she gently demurs
well be quiet
quick and quiet
she turns to him
i dont want to be either
a really good smile
the lips and tongue on his faded t shirt mark him as a stones fan
whens she out of here
norman gives up
he busses her cheek
moving toward the stairs alright
i cant take the rejection
im going to class
claire i have to show up for the its saturday
i knew that
you think i didnt know that
she smiles at him
after a beat its today
they share a warm poignant look
he turns and moves down the stairs
calling over his shoulder were going to have to leave by three if we want to beat the traffic
claire returns her gaze to the scene below as mr
feur says something ominous to his wife then stalks into the house
absently three oclock
feur drops her face into her hands
claire peruses her to do list as caitlin munches a panini
and i still think we should get you some mittens
caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly
the bond between them is palpable
do you have a scarf
claire looks up from her little pad of paper
its only two hours away
i know that
ill come back all the time
of course you will
im just saying youre going to be fine
sweetheart ive known this day was coming for a long time
ive got your father and the garden and the new house
you really dont have to worry
caitlin smiles back and nods her face betraying some concern
claire takes her hand
she nods reassuringly and pulls caitlin into an embrace
her eyes close
claires frozen in the hug
her eyes open
widen to reveal claire holding caitlin on the college campus
the urban skyline looms in the background
i haveta go
after a moments hesitation she releases her grip
caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no ones witnessed this overt display of maternal affection
ill call you
claire produces an envelope which she presses into her daughters hand
its a book of train tickets
come home anytime
caitlin looks at norman
really gonna leave me huh
they share a tender look
she throws her arm briefly tightly around his waist
a bit overwhelmed he slowly brings his hand to the back of caitlins head
after a moment she steps back
then turns and makes her way toward the large old columbia dorm
a banner is draped across its portals which reads claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen smoking and talking on the front steps
her eyes are shining
norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a kleenex
smiling i almost made it
they turn and head for the car
claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder
caitlin glancing back at claire with an apprehensive smile
claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton nightgown
norman is in bed absorbed in some notes
she gets into bed then picks up a thick text from beside him and starts reading
after a moment whatcha reading
reading the cover sexy voice genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms
slight smile how is it
claire snuggles up
couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell
lost in his book nice
beat almost done
she pulls slightly away
if you have to work
im just about
he places his book on the bedside table and turns to her
how are you
its okay if youre not
i am really
its just shes been the focus for a while
not the focus
you know what i mean
claire thinks for a moment
to tell you the truth
to get my life back
to have some time for myself
some time for us
he caresses her
you did a great job
shes a good kid
theres a weighty pause
its just us now
he kisses her
wanna fool around
they start to kiss
its slow and a bit methodical in the manner of long time lovers
suddenly the sound of a woman wailing can be heard
the sounds start to become louder
it is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making
he walks over and closes the window
it doesnt help
i guess theyre making up
the womans moaning becomes embarrassingly loud
what is he doing to her
they lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on
and we moved out here for the quiet
the mood has passed
maybe we should just
im finished at three
squash with stan
ill be there
they lie together in the darkness as the feurs finally climax
claire pushes open the door to caitlins room carrying an armful of folded laundry
she moves quickly to the bureau not wanting to spend much time in here then grabs a tiny black top from the pile and drops it into a drawer
shes just about to close it when something catches her eye
she drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered old juilliard t shirt with a very seventies logo from the drawer
claire gazes around the room which is a reliquary of caitlins recently concluded childhood pictures trophies she brings the now faded t shirt to her face and drinks in the
she stares down at the word juilliard
now its on the same t shirt only claires wearing it and shes much younger
its an old photograph in an album
younger norman stands next to her in the shot his arm draped around her waist
a cello case stands beside her
claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner
the cello case
she gazes at other photos
claire in her wedding dress norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow tie
claire and norman in front of a university building
a tiny caitlin rests on her hip
claires chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob
her face streaked with tears claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured rose garden
the yard is surrounded by a high wooden fence
she collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside
suddenly she hears something coming from next door
she cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound
it is ironically the sound of a woman crying
claire makes her way over to the fence
the womens sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered
she places her face against the prickly vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack
all she can make out is a dark blue blur that seems to be rocking
claire gathers her nerve and calls out
theres no reaction
the sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering
the blue shape vanishes from view
wait a minute
i just want something bumps against the fence
claire draws back
she hears heavy breathing
sniffling who are you
from next door
is everything youre the flower lady
ive seen you
from the window
is everything alright
claire leans closer to the tiny crack
she sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye
theres no response just the breathing
she seems on the verge of losing it again
its too much
and i cant
i cant breath
and im afraid
oh god im so afraid of
she trails off
what are you afraid of
i cant no no i cant
claire edges closer to the crack
that ill just
that one day ill just
claires taken aback by this admission
i can help you
how can you help me
with your flowers and your perfect life
its not like that
ive never even met you
and im sorry
ive been consumed with
my daughter left
its for the flowers
why dont you
tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into the feurs driveway
please forget that i
i dont know what im saying
claire listens to the sound of naked footsteps followed by a large front door swinging shut
a car door swings open and a mans shoes follow down the path
claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence as the door closes a second time
she sits there for a moment listening but all is quiet
she sounded terrified
claire and norman eat dinner
a rainstorm pelts the windows
of him i think
did she say that
more or less
honey theyre young
theyre probably newlyweds
im telling you
there was something in her voice
remember how we were
not like this
we were never like this
beat i want to go over there
after dinner we can why
to make sure shes all right
norman puts down his fork
claire honey we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of overlapping thats not what im sug when tonight theyll probably be keeping us awake
but what if something happens
id never be able to live with mysel reassuring nothings going to happen
beat besides i have to work tonight
the conference is in less than two weeks
ive got to stay focused on that for just a little longer
beat this is
its what ive been working for
she glances down at her untouched plate
i just wish you could have heard her
look ill call harvey tomes in the psych department see what i can find out
he gives her a didnt i just say so look
ill make you some coffee
she reaches for his plate to clear it
norman grabs her hand and kisses it
norman snores softly
claire is awakened by the continuing storm
she pads out to normans turreted library
rain pelts the glass
her face is briefly illuminated by the she hears the sound of a door closing and moves to get a better view of the feurs
nothing but blackness
just as shes turning to go back to bed
a lightning flash lights up the night
claires eyes go wide
in the split second of brilliance she sees mr
feur in shirtsleeves drenched dragging a large duffel toward the open trunk of his car
in a hoarse whisper norman
hes dead to the world
she calls to him again
norman you have to look at this
another flash illuminates
norman at her side
an empty driveway then blackness
what is it
whats the matter
she stares down into the darkness
i thought i saw something
is it gone
the beacon illuminates the empty driveway
come on lets go back to bed
yet another bolt of lightning reveals claire still at the window
claire sets up a camera and tripod
she steps back and aims her camera
she glances up at a large upstairs window at the feurs house
one side of the curtain seems to be pulled open but no ones there
feeling self conscious she turns back to the camera
the morning sun hits the flowers just right and she snaps several pictures of them against her lovely house
she glances back at the feurs window
the curtain is now she walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it
when this doesnt work she drags a lawn chair over and peers across the fence
she can barely see over but glimpses a deep furrow in the mud of the driveway
just then a car pulls into the driveway claire scrambles down from her perch
claire walks out to find her best friend jody pretty in her forties wearing hip hippie ish clothes
jody hugs her
how you holding up
why does everyone find that so surprising
are you kidding
only daughter just went away to school
who you were incredibly close with aaand id be tripping
okay im a little tender
so youre human
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club

reaching into her bag i brought you this
she proffers several homemade tea bags
what is it
kambucha mushroom tea
jody it soothes heart ache and promotes psychic wellness
sela suggested i bring youre discussing me with your psychic

claire gives her friend the once over then notices the mint karman ghia behind her
oh my god

beautiful thing alimony
lose a husband get a car
think itll help me pick up dudes
listen ive gotta run
i just thought id stop by and see if you want to take the boat out say thursday morning
you got it
see you then
jody drives off
claire walks down the driveway to her front door and sees mr
feur staring at her from a window
she starts to wave but the curtain is drawn shut
claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the doorknob
a faint rustling can be heard from within
claire quietly opens the door and moves into claire stops inside the door
now it sounds like whispering
two voices tense impassioned
it seems to be coming from normans study
she gathers her nerve then bursts into the room
but the whispering has suddenly stopped
the lovely circular room is completely empty
she looks around puzzled
cooper the familys aging lab casually ambles over
to cooper please tell me you heard that
claire and cooper out on a walk emerge onto large rocks at the waters edge
claire tosses a long stick for cooper who bolts out onto the long wooden dock
claire gazes at the lighthouse across the lake and a long bridge in the distance
cooper starts barking and looking down into the water
claire arrives at coopers side and stares down into the dark water
what do you see
she looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection
after a moment she notices a faint white shape directly in the reflection of her face
cooper rumbles a low growl
the shape seems to be gaining definition
claire gasps quietly then reaches into a pocket in her sweater and pulls out a cordless phone
into phone hi
on the other end im stuck here for another couple of hours
claires smile fades
unless you need me to come home
claire slowly leans out over the water to check her reflection
but the shape is gone
take your time
she clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water
claire sits in a small workroom at a computer
she focuses intently on the screen
its alices computer solitaire
she flips the last card and an animated queen of hearts accompanied by a series of musical notes parades across the screen
on computer you lost
off with your head
claire hits new game and watches as a fresh hand of cyber solitaire is dealt
she suddenly has a thought and disappears into the kitchen
she glances at jodys tea smiles then refills her glass of red wine
she picks up the phone from its cradle and moves into she dials a number
loud reggae can be heard blaring through the phone
straining to be heard hello
im looking for caitlin spencer
well could you check
she plugs one ear
well just tell her that her mother called
excuse me how can you study with that
the noise abruptly stops
claire clicks off the phone and replaces it in the sweater pocket
she tunes the stereo to a classical music station
she walks in places the cordless phone on a base unit then hears a different set of musical notes from the computer
she stares at the screen stunned
the game has been finished
cards with faces swarm chaotically across the screen with the message you win
without warning the radio dial rips cacophonously past several stations and comes to a stop on some angry punkish rock and roll
she bolts around a corner to the stereo
the music is chaotic and deafening
she finds cooper growling at
she turns off the stereo
cooper suddenly bolts down the hall
she follows him
the foyers empty but the front door is open
claire nervously walks out and looks around
no sign of the dog
claire turns to go back inside
when she touches the doorknob she hears the whispering again
a fleeting shadow draws her eye to a coat rack mirror which reflects directly into the study
the whispering stops
claire walks in to find norman surrounded by several grad students
at school hes a very different man pressed shirt and tie hair neatly brushed back
theyre preforming some unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness
she stops by the door to watch him
and then what
an intense asian girl answers
we administer the halothane
she glances at her notes
three point five ccs
andrew from downtown
andrew tall razor thin was waiting for this
an organic neuromuscular blocking agent which when administered in aerosol form temporarily renders the subject immobile
nothing but net
he measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep
prudence heres an old friend
he moves to the sheeps head and strokes it as he nods to courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus
the sheep suddenly goes completely still
norman moves around and begins a brief procedure
i try to stay on her good side because i owe her my career and most of our grant money
he completes the procedure
they look at him blankly
always do unto others as youd have others do unto your ewe
he stops claire
thatll do it
write this up for tuesday
andrew and amy tend to prudence the rest leave
claire moves over to him
norman packs notes and some of the chemicals into a leather case
warm what are you doing here
there were some noises
i didnt want to disturb you
she watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led out of the room
what do you mean
some noises where
in the house
i was scared
did you call the police
can you drive me home
ill bring you back in the morning
he takes her arm
norman pushes open the front door
cooper pads over wagging his tail
they walk together past the stereo into
the living room
all is quiet
they move into
norman checks the window locks
it was there
this angry music all by itself
and i heard whispering
what kind of whispering
i dont know
he nods as cooper appears
whatd you see coop
the dog stares blankly
to cooper tell him
norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes
im gonna have the police check on the house
claire leans against the window sill
oh great can you look in on my wife shes hearing voices
waitll that gets around
he walks over to her
ive got the conference next week
i want you to feel safe
i do i do
im sure im just
how was your day
he goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box in his dresser
think i may have cracked it
she produces a match and lights it
they sit on the bed
i think so
you are so brilliant
madame curie jonas salk norman spencer
smiling you know what that does to me
she takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck
youll never believe
i saw schumway
hes here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department so bob shine introduces us
he nods claire passes the joint back
and he says
youll fucking love this he says doctor spencer i am a great admirer of your work
well thats nice
especially spencers theorem
overlapping oh no
of perpetual distances
beat everybodys checking their shoelaces
im afraid youve mistaken me i say
for my father
im so sorry
didnt know he was dead every stinking paper on the globe
thats just mean
indicating joint oh
jody wanted to know if i could get her some
quickly glancing over did you tell her
with a smile norman you are so funny about that
no i didnt
he takes a little toke then vanishes into the bathroom
cause that would be really she lays back on the bed
sounds of flushing
he reappears without the joint
did you call about the feurs
harvey says the guys a sweetheart
wouldnt hurt a fly
claire ponders this
norman turns off the light and joins her on the bed
he kisses her knee
do the brilliant norman stuff some more
then starts working his way up her thigh
and speak up
claire sits frozen cello between her legs bow hovering in position
after an uncomfortable long pause she touches bow to string drawing in a breath at the power of the sound
claire takes another deep breath then launches into a beautiful and melancholy piece of music
shes very very good
her body begins to sway slightly as her left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck
she reaches a difficult transition and falters
she seems almost surprised
she attacks the transition again and again falters
claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again this time failing completely
she sits back in the chair despondent
almost as an afterthought she sadly drags the bow across strings
at the end of the tone something catches her ear
she can just make out the hint of a faint feminine voice echoing the tone
she sits up and plays a different note then another
each time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct
finally she plays a sharp higher pitched note
the voice echoes with a distinct unsettling shriek
claire walks in and sees insert lying on the floor
a framed newspaper photograph the caption announces that hes being promoted to the distinguished dupont chair in genetics
through the spiderwebbed glass norman can be seen shaking hands with an older academic hugging a smiling claire to his side
claire kneels down to gather the picture
a single shard of glass is missing
she finds it a foot away by a distinctive knot in the wood floor
she notices a copper glint in the point of glass but when she moves it its gone
she places the pieces of broken glass on the frame and stands
out of the window directly in front of her sees mr
feur removing a dirt covered shovel from his trunk
she glances down at the picture then back up at mr
feur who carries the shovel around back
claire wraps up the broken picture
she hears a car door slam and glances out the window in time to see mr
feur driving off
a stiff autumn breeze
claire stands at the fence
she looks through the tiny crack
beat are you there
claire glances down as she walks past the furrow
she looks up at the house which seems quite placid then slowly heads around back
she takes in the lake view from the large porch
the wind is really blowing
her eye catches on something
propped against the back door
claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it then knocks at the back door
theres no answer
she knocks again
shes turning to go then the door swings open
the smile fades from claires face
the immense mr
feur filling the doorway
im running late here
i just came back for my briefcase
well i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh to the neighborhood
im claire spencer
from next door
this really isnt a good time
he starts to close the door
well maybe your wife
growing cold she isnt here
when will she be back
i dont know
i have to go
and claire is staring at a closed door
what do you mean shes gone
claire and jody knife slowly through the water in the spencers sailboat heading back toward the dock the old lighthouse the bride in the background
shes not there
i havent seen her since that morning
well i mean ive never actually seen her but im telling you shes disappeared
jody finishes securing a line
the breeze is mild so they just cruise with the wind
what are you saying
claire just looks at her
you think he killed her
i dont know
when you say it it sounds crazy
but what else could it all be
jody shakes her head
i mean hes so kind of grim and daunting and she sounded terrified of something
claire glances over at jody
laughing to herself listen to me
i sound like some middle aged nancy drew
jody regards her
after a beat know what i think
just bought this beautiful antique ouija
thats all i need
jody shrugs have it your way
claires house across the lake
a figure in the turreted window of normans study
in the window
normans at work
claire looks over at jody
in the study
dont you see she looks again nothing
im losing it
no youre not
beat but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly
claire stares back at the house
claire walks in and sets down some packages
she opens one and pulls out new toothpaste and
an envelope the kind your pictures come back in
she absently leafs through them then freezes
she gapes at one of the shots
claire turns off the lights and crouches down
she raises a pair of binoculars
claire rakes the binoculars across the feurs house
past their car parked in front until she finds a light on the tall powerfully built mr
feur walks into the room and sits by himself at the dining room table which is set for one
he eats a tv dinner slowly chewing and staring straight ahead
he sips from a can of beer
a hand grabs claires arm
she lets out a screech and turns to see norman standing beside her
what are you doing
she glances back out the window and sees mr
feur standing at the window paging the curtain
she squats down pulling norman with her
shrill whisper get down
also whispers whats going on claire
she peers over the sill in time to see mr
feur turning away from the window
she takes norman by the hand and leads him downstairs
she leads norman in
still whispering why am i
full voice why am i whispering in my own house
he killed her
shes in the picture
i went over to look and shes gone
the table was set for one
and that means he murdered his wife
this is getting ridic no no no no
the soil on the shovel his shovel
its not from here believe me i
frustrated she grabs the photos all right look at this
she triumphantly thrusts one before him
norman looks at it
in the window
she points out a hazy figure in the turreted window of the study
norman takes it over to the light
its a flare
from the sun
its a reflection on the glass
im telling you
she whispered and turned on the music
shes trying to contact me
making sure hes got it its a ghost
norman shakes his head
he looks again at the picture does a quick calculation
you took this in the morning didnt you
she nods slightly
when the sun would be exactly right
shes got him
then why isnt it in any of the other pictures
she thrusts the batch at him
he peruses the other few shots of the garden
a cloud passed
or its a bounce off the lake
he might not be wrong
where is she then
she could be out
she could be sick in bed for all we know
ill bet theres
look at this
she leads him out of the room
claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly
what am i looking at
indicating completed solitaire game i didnt do that
and why is she here
if he killed her why doesnt she haunt him
she was lonely i talked to her
norman i know how it looks but claire listen to me
i know youre under some strain
but theres no such thing as ghosts
they dont exist
our neighbor did not kill his wife and i
wait why arent you dressed
with stan and his new girl
what do you mean
claire we talked about it
you didnt want japanese i said our first date since
she seems confused oh
you dont remember this
were going to be she looks at his watch
fashionably five minutes late
she bolts up the stairs
they drive across the bridge
concerned exasperated when you do this i swear
overlapping dont get all
like it never even happened
okay okay im sure that i just
he pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number
what are you doing
let them know were running late
the phone flashes
youre not at the center
overlapping i know im not at the center of the bridge
were going to be fine
they near the far side of the bridge
norman looks down at the cell phone which now reads roam
he presses a button
there we go
well thats a relief
he shoots her a look
a cozy candlelit italian place in town
claire and norman arrive at the table
the chair next to him is empty
he kisses her cheek
sorry were late
too earnest it was my fault
she greets stan a friendly looking man in his forties
we just got here
claire flashes a semi playful look back at norman
wheres the new squeeze
a voice speaks out from behind her
here i am
claire turns to find a tall elegant brunette standing behind her
the womans face registers some shock
id like you to meet
the two women embrace then beam at each other
to norman we know each other
several empty wine bottle decorate the table
we had this finnish conductor aki laki something
he had these ridiculous bangs
and hed sweep them off with his baton every minute or so and it drove us insane remember
he looked like one of the monkees
anyway claire slept with him
i didnt sleep with him
just so she could cut them off
he was so pissed
i came in from my room
interjecting we were suite mates
and theres this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish
they dissolve into giggles
norman and stan smile
to stan i made an honest woman out of her
elena puts her hand on claires
to stan you should have heard her play
we both auditioned for the philharmonic
one cello position open
do we have to
and i kicked ass
my best stuff
then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition
and i cried
shes making this up
couldnt pick up my cello for weeks
elena looks at claire then smiles
she got it
beat turned it down
i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night
claire puts her arm around norman
and three months later i was married
he squeezes her hand
claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to her ear and a cup of jodys special tea
she sniffs it and makes a face as she turns on the computer
after several rings a girl picks up on the other end
on phone caitlin
overlapping can you hang up
im trying to make a call
the line goes dead
claire hits redial and gets
a busy signal
she clicks the phone off as the computer boots up
claire puts the phone down and starts a game of alices solitaire
she turns a card and waits
gee thats tricky
sure could use some help
she waits the cursor blinks benignly
she walks into the room and notices steam wafting from the cracked bathroom door
claire enters the steamy bathroom
the tub is nearly overflowing with water
she squats down to drain the tub
she stops feeling watched then slowly peers behind her
no ones there
claire reaches toward the water to yank the plugs chain then freezes
in the bathwaters still reflection she see a pretty young blond standing beside her
startled she pops up and slams into the shower head
claire collapses over the side of the tub her head dipping underwater
a small cloud of red surrounds her
moments later an arm wraps around her
claires pov a face sharpens into focus hovering above her
claire sits on the bed
norman dabs the blood from a tiny cut on the back of her head
i dont need a shrink
gently harvey says hes amazing
what can it hurt to talk to someone
she goes to her dresser and gets a prescription bottle and starts to open it
norman gently places a hand on her arm
she shoots him a look
and puts the pills down
gently claire shes been a huge part of your life for seventeen years
if you werent thrown off balance by this then something would be wrong
i never said i wasnt upset
of course im upset
i miss her terribly
but i know what i saw and what i heard
and it wasnt some symptom of something
i never said
and i dont think im some lonely middle aged woman cracking up
are you lonely
and i dont need a psychiatrist
claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in her lap arms crossed
a smooth mellifluous baritone whos idea was it
she trails off
camera slowly pulls back to reveal dr
timothy drayton a stocky light skinned black man in his late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes
i didnt want to come
then why did you
because he was worried about me
beat im sure hes hoping youll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace
do you really think so
theres a pause
why is he worried
because i dont know because sometimes
sometimes i forget things
and ever since caitlin left ever since my daughter left for school thereve been
i fainted and
beat why is this so hard
drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny red fireballs next to his chair
he proffers it to claire
he shakes his head
she shrugs then grabs one and pops it into her mouth
its hard because im a complete stranger and what were talking about is incredibly personal
besides the first time most people come here a part of them is wondering if im gonna think theyre crazy
she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods
dont worry im required to have at least three sessions in order to commit
her eyes get a little wider
now thats a joke
she manages an unsteady smile
i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life one of which you may or may not be experiencing
if you want to get some stuff off your chest great
he smiles and shrugs no problem
she stares at him for a moment
re fireball these are good
she studies him for a moment
theres a ghost in my house
he nods slightly as if shes told him i have some anxiety
claire goes on
she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio
she likes rock and roll
angry rock and roll
how do you know its a she
i saw her in the water
she was filling the bathtub
what does she look like
shes a blond
do you have any idea who she is
id rather not say
what do you think i should do
he thinks for a moment then try to contact her
claire nearly swallows her fireball
try to communicate with her somehow
you think thatll help
and i think its important you find out what she wants
claire ponders this for a moment then looks back up at him
are you humoring me
she seems satisfied by his sincerity
i dont know
my aunt used to use my uncles old pajamas and a candle
claire nods then stands
she smiles too
is this time okay
claire walks in carrying a half empty bottle of wine
she looks over at jody who turns off the lights
jody then strikes a match and lights a large candle
she unveils her carved antique ouija board
sit down here
nervous jokey are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee
jody turns to her deadly serious
isnt this where you saw her
claires smile fades
then this is where shell be
they sit cross legged the board between them
place your fingers on the planchette
jody indicates the wooden pointing device
each woman grasps an edge
in a low voice we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs
to claire whats her first name
i dont know
jody closes her eyes
claire follows suit
i call forth the entity that is haunting this house
they look down at the planchette which hasnt moved
theres still no movement
jody focuses intently
reveal yourself to us
a long moment passes
its starting to seem like a bust
suddenly the candle flares
even jody seems startled
to the spirit who
who are you
at first nothing happens
then slowly the planchette starts to move across the board
are you doing that
jody shakes her head
im not doing that
the planchette comes to rest on the letter m
moments later it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on oh
it starts to drift again moving slowly toward the space between e and f
the planchette stops on f
jody removes her fingers from the device
f is feur
suddenly the candle starts flickering strangely and the shit
jody stumbles backwards gasping
did you see that
claire leans in
to ghost what happened to you
the candle goes out
claire catches up to the completely spooked jody outside the work room
she holds onto her arm
i have to go
coopers growling in the work room
they look in
claire this is
claire transfixed walks in
she stares at the computer screen which is being filled with letters at an amazing speed
she hears the front door swing open
claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the karman ghia tearing out of the driveway
she turns and goes back into the house
she edges into
the picture has once again tumbled from its spot
she drops to her knees over the picture
this time the glass is shattered
when she picks out the remaining shards the newspaper photo slides out
claire glances at the benign news stories on the back
she looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack in the floor boards by the knot
the piece of glass wedged next to what looks like a copper coin in the crack
its too big to be a penny
she tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free but recoils
a tiny drop of blood appears on her finger which she pops into her mouth
still sucking on her finger claire walks in and begins to clean up the remains of the seance
she bends down to pick up the ouija board then stops when she notices that the tub is again full to the brink of overflowing
what do you want
claire peers around frustrated half waiting for a reply
there is only silence
she reaches in to pull the plug nearly scalding her hand
when she turns for a hand towel she finds a message traced into the steamed up mirror she draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom
norman nods to a security guard as he leaves a darkened university building
he sees claire standing at the foot of the steps
what are you doing out here
he killed her
im not crazy
he killed her and this is the feur thing
and hes going to get away with it
normans momentarily speechless
how do you know this
we had a seance
jody and i
and she was there norman she was
it scared jody so bad she had to leave
how did you jody brought a ouija board and we summoned her
he regards her for a moment
are you angry at me
this stops claire in her tracks
maybe you resent how busy ive been
what are you
you know what ive got at stake with this paper
you know that
i cant help but think that youre doing this now to hurt me or to sabotage me somehow
ever since the accident ive been worried that youd been unhappy or
but then youve been so much better
norman this isnt about you
this is something thats happening to me
its not to get even
and its not some warped bid for attention
some strange things are happening in our house whether you believe in them or not
not sweetheart no
i believe in whats happening
i dont want to but i do
i guess i was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you
she turns on a heel and walks toward her car
norman catches up to her as a large crowd is filing out of the concert hall next door
she turns on him
dont tell me how to react
norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk
keep your voice down
i will not
some of the bystanders stop to watch
still loud maybe youre right
maybe im losing my mind
looking around claire please
claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her intensity
but what if im not
what if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her cant move on while thats unresolved
cant you just
something behind him catches her eye
she trails off
claire walks past him toward the parking lot
theres a dangerous energy to her walk
people step out of the way
claire walks past several cars until she sees the one shes after
feur steps out from behind the open trunk of his old buick
walking up you
he looks up at her
you think youre smart dont you
you think you got away clean
well i know you killed her
you drowned her in the bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and im gonna find her you murdering sonofabitch
feur stares dazed through the tirade
norman arrives at her side
scoffing give me that shit
i didnt kill my wife
feur im sorry
over norman then where is she
he stares at both spencers for a moment
then calls past them
claire and norman turn
a blond woman backs out of the passenger seat
its not the face claire has seen
claire looks sucker punched
claire sits back in the chair
she looks drained
a soft rain taps against the windows
and his face
it seemed so gentle and i knew
in that second i knew that id imagined the whole thing
drayton takes this in
she seems genuinely frightened
whats happening to me
well thats what were here for
he watches her calmly some empathy on his face
whether you imagined it or not you actually saw and heard things that frightened you
that gave you reason for concern
your friend saw them
isnt there something called group hysteria
you think you influenced her
i dont know
i just know that when all this was happening i felt some part of me felt
like somebody needed me
and the more i reached out to it the fuller it became
youre saying you willed these events to happen
i dont know im very confused right now
did you ever find out what it wanted
she said you know
that i know
what do you think
claire ponders this
that shed been hurt by someone
beat this is great
im trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my have you been hurt
well in the accident i was injured but
you were in an accident
i drove my car up a tree
nothing serious this
she indicates her scar a minor concussion
but the car looked bad
it could have been bad
i think it scared the hell out of norman
hows your marriage
claires eyes widen
listen dont hold back
drayton smiles kindly
well hes been amazing throughout this whole thing
patient and caring
beat i mean sure he can be obsessed with his work and
its a very important time right now with all that
i mean with everybody right
sometimes its like
she trails off
that he doesnt
see me or you know that im
thats somethings wrong
that cant feel good
no it doesnt
okay look i see what youre doing here and thats im sorry but thats not it
my marriage is fine
ive had some kind of empty nest episode where i saw some things that werent there
lets deal with that
im willing to deal with that
beat i just dont want to go conjuring problems where none exist
claire finishes her tirade
drayton lets her settle for a moment
but you should know that im far less concerned with whether things you saw existed than i am with why you saw them
she takes in the ramifications of that
claires carrying some cuttings into the house
she hears a knock at the gate walks over and opens it to discover
the real one
i wanted to apologize
for scaring you like i did
when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day
and then you werent there
theres an awkward pause
would you like some iced tea
claire leads her toward the house
claire pours mrs
feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher
shes small and delicate looking with big watery eyes
your house is so beautiful
and these roses
theyre much prettier up close
she regards mrs
feur for a moment
she seems skittish and shy
theres something i have to ask you
at the fence
you seemed terrified
i dont think i was imagining that
theres a pause
feur looks down into her lap
what were you so afraid of
youre going to think im crazy or something
a tiny smile
not this week
she looks away for a moment then looks back at claire
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldnt breathe
that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave
i couldnt catch my breath
thats not a metaphor thats
and i panicked
i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there
beat i tried to leave him
went to my mothers in boston
he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home
claire is mesmerized
you must think im pathetic
no i dont
im sorry that i frightened you like that
but i was so touched by your concern
ive been lonely here
beat perhaps we could be friends
claire stares at this strange passionate woman
i would like that
feur smiles at her
claire pulls up in front of a large new york hotel
on a cell phone im pulling up yuri
ill see you for dinner
to claire sure you wont stay
no its fine
tempting her really big bed
she smiles and shakes her head
norman kisses her goodbye then grabs his bag from the backseat
do i have everything
call ya later
he starts to walk into the hotel
and you glad you married me
shes standing next to the car
are you glad
norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand
softly you know i am
she gazes at him then softly you sat in front
i saw you there
norman takes his cue
you were lost in the music
your chest heaving
i felt you
looking through me
we walked all night
you told me that i was
he gently cups her chin in his hand
overlapping that you were everything id ever dreamed of
she smiles kisses him warmly then gets in the car
claire stands outside caitlins columbia dorm watching young lives in motion
claire walks past a number of doors
music booms out of one shards of a conversation out of another
finally she arrives at a door that says fur is murder
she smiles to herself and knocks
theres no answer
claire turns to find an attractive young man standing at her elbow
theyre playing at cbgbs down on bowery
probably wont be back for awhile
you her mom
who was playing
stunned caitlins band
theyre really good
i would have gone but i have a paper
beat and im not just saying that because youre a mother
claire nods slightly
she walks down the hall
claire moves past a huge black skinhead doorman into an entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club
she looks out over the mob of seething young people swaying to a pulsing power pop band
punks and club kids push past her as they move into the throng
she looks up and her face changes
a shaggy trio of musicians on the stage pumping through a jangly but surprisingly melodic song
her eyes race across the faces of a butch female drummer an emaciated guitarist singer and stop on the bass player
she rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line eyes claire is transfixed her face a mix of pride and sadness
the song ends and caitlins eyes open
she smiles for a moment then the smile fades as she spots claire
panicked claire ducks behind a pillar
the last groups of young people file out of the club
a couple of them glance at claire who seems very out of place standing on the bowery late at night
she turns to see caitlin standing before her a bass guitar case on a strap over her shoulder
theres an awkward pause
that was very good
mom im sorry
i wanted to tell you
but it never felt right
caitlin stares at the ground
i didnt want to bring up memories
i didnt want to do anything that might make you regret your choices
claire winces silently
besides dad would have freaked
no he wouldnt
i think playing in a band called bitch might put a dent in the whole perfect family thing
thats not true
yes it is
can we please not do that
cause it is
claire doesnt disagree
he loves you very much
he just i know he does
claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter
are you mad at me
listen to me
the one thing in life that i definitely dont regret
is the choice
i made to be your mother
for a moment claires got her little girl back
her eyes well up
i miss you
laughing it got so bad your father almost had to put me away
what do you mean
i started seeing things
claire stares at her daughter
but once i heard
beat i thought i was crazy
quietly then we both are
a large cocktail party
the house is crowded with professors administrators and their spouses
president templeton a frosty haired avuncular chap greets them with his wife a sharp looking woman in her late fifties
there they are
you remember my wife claire
shaking hands of course
you must be so proud
to norman everyones very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity
she takes their coats
dean templeton leads them in
mustve been some paper
your father would be very proud
this seems to strike a nerve
claire notices this and squeezes his hand
templeton leads norman into a large living room which is filled with colleagues
several of them turn and begin clapping
others follow suit
claire stands at a small bar
to bartender white wine please
she scans the party and spots the feurs deep in some intimate conversation with each other
shes speaking about something astonishing
claire locates norman in a corner listening as some aged alumnus holds forth
he sees her and mouths im sorry
he points to his watch and flashes five fingers
she smiles and nods
guess im not much of a medium
she turns to see jody
are you okay
i think so im sorry for leaving but i mean jesus claire
i mess around with this stuff but i never thought anything would happen
claire looks uncomfortable
does norman know
jody shes alive
i met her
shes really sweet
then what was it
it wasnt anything
ive been on edge lately
maybe since the accident
and id prefer i really would to just something was there
you saw it
now i talked to sela and theres a guy this pakistani guy down in hartford
and hes the real thing
specializes in cases like this like yours
jody listen to me
you have to listen to me
this is not something that i can do right now
whatever it was its gone
i need it to be gone now
but claire please
jody recognizes her fragility
ive got to find a bathroom
ill call you
jody nods as claire walks off
claire stands in the spacious powder room checking her makeup in the mirror
templeton enters from the bathroom
howre you holding up
its a lovely party
the two women fix their makeup side by side in the mirror
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished
its good to see you two doing so well
claire looks confused
i know how hard it can be sometimes
claire turns to her
what can be
well i dont think ive seen you since the reception at dean ackermans last year
claires still in the dark
for the dupont chair
off claires look i swear
im becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst
im just not sure what you mean
there was just
you were upset
i remember being concerned
at the party
toward the end
recovering ohhh yes
just a little you know
well im glad
pardon my intrusiveness but we do have to stick together you know
claire looks into the mirror
what was it about
claire and norman walk toward the car
you dont remember
when she said it there was something familiar
he looks at her for a moment
you dropped a glass
a cheap wine glass from the caterers
you started crying
i tried to comfort you
somethings triggered in the living room
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio
i took you home
i cant understand how i could just completely it was maybe a week after the accident
we were moving
it was a hard time
but i dont remember
sweetheart it was over a year ago
whats wrong with me
he stops takes her shoulders gently
nothing at all
its been a hard year
but youre better now
and things are really looking up for us
so lets try to enjoy that
she thinks for a beat
thats what i want
she takes his hand and kisses it
claire walks up to the door
when she touches the knob she hears
she opens the door and moves into the same intense whispered exchange
she glances into the mirror and sees
shapes moving bodies a flash of silver
she turns the corner and again
no ones there
she walks in and stands before the repaired photograph of herself and norman
at the party for the dupont chair
she takes it from the wall stares at it for a moment then smashes it on the edge of the desk
she extricates the picture from the broken glass
the caption reads dr
norman spencer being awarded the distinguished dupont chair in genetics by dean of sciences torvald ackerman
she stares at the picture for a moment then flips it over and scans the stories on the back
one tells of a hotly contested city council race another contains details of a large alumni donation to the university
she notices the bottom corner of another story she hadnt noticed before
its only a small portion of one column but it seems to detail the search for a missing girl
claire online logs onto a missing persons website
she narrows her search to new england
a screen pops up with a list of names
she scrolls down the list until she finds
frank madison elizabeth
claire double clicks on it then waits breathlessly as a blurry cyber photo fills the screen
slowly higher resolution moves down the image
under the photo is the legend claire stares at the familiar face then shakily hits print
claire is staring down at the girls face on the print out
on phone she was practically a townie
grew up in bradford
and she was never found
on phone nah
she was a live wire
had this old mustang fastback
its gone too
most of her friends think shes tooling around mexico somewhere
police downgraded her to a runaway
thank you mr
she glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo
by neil mccann mccann
she hangs up
norman is unpacking notes and chemicals from his leather bag
claire walks in
she places the printout on his desk
he takes a long look at it
is this that girl from last year
did you know her
norman looks again
i may have seen her on campus
beat im afraid to ask what this is about
solemnly its her
this is the woman who ive seen
norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window
i thought it was mrs
feur but its not
quietly overlapping stop
im positive this time
overlapping please stop
its madison fra claire falls silent norman turns from the window
calmly claire ive tried to be there
i know youre going through something that i cant understand
but its enough
claire looks down
do you want to go see someone
should we call dr
she shakes her head
well then what
tell me what i can do
claire looks up then timidly holds out the printout
normans jaw tightens
i dont want to make you angry
but shes here
and i dont know why
he silently walks out of the room
claire stares down at the face in the photo
claire parks in front of a small clapboard house in a neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own
she gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch
claire rings the bell
a drawn looking woman in her early fifties answers the door
id like to talk to you about madison
you know where she is
no i dont
please leave me alone
she starts to close the door
claire leans forward
shes my friend
the woman stops
ive been away for awhile
when i came back
she studies claire
whats your name
she never mentioned you
claire doesnt know what to say to this
then again she didnt say much about her college friends
she gives claire the once over
im watchin my shows
she motions claire in
claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room
frank serves up a mug of coffee
a soap plays silently on an old rca
just plain old coffee
none of that mocha nonsense
she sizes claire up
you look a little old for a student
we met at a party
sounds about right
never understood how a girl that wild got all as
sure didnt get it from me
they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young
maddie wouldnt hear about it
she never mentioned her father
well she wouldnt
he left when she was twelve
never spoke about him after that
theres a silence
frank stares at the tv
dont need the sound
you can pretty much tell whats happening by the faces
turn it up sometimes though
feels like someones here
claire doesnt know what to say
frank turns to her
why are you here
i dont know
its like that
doesnt seem real
beat cops say shell be back
i just wanna know what happened
claire stares at this tough tragic woman
wanna see her room
claire enters the room
her face freezes
several posters for alternative and metal bands side by side with academic plaques and awards
she wanted to stay close
you must have been very proud
claire moves along looking at pictures
some with different men others with rough looking friends
claire stops at a picture tucked into a mirror
madison singing at a recital of some kind
shes lovely with striking green eyes
around her neck is a distinctive silver necklace with a perfectly wrought silver rosebud
such a pretty voice
surprised she didnt major in music
beat thats the last picture
a phone rings in the hallway
claires eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror the reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin board
she turns and moves over to a short blond braid
she reaches out to touch it
claire hears footsteps
frank leans back into the room
theyre calling me in to work
i should be going anyway
frank walks claire out
yhear anything youll let me know
claire walks to her car
she turns and calls out what was her major
she wanted to be a doctor
claire stands frozen as mrs
frank disappears into the little house
claire shuts the blinds then places the large candle on the floor then places the missing girl printout at the base of the candle
on top if it she places the braid
then claire lights the candle puts the braid on the picture and hunches over it whispering intensely i need to know the truth
she waits a beat
she looks around at the seance props
she stands and places her hands on the sink
she glances at herself in the mirror
what am i doing
suddenly her head droops over she shudders softly
when she looks back into the mirror her eyes are a deep green
she hears the front door open downstairs
a strange smile creeps across her face
pov gliding down the stairs and into
the refrigerator door is open
norman is leaning over
only his ass protrudes
norman closes the refrigerator door and sees claire standing before him stripped down to a skirt and slip top
theres a different physicality to her movements
a different rhythm to her speech
she shakes her head
she takes the apple
got a problem with that
then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room
norman finds claire seated on his desk her legs spread
i take it your not mad at me
wouldnt go that far
she grabs his belt and pulls him into her then holds the apple to his mouth
norman tentatively takes a bite
she mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly
mouth full okay
when he chews the huge bite a glistening drop of juice runs down his chin
claire leans forward and licks it off
whats gotten into you
she just smiles mischievously then starts kissing him
it looks like shes eating his lips
normans getting hot
she bites down on a lip
whats the matter
its too rough
something about this response frightens him
claire yanks normans belt open
he steps back tripping over his castered desk chair
shes on top of him in a flash sitting astride him
she speaks in a forceful sexy whisper
i dont like this this
pinning his hands above his head why dont you shut up and fuck me professor
she grinds up against him
suddenly something pulls her eye to the hallway
pov the coat rack mirror now from inside the study
in its reflection another claire shorter hair stunned expression
where shes standing
claire leans over him until theyre nose to nose
tense whisper i think shes starting to suspect something
through clenched teeth who
leaning down your wife
norman shoves her off of him onto the floor
he stands breathless
what the hell are you doing
in a moment its claire again stunned and trembling against the wall
to herself remembering you know
she looks up
i was there
claire flooding back to her i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her
in my house
i snuck back to my car trying to convince myself it never happened
and when i woke up in the hospital
somehow it hadnt
he just stares at her his face anguished
it was last year
we were having troubles
so you fucked a student
reaching for her thats not what im sayi pulling back dont touch me
just get away from me
norman doesnt move
hes never seen her like this
she bolts toward the living room
he follows her
she grabs her coat
welling up claire please dont
what did you think i would do
i gave up my life and my music
i never asked you to quit
you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife perfect family
he follows her as she searches for her purse and keys
thats not true
you wanted to quit
and then when you did you hated me for it
so you gave it all to her
she wheels on him with fury
leave her out of this
and then out of nowhere some bright young woman found me attractive
would do anything just to be around me
and i slipped
god help me i slipped
im not going to listen to this
claire goes to leave norman blocks her path
i tried to break it off
you should have tried harder
seething get out of my way
she brushes past him
he catches up beside himself
claires nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst
she turns at the door and looks back
you made it impossible for me to be someone you could be in love with
norman rumpled and unshaven is passed out on the couch a half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table
he awakens to find claire sitting across from him
i want you to answer one question
did you have anything to do with her disappearance
claire goes pale
she was damaged and unstable
the more i tried to distance myself the more desperate she became
finally she showed up at the new house
how did she know where it was
he stares off
the reality sinks in for claire
softly our dream house
norman can hardly look at her
she was out of control
she said she was going to kill herself
i never thought shed go through with any of it but then she was gone
he trails off
she did it
we dont know that for sure
of course she did norman
what else could it be
the enormity of this hits norman
his head drops into his hands
oh god what have i done
how could i have let this into our lives
he looks up at her teary
i dont know
she gets up and walks out of the room
an old industrial loft filled with finished and half finished oil paintings
jody brings claire some tea
and everything i have everything i thought my life was
christ when i think of all the lies
jody looks down
beat jody what
jody looks up tears in her eyes
i was down in adamant
artsy little village down seven
theres a guy there who sells my work
i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car
i saw norman sitting at this little cafe
claire waits for her to continue
i started to walk over
but he wasnt alone
i only caught a glimpse
she was young
beat i should have said something right away
but i didnt
partly because i didnt want to hurt you
partly because i was relieved
i had just been left by richard
i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason it made me feel better that your life wasnt as perfect as it seemed
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you stan called from the hospital and it was too late
jody it was an accident
on a two lane road
with a ton of valium in your system
claire walks over to a window
i got there first
stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman
he seemed desperate not to lose you
he promised to handle it
and we all let it drop away
all of us
im a terrible friend
how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldnt even tell myself
what are you going to do
i dont know
if she was dangerous before she could have hurt me if she wanted to
you dont know that
beat if its your belief that gives her form then youve got to shut her out
somehow you have to break the connection
she wanted me to know the truth
now that i do
i think shes at peace
jody isnt as sure
claire walks in
she notices the clock on the range is dark
she flips on a light
worried she heads upstairs
the bed is empty
the shower is running in the bathroom
her face a mask of terror
the bathtub with the shower curtain drawn around it the water blasting
normans limp hand pokes through the curtain
an electric cord leads from the mirror socket into the tub
claire races over and rips the plug from the wall
she tears the shower curtain away to find a bluish norman lying unconscious in the tub
she hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a heartbeat
claire shakes him to no effect
she slaps him on the face
once then twice
he suddenly sucks in a gulp of air begins struggling and dazedly returns to life
sobbing she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to pull him upright
she discovered her blowdryer in the tub and hurls it across the room
claire sits beside norman on the bed as two e
s an old guy and a heavy woman pack up
stans on the phone jody off to one side
vitals are good
id take it easy for a couple of days
s leave as stan hangs up
theyll take you for a cat scan tomorrow if youre feeling dizzy at all
that wont be necessary
he glances at claire as he walks stan out
not unless theres a miracle drug for clumsiness
jody she tried to kill him
i cant believe this is happening
we need help
please let me call the medium
that could take days
i need to do something now
dont you see
she wants us dead
jody thinks for a moment
you opened this door
theres got to be a way that you can close it
i have an idea
but i mean im just making this up
what is it
claires staring down at the printout
shes kneeling at the edge of the dock
from her pocket she produces the blond braid and a piece of twine
she wraps the braid up in the printout with a rock and secures it with the twine
better or worse hes mine
she tosses the little parcel into the dark water
bubbles stream up
in the bubbles claire sees
the pale shape which slowly becomes the drowned girl staring up from beneath the dark water
claire wants to pull away but shes transfixed
madison reaches up toward the surface
as the bubble diminish she seems to be fading away
when shes gone claire reaches out toward the water
when her finger touches the surface
shes sucked down into the water
norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off the dock
he races out of the room
claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her deeper into the murky depths
norman sprints toward the dock
as he oxygen begins to run out claire screams desperately as her hand plunges into the muddy bottom
suddenly shes released
she yanks her hand free the silt swirls revealing
a copper colored glint in the mud
normans hand grasps claires ankle and pulls her upwards
norman helps claire coughing onto the dock
they hold each other
are you okay
she nods catching her breath
we have to get out of here
cant you see shes trying to kill us
she cant be here without me
how can you be sure
i dont know but i am
she was there and then she was gone
i felt it
she stares into the still water
claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her
norman walks in with some steaming mulled cider
he stokes the blazing fire
he sits on the edge of the bed
i know its going to take awhile before things are back
until theyre better than before
but youve given us a chance to make a fresh start
and im going to spend the rest of my life making you glad that you did
the gaze at each other
tentatively she places a hand on his
claire dressed in a warm sweater finishes wrapping her rosebushes for the winter
she picks up a basket of clipped flowers and heads inside
she turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering
all is quiet
she looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the lake behind it
claire places the roses in a vase on normans desk and in doing so accidentally knocks it over
with a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the wooden floor
the stream has flowed over to the knot and dripped into the crack
claire stares down at the strange she grabs a letter opener from normans desk and pries the coin out
its actually a small brass key the head of which is three interlocking circles
she stares at it for a moment then places it in her pocket
claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset
the leaves on the surrounding hills are stunning
norman appears beside her
last sail of the year
she gazes out
we should take a drive before theyre gone
spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast
look for antiques
theres some great places nearby
a reflex adamant
little village down seven
supposed to be charming
do you know it
dont think so
maybe we can stop there for lunch
he wraps an arm around her
whatever youd like
she leans against him staring out
jody and claire return from a walk
norman has the boat on the trailer and is securing a tarp over it
they stop under a tree
but he acted like hed never heard of it
did he say that
jody he was lying
what if he was
do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when youre trying to make a new start
i guess not
hes trying to put it behind him claire
you should too
norman smiles and waves
they wave back as they arrive at the karman ghia
youve got a beautiful life
and even with this its always been clear that he loves you
beat ive come to think thats all that really matters
i dont know
trust me claire
you hear something
change the subject
you find something
get rid of it throw it in the lake
beat you know what happened
the rest is only details
and no ones ever glad they got a hold of those
if you want to put this back together
just let it go
jody drives off
claire walks over to norman
she hugs him tightly
whats that for
im cooking you dinner
you dont have to do that
ill do the shopping
she heads to the volvo
claire is approaching a country market
she spots a little sign with an arrow adamant mi
she hesitates for a moment then take the turn
claire stands on a street in the quaint little village
she looks around spots a little cafe with outdoor tables
a friendly old hippie woman walks out of a store
she watches claire gazing around
what are you looking for
i dont really know
know what you mean
she ambles off across the street
claire watches her go
then notices a sign hung out above a little shop
three interlocked circles
she walks toward it
claire stands in front of the store window
a sign in the window identifies it as the sleeping dog hand wrought jewelry and gifts
claire tries to open the door but sees a closed sign
she steps back out to the window and looks in
on display are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios
suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an intricate rosebud
her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display where she spots a small ornate copper chest
protruding from its lock
the interlocked circles
claire looks like shes been punched
claire glances over at the soundly sleeping norman
she gingerly slides out of bed
claire sits among the boxes leafing through the photo album tracking the years of their life
her hands tremble
finally she reaches the picture of their wedding reaches behind the photo and produces
claire in her nightgown and a jacket walks slowly down the dock
an expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path
she stops and stares out at the moonlit lake
she holds out a fist
her fingers unfold and in her palm lies the key
she holds the key out over the water and stands there frozen
the lighthouse beam sweeps past her once
claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest then carefully places it on the dock
she very deliberately takes off her jacket and slippers steps to the edge of the dock shines the flashlight on the dark water
then steps off the dock
an anguished cry from downstairs
norman bolts upright in bed
norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit room
he pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting closed on his desk
he looks around sees the room is empty and walks over to it
the mud and silt has been wiped from the top on which is engraved to n
with love always m
he pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside
claire stands in the doorway holding out the silver rosebud looking for this
norman stares at her dumbly
shes out there isnt she
shes in the lake
you dont understand what this is
dont i norman
you kept the fucking necklace
of a woman you killed
nearly hysterical i did not
i did not kill anyone
claire listen to me
i walked in and she was lying there dead
i swear to you
on my life
she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me
to destroy us
if i hadnt stopped by here before school the painters would have i dont believe you
you have to believe me
oh god im telling you the truth
beat fighting tears i did what i had to claire
she was gone
there was nothing i could do for her
i put her in the lake
i rolled the car in
and i watched it sink
beat and ive lived with that image ever since
beat i couldnt just stand there while everything my career us everything just washed away
dont you see claire
shes doing this
this is exactly what she wants you to think
claires lip is quivering with confusion
i dont know whats true anymore
beat but that girl must be brought up
now do you want to call the police
or should i
norman stares at the phone
hes a wreck
i cant live with it anymore
he takes the phone punches in three numbers waits
this is dr
no its not an emergency
he looks at claire
i have some information about a missing girl madison frank
could you send an officer
fifteen willoughby about a mile before the bridge
he hangs up
they look at each other
you did the right thing
beat im going to get cleaned up
he walks out
claire walks over and stands before the box
claire walks into the bedroom
the shower can be heard through the bathroom door which is partially ajar
steam drifts out through the crack
she stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her weary distraught countenance in the mirror
she glances down
the necklace still in her hand
she looks up again into the mirror
her face goes strangely blank and almost mechanically she clasps the necklace onto her neck
suddenly she stares over at the cordless phone lying on the bed for a long moment
she walks over picks up the phone and looks at it
the redial button
she stares at the bathroom door then hits the button
two rings then on phone directory assistance
claires eyes widen in terror
she clicks off the phone and taking it with her starts moving toward the door to the hall
she keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom
she quietly pulls open the hallway door
suddenly a hand with a washcloth is thrust over her face
claire shoves normans hand away and runs past him down the hall
shes nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to falter
she tumbles over dropping the phone which clatters down the stairs before her
claire is pulling herself down the stairs moaning in terror
norman can be seen calmly following her waiting for the halothane to take its full effect
finally she freezes
norman picks up the phone and stands over her
god how did we come to this
he picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her slowly up the stairs
the ghost stuff that was impressive
i figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing
that would be pretty astonishing
a passive aggressive masterpiece
and into the bathroom
wasnt until the shower that i realized you actually believed it
nearly froze to death waiting for you
thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and id be toast
then shes lowered into the tub
the crazy thing is
i have never for one moment stopped loving you
he actually wipes a tear from his eye
he kisses her lips
we can feel her revulsion
his face over her
dont worry about caitlin
im sure in some tragic way thisll bring us closer together
he turns on the faucets then moves out of her line of vision
sound of a number being dialed
hey its norman
listen we had a huge blowout so im going down to sleep at the lab
i guess youre out but
if you wouldnt mind stopping by to check on her in the morning
she glances down and sees on the edge of the tub
a prescription bottle of valium with her name on the label
her eyes go wide
jody its bad
ive never seen her like this
he trails off choking up i dont really know what to do anymore
norman lit periodically by the sweep of the light house beacon squats with the phone and gazes down at her
if anything ever happened to her id
beat anyway thanks
claire mute glances frantically around
one of her fingers begins to flutter
tearfully im so sorry
the tub is rapidly filling
he checks his watch then reaches for the valium
as much from will as the drug beginning to fade claire lets out a garbled cry
sloppy guttural mmmuh
norman seems unnerved that shes still clinging to her belief in the ghost
thats a little much dont you think
he sees the necklace on her neck
cant have that
he puts down the bottle of valium then reaches around claires neck to remove the necklace
when his hands close on the clasp his face suddenly goes slack
his arms around madisons beautiful corpse
norman explodes backwards slamming his head into the brass shower nozzle
he staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud
the water finally rises above claires nostrils
claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free
the water slowly descends
when it seems that her lungs must burst her mouth finally clears the descending water
she chokes in great gulps of air
the drug is finally wearing off
claire sits up
normans unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway
she turns off the water and stands unsteadily
she looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under norman
she delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket only to discover that its been broken by his fall
she drops it and walks quietly out of the room
claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs
she fumbles for some keys in a basket by the door then looks at the cell phones recharging cradle
she spots normans coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles through the pockets
she finds the phone and flips it open to see if its working
a drop of something splats on the phone
she looks up and sees norman his forehead gashed glaring down from the landing
she reaches for the door knob but the keys and cell phone in her hand make it difficult to open
norman hurls himself over the banister
a bloody hand yanks her backwards
claire slams into the corner by the armoir
norman advances on her
at the last moment she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles over on norman
claire races over to the volvo which is blocked by normans pickup the dark hulk of the sailboat on a trailer behind it
she starts to get into the pickup then remembers to look in the bed
the truck is cold and doesnt want to turn over
she stares at the door for signs of norman
and vroom the truck roars to life
claire spews gravel as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway constantly watching the door
when she veers to the right out of the driveway she looks into the rear view mirror
the boat momentarily blocks the open door then clears
claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two lane road
shivering with cold and adrenalin she tries to work the ancient heater
she turns onto the bridge
the pickup and boat race across the deserted bridge
claire through the windshield
her face striped by the reflection of the bridge lights which whip one by one across the windshield
she flips open the cell phone and punches in
it blinks no service
she glances into the rear view mirror
a stern section of the boats covering tarp untied flapping in the breeze
claire desperately punches the talk button again
shes past the center of the bridge
she looks again roam
claire punches the talk button again
a trailer crank punches through the window
normans arm follows coiling like a python around claires neck his grim visage pressed against the glass
she squashes down the accelerator
the trailer starts to weave from side to side swerving the pickup
claire chokes then blacks out
the pickup and trailer smash through the railing barreling over bumpy terrain straight toward the boat ramp
the truck hits the water at fifty and norman is hurtled through the rear window and into the passenger side dashboard
claire is unconscious in the drivers seat a trickle of blood runs from her nose
norman stirs briefly as claire groggily comes to
she hears the hissing of the smashed radiator then sees norman a shattered bloody mess on the floor of the cab
she leans over to see if hes dead hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup with the battered sailboat and trailer miraculously still attached is rolling deeper into the
before she can get the door open the truck is half submerged
she frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out
her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks onto her ankle and yanks her inside
norman pulls her down until theyre face to face
she yanks the emergency brake but its too late
the submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp
the truck is nearly submerged
desperately norman please
the water is up to the windows
norman shakes his head slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes
think of caitlin
water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and momentarily blinds norman
claire jerks free and scrambles out of the drivers side window as the truck sinks
just as shes free of the window she jerks to a stop
she looks down and sees norman half out of the window one hand clamped onto her ankle
there is a wrenching metallic creak
the truck lurches downward
it doesnt sink
the boat buoys it like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake
the headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater drop off
claire tries to swim free but normans not letting go
suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer
it hurtles downwards and the still glowing headlights reveal
when the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car the mustangs windshield shatters
a pale shape floats norman is suddenly entangled by something
he tries to brush it free but comes face to face with madisons ghastly decomposed face
the last of his air bellows out of him in a scream as he releases claires ankle
his dead staring face separates from madisons as the truck slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom
claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air
the sound of a furious cello solo
norman half out of the truck arms floating
follow his eyes to the pale corpse drifting above tethered to the mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle
move through the murky water toward the corpses clothed back
as she twists into view
morphs into madisons pale beautiful face
camera drifts moves upward and breaks the surface as the distant lights of emergency vehicles approach
filled with moist earth
a hand tosses the clump of dirt onto
widen to reveal claire dressed in black stepping away from the grave
a tiny arm snakes around her waist
she glances down to see caitlin her eyes shining clasping her mother tightly
claire takes a last look into the grave
rest in peace
mother and daughter turn and step back
next to them also in black is mrs
racing across the neck of a cello
the solo continues and now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped claire before
claire her hair short and sexy eyes tightly shut brow beaded with sweat
the piece builds to a dark passionate crescendo
her eyes remain shut for a moment then flutter open
a new york apartment the glimmering skyline visible through a large window
cooper gazes up attentively
claire sips a glass of wine her face unsmiling but serene
