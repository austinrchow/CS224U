screenplay by david lynch blue skies
pan slowly down to clean white picket fence with beautiful red roses in front of it
birds chirp in the distance
a faint sprinkler sound is heard
very sweet music is playing
a songbird sings in the tree
a very clean uniformed smiling policeman with arms outstretched allows clean happy school children to cross the street safely
a bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street
we move in to see the happy face of a fireman
yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze
the same white picket fence with roses in front of it
panning slowly now away from the roses down to the rich green lawn and over to the sprinkler which goes around and around shooting water droplets sparkling in the light
this is slightly slow motion and dreamy
closer on water droplets
the water droplets are somewhat abstracted as they dance in the light
pan down now to the green grass traveling along the grass
the music becomes fainter as we move suddenly under the grass now as if in a dark forest
the grass is like great timbers
it is getting darker and ominous sounds come up as we discover black insects crawling and scratching in the darkness
beaumont is watering flowers and grass with the hose
he is dressed in khaki trousers canvas shoes old white shirt straw hat and dark glasses
watches his watering then looks up
the sky and the neighborhood are reflected in his dark glasses
he moves his false teeth around a little in his mouth jutting out his chin in the process
hes thinking about who knows what
he looks back down at his lawn
the water hits the grass and mats it down
moves the hose over a bush and gets a kink in it
water stops coming out of the nozzle and there is a loud hissing noise of water under pressure
loud hissing noise
beaumont goes around the bush and is undoing the kink when he is suddenly hit with a tremendous seizure
hes doubling over and falls to the ground
he continues to grasp onto the hose
water shoots crazily onto the driveway and his car
beaumont seems to be in tremendous pain
beaumont is curled up on the couch smoking a cigarette and watching t
its a daytime soap
takes a big drag of her cigarette and luxuriously french inhales a huge quantity of blue smoke
shes enjoying her show
his teeth are crooked in his mouth now as he tries to scream
no sound is coming out
water sound is loud
water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into the yard beyond
a small boy gregg appears wearing only white underpants and a white t shirt
he holds a large red popsicle
gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show
he holds his hand out to get it wet in the spray
this makes him screw up his face in a laugh
he waddles over and looks at mr
beaumont on the ground
beaumont seems to be worse now unconscious but still gripping the hose tightly
his clothes are sopping wet
screen window of greggs house
greggs mother calls out but remains looking at a bowl she is holding in her hands
calling out gregg
billys waiting for his teddy
she then turns to look out
billys waiting for his teddy honey
in the distance she sees greggs back a bush some legs with wet khaki trousers and water squirting up in the air
traveling along sidewalk bushes to lighted windows of an auditorium
music is heard
a dance is going on
sixties music plays performed by a live band on stage
college kids dance
a college boy enters the auditorium urgently looking for someone
he quickly approaches a girl
his mothers on the phone its an emergency
he disappeared to the mens room a little while ago
im getting very tired of waiting lets go find him
we move into the face of jeffrey
he is hiding behind a furnace
he is fascinated by a sight beyond in the darkness of this basement room
he sees a male student trying to rape his girlfriend
she is crying and telling him to stop but the boy keeps forcing her down toward the ground
forcing her clothes off her
jeffrey at this point hears his name being called
each time he hears his name the caller is closer
the boy is now hurting the girl
before jeffrey leaves the furnace room he yells out hey shit head
leave her alone
dont force girls
the couple looks up but cannot see jeffrey
the boy is scared and releases the girl who promptly pulls farther away crying
jeffrey leaves the furnace room
louise and the college student see him and move quickly toward him
jeffrey your mothers on the phone
its an emergency
thanks for keeping me waiting so long
as jeffrey moves quickly toward the telephone
im sorry louise
the phone dangles on its cord in the foreground as jeffrey moves toward it in the background
louise slowly follows jeffrey but stays in back of him
jeffrey picks up the phone
whats wrong with dad
sure i will
beaumont sits talking on the phone in a dark quiet bedroom
i mean for good jeffrey
not right in the middle of the term
now looks very tired and poor health jeffrey
your fathers condition is serious
its going to cost so much
we just wont have the money to keep you in school
im telling you this now so that you can get your things together and check out of school honey or whatever you have to do
itll save you another trip back
youre going to have to work at the store
louise looks at jeffrey crying then turns away
jeffrey hangs up the phone
beaumont hangs up her phone
just next to the phone traveling into a shadow is a winged termite
jeffrey is waiting in a girls dorm lobby for louise
girls are milling around
louise gets off an elevator with some other girls
she forces a smile at jeffrey as she comes toward him
cant you come to the damn airport
i really cant
i have to go to that class tonight
i cant get out of it
i really cant
i love you jeffrey

i hope your fathers okay
i love you
im sorry jeffrey
i love you too louise
ill see you
jeffrey comes walking out of the airport where his mother and aunt barbara who is a very absent minded little woman with very thick glasses are waiting for him
they are parked illegally and another car is honking at them
their trunk is open in anticipation of jeffreys things
they are waving and yelling at jeffrey to get his attention
he finally joins them and kisses his mother then his aunt
hi aunt barbara
they ad lib hellos
a bit concerned wheres all your things jeffrey
this is it
beaumont looks at jeffrey
i sent a trunk home yesterday
this is all i have
you look good jeffrey
did you have a nice flight
well tell you on the way home
they get in the car
aunt barbara is driving
she is not a good driver and makes jeffrey nervous
he watches her every move from the back seat
they drive on surface streets
many gas stations traffic lights bars
he had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think theres some sort of clot or tumor or something in there
theyre doing all sorts of tests
on the surface he looks pretty good but there are problems
they think he may have to stay in two weeks now at least
you can go see him though tomorrow jeffrey
they tore down the a p jeffrey
did you see that
aunt barbara that was years ago
the car pulls into the beaumonts driveway
the neighborhood is quiet and dark
jeffrey aunt barbara and mrs
beaumont enter the living room
beaumont turns on a table lamp
a cold circle of light hits the light blue rug
home again home again jiggidy jog
they look at jeffrey
he looks at them
jeffrey enters his small attic type bedroom turns on the overhead light and sets his suitcase down
he goes to his desk and leans across it to look outside
the street is dark except for a pool of light from a street light
a breeze of cold powerful string music blows as we watch jeffrey stare into space
beaumont is calling upstairs to jeffrey
jeffrey breakfast is ready
calling be right down
beaumont joins aunt barbara at the breakfast table in the kitchen
this is marvelous jam
are you going this morning
i think jeffrey would like to see his father alone
jeffrey comes down the stairs
everyone says their good mornings and jeffrey sits down to breakfast
what time are visiting hours
ive made arrangements with dr
but jeffrey youll have to walk over i need the car this morning
jeffrey when you see your father
he doesnt know youre out of school
he thinks its a vacation for you
it would be too much for him
so please let him think as he does that youre home just to see him
thanks a lot mom
nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store
maybe going back to school will be an option one day
i hope so
i think its important not to get depressed
depression is a terrible thing
they say it can bring on illness
angry aunt barbara
ill try not to get depressed
jeffrey follows a nurse to a hospital room
please wait outside while dr
gynde prepares him to see you
she peers into the room
jeffrey does too
all he can see are curtains surrounding a bed and stacks of medical machinery
doctor gynde comes out from behind the curtains and walks to jeffrey
hello doctor gynde
how is he
hes fighting hard
its very important that your father doesnt try to move
hes been immobilized
it would be very painful for him
you do the talking and moving
he knows youre here
he became very emotional
i dont think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this
nurse cindy goes to the bed
she begins to pull the curtains back revealing mr
smiling a big smile mr
your son is here to visit you
then we see mr
he has numerous tubes and needles going into different parts of him
a stainless steel device holds his head perfectly still
nurse cindy picks up a tray and leaves
shocked but concealing it hi dad
speaking as plainly as possible but sounds like mumbling hey jeff
jeffrey goes to him and puts out his hand to shake his fathers hand but remembers his father cannot move
jeffrey pats him on the shoulder
looks like theyve got you strapped in pretty good
lips moving but hardly any sound uh uh
are you feeling okay
more mumbling uh uh
tears well up in mr
before jeffrey can stop him he reaches for jeffreys hand then struggling against tremendous pain he manages to form words
more plainly but under strain good to see you son
holding back tears its good to see you dad
jeffrey squeezes his fathers hand
jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home
he kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks
he has some time to think about things
he sees a green bottle in the distance
he gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle
he looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds he sees something strange
he looks closer
it is a human ear covered with crawling ants
jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around
all he sees are houses some laundry drying a very peaceful scene
no one seems to be around no one seems to be watching him
he looks again at the ear
we are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it
there is dried blood on part of it
jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig he pushes the ear onto it
again he stands up and looks around
in the distance a man goes into the back door of a house
jeffery hurries off carrying the bag with the ear in it
jeffrey goes up the front steps
and to the reception desk
a police officer is standing behind the counter
could you tell me if detective williams is still working here
hes up in room
right up the stairs
jeffrey enters room and sees the desk marked detective j
williams however the desk is empty
two men are talking at the end of the room one of them comes toward jeffrey
are you detective williams
my name is jeffrey beaumont i live near you
i believe you know my father tom beaumont beaumonts hardware store
sure i do
i understand hes in the hospital
how is he
hes alright i guess
theyre doing tests thats why im home from school
i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood
there behind vista i found an ear
matter of factly you did
a human ear
ive got it here in this bag
i thought i should bring it to you
yep thats right
lets take a look at it
jeffrey opens the bag and lets detective williams look inside
continuing that sure looks like a human ear doesnt it
lets run it down to the coroners office and see what they make of it
then i want you to show me exactly where you found it
jeffrey detective williams and an old coroners officer are looking at the ear which is sitting in a medical dish on a table
the tests will take awhile
meanwhile well check the morgue records
i dont recall anything coming in minus an ear
the coroners officer turns to jeffrey
continuing now if youd found a jaw or lets say a heart or even an arm we would assume that there was a corpse however a finger or an ear
the person may very well be alive somewhere
what can you tell about the person from the ear
when the tests are done quite a lot sex blood type whether or not the ear came off a dead person
right now i know what you know
its a real human ear
the human was or is caucasian
it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors
jeffrey is out with detective williams and a crew of officers who have roped off the area and are doing a grid search
a police photographer is also there taking flash pictures all around the field especially where jeffrey has told them he found the ear
detective williams takes jeffrey aside
by the way jeffrey this story isnt going to the press and im going to ask you to consider all youve heard strictly confidential
do not discuss this business with anyone but me or other police personnel
thanks for letting me in on as much as you did
ill drive you home
its on my way
beaumont and aunt barbara are doing the dishes
the news is on a small portable television
there is a broadcast on the mounting crime wave
a series of murders are being discussed and a police drawing mug shot is shown on the screen of the suspect who is at large
jeffrey is sitting at his desk daydreaming
he suddenly picks up the phone hesitates then dials
louise wertham please
is she there
very happy yeah
how are you
in the hospital for tests
very serious i miss you so much
smiling now what have you been up to
louise i dont know
ive got to see how my father is it costs a fortune in that hospital
when did he ask you to that
i cant stop you
just go ahead i may never be back go
look louise stop trying to explain everything
just do it
lets talk again in a couple of days or somethin okay
yeah i still love you
jeffrey sits alone in his room thinking things over
very slowly we move very close to the ear gliding slowly around the crevices approaching the dark hole
a huge low rushing of air sound low light
jeffrey enters the room
aunt barbara and mrs
beaumont are watching television
aunt barbara is knitting
im going out for awhile
looks at her watch do you want the car
no im just gonna walk around
youre not going down by lincoln are you
yelling back no
im just going to walk around the neighborhood
aunt barbara and mrs
beaumont continue watching the television
we see a mans shoes
he is sneaking slowly up some stairs
jeffrey walks along the dark streets
the same sombre music plays low and slow
some of the houses have a few lights on some are dark
some windows have a slow uneven blue flashing light indicating the television is on inside
jeffrey continues walking through the night
in the trees the shadows continuously re arrange themselves in mysterious sometimes frightening patterns
jeffrey finally comes to the house hes been looking for
he goes up the front walk
now at the last minute he feels a little foolish and has second thoughts about knocking on the door
he looks in a window
inside he sees a nicely lit living room
he goes ahead and knocks
a very pleasant looking middle class woman answers the door
my name is jeffrey beaumont
is detective williams in
oh yes jeffrey
hell be back any minute now
youre welcome to wait
is it urgent
i just wanted to ask him a few questions thats all
maybe i better go
really hell be home soon would you like a cup of coffee
thinks a bit alright
she leads him back to the kitchen where she has him sit at the kitchen table
she pours him a cup of coffee
i was sorry to hear about your father
i know your mother from church
its such a shame
yeah i know
would you like a piece of cake
no thank you
its a real good chocolate cake
duncan hines devils food
out in the living room sandy williams and her boyfriend mike shaw come up from the basement
they are both carrying books
sandy is a very good looking high school senior and mike is a big handsome football player type
sandy and mike come into the kitchen
jeffrey has a big piece of chocolate cake in his mouth
continuing jeffery this is my daughter sandy and
her boyfriend mike
they all say hi to one another
mikes gotta go
to jeffrey nice to meet you
yeah nice meetin yuh
it was nice meeting you too
they leave and go out the front door
smiles he comes over to study
smiles big yeah
the front door opens
in the kitchen john
detective williams comes into the kitchen surprised to see jeffrey
he kisses his wife
come into the study a minute
getting up excuse me mrs
jeffrey follows detective williams into his study
detective williams study is filled with filing cabinets
the desk has two phones and is covered with papers and folders and a picture of mrs
williams and sandy
the police radio is asking for detective williams as they enter
to jeffrey shut the door
detective williams speaks through the radio while jeffrey shuts the door
continuing in radio detective williams here
tell him to go to sergeant milton
clicks off radio turns to jeffrey well jeffrey you found something which is very interesting to us
i know you must be curious to know more
scratches the middle of his back but
im afraid im going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find but also not to ask more about the case
when its all sewed up ill let you know all the details
right now though
im just real curious like you said
i was the same way when i was you age
i guess thats what got me into this business
it must be great
and its horrible too
a cold look comes over detective williams im sorry jeffrey
thats the way it has to be
im sure you do understand
jeffrey studies detective williams face as they walk back to the living room
calling into the kitchen mrs
thanks for the cake
coming out from the kitchen oh youre welcome
nice to finally meet you jeffrey
say goodnight to sandy
jeffrey leaves and they shut the door behind him
as jeffrey leaves the light of the front yard and enters onto the dark sidewalk he hears sandy call out behind him
are you the one that found the ear
jeffrey stops and turns around
sandy comes up to him
yeah how did you know
coyly i just know thats all
i remember you from central
they slowly walk down the street together
you were pretty popular
didnt you run for some office
yeah i did
shouldnt you be studying or something
am i bothering you
youre not bothering me
you a senior
how is central these days
what else is new
what are you doing now
im home from school
my fathers in the hospital
thats too bad
what do you know about the ear
didnt my father tell you not to talk about it
she smiles come on
you brought it up
do you know anything
i dont really know much but bits and pieces i hear things
my room is right above my fathers office
theres no corpse in the morgue missing an ear and it did come off a living person
thats direct from the coroners office
the person is unknown
there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could
have something to do with the ear
i heard some of the same names
do you know who was brought in for questioning
there were at least three maybe four
but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found
theres also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned
and a musician
and some others
were all these people questioned this afternoon
this has been going on for some time several months
about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river
they were from people who were reported missing
they never found one complete body
the ear is from a missing person maybe
its a strange world isnt it
do you know what building the woman lives in
its close by
thats whats creepy
theyve had her under surveillance for a couple of months except i dont know what theyve found out because my father isnt in charge of her
i guess you have to get back home soon
not really why
then she understands you want to see the building
come on ill show you
jeffrey and sandy walk through the light of a street light
the street sign lincoln st can be read
they walk into darkness and continue down to an apartment building on the right side of the street
nodding toward building thats the building
she lives on the seventh floor
dont stop to look long the police are watching
where are they
i dont know
youre not supposed to see them
theyre supposed to see you
they begin walking slowly back to sandys house
did they find out anything when they questioned her
i dont know
like i said shes not my fathers case
what about those other people
my father is watching the businessman
the businessman had a partner who disappeared
left his whole business and family his wife and two kids
they think hes been murdered
you really do hear a lot dont you
yeah i guess so
they continue walking what are you going to do now that youre home
i have to help out in my fathers hardware store
theyre giving me sort of my own hours for a while
which is nice
still it must be kinda rough
its not bad
but its bad enough
its a lot worse for my father
jeffrey points to a house i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world
jeffrey and sandy both laugh
what happened to him
i dont know
he moved away
jeffrey and sandy walking and talking sometimes laughing in the distance while the music theme haunting yet warm plays over
they arrive back at sandys home
in front of sandys home
ive gotta go in
thanks for the tour
it was nice talking to you
sandy just looks at him shyly before she turns to go up the front walk
continuing i guess ill see you sometime
i guess so
like you said
its a strange world
jeffrey watches as sandy goes inside her house
he watches her house for a moment and sees her cross the living room
he turns and walks away
again the mysterious chords of music swell up as jeffrey walks through the night
jeffrey is poking around in the back room
he picks up some bug spraying devices
he yells out to an old black man who works in the store
hey ed okay if i borrow these bug spraying rigs later on
ed peers into the back room
if you need to spray for bugs theyre yours
it causes me no pain
jeffrey puts the stuff in the trunk of the car
there are several awake magazines there too
he gets in the front seat and drives off
he looks at his watch
jeffrey is parked across the street from the school
high school kids are pouring out the front door
in a moment he sees sandy come out with two or three other girls
they walk down the sidewalk away from jeffrey
he starts the car and slowly follows them to the corner where he pulls up alongside of them
sandy suddenly recognizes him
you hungry or thirsty or both
taken back i dont know
id like to talk to you about something
just a minute
pull over and wait a minute
sandy pulls her girlfriends away from jeffreys car and says something to them
there is some whispering and giggling and then to the girls please dont say anything to mike
the girls promise
sandy goes around and gets in the car
i dont want to cause any trouble
im here arent i
smiling as though he knew i guess mikes got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon
ooooo you are smart
just dont get too smart
jeffrey and sandy are sitting in a booth
jeffreys grilled cheese on white bread and a coke have just arrived along with sandys coke
alright now tell me
what is it
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience
sometimes in some cases
its necessary to take a risk
i got to thinking
ill bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that womans apartment
sneak in and hide and observe
you said it was a strange world
and youre the strangest part of it
are you crazy
she is possibly involved in murder
this gives me the creeps
i have a plan which i think will work
there is very little for you to do but i do need your help
arent you curious about my plan
thinking and intrigued plus she is beginning to like jeffrey it wouldnt hurt to hear the plan i guess
getting excited alright
the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later
now how are you going to do that
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig
i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man
i will spray her apartment
after a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window
what will i say when she comes to the door
you will be a jehovahs witness
i have a few awake magazines for you
you dont have to keep her very long
a few seconds is all ill need
i dont know
it sounds like a good daydream
but actually doing it is too weird
lets just try the first part
if that goes well well see about the rest
no one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this
youve got a point there
jeffrey and sandy are in the car
jeffrey is struggling to put on the old overalls
well walk over so theres no license plates and you give me at least three minutes
i can stall if its more but i need time to find a good window
they get out of the car
sandy has the awake magazines
okay im going ahead
wait a minute whats her name
dorothy vallens seventh floor
look on the mailbox for her number bright boy
three minutes no sooner
good luck yourself
jeffrey takes off in the direction of the apartment building
jeffrey walks up the front steps and goes in the double outer doors
he looks up and down the mailboxes and finally finds d
vallens apartment number
jeffrey goes into the lobby
jeffrey climbs the stairs
an old lady is making her way down the stairs
she sees jeffrey and his rig
well its about time you came
jeffrey forces a smile at her and after shes gone
to himself thats a good sign
he keeps climbing
he arrives at the seventh floor
and finds number
he knocks and waits
he looks around
the hallway is empty
dorothy vallens opens the door
she is a very beautiful woman in her late thirties
she has a beautiful full figure dark eyes black thick wavy hair
full red lips
right now however she looks a bit tired and a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe
what is it
gotta do your apartment
oh god that stuff stinks
as he goes in nope
its new stuff
oh yeah thats good
jeffrey goes all around the baseboards spraying
all the while hes getting a good look around the apartment
there is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape
jeffrey looks around to see what dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying
the apartment is smaller than he thought so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed
suddenly there is knocking at the door
what is this
grand central station
she opens the door
its not sandy
a man with a yellow sports coat is standing there
jeffrey begins to sweat because the man looked around dorothy to see him
dorothy says something to the man which jeffrey cannot hear
the next time jeffrey looks up the man is gone
the whole thing looks to be turning out badly when jeffrey spots a key on the counter
on a long shot he steals it just as the front door shuts
he wraps things up and gets out
to dorothy that oughta do it
out on the stairs he finds sandy with her awake magazines
are you alright
lets get outta here
as they go downstairs i was just about to go to the door when that man did my job for me
was it alright
yes and no
did you recognize him
i only saw his back
he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall
i didnt get a good look at him either but he sure looked at me
i didnt have time to get a window but i found this key
he shows it to her pretty nifty huh
yeah if it opens the door
they get to the door of the apartment building
you go first
they leave the building separately
when jeffrey gets to the car sandy isnt there
he looks around
he starts the car and drives off
there up ahead he spots her
he pulls over and she gets in
are you game for more
i owe you
since i goofed up this one
you didnt goof it up but
you still owe me one
i want to sneak in tonight
do you have a date tonight
well its friday night and youre a beautiful girl
i guess you would have a date
that does that
jeffrey is driving sandy home
you really want to do this dont you
i dont want you to get involved really i mean i do but if something went wrong i mean like you said they may be involved in murder
they pull up in front of sandys house
making up her mind against her better judgment ill tell mike im sick
theres a game tonight anyway and hell never miss me
afterwards he can go out with the guys
just so the record is kept straight though i love mike
what do want me to do

ill pick you up around eight oclock

yeah but dont pick me up
my father may think its strange
ill walk over to your house
ill be there at eight oclock
you better get out before someone sees us
sandy gets out of the car and without turning around walks into her house
jeffrey calls out after her
the television is on
some crime show is playing but the sound is very low
the family doctor is over and is giving mrs
beaumont an injection of medicine
aunt barbara is sitting nearby
that will take care of you frances for another week
i dont want you to overdo things either
take it very easy
ill see to it bill
i feel fine
thats not the point
youre under a great deal of stress
dont overdo it
dont be foolish
jeffrey enters the room to say goodnight
my whole familys sick
whats going on

jeffrey points to his head and makes a circular crazy gesture
they all laugh except aunt barbara
continuing well see who stays in my will
they laugh again
to his mother can i use the car tonight
of course jeffrey
they say their goodnights
jeffrey and sandy are looking at each other
jeffrey turns back to driving
sandy watches jeffrey drive then she turns and watches the stores and shops go by
when she is turned away jeffrey turns and look at her
sandy is thinking
whats the plan
first of all were going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens
well watch her for awhile
id like to hear her sing anyway and then also well know she is there and not in her apartment
then well drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there
this is not my usual friday night
the slow club is a sleazy night club on the outskirts of town
it has a dirty trash strewn parking lot in front of it where jeffrey and sandy park
they get out of the car and enter the club
french accent good evening
could we get a small table in the back
surely come this way
they follow him and are seated
may i get you something to drink
id like an ice cold heineken
she might as well that sounds good
two heinekens thank you
the maitre d leaves
on stage a fat comic is telling jokes
the jokes are tailored for this kind of working class crowd
the people are laughing
the place is almost full
jeffrey and sandy are taking it all in
to waiter when does dorothy vallens come on
flustered overworked i dont know
after the waiter leaves that guy was filled with information
they pour their beers
raising his glass heres to
an interesting experience
ill drink to that
jeffrey and sandy have just finished dinner
is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a saxophone player a bass player and a drummer are on stage
very low key ladies and gentlemen
the blue lady
miss dorothy vallens
there is quite a round of applause even though most people continue laughing talking and drinking
dorothy vallens comes out on stage
the house lights are still up
as she sings the first lines of blue moon the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word blue
this is a very sexy and slow version of the song
during the song jeffrey and sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into
jeffrey and sandy leave as dorothy starts her next song blue velvet
they hear the first few lines before they get out the door
they hurry to the car get in and drive off
jeffrey and sandy drive through dark areas of the city
they dont talk as they drive but again they sneak glances at one another
they turn in to the street where dorothy vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building
jeffery cuts the engine
it is very quiet
both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching
jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the seventh floor
it is dark
every tiny sound is heard
sandy looks at jeffrey for some time then back at the building
jeffrey i dont think you ought to do it
its crazy and dangerous
i shouldnt have told you
itll be okay
i dont think you should wait out here though
i think you should go home

thats for me to know and for you to find out
ill see you
i mean call you
jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door
he looks in one more time at sandy
they stare at each other silently
jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car
sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building
she slides over and sits in the drivers seat
jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the seventh floor
someone comes out of an apartment just as jeffrey gets to the seventh floor
he goes up another flight of stairs to the eighth floor and waits until the man goes downstairs
jeffrey then goes back to the seventh floor and goes to door
he takes out the key and looks around
he inserts the key
he turns it
the door opens
he quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door
it takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness
soon he finds his way around
he decides on the closet to hide in
however before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness
he goes down the hallway to the back bedroom
across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty childs room
in the childs room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top
the kind that plays music when the propeller turns
the hat is sitting silently on the bed post
he quietly closes the door
he returns to the closet
once inside he checks out how much he can see
through the slats he has a view of half the apartment
this is where he will stay
he moves around some to relax
he takes several deep breaths
he looks at his watch
sandy sits in the car carefully watching the apartment building and street
in the closet jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to stretch his muscles which are getting tired
again he takes several deep breaths
he looks at his watch it says
to himself oh no hurry up dorothy
and i gotta pee
its now or never
jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to the door of the bathroom
his foot hits the door and it makes a loud noise
he moves again into the bathroom
he starts to pee
suddenly sandy sits up alert
a car drives up and a man helps dorothy vallens get out
they walk into the building
jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else is so quiet the water sounds seem very loud
sandy begins to honk the horn
unable to hear the warning horn jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom as the tank is still filling
suddenly he hears something
a key going in the door
he bolts toward the closet
he flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front door opens
just as suddenly the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off silence except for dorothy vallens at the front door
were watching jeffrey trying to control frightened breathing in the dark closet thanks jimmy see you tomorrow
you want a drink or something
i better get back
the front door shuts and the living room lights go on
jeffrey can see dorothy come toward him
she walks right up almost to his face when the phone rings
she turns immediately and goes to answer it
jeffrey almost passes out
he thought hed had it
on the phone hello
yes sir frank
let me talk to him
please frank sir
i like to sing blue velvet
can you hear me
is little donny ok
is he there
you mean meadow lane
whats the matter with him
in an hour
ill be sweet
momma loves you
okay frank sir
she hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands
to herself frank you son of a bitch
she goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail
she nervously gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides the photograph under a pillow on the couch
she puts on a record for your precious love
she sits back down and chews her nail again listening to the music she starts to cry
she stops herself and takes the record off
she starts taking off her stocking
she then takes off her dress
underneath she has on a bra and panties
she crosses the living room goes down the hallway into the bathroom
jeffrey cant see her too well now
she takes off her panties in the bathroom
she is now naked
she looks at herself in the mirror
we see jeffreys face as he watches her
she disappears from view completely and we hear her start a shower
he sees dorothy in a towel come toward him again
he quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can
she opens the door reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe
she doesnt see jeffrey even though he isnt well hidden
she closes the door
it clicks shut
jeffrey is in almost total darkness
he can hear walking around then silence
he hears the kitchen sink water running
he hears her walking again
now he can see her
she sits down on her bed
she looks up
just as jeffrey shifts his weight
she looks at the closet strangely but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it
she slowly gets up
jeffrey doesnt know what is up
he looks but she walks out of view
suddenly he hears a drawer open and just as suddenly the closet door flies open and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him
when she realizes that someone is really there she screams once very loud
crazy scream then get out of there
put your hands up on your head
get down on your knees do it
what are you doing
who are you
whats your name
you tell me
let me see that wallet
reads his license jeffrey beaumont

word for word
trying to remember you said hello
you wanted to talk to someone
and little donny
you said something about momma loves you
and something about a meadow lane
something in an hour
i dont remember any more
dorothy stares at jeffrey studying him for some time thinking
thats what i said
you have a good memory
then you got undressed
how many times have you sneaked into girls apartments and watched them undress
quietly feeling guilty never before this
howd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you
gets an idea get undressed
i want to see you
no you come on
take off your pants
i want to see you
just let me leave
dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife
she goes to jeffrey
now she has a knife and a gun
i want to see you
jeffrey begins to undress
first he takes off his shoes and socks then his shirt
he undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them off
now he is only in his underwear
continuing come closer
dorothy has a strange look on her face
she reaches out and pulls jeffreys underpants down to his knees
she looks at him
whispering what do you want from me
quietly getting very hot i
i dont know
whispering what do you want
dorothy is getting very dreamy and begins to talk in a childlike voice
she opens her robe and pulls jeffrey to her breasts
dont look at me
jeffreys eyes close with nervous ecstasy as dorothy begins touching him
do you like that
he tries to touch her
dont move or ill kill you
she looks at him
continuing do you like talk like that
lie down on the bed
he lies down
he looks frightened
theres a knock knock on the door
dorothy looks very frightened
she quickly moves a finger to her lips in a quiet sign and whispers to jeffrey
whispers frantic shut up
go in the closet
dont say anything or youll get killed
i mean it
knocking is heard louder at the door
jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet
hes naked and hiding in the closet
dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door
jeffrey sees frank come in
frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut
he is wearing a tight blue t shirt and an old black sports jacket
hes got on a pair of blue jeans and boots
he has a raw mean sexuality a bomb about to go off presence
he comes into the room slowly always looking at dorothy
he sits on the couch
annoyed condescending shut up
cant you remember anything attitude my bourbon
dorothy goes into the kitchen to get frank his drink
as she passes the closet jeffrey can see the fear in her face
she returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to frank
frank sips on it
get your chair
dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down
she adjusts her robe
studying her spread your legs
dorothy slowly spreads her legs
she can see jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her
she opens her legs wider
frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon
he stares at the floor for a moment then slowly looks back at dorothy her body her crotch
dorothy looks up at the ceiling waiting
frank suddenly reaches to his belt where he has a small canister and a mask
he opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth
the canister is filled with helium which makes franks voice very high and strange sounding
the result is frightening
high voice mommy
she keeps looking at the ceiling
continuing with high voice frightened mommys here
high voice baby wants to fuck
then franks voice goes to normal
normal voice but loud like an army order to himself frank goes to dorothy and kneels down in front of her
he takes one more gasp of helium
high voice baby wants blue velvet
dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to frank
frank slowly moves frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet
his hands rub the velvet and feel dorothys body underneath
his hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe
dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear
then frank in a sort of sickening way pulls dorothy down to rug
he warns her
dont look at me
he begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth
then he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back letting frank have his way
frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange compulsive timidly sickening way
dorothy is moaning
frank is breathing very heavily
he feels her crotch
dont look at me
heavy breathing daddys home
he starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of dorothy
he starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him
faster and faster then he has a climax in his pants
dorothys head is falling back
she can see jeffrey blurred in the distance in the closet
cautiously she looks sideways at frank
screaming dont look at me
he slugs her in the face
his nose is running and hes stifling sobs from deep within him
on his hands and knees he moves away
the robe pulls out of his mouth
his breathing is even heavier now
he stands and begins to move around the apartment
he goes to a wall turns off the lights then turns and walks into the bathroom all the while breathing big heavy breaths trying to stop the crying
dorothy moans softly
it gets very quiet and still for a moment
then jeffrey hears frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom
the high strange sound reverberates in the distance
jeffrey cant make it out soon he hears franks high laughing
frank comes back into the living room
the mask is around his face
all his breathing every sound is high
he laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door
stay alive baby
see you next christmas
frank leaves and shuts the door
the apartment is silent except for dorothys moans
jeffrey is stunned
he doesnt move
he watches dorothy in the half light
she rolls over and starts crying
the crying is deep and genuine
slowly jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her
he bends down and touches her
she flinches and turns to see him
she turns back sobbing
he tries to get her up
why dont you come lie down
come on ill help you
she struggles up with jeffreys help and he takes her over to the bed
she falls down on her side turned toward the wall
he covers her with the sheet
referring to the sheet i dont like that
what do you want
are you alright
sure im alright
she starts crying again ill go then
he starts to put on his underwear
theyre inside out
he tries to turn them around
jeffrey turns to her
he studies her
he reaches out and takes her shoulders
he moves down and holds her
whispering thank you
whispering its okay
they lie together for a long silent moment
do you like the way i feel
see my breasts
see my nipples
whispering you can kiss them if you want
fell them theyre getting hard
jeffrey starts to move closer
dorothy closes her eyes
continuing go ahead
i dont mind
jeffrey cant help himself
he licks and sucks her nipples and feels her breasts
they both are getting very hot
jeffrey is all over her now
dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him
you can hit me if you want to
dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall
she moves and wont let him feel her anymore
she holds his hands away
whispering do you like me
whispering yes i like you
whispering you can be my special friend and come and put that in me
they start making love
suddenly dorothy starts crying
whats the matter
suddenly dorothy slaps jeffrey in the face
get off me
jeffrey gets off her pressing his hand to his face
dorothy goes into the bathroom crying all the way
jeffrey sits confused
suddenly jeffrey hears a horrible scream from dorothy
a true scream of horror
he rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong
she is just flushing something down the toilet
the water sound rushes
he turns to her
she is trembling and in a state of shock
i made it go down the toilet
he looks in the swirling water
it looks like an ear revolving around and around then whatever it is disappears
i made it go down the toilet
jeffrey looks up
he sees written with a bar of soap the words look down on the mirror
he looks down into the sink
at the bottom he sees a small clot of blood and a smear of fresher blood
jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally franks high helium voice reverberating in the bathroom
frank in bathroom
frank at door saying see you next christmas
inner voice next christmas
is he santa claus who has left a present for dorothy
what was it
out loud to dorothy what was it
strangely extremely frightened now that jeffrey may have left it do you know
breathing heavily strangely you dont
what is happening
maybe you dont know
i know you though
youre jeffrey beaumont and i know where you live and i know ways to get you and i know ways to kill you
please dont talk like that
im not helping you
im sorry for what i did
i better go
i cant let you put it in me now but i want you

strange smile go ahead you better leave now
i cant open myself to you now
ill tell you a little secret
she leans close i want to die
dont say that
its a secret so dont tell anyone
some day ill show you where
ive gotta go to sleep now
frightened by her craziness he takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink
he takes another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of dorothy vallens and turns goes through the hall to the living room
he crosses slowly to the door suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the bathroom
he stops and looks at dorothy who is turned away from him
she stares into the sink
jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe im leaving now
she is whispering something to herself
very faint whisper help me
please help me
jeffrey doesnt know what he can do
jeffrey turns back goes through the living room
he looks around and sees the empty bourbon glass of franks
suddenly he remembers the photograph that dorothy hid
he picks up the pillow and sees a picture of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed hat with a propeller
he turns the photo over and finds an old marriage license
it reads dorothy vallens to don
oh my god
he hides the photo again
he sees dorothys telephone
he memorizes the number moving his lips with each digit
he goes to the front door and opens it quietly
he looks out into the hall
he quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs
these steps are cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud
he goes through a door marked exit
and comes out crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk
he walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths
he looks at his watch
he feels so confused exhilarated so uneasy
he secretly worries about what hes gotten into
jeffrey enters the house
the camera rushes along the rug in the dark to a foot
the lights come on
pan up the leg to mrs
beaumont waiting in a chair staring
you scared me
is something wrong
whats happened to your face
you cant just stay out half the night and carry on jeffrey
theres got to be some order jeffrey
i thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late
jeffrey gets out of bed and goes to the phone
he dials a number
louise wertham please
are you kidding
long pause well louise i wish you a lot of luck and if things dont work out i think you should go into comedy
jeffrey hangs up the phone hard
he shakes his head
jeffreys drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store
he takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down
he clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down
to himself out loud how can i help her
i cant tell her to go to detective williams
shell think im a policeman
she has my address
she can go there
if she has to
ill tell her
and she thinks im don
where the hell is don
maybe he died
jeffrey dials the phone
this is jeffrey beaumont
is sandy there
can you talk
well i guess ill talk to you later on
it went okay
ill tell you about it
seven oclock yeah sounds good
hes still in the hospital
see you tomorrow
the searching mysterious music plays over while a doctor is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope
various sophisticated gadgets are seen in closeups
this is what my fathers disease looks like
the blood is seen in closeup
cells are moving
the doctor makes a change in magnification
the cells are huge then even bigger
they are so big we can hear them moving
the parking lot is half full
a strong wind is blowing trash around
jeffrey parks his car
and enters the club
he speaks to the maitre d
a table in back please
certainly dorothy is singing her opening song as the maitre d seats jeffrey
ill have an ice cold heineken
one heineken certainly sir
jeffrey surveys the place after the maitre d leaves
it is very dark and smoky inside
he has trouble seeing but suddenly he spots frank sitting with some other guys watching dorothy sing
they are sitting two tables away
frank is totally captivated by dorothys singing and is very serious looking
he looks right up to her eyes
in his hand he works a small piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers
again her first number blue moon segues into blue velvet
this song she sings mainly to frank
when it is over frank continues watching dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly
jeffrey drinks up his heineken and goes back outside
he looks around at all the cars but none stand out as franks
he gets into his car and pulls out across the street re parks the car and waits
traffic roars past jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the slow club
among them are frank and his friends
they get into a black ford fairlane and drive out of the parking lot down the highway
jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them
he has to gun the car up to sixty five to catch up with them
the mysterious music plays
he follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right
he waits at a light right behind them
inside they are lighting cigarettes
the light turns green and frank takes off
jeffrey follows them through a dark area down by the docks
he follows them up a narrow street through dark factories
dark low music now
up ahead frank parks his car
jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his lights and engine
he watches frank and his friends enter an old apartment building next to a bookbinding factory
they disappear within
the electric lines above buzz loudly
jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street
he reaches franks car which is making popping and clicking noises as it cools down
he looks at the license plates walks a few paces ahead and then writes it down in his notebook
he continues on to the apartment building
inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes
he sees a name frank booth
the name gives him the chills
the apartment number is
in the distance he hears footsteps
he quickly leaves
and crosses the street down to his car
he gets in and waits
frank comes out of the building and crosses to his car
out loud to himself ill bet i know where youre going
he follows frank as he pulls out
jeffrey discreetly parks just after frank kills the engine on his car
he watches frank leave the parking lot
he follows frank through the same vacant lot where he found the ear
he seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to dorothys apartment
jeffrey goes back to his car to wait
a storm is building
there is a roar of thunder as frank slams his car door as he gets in
his mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine and leaves
jeffrey waits till frank is safely gone
thinking out loud i shouldnt go in
but im too curious
and i have to try to help her
he then gets out of his car as the wind is building
and runs through the vacant lot
to dorothys building
he goes up to the seventh floor and knocks twice on
a moment passes then the door flies open
dorothy looks as if she was expecting frank to be coming back
can i come in
looking around the hallway yeah
hurry up though
they go inside
are you alright
dorothy breaks down crying
jeffrey goes to her
why are you here
still crying i looked for you in my closet tonight
a little laugh its crazy i dont know where you came from but
i like you
thats not crazy
i like you too
dorothy looks up
they stare at each other for some time
i liked being with you last night
there is a loud knocking on the door
she starts to stagger oh shit
can you stand up
this wont take long
jeffrey gets in the closet and dorothy closes the door
she holds her head collecting her fragile self
dorothy goes to the door and opens it
its the man with the yellow sports coat tonight hes wearing a purple sports coat and light blue double knit pants
his eyes are glazed and his face is broken out in a sweat
but get outta here
hes comin back
alright suit yourself

franks got me
and really its all thanks to don

dorothy kicks the door after he closes it then she chains it
jeffrey comes out of the closet
talking softly nice guy
whos it you mean
suddenly dorothy starts to shake and cry
jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him
she starts sobbing again
continuing oh god
why cant i just die
quietly soothing her there you go again
stop saying that
you can make it
you think you know so much
take it easy
whats goin on anyway
why are you in so much trouble
dorothy is sobbing and jeffrey is holding her
there is a long silence and she calms down
just be with me
now very strangely oh god
come with me
who are you
come up here
dorothy takes jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back
to a back stairway leading to the roof
the storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full moon
the wind continues to moan
they move to the roof top and dorothy leads jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building
a very sad forlorn version of somewhere over the rainbow creeps through the wind
as she stares down look
turning to her quickly no
continuing to look down her eyes widening she whispers falling
why are you in so much trouble
he moves closer to her
continuing who is don
very crazy and angry don
are you in with them
but youre in very big trouble
why are you so interested
why do you keep asking me
i came back to help you
you said do i let girls sneak into my house
you know where i live
if you need to
come to where i live
who are you
maybe ill need to
you like me huh
whispering or do you just want me
im going to let you enter me now
i should go
she makes him kiss her
he really likes it
once again jeffrey and dorothy get very hot
dorothy and jeffrey lie down on the roof
dorothy cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the roof
we move very close to jeffreys ear as dorothys lips come up and whisper into it
i have to make it hurt
i want there to be nothing again
as she slams her head again and again she reaches up and clutches jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish kiss
lightening cracks above them and the wind howls
jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into darkness
he continues down the sidewalk
he looks up at the starry sky
the stars are so far away the feeling is cold and lonely
darkness there are bell tones sounding and as each one sounds pin points of light appear on mr
beaumonts distorted dream face
he is trying to speak
hes trying to say jeffrey
another dark image appears
a robin sits in a tree at night
there is a slow low reverberating chirping sound
now dorothys apartment building at night
a very low angle looking up to the roof
suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from the roof
it flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is a red high heeled shoe
as it fills the screen it becomes red lips of dorothys which open into a scream
jeffrey wakes in his room terrified
jeffrey is talking with aunt barbara in the semi dark living room
will you tell mom when she gets home from the hospital that ive gone to dinner at sandy williams house
that sounds nice
i think youve got termites in the house
have you seen any
ive seen a few
well i havent seen any
i wouldnt worry about it
i better go
jeffrey leaves and aunt barbara moves about tapping on the walls
she moves into a dark area and taps
she reaches down
in extreme closeup we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet
then in extreme closeup we see aunt barbaras fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look
she looks at the termite then looks back at the walls
we glide along the dark walls of the house
they all sit around the dining room table
they have their heads bowed in a prayer before dinner
we thank you in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost
they start passing food around
like i was saying
if you toss the ball like this with your fingers just down here that thingll spin like a beauty
teasing him yeah
then how come nobody caught anything last week
not laughing cause we had a bad day
you play any sports jeffrey
looks like youd make a good runner
i mean you dont exactly have the build for a football
jeffrey looks around and sees sandy looking at him
she then gives a stern look to mike
then mike and sandy both look at jeffrey
not offended no
some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered
yeah well i never wanted to get slaughtered much
not getting any humor well most guys dont
i mean thats the point
you all mind if i take my vitamins
but there are vitamins in the food you know
yeah but i gotta supplement that
i gotta take a bunch of zinc too
the body is like a machine
everything has got to stay in perfect tune for perfect health
thats what im interested in
sandy looks at mike
and a few other things
everyone laughs again
weve got some heinekens
i like bud myself
ill get it
mike whatiya want
i guess another glass of water
sandy and jeffrey share a look
mike and sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement
jeffrey is sitting on a chair nearby
the television set is on
calling downstairs who wants dessert
its blueberry pie
and ice cream
jeffrey and sandy say yes
none for me thanks
jeffrey looks over at sandy
mike sees this
there is more tension growing
referring to t
what are watchin this junk for
you can change it if you want to
i dont know why we have to watch t
we dont have to watch it
williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert
here you are
would anyone like coffee
that sounds great
alright jeffrey just a minute
williams goes back upstairs
jeffrey and sandy start eating their dessert
sandy watches jeffrey happily wolf down his pie
mike stands up
ill be right back
he leaves as if hes going to go upstairs
once around the corner he stops and listens to see what jeffery and sandy will say to one another
well how did it go
ive found out some things
nothing really for certain
there are some strange people involved
what did you see
looking around feeling funny maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
you know what i mean
just then mrs
williams starts down with the coffee for jeffrey
she sees mike at the bottom of the stairs
this seems strange to her
are you alright
mike starts upstairs
downstairs jeffrey and sandy hear that mike was close by
williams and mike pass on the stairs and mrs
williams enters the basement
she throws sandy a concerned look
just then mike calls downstairs
could i talk to you a minute
calling up sure
just a sec
to jeffrey excuse me
upstairs mike is by the front door
come on out a minute okay
williams picks up some dishes
please excuse me a moment jeffrey and ill get to the dishes
please dont worry about me
can i help you with the dishes
nice of you to offer jeffrey but certainly not
just relax and enjoy your coffee
im sure sandy will be back soon
detective williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down
if you want to come up a minute ill show you some pictures
jeffrey enters detective williams study
continuing take a look at these
these are the photos of the vacant lot where you found the ear
you might find them interesting
jeffrey begins going through the pictures
they are x black and white prints
mostly they are pictures of weeds but they look quite beautiful in an abstract way
as he goes through them
these are beautiful
hows the case coming
anything you can tell me
the criminals are winning
is that why you say its horrible
i guess youve seen some bad things
yes i have so bad i wouldnt poison your mind by telling you
why do you do it
i wont let the bastards get me up against the wall
its an act of defiance
i get it
suddenly jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos
a piece of cloth in the grass
carefully he asks
what is this
what color is it
leaning over to see blue
its blue velvet
sandy comes into her fathers study looking upset
detective williams puts the photos away
can i use the car for a while
i want to buy jeffrey a dairy queen
a dairy queen
he holds his stomach oh yeah
sure that sounds great
jeffrey gets in and sandy starts the car
she pulls out
they drive away
whats with mike
he got a little jealous
im sorry i didnt
dont worry about it
the car glides along
jeffrey and sandy smile at one another
they drive on
you want a dairy queen
im about to blow up
sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church
the church pipe organ music drifts softly into the night
you want to tell me about it
its a strange world sandy
this is what i have found out
what i think i have found out
dorothy vallens is married to a man named don
they have a son
i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of dons ears
i think he is holding them to make her do things for him
i think she wants to die
the ears were for her a warning to stay alive
there is another man involved
i call him the yellow man
you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door
i dont know what he does but i think hes on drugs supplied by frank
frank is a very dangerous man
should you tell my father
i dont see how i can
and i cant prove any of this
i got all this information illegally
also it could get you in trouble
you saw a lot in one night
ive been in twice
without her sensing anything
pausing did you see her undressed
a searching slight smile that doesnt bother you does it
why should it
seeing some jealousy and and happy for it thats what i thought
youre sure right
it is a strange world
why are there people like frank
why is there so much trouble in this world
i dont know
i had a dream
the night i met you
she reflects silently on this before proceeding in the dream the world was dark because there werent any robins
you know birds
robins stood for love
and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love
and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference
until the robins come there is trouble
yeah i guess so
he turns to her youre a neat girl
so are you
laughs i mean youre a neat guy
we better get back
i guess so
you want to help me watch frank
im going to stake out franks place tomorrow
with a camera
sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street
they begin driving back
no silly im still in school you know
but ill meet you after school and you can tell me what youve learned
you better be careful jeffrey
ill pick you up on the same corner at three thirty five okay
they pull up in front of jeffreys house
jeffrey gets out of the car
he goes around to her side and looks down at her in the car
she looks very beautiful
he stands there for a moment
can i give you a kiss good night
pauses trembling you better not jeffrey
see ya tomorrow
sandy slowly drives off
jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes inside his house
the house is very dark and quiet
jeffrey finds a note by the one table light is on
the note is from his mother
it reads jeffrey hope you enjoyed yourself
see you at breakfast
a postscript is written on the note by aunt barbara
jeffrey honey i found these
love aunt barbara
jeffrey sees that aunt barbara has left him two dead termites
he picks one up and studies it
again we see a huge closeup of a termite in the half light
jeffrey shakes his head in amusement
jeffrey paces nervously
he picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers he dials dorothys number
there is a click but no one speaks
jeffrey instinctively speaks
frank telephone v
speak to me fucker
jeffrey hangs up immediately
to himself stupid
now she might be in even more trouble with frank
i hope not
i hope not
tomorrow i have to find out more about frank
jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of frank booths apartment building
the camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box
jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching
a lady steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps
jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures
we see a man walk down the street and turn up the steps
jeffrey shoots but really only gets the back of the man
he replaces the cardboard box and continues eating
later in the day
jeffrey sits waiting
he looks at his watch
as he looks up he sees frank getting out of a car with another man
the yellow man
they head for franks building
jeffrey hurriedly removes the shoe box and begins snapping pictures
they mount the steps and disappear within the old dark structure
jeffreys watch the hand time lapses around to
out loud to himself fifteen more minutes
just then he sees movement and takes the box off the camera
he starts shooting as two men come out the door
it is the yellow man and a man who is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache
he carries an alligator skin briefcase frank has disappeared
both are talking together and now laughing
jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to cover the camera as they approach
the box falls
the yellow man looks but jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the glove compartment
the two men walk right by jeffrey and get into the car behind his
jeffrey decides to follow them
he waits a few seconds and starts off
they drive through town
to a large factory building park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building
jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them
at a metal landing they stop
he sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance
the man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the yellow man at what he sees
he grips the yellow man on the shoulder
jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point
he looks at his watch
you gotta wait for me sandy
im on a real roll
he quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase
then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking
at the end of the alley he turns left and stops short
he sees a crowd of people an ambulance and two police cars
he walks closer
through the crowd he sees a broken window
hanging in the window is a dead man
blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head
on the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock
her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head in horrible positions
jeffrey stands next to two black guys
suddenly one of the police officers start pushing everyone away
jeffrey turns to them
he was blown away man
cant you see
that cracker was the biggest dealer in this section of the city brother
the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe
its a speedball heaven in there
what about the woman
probably just a whore he happened to be with at the time
man oh brother
this is the way the world is my man
take a good look
jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off
jeffrey drives up to the corner where sandy is standing
she is frantically looking around
jeffrey stops for her
looking beyond the car jeffrey looks around
a big football player is running up to a chain link fence across the street but its too late mike sees jeffrey
everything stops for a moment
then mike runs off
sandy goes around and gets in the car
continuing you were late
im really sorry
what am i going to do
you want to go talk to him
i dont think its going to do much good
ill try to talk to him later
jeffrey and sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth but having the same things as before
you know that cheese is practically all chemicals
thats what makes it so good
you wanta hear what i saw today
i saw the yellow man go into franks building laughing with frank
the only trouble is
what does this prove
thinking nothing really but its interesting
they know each other
they seem to like each other
but i think the yellow man is on drugs
i think frank supplies him
i saw the yellow man come out
this time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase
they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance
now get this
in the distance was a murder
a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead mans place
i cant believe what you are finding out
are you going to continue with this
are you going back to her apartment
im seeing something that was always hidden
im involved in a mystery
and its all secret
you like mysteries that much
youre a mystery
i like you
jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth
they stare at each other
jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently
she pulls away
jeffrey looks at her for a moment
you worry about me really
is that so surprising
yeah i worry
i got you into this
jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of dorothys apartment building
he hesitates before crossing to dorothys door
he knocks on the door and dorothy opens it
dorothy closes the door
she chains it
the kiss gets hotter
the feeling begins
they move down the hall to the back bedroom
theyve never made love there
as they hurriedly undress jeffrey sees the pointed childs hat with the propeller
he picks it up and spins the propeller
it makes a bit of music
dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward jeffrey grabbing his hand stopping him from turning the tiny propeller
she gains some control of herself
jeffrey releases the hat into her hand
it used to make me laugh
maybe i better go dorothy
frank frank is coming
how could he
you think im crazy dont you
i want you to stay
crying dont hate me
very nervous i sure dont hate you
im not crazy
thinking i know the difference between right and wrong
jeffrey moves to get out of bed
she poses do you like my body
sure i do
she moves closer to him towards his back touching it with her tongue
she gets down in a pose and holds it
im a statue
you can feel me
you can do anything you want
jeffreys hands find her flesh and move about
jeffrey and dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness
dreamily what do you want to do
im doing it
are you a bad boy
do you want to do bad things
very dreamy anything
whispering hot what do you want
i want you to hurt me
i told you
i dont want to hurt you
i want to help you
i think i know some of what is happening to you
she doesnt react dorothy
frank has your husband and son
you have to do something dorothy
go to the police
pushing herself back against the headboard then frantic no police
suddenly dorothy gets very odd
she turns into a little girl
she has a frightening little girl smile
you like to open me
thinking with a grin what if i told frank that you opened me
for just one quiet moment we see the stairway to dorothys apartment
it is empty
then back to jeffrey and dorothy
that wouldnt be too good would it
frank would open you
i know youve been scared
now you want to scare someone
smiles very strangely does that scare you
scared and mad come on dorothy
what if frank came over here and found us
the curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind
look snap out of it will ya
continuing do you love me
do you love me
i asked first
sometimes i think i do
and sometimes you think you dont
well get away then
she bolts up
wait a minute
for cryin out loud
just get outta my bed
she hits out at jeffrey and strikes him in the face
jeffrey struggles with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams out at his face again
he pushes back hard and her head actually hits the wall
she smiles through the pain
are you alright
she falls on him and smothers him with kisses
see how you hurt me
jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness
we move very close to jeffreys ear as dorothys lips come up and whisper into it
i love you don with all my heart
its not don
but he cant stop himself or her from making love
come inside me
oh yes oh yes oh yes
very frantic oh yes oh yes oh yes
the movement subsides
there is silence in the room except for breathing
i didnt mean to hurt you
now i have your disease
you put your disease in me
its hot and full of disease
theres no disease i can tell you
men are crazy
then they put their craziness into me
then it makes me crazy
then they arent so crazy for awhile
then they put their craziness in me again
starts crying its burning me
but i love you
i do i do
did you know that
did you know that i love you
very apprehensive im glad you do
theres so much i want to tell you
im in so much darkness though with things moving
there is darkness sucking me
its kissing me and darkness is entering me
in every hole
its opening me to a death
whispering if i die then theyll be free
its getting late isnt it
i can tell
its a cold feeling when its late
its warm then it gets cold
i feel it getting cold
you called me jeffrey
why are you here
jeffrey gets on top of her again hmmmmmmmm
they kiss very hot but also because i really want you to be alright
dorothy stops and looks at him she holds his face
she starts to cry
you really do
she continues holding his face looking in his eyes crying openly
he pulls him down to her
i guess i should go
i want you to stay with me
i think i better go
jeffrey is dressed and dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her robe
she is combing her hair
one or two lights are on now
she looks at jeffrey and smiles brushes some of his hair back from his face
youre my special friend arent you
whispers i have you inside of me still
big smile it helps me
i need you
jeffrey doesnt know what to say
he starts walking toward the door with dorothy beside him
lying ill call you
do you think im too fat
im getting a little bit fat
i hate that
you look beautiful to me
she pats her hips
right in here
fat fat fat
dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it
the hall is empty
there is some noise on the stairs
suddenly frank and two friends of his come into view on the stairway
to dorothy oh no
her eyes glaze over shes gone again no
calling out to frank hi baby
whos this fuck

from the neighborhood
we were just talking
to jeffrey from the neighborhood
slowly shut the fuck up
to jeffrey you like telephones

on a ride
hell thats a good idea
okay lets go
hey lets go
frank grabs jeffrey and pulls him along
continuing to dorothy come on
were goin for a joy ride
frank takes jeffrey on a wide eyed terror walk down the stairway
frank and dorothy are in the front seat
jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back
frank is driving very fast and very crazy
sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports
at the lights when they turn green frank lays rubber
where you wanna go
we gotta see ben
we gotta right
we gotta see ben
the car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs
liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors
they are blurred visions because of the speed of franks car
driving music plays
frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets just barely making turns
the ford bounces off several curbs
dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at jeffrey
she squeals out loud sometimes with glee mostly in fear
raymond and paul laugh with frank yell out or light cigarettes
frank finally gets to where hes going a corner bar and skids to a hault
they all pile out
frank grabs jeffrey
i wancha to meet a frienda mine
raymond get enough beer for ben too
to jeffrey what kinda beer do you like
just says it heineken
he grabs jeffrey and pushes him into the bar
moving fast now they go through this dark frightening place
frank has jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster
in the back there is a black man fondling a white girl near a doorway
they go through the door to a back room
a few naked girls are there near beds with curtains around them
one girl lies on her bed with dried vomit around her head and pillow
suddenly frank spots his friend willard
he runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat
thats the last time i get you high and watch you freak out motherfucker you tore my coat and i lost my lucky piece of blue velvet man
to the black and white photo of a piece of cloth in the weeds in the vacant lot
what color is it
hey frank im sorry buddy
get ready for a love letter
when you least expect it
a big love letter
frank pushes him down on the bed with the dried vomit whore
they leave willard
and go up a flight of dirty wooden steps
frank bangs on a door at the first landing
raymond joins him with a case of pabst blue ribbon beer
a tall slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door
his voice is very horse from years of smoking
very gracious frank
hey i brought some friends
and some beer
come sit down
the apartment is very large
all the furniture is over stuffed
in the room there is a very much over weight woman dressed in black and a greasy looking couple

frank almost dies laughing
everyone else joins in
ben turns to frank
frank i have something for you

as jeffrey tries to catch his breath he sees tremendous emotion fill dorothys face
she rushes forward
raymond grabs her by the arm and takes her into another room
jeffrey hears her crying out
he hears a small boy
donny oh my donny
dorothy is sobbing and clinging to donny
he is crying and gripping her like a small monkey would grip its mother
suddenly donny breaks away screaming

looking around dorothy rejoins the group
shes in a state of shock
frank pinches her cheek
continuing no smile for frank
okay fuck it
oh you wanna come with raymond
raymond has picked up the greasy girl

lets go fuck
ill fuck anything that moves
they leave and pile back into the car
now there are four in the back
raymond starts necking with the greasy girl
they speed on into the night
frank drives through various dark streets
then out onto a highway and goes over mph down a two lane highway
to jeffrey hey
you like to walk
lets take our neighbor out
let him fuckin walk back
laughs as frank is driving jeffrey sees dorothy nervously look at the road and surrounding countryside then questioningly at frank
she senses something about where they are going
where are we going frank
im taking your neighbor to the country
maybe something for you too
very anxious frank
you want to see him too right
then shut up
frank sees dorothy look back at jeffrey
whats this fuck got to do with anything
frank angrily swerves the car off onto a small dirt road bouncing down it screeching to a halt near an orchard of trees
he turns violently around to jeffrey
what are you lookin at
locks eyes with jeffrey long pause dont look at me fuck
i shoot when i see the whites of the eyes

jeffrey is quiet

frank takes helium

she winces and tries to pull away
continuing whats the matter

theyre just a little red thats all
let me feel em again
frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again
it really hurts her and she is frightened and in pain
leave her alone
frank pretends not to hear jeffrey and pinches dorothys breasts real hard
she stifles a scream
jeffrey gets mad
he hits frank hard in the face
everyone is deadly silent as frank turns to jeffrey
frank stares at jeffrey
out of the car fuck
help him frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window
his distorted face is hideous
he opens the back door
raymond and paul grab jeffrey and pull him out of the car
the greasy girl laughs nervously
he didnt mean it
leave him alone
he didnt mean it
gimme your lipstick
takes gas hey pretty pretty
dorothy doesnt move fast enough so frank dumps her whole purse out on the front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight
he puts lipstick heavy onto his lips
while raymond and paul hold jeffrey
frank kisses jeffrey all over the mouth
jeffrey tries to hit frank and pull away but raymond and paul have a hold of him
jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches of red lipstick on his face and mouth
frank slams the front door shut to muffle dorothy
he grabs jeffrey and presses his frightened face against the front window
then the back window
then he flops jeffrey up on the hood with pauls help and presses jeffreys face against the rear window
inside the car this show is crazy and scary
then frank takes jeffrey over to the side of the car again
to jeffrey youre fuckin lucky to be alive
raymond pulls jeffreys face back so hes looking at frank
dorothy and the greasy girl watch in terror
dont be a good neighbor to her or im gonna send you a love letter
straight from my heart fucker
you know what a love letter is
its a bullet
straight from my gun fucker
once you get a love letter from me youre fucked forever
ill send you straight to hell fuck
frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins feeling jeffreys face with it
continuing breathing heavily you feel good
feel my muscles
raymond makes jeffrey raise his arm and jeffrey feels franks biceps
continuing you like that
to raymond and paul hold him tight for me
suddenly frank starts hitting jeffrey in the face
dorothy screams at the car window
of rocks on the ground
he slowly picks up and looks around
the car is gone
he is swollen bloody and covered with lipstick
his pants have been pulled down and fuck you has been written with lipstick on his legs
he struggles to his feet and pulls his pants up
he fastens his belt and begins limping up the dirt road highway
is this yellow cab
i need a cab
he looks around just by meadow lane
jeffrey remembers dorothy mentioning meadow lane on the phone
jeffrey remembers frank saying you want to see him too right
and dorothy saying yes
continuing meadow lane
theres a big nehi sign

jeffrey is sleeping
his face is swollen and bruised
the clock says p
the clock says a
jeffrey goes into the bathroom
looks at his puffed face and takes two aspirin
he stumbles back to bed
the clock says a
and jeffrey gets up and stretches
his muscles are very sore
at the breakfast table
aunt barbara and mrs
beaumont are staring at jeffrey
i dont want to talk about it
everythings okay now
i dont want to talk about it
sometimes it helps to talk things over
for instance many marriages are saved by
interrupting smiling at aunt barbara aunt barbara

he holds his fist up
jeffrey dials the phone

jeffrey climbs the stairs up to detective williams office
he rounds the corner and steps inside the office when he stops short with fear
detective williams is not there but sitting at a desk next to detective williams desk is the yellow man
their eyes lock
jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler and gets a drink keeping his back to the yellow man
he shakes with fear
he slowly turns around
the yellow man is studying some papers on his desk
again the yellow man looks up
this time he is slightly suspicious and he cooks his head
jeffrey cannot move
finally jeffrey is able to step away
as he leaves the yellow mans line of sight jeffrey catches the names on the door
inner voice gordon
a police inspector
wait a minute
wait a minute
jeffrey remembers the black guy saying the police are going to find more drugs in there than you can believe
continuing inner voice the police
jeffrey remembers franks voice in the distance gordon went right up to them in broad daylight of course cause hes the man right
and he took all those drugs away
continuing inner voice took all those drugs away
gordon took those drugs away
jeffrey walks through the darkness carrying the photos
he stops in front of detective williams house and hesitates
jeffreys face has a troubled look
he approaches the front door
he hesitates again before finally knocking
detective williams answers the door
sandy is in the background
when she sees the look on jeffreys face she knows why hes there
come on in
im sorry to bother you but ive got to talk to you
come on in
looks like you had a bad face lift
with a goofy smile to sandy yeah
sandy gives him a concerned look
jeffrey follows detective williams to his study
he closes the door behind him
i gotta tell you
discovered some things
anyway i have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them
the first picture is this
he shows him the picture of frank and studies detective williams face as he sees it
continuing this is frank booth
his address is on the back of the photo
he in my opinion is very sick and dangerous
this photo here is of frank with another man as they went into franks apartment
jeffrey casually hands the photo over and watches detective williams face extra carefully
detective williams doesnt flinch yet his eyes slowly glide upwards to meet jeffreys
continuing and that man came out with a third man this well dressed guy
heres the photo
i think a girl named dorothy vallens is in trouble with these people
i think frank has taken her husband and her son
continuing i have no hard proof of any of this
her address is also on the photos
i think these people are involved with drugs
i think frank is killing drug dealers and
he decides not to tell detective williams everything and somehow frank is getting all their drugs
i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to but its over now for sure
i had to tell you about these things in case it could help
well now jeffrey how did you come to get so involved
i cant tell you the whole story
i took it upon myself
i cant say more
is sandy part of this
not at all
referring to the photos who knows you have these
and the photo lab
youre all through with this now
i sure am
detective williams studies jeffrey then the photos
you better be
and sandy better not be involved with this i can tell you
be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later
jeffrey leaves the study
in the living room jeffrey looks at sandy
i think so
i just had to tell him some of what i knew
is friday still on
you didnt tell him about me
detective williams comes out of his study and sees the two of them talking
he sees some nervousness
sandy quickly changes the subject
i should never had gotten you going on this
changing smiling yes jeffrey
jeffrey waters the flowers and bushes as his father had done
his face looks much better
jeffrey sits and visits with his father
his mother and his aunt barbara are there too
closeups of cells moving dark cells move in the picture gets dark
jeffrey is driving over to sandys
he has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front of the williams house
its lights are slowly revolving on top
the engine idles
a man is inside
his head down studying some papers
jeffrey barely notices all this as he heads for the door
williams answers the door and sandy is behind her in the dining room
jeffrey enters and crosses the room to sandy
you all set
detective williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing in a briefcase on the dining room table
just then a man comes up to the door which is still open
jeffrey turns to see
it is detective t
gordon the yellow man
all the color instantly drains from jeffreys face
yelling inside hey john get a move on
detective williams turns
he sees detective gordon
he turns again
he sees jeffreys expression
sandy hasnt seen it yet
detective williams goes to jeffrey
he looks him straight in the eye
he also positions himself between jeffrey and t
easy does it jeffrey
dont blow it
sandy becomes curious and moves over to jeffrey and her father
jeffrey decides to trust detective williams
the yellow man t
gordon yells again
come on john get it in gear pal
so long jeffrey
you two have a nice night okay
what is it
just some fatherly advice
jeffrey and sandy head for the door
the yellow mans and jeffreys eyes meet once more
the yellow man cocks his head
to her mother goodnight mom
to the yellow man goodnight tom
they cross the yard to the car
jeffrey helps sandy in then goes around and gets in himself
they are both dressed very nicely
jeffrey starts the car and pulls out

you look beautiful
whatiya say we just enjoy the evening
i like that idea
thats a real good idea
jeffrey and sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded with kids dancing and talking
jeffrey and sandy are holding hands
jeffrey feels a little out of place
a couple of girls raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to sandy
the music is loud fast dancing music
you want to dance
i cant dance fast
you want to dance with someone else
lets wait for some slow one
just a minute
sandy leaves jeffrey for a moment and jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a girl by the record player
sandy confers with the girl
sandy comes back to jeffrey
i took care of it
you want something to drink
just then the music goes slow
you want to dance
they begin to dance
at first further apart then they make the mistake of looking in each others eyes and they move very close together
they move around to another look
then they kiss
they kiss for the entire rest of the song
between songs and during the entire next song
they finally as they say come up for air
i love you jeffrey
they kiss again
then they dance and look at each other
then they hug each other
as they hug jeffrey closes his eyes
inner voice i really do love you
jeffrey gives sandy a little kiss while theyre over by the cokes
theyre having a drink
sandy introduces jeffrey to some of her friends
she is very proud of him
they are both very happy
they look at each other and kiss again
the party is breaking up
kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars
jeffrey and sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm
they say goodnight to the parents in the living room and leave through the front door
they cant take their eyes off one another
they are totally oblivious to the three guys in a car across the street
as soon as jeffrey gets sandy and himself in his car he starts it and moves off
the dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a scream
it follows jeffrey and sandy for a way then it roars up behind them swaying back and forth honking its horn and trying to ram jeffreys car in the rear
jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror
sandy turns around in fear
jeffrey guns his car and races down the street
oh my god
he swerves around the corner
up ahead a car is pulling out of a driveway
continuing referring to the car ahead come on
jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street passing lincoln st
i cant outrun this guy
he floors the car and flies down another street very fast
my father has a gun at home
this guy is a killer
i promise you
sandy turns back to take a look
jeffrey swerves the car again he bangs it off a curb as he rounds a corner
a hub cap goes flying off rolling noisily down the street
try to get to my house
then my father can
he remembers detective gordon the yellow man at sandys house
jeffrey floors the car again
but the car behind him is fast and gains on him
it swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror
now it swerves and roars up alongside jeffreys car
jeffrey looks over
it is mike
out of enormous sense of relief he starts laughing
he slows instantly and so does mike
he pulls slowly up in front of his house his head back laughing
mike swerves his car in front of jeffreys and jumps out
out of the car very drunk hey come here you stole my girl you bastard
im gonna kick your ass right in front of your stupid house
stop it mike
to sandy you shut up
nobodys talkin to you
hey whos that jeffrey
everyone turns and looks
slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman
it is dorothy
she is totally in shock bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth
she is bloody swollen and bruised all over
she is totally different drained of her sexuality
she has been ravaged
he jumps out of the car gets a hold of her and helps her back
mike comes after him
going for jeffrey hey you ivy league shit
pushing mike off later mike
i gotta take care of someone whos hurt here in case you havent noticed
mike go home
mikes friends are dazed watching dorothy staggering beside jeffrey
mike steps back as jeffrey puts dorothy in the car
jeffrey stands back up and glances at mike
dull very drunk hey im sorry
jeffrey gets into the car
jeffrey shuts the door
dorothy is sandwiched between him and sandy in the front seat

looking quickly from dorothy to jeffrey right
watch out for mike there
mike and his friends are getting in mikes car
mike is trying to start the engine
he does and clumsily throws the car in reverse
he screeches out and screeches to a stop
then he guns away forward and shoots crazily down the road
here we go
they drive off
looking over oh god
jeffrey is that you
sandy looks at jeffrey questioningly
yeah its me
oh god jeffrey

sandy is confused
how do they know each other
jeffrey and sandy take dorothy up the walk
sandy opens the door
they enter the living room
williams comes in from the kitchen

dorothy is clinging to jeffrey
williams goes to call
sandy moves closer
jeffrey looks at sandy and she returns the look

williams watches with confusion and worry for the hurt this is causing sandy
sandy is crying now and turns away
ill get a coat for her
she leaves the room hurriedly
whats going on

quietly they hurt his head
a huge roaring wind sound comes up
dorothy starts screaming
the screams dissolve into a siren as it roars to a stop in front of the williams house
dorothy clings to jeffrey
her eyes are turning a dull milky white
the effect is horrifying
she is in shock
sandy is still crying while she moves back and watches jeffrey
jeffrey turns to look at sandy
crying i still love you jeffrey
williams comes to put a coat around dorothy
williams is shaking
the paramedics enter the house
the paramedics are loading dorothy into the ambulance on a stretcher
dorothy is moaning
a sickening warm wind comes up and howls through the neighborhood
i should go with her sandy
jeffrey turns slowly and gets into the ambulance
jeffreys head is very close to dorothys
dorothy is saying something mumbling
hold me don
where is he
straining her eyes to focus on jeffrey help him

she bolts up screaming directly into jeffreys face
her beaten face and milky eyes are a study in horror
jeffrey finishes dialing

sandy with red eyes in a darkened room
in phone struggling to keep from crying i forgive you

driving through the night
jeffrey arrives at dorothys apartment building and pays the driver
he gets out of the cab and looks around
the building looks just the same standing there in the dark
the dim lights in the front entrance
jeffrey moves up to the front doors and enters
sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio
over the radio no
he only wants my father to come over
its very important
he said someone was hurt and he wants detective williams there
well find him
jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs
his shoes squashing the carpet make mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building
he arrives at the seventh floor and stops
a high pitched whine can be heard faintly
it gets louder as jeffrey crosses to dorothys apartment door
he gets his key out and inserts it
with a loud click the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing
he sees something and jumps back
it is detective gordon the yellow man standing in the center of the room
he plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again
something is wrong with him
he is bleeding from the head
he stands almost motionless
jeffrey peers into the room again
he enters carefully and lets the door close behind him
he very cautiously moves forward into the room
slowly he moves closer to a hideous sight
standing in the middle of dorothys apartment is t
gordon the yellow man
he is in an extreme state of shock
he is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head
his eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see
sitting in one of dorothys chairs is a dead man with no ears
only half healed bloody wounds at each side of his head
a bullet hole in the center of his forehead
is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine
jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall
the high whine stops instantly
silence except for the yellow mans labored breathing
suddenly there is a loud radio voice coming from the yellow mans police radio which is turned on in his jacket pocket
jeffreys heart leaps and just as suddenly the yellow man throws his arms out wildly knocking a floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light
jeffreys heart goes wild at this sight and he jumps back but the yellow man is silent and motionless again
the radio talks again
get back and stay down
its apartment eight
love letters straight from my heart
begins to play
jeffrey watches the yellow man and listens to the radio
continuing im sending jack and pete to the roof
sounds of shots
continuing hes shooting
from the second window
stay in place
get up there quick
can return fire
i think hes alone
but return fire to second window only
we see jeffreys face in closeup
the real scene is before us
police cars line the street along with a huge fire truck and several ambulances
special police marksmen are crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite franks building
screams are heard from within and police radios blare
shots are being fired into a black window
once in a while a shot is returned
two policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance
he hasnt fired a shot for six minutes
maybe we got him
get on the radio
get detective williams
ask him if we can rush the son of a bitch
a policeman runs off
more shots are fired into the building but none are returned
the policeman comes running back
its in the works already
were in there
theyre goin down the back stairs now
it wont be long
and theyll have us rush em from here
one whistle and we go
suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into franks apartment
then a loud whistle
police race across the street to franks building
police kick the door in and rush into the apartment
its empty excpt for a large dog which has been shot
the dog growls and cowers back in a corner
every now and then it limps on bloody legs back and forth
jeffrey hears the radio
he hears the policemen talking at franks place
he hears that frank is gone
he decides to leave dorothys apartment
speaking to t
gordon who doesnt hear him because hes almost dead im leaving now
ill let them find you all on their own
find all this horror on their own
whispers good bye
he goes out and closes the door
the door clicks shut
he makes his way quietly down the hall to the stairway
he starts down the stairs
he rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another floor
at the next landing something out the window catches his eye
he notices a man get out of the car
he recognizes the man
it is the well dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase
jeffrey watches the man come toward dorothys building
then his eye goes back to the mans car
it is franks car
he notices the man is carrying a police radio
to himself franks car
is this man a cop
he has a radio
so did frank though and hes no cop
thats for sure
and hes driving franks car
who is he
the man enters the building at the front entrance directly below jeffrey
jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs
what happened that day
jeffrey remembers frank and the yellow man go into franks building
they went in together
jeffrey remembers the well dressed man come out with the yellow man
and out came
no it couldnt be
but i think it is
jeffrey runs like mad up to dorothys apartment
he looks back once and sees the well dressed man hurrying up the stairs
closeup on well dressed mans face
it is frank underneath a very good disguise
jeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket
he fumbles with it and it drops to the floor
frank climbs the stairs
finally the key goes in and jeffrey frantically opens the door
he rushes into the room
the horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again
he rushes to the yellow man and takes the police radio out of his pocket
he runs into the back of the apartment to the back bedroom where he crouches down behind a double bed
into the radio detective williams
over radio detective williams here
is that you jeffrey
yes its me
frank is on his way up to dorothys apartment
thinks hits himself in the forehead inner voice oh no
frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say
thinks some more fast detective williams
im in the apartment
im hiding in the back bedroom
were ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can
sandy runs frantically down a dark street
we see a street sign which says lincoln
jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room
he leaps safely into the closet just as frank opens the apartment door and enters
jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet
frank is smiling
calling pleasantly in the direction of the back bedroom hey neighbor
shit for brains
you forgot i have a police radio
i know where your cute little butt is hiding
here i come
ready or not
he starts down the hall to the back bedroom
the police radio which jeffrey planted under the bed and franks radio both start broadcasting
frank turns his radio off now only the one under the bed plays
i can hear you radio
hey you stupid fuck
you got about a second to live
jeffrey watches frank reach inside his coat for his gun
he watches frank sneak to the back bedroom area
jeffrey turns and looks at the yellow man
he gets an idea
he quickly rushes out of the closet feels inside the yellow mans coat for his police gun
he gets it but it causes the yellow man to moan and leap some in another almost death spasm
jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath
just then he hears frank in the back room
helium voice hey pretty pretty
jeffrey then hears three or four shots deadly sounding coming from a pistol with a silencer attached
hey fuck where are you
jeffrey sees a furious frank come storming out of the back room and come slowly up the hall directly toward him
jeffrey raises his pistol very slowly
frank enters the living room
he looks around
the yellow man moans
frank makes a face and blasts the remainder of the yellow mans head away and this time the yellow man falls dead to the floor
jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air
frank looks to the kitchen
all around the living room
he looks at the closet
he smiles he slowly goes right toward jeffrey smiling
jeffrey points the pistol
his finger moves to the trigger
he squints his eyes
he doesnt want to kill a man
frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open when jeffrey hears sandy scream
frank and jeffrey lock eyes as jeffrey pulls the trigger
he yells sandys name and franks head is blown off
we see sandys frightened face
we see policemen racing up the stairs in dorothys apartment
we see cop cars with lights revolving radios blaring
the large room is crowded with policemen and members of the f
everyone is talking excitedly
jeffrey and sandy are sitting by detective williams in wooden chairs near the center of the room
we hear bits of conversation
to jeffrey because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon
i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different
he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid franks place
does dorothy know her husband is dead
oh my god
is her son ok
were looking for him
in your opinion why did frank kidnap dorothys son and husband
he became obsessed with her
she hated him
he had to have her
he kidnapped them to control her
to make her do things
then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive
im not kidding
frank loved blue
he had to have dorothy cause her whole life was blue
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens
i guess i did
he turns to sandy with a worried look whats going to happen to me
were going to leave that up to detective williams
ill tell you though
you shot a real son of a bitch
i sure know that
yeah but how many more are out there
a huge low roaring sound comes in
slowly we come up out of a huge dark hole
we see we are rising out of an ear but still among the crevices
they look enormous
we move up and float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye
his face is bathed in light
all sorts of springtime in the garden sounds are heard
we suddenly see that jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard
detective williams is with mr
beaumont working in the garden in the distance
the sprinkler is turning
sandy comes out on the back porch and calls
lunch is ready
jeffrey opens his eyes
he looks around confused for a moment
he sees sandy
ill be right in
sandy goes back inside
suddenly a big red robin chirps loudly above
jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree
the robin and jeffrey seems to exchange a special look
jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird
he gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of the house
as he passes his father and detective williams how ya doin dad
distant voice hey jeff
im feelin so much better
good deal dad
he and detective williams share a smile
jeffrey enters the kitchen and sees sandy standing with aunt barbara by the kitchen window
beyond in the living room mrs
williams and jeffreys mother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam
a large red robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big bug in its mouth
referring to the bird look jeffrey
as he joins aunt barbara and sandy to look at the robin yeah
i just saw him outside
maybe the robins are here
i dont see how they do it
i could never eat a bug
smiling its a strange world isnt it
yellow tulips sway in a warm afternoon breeze
a bright red gorgeous fire engine is moving very slowly down the street
we move in to see the happy face of a fireman
a very clean uniformed smiling policeman with arms outstretched allows clean happy school children to cross the street safely
a songbird sings in a tree
we are in a beautiful park
slowly we move down and a little hat with a propeller comes into view
the hat is on the head of a small child who is dancing slowly toward dorothy
she is laughing
when the boy gets within arms reach they embrace
we move close to dorothys smiling face
tears of happiness come into her eyes but there is still a distant look as we hear bobby vinton sing the last lines of his song
and i still can see blue velvet through my tears
blue velvet dissolves in and takes over the image
