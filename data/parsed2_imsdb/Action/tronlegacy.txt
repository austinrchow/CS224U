x takks notice moving to investigate
red data uploads into solid form
a red figure
we see from the back infrared strobing disk etched metallic detail lethal edges then slowly he it turns
hardly a face only data hungry eyes riveted to a task seriously upgraded over clocked armed for trouble
the friendly hero we once knew has been re programmed into a ruthless cyber ninja
x takks search ten story gantries
tron springs into the lattice dodging plasma beams avoiding detection
slips into x takks on high alert
tron slips down main shaft freezes confirms data

tron inserts key in and encryption panel
shockwave quakes system
x takks spot tron
tron pulls hyper disk off his back and hurls it disk strikes cop fries his circuits
disk ricochets brutally accurate takes out three more police tron flips into the air his disk boomerangs straight for him
but his timing is inhumanly accurate
disk docks on his back midair lands and bolts
power supply verges on meltdown circuits fry plasma spews
x net crisis team rushes in inserts master key
power supply stabilizes
tron flips away chased by firing x takks arriving on the scene split second response elite team of x net security agents lead by rx security leader cyber twin of
our real world hero rush
tron jumps down main shaft a thousand stories
riding his disk as a heat shield dodges x net fire swerves into a data rx and a pair of his agents hop on pulse rider vehicles hotly pursuing tron
tron plunges onto a data highway speed out of nexus hurls across cyberspace
this is the first time an intruder has broken into x net
and its the last
shut him down
they speed onto the optik highway
broadband light speed optik highway
empty except for tron accelerating escaping
rx and agents catch up fast on pulse rider vehicles
tron throws his disk
blings off agents triggers crash
plasma blast rips open highway wall
rx emerges unscathed pursuing
tron leaps out blast hole recovers his disk vanishes into rx roars after him riding hard joined by airborne search engine vehicle piloted by a dumpy nerd program called krod
i got a lock
im on him
rx chases tron into a dark canyon
hairpin turns and blind curves
rx arrives a junction
tron has vanished
which way did he go
rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode
a head shoots up from a cubicle
its rush nortebi computer security expert
real world version of the rx program
his cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and bleeding edge computer gear
i said which way did he go
dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system intruder
dangling from desk lamps the company toy conical pyramid with a square stuck on top labeled x net rules
come on guys
nobody hacks x net
you gonna let him get away
rush i think i found him
in the adjacent cubicle overweight ultra nerd miles rabbish real world version of cyberworld krod
check the old game grid
rush jockeys an old apple lisa computer
on screen a crude old vector graphics game grid
a red figure steps appears the grid
you get a cookie miles
programmers gather to watch rush in action
vast low rez uncool largely forgotten
tron pulls a light wand from his legging grips it
a turbo charged light cycle rezzes up beneath him
he fires his lightcycle
zip hes gone
onto the grid blasts rx speeding on his pulse rider
he skids and swerves learning the funky surface
search engine flies onto the scene hovering overhead
there he goes
the chase is on
tron escapes across the vast grid plane head down eyes hollow
he gains speed retreating to somewhere
rx surges on his pulse rider closing the gap
rush gets the hang of this old game
i havent played this since i was
but i was mighty awesome
red lightcycle turns hard degrees rush maneuvers to counter
co workers lean over the cubicle walls from all sides score an id on this leech
rush youve gotta nail him
or you know were all fired
rush baits the red lightcycle
it anticipates his every move goading him tailing him
i groked a pattern in his moves
fake left go right
search engine flies overhead krod locks on tron
rx s pulse rider pulls the move surges up beside red lightcycle
tron pulls away baiting his opponent
you got him on the run dude
rush rush rush
rush hits keys jockeys mouse
shifts drive status to turboject
rx s pulse rider screams gaining on tron
neck and neck
but tron suddenly brakes quitting the chase
rx is puzzled
eyes spring wide
rushs screen his pulse rider speeds straight for the rocks
pulse rider smashes into rocks rx pulverizes to neon bits
electro shockwave sears across game grid
search engine freezes overhead glitches and crashes like a blimp
all goes white snow crash
he crashed me
did you get a trace on him
miles stares at his blank screen
every screen in the lab is blank
we are so screwed
who tells the boss
all eyes land on rush
get the system back up
press crews camp a block away
x net pr team preps a media extravaganza
shirt logo x net total data security banners video projections music
x net public relations vp leads entourage on a preview
weather is holding
dress rehearsal on for pm
in the morning we let the press in for a am tech set up then you go live worldwide am sharp
staff defers to gordon sinclair boyish ruthless brilliant ceo of encom corporation
delay the press until
ill taking the stage at
force a network break in
then its news
he catches something on a video screen snaps his fingers
play that again
crew murmurs on headsets
promo video replays x net deploys radical software design constructs proprietary white hot firewalls unleashes virus killer apps
creating the most secure data network in history
your data can never again be hacked corrupted stolen or destroyed
x net is the final solution totally guaranteed
secure data transmission who changed that
x net executives chill
um that would be
eyes land on withering legal vp
change it back to the way i wrote it
with the launch of x net this company guarantees one hundred percent secure data transmission
if we cant deliver on that promise we deserve to be out of business
rush appears from a building
signals sinclair aside
what cant wait rush
x net was just breached by a hacker
sinclair goes pale
systems back up no permanent damage but
but whoevers behind this theyre good and theyre still out there
sprawling big bucks basketball hoop
sinclair enters alone
uses a retinal scan id to access his computer
secure connection opens
as he speaks text instantly appears identify the intruder
flashing circuitry machine code bit storm
we follow sinclairs text message data stream min blowing cyberspace fly over
data beam penetrates a towering shaft reaching deep inside the massively fortified x net central server
lone figure stands clothed in flashy cyber armor fluid photons oozing high rez circuitry
its plexor cyber twin of real world sinclair
he crosses into an round inner sanctum
data stream radiates from above
plexor stands in the center pulls his disk off his back raises it above his head
data stream converges onto disk becomes a tight ruby red plexors eyes decode transmission
text races across his eyes identify the intruder
identity not captured
other side of the link
real world sinclair reads text as it appear on his office screen identity not captured
how did he enter x net
his text inputs
answer comes path untraceable how could you let this happen
plexor processes the input remains emotionless
i do what you programmed me to do
i am constructing x net
new instructions find and destroy the intruder
text reply resource allocation reconfiguration required
estimated delay to x net construction
we cant delay the opening of x net
disregard my last command
maintain construction priority
sinclair cuts off the contact pressure mounting
ruby beam goes dark
plexor lowers his disk
his eyes are cold his confidence supreme
crisis management team assembles
nervous x net senior staff
rush arrives late out of breath determined
joins phlegman and kelter
system is stable again keep you fingers crossed
any luck finding the intruder
rush notices across the room brilliant beautiful megan randall his age
her security id level black
whats she doing here
this is an operations meeting
you and meg still eh
there was never anything between us
kelter and phlegman trade a look
shes advanced projects
this has nothing to do with her
sinclair storms in
room falls silent
this companys existence depends on the flawless launch of x net in twenty two hours fifty one minutes
now somebody some hacker some competitor somebody just proved theyre smarter than us
breaking into x net is theoretically impossible
everybody looks at rush
this creeps the best ive ever seen
he crosses platforms cracks bit encryption cloaks every move never leaves a trace
when you find him ill be sure to hire him
chuckles around the room
mood chills sinclairs not laughing
boys and girls we cannot sell a secure network that is not secure
we delay the launch
and the world assumes weve got a faulty product
and theyd be right
we ramp up our encryption schemes thicken all firewalls we cant win playing defense
and its a bigger job than just swatting an intruder program
somewhere theres a human mind behind this thing
we have to get to that user and shut him or her down or the game never ends
meg listens quietly
what do you need rush
guys for days we dont have hours
this problem needs to be gone before tomorrow am
come on people this companys future is at stake
its time to think without a box
minds ponder grimly
finally a lone vp rises
its rudy the company archivist
at a time like this lets seek inspiration in the past
we should ask ourselves what solution would spring from the inspired mind of our departed leader flynn
hes got an obituary photo of flynn encoms legendary previous and deceased ceo
groans around the table
execs rolls their eyes disses rudys idea
flynn has become a stale company joke
rudy sheepishly sits
but sinclair stops behind rudy eyes fixed on the photo of flynn
an idea takes hold
he looks to meg
is the qf is operational
midway into phase one testing
confusion among execs
nobody knows what a qf is
not even rush
if we cant fight this intruder from the outside then maybe we need to fight him from the inside
megs mind races
im ready to do my part
this company needs a hero
who among you is the smartest most resourceful and courageous
looks trade around the table
meg slowly rises indicating her choice
who else could it be
shes singled out rush
meg leads sinclair and rush to a secure elevator
her retinal scan id opens the door
they step in
somebody going to tell me what ive been volunteered for
rush youre the only one i can trust to eliminate the intruder
but you wont be doing it the way you thought
megs been working on something down here thats well
beyond top secret
rush drills a look at meg but she keeps it all business
out the elevator meg leads them into a maze of ultra tech gear
this is where flynn worked
and where he died
amid sleek new equipment theres a glass cabinet housing a charred remnant of strange machinery
meg has reconstructed flynns last project
this time it works
mega signals lab assistant dewey
he pokes buttons a massive technical device unfolds and boots up
you didnt pick this up at circuit city
what is it
a quantum digitizer
prototype only one of its kind
flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data
luckily we salvaged his key components and back engineered the system
she opens a cage places her lab rat jo jo on a target stage
dewey boots controls presses commands
beam array scans the rat into the computer forming a d rat image on screens dematerializing the physical rat
device revs down
rush runs his hand over the empty target stage
lab rat has vanished from the physical world
its digitized image rotates on monitors
flynn was trying to take it one step further
he wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace
you mean the urban legends
a computer sucked flynn into cyberspace a long time ago
we think it happened
rush gets a chill
it was a fluke
but flynn worked for years down here trying to make it happen again
one day a test went bad
a plasma reaction destroyed this lab
flynn was reduced to ash
rush views the charred remains in the glass case
photos of the destroyed lab
spooky evidence of a hellish death scene
i was never told how he died
it was all just weird you know because flynns the guy who hired me
but he was strange kept to himself i didnt know what job i was supposed to be doing
to sinclair then you came onboard the company woke up we had a direction
it was kind of pathetic because by the time flynn died everybody was too busy to care
he was brilliant in his way but genius without discipline leads to nothing
his reckless habits nearly ruined this company
and for sure got him killed
a last look at the charred remains of flynns machine
that kind of accident cant happen again
weve upgraded the system in ways flynn never could
the chips didnt exist until now
she presses commands
beams re materialize the lab rat on the target stage
jo jo is as good as new
hey jo jo
have good trip
she puts the rat in on her shoulder feeds it a tidbit
then she scrutinizes rush
rush considers meg then turns to sinclair
you want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us
the future of this company depends on it
rush looks to meg
she offers a reassuring nod
you can bring me back okay
ask jo jo
lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder
destroy the intruder by am tomorrow rush
i know if anyone can its you
ive had my eye on you for a long time
score this hit and ill make you my full partner in this company
rush is awe struck
ready willing able
he shakes sinclairs hand sealing the deal
i wont let you down
lets do it
meg removes target stage swings a custom target chair in place
rush lowers in place
meg buckles him in
last chance for a private word i promise ill get you back safely by am tomorrow
but you have to promise me something too youre a piece of work
you dumped me because you said i was too much about the companys needs and not enough about yours
well here we are the company needs their best guy and you just cant admit how much to hurts to nominate me
this bigger than us rush
listen to me
i dont know what youre going to find in there but whatever it is promise youll follow your heart and do the right thing
rush stares at here in shock
so you think i have a heart
meg breaks away retreating to the controls with sinclair
rushs trails her with his eyes he cant stop looking
under his breath i promise
meg initiates quantum digitizer sequence
rush watches pulsing chromatic light build down the units column coming toward him
plasma strobes cyan magenta
then groans wildly
somethings off balance meg worries
moves for the abort button
ceramic components stress and crack
rush clenches his seat terrified
system is losing stability
sinclair sees monitor sounds company wide alert x net theres been another breech
its the intruder again
we have to abort
we might not get another chance
sinclair pulls megs hand from the abort button and slams his hand on digitize
beam array scans rushs body reducing it to bits meg worries sinclair dives for cover plasma ball engulfs quantum digitizer
final bits of rush scan away
plasma ball fries the unit
meg and sinclair come up to find quantum digitizer in a smoking heap
target chair empty
light speed thrill ride hurling into digital chaos
rushs electrified body hurtles across the void eyes filled with terror and awe
shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape
rush enters this bizarre world crash flash stranger in a strange land
data energy zaps off his body interacting with the landscape circuitry around him
he fights it tries to control it
rush stands beholds the place
looks at his hands and arms clad in circuitry
he finds he had landed outside fortress like x net central server
alarms sounding inside
he turns looks up a firewall
hundreds of x takk troops hurry to look down
a figure comes at him down the wall streaking red
tron lands on a plateau above rush gazing down
they face each other equally perplexed
rush is no longer human but not quite a program either
energy zaps off his body infusing the surrounding circuitry
tron stares unblinking cyber ninja
rushs body circuits pulse with anger data surges out his feet across floor circuitry up to the plateau
energy interacts with trons body circuits siphoning off bits of code
code races across rushs eyes
x takks hustle onto the scene
tron leaps off the plateau cutting the data connection
he whips his disk off his back and throws
disk slams rush in the gut knocks him flat
x takks pursue tron tron recovers his disk vanishes in an outbound data stream losing his pursuers
x takks pull rush to his feet shocked
you crashed irrecoverably
uh well im not exactly rx has been rebooted
rx reboot was not authorized
pushing through police a sleek smart cyber babe mega
shes megs cyber twin twice the edge half the patience all the curves
rush is awed by the sight of her
i know who programmed you
i am mega x net intelligence
i am a spy
posing as rx
under which register were you rebooted
im a user
mega and x takks look at him like hes crazy
detain this impostor
x takks move to seize rush
no wait look
were on the same side here
i got an id on the intruder
mega touches rush exciting his energy flow
she reads data streaming in his eyes trons id info
how did he get that
plexor must know of this
mega and x takks escort rush across bridges in security portals
firewalls cool and part allowing them to pass
down a grand corridor past towering energy columns and throbbing green memory banks
they cross a bridge
view includes vast square concentric security rings surround a massive cubic power supply core
plexor toils over the latest security breech failing to decipher recordings of the intruder
rush is brought in buy mega
he double takes on plexor the cyber twin of sinclair
this is the one
plexor steps closer scanning rush
you are not rx
my name is rush
im a look i got an id on the intruder
do you know the program they used to call tron
plexor activates memory banks
accesses archive files of the original low rez tron so harmless so many years ago
bears little resemblance to the upgraded tron
you are in error
thats how hes getting past you
you dont see him for what he is
hes one of your own gone bad
tron was a crude security program from encoms old days
strictly low rez right
archived and forgotten
but his source code contains all the architecture of every encom system including x net
thats why some smart user dusted him off and upgraded him user
from the outside
people who write all of your instructions
plexor and mega trade a look
he displays random instability
users do not exist
how do we contact sinclair
you dont know
there must be a way to link him into this
rush touches plexors command console but his energy overloads the system x takks pull rush away
zero match for a sinclair
hes your boss
outside in the real world
assuming the existence of a world beyond this is a fatal error
plexor issues all commands
rush considers his predicament
im a program guess i got a piece of my code corrupted
whatever it is its given me power over tron
to x takks and mega they saw me read his circuits
can any other program do that
plexor looks to mega
he creates alternative data channels at will
yeah im a little unstable
but i can find tron for you
his eyes stream barcode data to x takks release him
x takk troops read plexors barcode command with their eyes
they let go of rush
plexor turns to mega
issues more barcode
interface with this one
exploit his ability
locate the program tron and destroy him on sight
instructions received plexor
mega exits with rush
plexors gaze lingers on rush
security portal opens
ultra sleek straithe vehicle glides out accesses a shiny new empty x net data optik highway
mega at the controls
rush rides beholding the lightshow wonder of cyberspace
i need to find a program called krod
hes a specialist in pattern recognition
he snagged the last known position on tron for me
mega scans data gets a fix on krod
this is a waste of x net resources
youre strictly random
we will never find the intruder this way
plexor ordered us to work together
you cant doubt his instructions right
of course not
but i am programmed to predict all possible errors
you contain an infinite quantity
meg for sure programmed you
i have no data on meg
im being random
mega speeds along empty x net optik highway
wide secure newly constructed
high above the tangle of chaotic clogged x net is amazing
its going to change everything
unless one rogue program called tron brings it down
do you believe he could
i calculated the probability
soberly he could crash it all
so were working together on this
as instructed i will interface
mega pulls straithe into construction nearly complete
mega leads rush to secured encryption gates
her eyes light with data the gate opens
the program krod is over there
across a bridge an old network hub city
like hong kong in wilder days
jammed with programs colorful data loud data transfer screams
what a dump
he heads across but mega hesitates
mega grudgingly follows
electro pop overload
rush and mega squeeze through crowds past screaming data pipes and sizzling circuitry
city is dominated by mugshots of tron enemy of the future mega locates a gleaming x net kiosk
a promoter krod extoles the virtues of the x net system three more hub cities have been attacked by viruses
crowd gets scared but x net opens soon
you will travel in total security
they cant wait
this is the one you seek
rush approaches krod
looks like miles rabbish
theres a bizarre moment of recognition between them
its gotta be krod
yeah yeah heeey
the best pattern recognition program ever
to mega this guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff
you know it dude
krod smiles big at mega refers to rush who is this guy
rush pulls krod aside
miles i mean krod you flew the search engine
you ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider
the red guy
id like to help you but truth is i just got rebooted from a big crash
theres nothing left in my memory from before
he taps his head
this will yield zero
rush thinks touches a surface
circuitry zaps from data coming off his hands
connections illuminate data races around walls and floors
programs stop what theyre doing amazed by the feat
mega is astonished and privately worried
rushs data flow illuminates surfaces with images from his memory the opening light cycle race
you were watching this lightcycle duel a red guy and a green guy head to head
krod gawks at the image but hes stumped
the green guy faked out the red guy but the red guy double faked the green guy
and the green guy splattered big time
it was awesome
how could i forget that
splat happens in rushs memory image
all goes white
where did the red guy go after that
you didnt crash right away
he escaped out this hidden exit krods points to another screen
wanted image of tron
the red guy
did you jack his coordinate
they slap high fives
krod double takes on rush
and the green guy was you
you got rebooted
they called you um dont tell me i got it eh call me rush
howd you do that thing with your hands
youre coming with us to the old game grid
were going to find tron and shut him down
they head out
krod falls in beside mega impressed by her
did i ever know you
rush krod and mega head deep into an obsolete abandoned region of low rez circuitry
the old game grid is this way he spins
rush and mega arent behind him
theyve climbed inside a defunct i o port like a retro tech temple
how do i uplink to the real world
the real world doesnt exist
nobody can uplink
these ports were for simulation only
but how did those poor misguided fools boot up the link
they stood in the center
held their disk above their head
rush pulls his disk off his back aims it skyward
energy flows off his feet interacts with the i o port floor
ruby communication beam shoots skyward
kelter and phlegman report to sinclair intruder attempted another break in
we patched the firewall but our manpower getting is maxed out
stay on it
guys hustle out
sinclair wheels as meg storms in
theres a message on your secure link
sinclair enters retinal id
text forms where is this coming from
meg hurries to the screen
text appears i am rush
my god hes there
rush its sinclair and meg
her words transform into text
rush raises his disk beaming data into the great unknown
smiles as he downloads the response
mega and krod watch nearby
i identified the intruder
i o port walls zap energy stressing rushs connection text appears intruder is upgraded version of tron
wasnt tron one of our programs
sinclair and meg trade baffled looks
plexor oversees construction
x takk commander points to something in the distance
beyond the horizon the ruby red beam reaches to the heavens
plexor sees it alarmed
text forms in magenta circuitry good work partner
i have a plan to crash tron
mega turns with alarm
walls thunder and crash in rush leaps clear with his disk massive romball data reformatting orb hurtles around the i o port zapping all it touches de rezzing data structures
into neutral gray blank matter
romball loops skyward
giant d rezz program crashes down from above retrieves romball hes enormous tough single minded
sinclair and meg hang on the broken transmission rush
words appear end of line
hed better not fail
d rezz screams like a modem hurls romball mega and krod dive clear romball misses them but blazes down two more i o ports
d rezz retrieves romball bears down on mega and krod
double points if you nail me
bring it on
d rezz turns his ugly sights on rush baited away from mega and krod
d rezz flexes and roars revealing an x net logo on his chest
end your routine
d rezz corners rush hurls his romball ball fires every circuit in its path bleaching away data energy
rush dodges cease
were on the same team
mega throws her disk plings d rezz on the skull
d rezz turns on her rush runs leaps on d rezzs back
like riding a gorilla d rezz flips rush to the ground pins him with one mighty hand raises his romball for the kill
im x net too
data flows from rushs body up d rezzs clamping arm
radiant energy between predator and prey
digits race in d rezzs eyes
a code unlocks
he looks down finally registering the x net markings on rushs outfit
d rezz lets go of rush slumps back on his haunches
lowers his head in shame
no hey hey big guy dont take it so hard
we all have bad days
rush rolls the big romball over a peace offering
mega and krod cautiously approach
he was carrying out his programming
all i o ports are scheduled for de rezz
d rezz hears this happy to be understood
he never talks
easy big guy
no harm no foul
d rezz we can use a guy with your raw power
you ready to be a hero for x net
d rezz stands clutches his romball
reporting for duty
now ive got somebody i can boss around
d rezz modem growls at krod
lets get to the game grid
rush leads them up an incline
grudgingly to rush you have a skill for manipulating other programs
when do i get a shot at hacking your code
our operating systems are incompatible
you act like ive got a virus
they come to a spectacular vista of the old game grid
low resolution uncool largely forgotten
there it is
the place we nail tron
obsolete abandoned computer game entry portal guarding entry to the old game grid beyond
an electro tech carnival zone gone dark
no life in sight
then beam of data energy sling shots at ground level solidifying to become a slender jumpy program called i beem
he wears the x net logo and a cracked disk on his back
hes highly unstable and way unplugged from the system like one of those japanese soldiers still fighting alone in the hills years after wwii was over
i beem sees something he panics zapping away in characteristic streaks of airborne data
he reassembles in a hiding place skittish observing rush mega krod and d rezz arrive
see giant pile of game vehicle parts blocking access to the grid
rush picks up an old light wand
krod finds one too
cut a path
d rezz hurls his romball zaps into vehicle parts
keep doing it
d rezz retrieves romball for another whack zap data energy beam snaps in front of them becoming i beem
he grips his rickety disk challenging them
relax buddy mega scans i beem
he freaks drops his disk grabs for it
pound him to bits d rezz
d rezz raises his romball to pulverize i beem
i beem freaks zaps away in his data beam as romball crashes down
i beem reforms further way then beside them he snatches his pancake disk the zaps away again emerging then high on the pile of parts
searching data bank
security specialist damaged in service rated unstable
ranting from above unstable
like they arent
they booted me off x net
ill show them
im doing my subroutine out here
nobody gets through this portal
he kicks parts avalanche fills the gap d rezz blasted
d rezz take out this blip
d rezz cocks romball
i beem freaks sling shots all over the place via his data beam tossing his wobbly disk
rush catches i beems disk
holds off d rezz
were from x net cpu
youre doing a great job out here
everybody knows it
mega throws rush a look
i beem comes up grateful
now have you seen a rogue program around here
known as tron
data zags to rush forming into i beem
the red one
that illegal function
he blasts through here and jumps over the top
i tell him access denied he jumps right over like i was never there
when did he come through last
right before you got here
rush trades looks with mega krod and d rezz
trail is hot
i beem weve got a plan to shut down that red violator
youre going to help us
let me at him
first youve got to let us onto the game grid
i beem stiffens reflexively vigilant
he scans the four of them again finally softening
he zaps to a wall near his giant barrier then proudly pushes aside a thin panel
beyond a corridor of game gear view expanses to reveal rush steps across the vast vector graphic grid surface
mega i beem krod and d rezz follow
this region is obsolete
rush kneels touches grid lines
circuits energize as his energy surges in all directions
he draws in data
theres bits of trons code all over
krod give d rezz and i beem the escape coordinate tron used on me
krods eyes flash data to i beem and d rezz
d rezz nods palming his romball
thats where tron will bail out
well make sure he needs to
go set up the trap
to d rezz you only get one shot at this big guy
stop him but dont destroy him right
hes got data i need
d rezz grips romball grunts affirmation
he and i beem head for the perimeter of the grid
if this is trons territory hell know were here
he cant resist a grudge match
hell take risks trying to beat me
thats how we trip him up
to krod whip it out
rush unsheathes his light wand
krod pulls out his own light wand
they both look at mega
shes got no light wand
you didnt bring one
i dont have one
hey not a problem krod holds his light wand forward activates it
light cycle up rezzes under him
he revs it ready to go
to mega hop on
hang on krod
rush activates his light wand
light cycle up rezzes under him with a special two tier seat for a second rider
i upgraded my unit
you are awesome man
i hate you
theres more on her mind shes not talking about
she smiles at rush climbs on back of his light cycle
a nod between rush and rush they take off
light cycles shoot across grid surface
mega screams and clutches rush throwing her body against his clamping her arms around him
krod and rush turn degrees rallying passing each other getting warmed up
its familiar territory
light cycles race toward each other on the same line
mega holds rush tight eyes filling with terror
fatal crash imminent
but krod and rush slow their light cycles with expert skill rolling safely to a halt nose to nose
directly over a big red dot
the only dot on the grid
mega rush and krod raise up to scan the horizon
its all clear flat grid to the horizon
any sign of him
everything looks the same to me
everything looks the same
krod snap out of it
tron will never expose himself
they watch wait pivot
d rezz and i beem search grid edge along the rocky boundary
i beem zaps himself further along finding glowing code numbers mark the end of each grid line
d rezz grunts points
one lights up tr
they follow the line off the grid where it leads into a narrow rocky pass
yes i see
this is going to be good
rush mega and krod wait on their light cycles
speck moves on the horizon turns a corner stays on the horizon
its a light cycle making a huge box around them
remember the plan krod
dont bail out until the last millisecond
lightcycle turns toward them coming fast
hang on tight mega
mega hugs rush
they speed away
approaching cycle comes at degree angle turns hard closes the distance
heartless eyes ruthless moves
rush turns quick baiting tron
tron turns to follow coming alongside
krod runs interference cuts sharp in front of tron
its a high stakes speed chase narrowly missing side walls and rock outcroppings
i beem zaps onto the grid tracks horizon dots
here they come
he zaps back to the edge signals upward
d rezz straddles the rock passage above ready to hurl his romball
tron takes the lead in a three way heat
revs to breath taking speed
rush and krod gain coming up on either side of tron
tron looks to each opponent
his eyes lock on mega
mega stares into trons cold eyes almost like shes trying to signal him
but tron returns his gaze forward as the rocky edge looms closer
you call that speed
rush kicks in a hyper burner surging forward
krod does the same
tron responds with more speed
rush and krod have tron sandwiched heading for the rock edge
tron pulls ahead aiming for the hidden crevasse
clings to rush
d rezz astride the crevasse sees light cycles speeding his way
hes got the rom ball poised to intercept tron
i beem de rezzes into the grid clearing the path
rush and krod taunt tron into the trap
but out of nowhere mega reaches to rushs handlebars and turns degrees too soon
hey what are you
tron sees the bail out knows somethings wrong
he looks ahead sees d rezz astride his crevasse escape root rom ball poised in the air
tron bails out degrees cutting behind krod
krod turns twice ending up in trons lane
to the side rushs light cycle screams toward solid rock vibrating out of control
rush grabs mega and jumps off
they slide on the grid holding each other
krods lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage
rush and mega slide to a halt in time to see their light cycle smashes rocks explodes in a million bits
krod shoots gap
d rezz is ready to smash him with his romball
tron is over there
d rezz makes mental switch hurls romball
romball bounces down solid rock onto game grid rolls with ferocious speed diagonally across the grid
romball curves to track tron like a great bowling shot
romball clips rear wheel of trons lightcycle
tron skids and tumbles
i beem zaps beside rush and mega
krod and d rezz join them
there he goes
tron climbs over rocks escaping through a tunnel
weve got him now
electro fire romball careens across grid bearing down on them
group dives clear
d rezz swings in a foot stopping the romball inches short of mowing down krod
i could have done that
he strobes freezes hits the deck
stalking their prey rush krod i beem and d rezz
we cant go any further
ahead vast old circuitry has been eaten through by dull throbbing greenish memory leakage
paths of unaffected material are narrow and maze like
what is it
dont ask dude
its a memory leak once it starts it infects everything
touch it and you crash forever
we cannot risk it
d rezz grunts
then its settled
krod turns to head home
listen to me
you might not believe theres a world outside of this one but lets just say a guy named sinclair is depending on me
if tron got through here then i can too
whos with me
d rezz steps forward then i beem
shamed krod joins them
finally mega makes it unanimous
i beem take d rezz see whats up ahead
well guard this portal until you come back
i beem and d rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission
krod pulls off his disk nervously practices boomerang throws
better show me how to use mine
its all in the velocity vector ratio
rush pulls the disk off his own back
he throws disk flies wild he runs to retrieve it
mega retreats to a side area partially eroded by memory leakage
she finds the remnants of com circuitry and stares data beams into its transducer
plexors vehicle circuitry forms image of mega
we interfaced with tron
he escaped into a dark zone
around a corner rush comes to retrieve his disk
he pauses to eavesdrop on megas communication the random one has proven effective
he is all glitches and bad data
he virtually got us de rezzed
i recommend we terminate this mission
rush listens hurt and angry
if you keep tron on the run he cannot attack x net
its a poor allocation of resources
you have your instructions
circuits go dark
mega turns running smack into all glitches and bad data
whats up with you
ever since i got here youve been working against me
i act as plexor programs me
blah blah blah
youve got you own processor
i can feel it working overtime
did meg program you to mess with me
i have no match for meg first you dont want to come with me then youre all over me on the light cycle so you can dump us over and
blow the plan
we would have nailed tron by now if it wasnt for you
whats your malfunction
dont troubleshoot me
the most effective alternative is to return to the main cpu and anticipate trons next attack
she moves to exit past him
he snags her arm pulls her back and kisses her
energy zaps between them racing through their body circuits
rush downloads the spiky sensation
mega remains cold and bewildered
outside krod tosses his disk moving to track as it arcs through the air
he notices rush and mega kissing
digs it vicariously
you ram hog
his disk clunks him on the head
mega breaks the kiss backing off conflicted
arcs of energy stretch between them then snap loose
its what im programmed to do
mega tries to ignore the kiss
she exits past the guys
what were you doing with her
she had a glitch
i was just pinging her eprom
she let you
theres a way through
rush krod and mega hurry to see i beem zap zap zaps toward them scared to death tron attacked us
d rezz has him cornered
rush stows his disk on his back weve got him now
eaten away by memory leaks like swiss cheese
rush mega krod follow i beem along narrow paths of unaffected material
krod trips his light wand tumbles and skates into memory leakage
it fries and de rezzes sucked into the molten silicon swamp
akakakaka agggggggg sounds like a modem but its a battle cry
rush comes to a point above and cut off from the fight
d rezz advances along a narrow gantry spinning his romball ready to hurl at tron flips over memory leakage gains position and throws his disk disk hits d rezz
plasma ball gash but d rezz is tough
he takes the damage cocks his romball guys
go around behind tron
rush darts down to help d rezz
mega rush hurry ahead
i beem zaps zags and reforms scared out of his mind
d rezz hurls his romball romball pings off two walls comes at tron from behind
tron spins milliseconds to spare and flips clear
retrieves his disk on the way down
romball slams off a wall heads back to d rezz but trons disk hits it knocking it off course
d rezz dives for romball but it falls into the memory leak and fries to bits
tron plants for a clear shot at d rezz
rush jumps down from above right in front of d rezz
he straightens standing in front of d rezz
lays eyes on tron
pick on somebody your own size
d rezz is twice as big as either of them
trons eyes are cold lifeless calculating
scanning his new opponent without success
youve got no data on me
rush pulls his disk off his back poised for a duel
tron moves with calculation grips his hyper etched disk
circling his prey
throws again rush ducks trons disk slams d rezz
d rezz tries to catch the disk but hes just too slow
rush throws his disk
beginners luck it banks off a wall and nearly smacks tron
rush snags it on the way back before it tumbles into memory leakage
tron jumps up two levels
retrieves his disk
d rezz pull me up
d rezz hoists rush up
fingers grab upper deck
tron jockeys for position
throws disk disk strikes d rezz in the ribs
d rezz loses footing
rush grabs upper level
d rezz slips toward memory leakage
rush grabs d rezzs hand he weighs a ton
mega krod and i beem cant get here to help hang on man
but d rezzs big hand slips out of rushs
d rezz plummets into memory leakage zapping away in a blaze of glory he comes to his feet facing tron
i know who you are
encom security program tr tron
who is your user
tron glitches at the question
who programmed you
i know your encryption code
tell me your user or i shut you down
tron throws his disk
he sends waves of data energy through floor circuits reaching into trons body
i can shut you down with a nine digit code
who is your user
trons body animates painfully as the first three code digits click into place
tron flips away breaking contact with floor
data transfer stops
tron steals away through a tunnel
krod mega and i beem clamber for a way to follow
circular riddled with memory leaks
rush hurries to the center
no sign of tron
tell me tron
who programmed you
heres your encryption code
rush sends data coursing into floor circuits
it radiates up walls across bridges
and finds tron in hiding
data races into trons body
six code numbers engage he glitches
he leaps to breaks the contact flinging his disk trons disk slams rush
rush tumbles off a ledge dangling over a memory leak
tron pounces in
snags his disk
tron steps on rushs hand
pain energy jolts rushs circuits
rush slips grabs a slim protrusion
feet zapping an inch from the memory leakage
tron throws his disk for a final time
it arcs wide coming around directly at rush
tron leans down gazing into rushs eyes
burst of searing data surges off rushs hands radiating up circuitry loading into trons body
all nine code numbers lock in
trons body seizes
he fights the data intrusion but his circuits sequentially shut down
trons airborne disk wobbles and darkens
tron tumbles off the edge plummets past rush
disk misses rush skates into darkness
mega krod and i beem hurry in and see rush climbing to safety
and below trons body slips into the memory leakage zapping away to bits
you got him
but mega looks dreadfully worried
she slips away
krod and i beem climb down and help rush to his feet
game over dude
you crashed him
rush gazes off the precipice
remains of tron is consumed by the swamp of memory leakage
its more than i wanted
now ill never know who his user is
i will be upgraded
theyll give us a slot in the main server
i will be upgraded
i will be krod slams him makes him stop
rush now you can finish pinging megas eprom
rush looks around
where is mega
she was just here
right behind me
he finds trons disk picks it up
its dark and lifeless circuits gray
sounds echo around them
electro metallic footsteps
rush krod and i beem bunch together and pivot
black clad finity fighters appear blocking all exits
disks ready for attack
rush double takes on faces among them quantz tall silent hardcore looks like real world phlegman and boole rotund seen it all like real world kelter
theyre scanning us
i beem go for help
zap your butt out of here
but i beem freezes terrified
fighters tighten perimeter
it had to happen
but why now of all times
rush and krod turn
fighters defer to a dark figure limping forward one leg badly deformed by data corruption
a user shows up
rush is surprised then pleased
somebody finally gets it
yeah im a user
a superior being
the first to enter this realm
and you are
figures circuitry lights
finally we see the face
it is flynn
how can you be here
you know this dude
yeah hes a lunatic
i beem panics zaps away in an energy beam
he reforms further along for a breath then zaps further away
three finity fighters chase him
rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of encoms former leader
flynn comes closer recognizing rush
i remember hiring you
they are equally dumbfounded
somebody tipped these guys off about us
not soon enough
fighters step aside mega enters furious at rush
you werent supposed to beat tron
i thought for sure hed finish you
you destroyed our last hope
i detect a pattern in her behavior
shes a spy
mega and rush ooze mutual contempt
rush turns on flynn
no wonder i couldnt figure it out
i assumed tron user was on the outside
if id known this i would blown past him and come straight for you
flynn yanks trons disk from rush peers over the precipice
below the last of tron is consumed by memory leakage
flynn ponders trons lifeless disk
he falters on his bad leg
mega throws an arm around to help him stand
melancholy energy courses between them
i failed our cause
you did everything you could
they know each other well
rush registers jealousy but larger concerns prevail flynn never died
dawning because your quantum digitizer worked
thats how you got here
i know thats how i got here too
flynn studies rush anger rising
the day after i hired you you start sucking up to sinclair
you thought i didnt know
bet he offered your a partnership for this right
you have no idea the damage youve done
im only getting started
man you were the company joke
now i see why
you melted down your lab to take this little joyride
you got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other peoples hard work
open your eyes geek
my lab was rigged
my death was no accident
i pushed the button just in time to escape
almost in time
he indicates his deformed leg
mega krod and the others listen with awed bewilderment
these two guys speak of a world unknown to them
who would want you dead
the same guy i programmed tron to shut down
same one youve been sucking up to
and his cyber henchman plexor
malicious grumbles from fighters
too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here old man
rush you lamer
youve been working for the bad guy
three fighters return from the i beem pursuit
he got away
flynn scowls at rush
sin number two
flynn slips trons dead disk in a special case
x net goons will soon be all over this place
energy zaps across grid forming into i beem
hes on the run de rezzing zapping reforming bolting for i beem de rezzes reforms zaps himself toward the nearest x net optik highway
fighters thread secret buffers and gates
flynn carries trons disk helped along by mega
rush and krod are held prisoner prodded by quantz and boole
they cross a data bridge drawn to the sounds of shreiking vast retro multi level
diverse and beautiful energy flows
flynn mega rush krod and fighters come to a stunning view gleaming new x net data optik highway is being constructed right through the heart of the city
i hired sinclair as encoms business guy so i could do the dreaming
right off he wanted to capture the market on data transmission
had this plan called x net based on flawless efficiency hyperlock security encryption protocol uniformity
i was the boss i told him to forget it
i knew it could go bad
but the guy had trouble taking no for an answer
he arranged for my lab to melt down
sinclair took over my company and put x net on a fast track
and heres where its brought us
city descends into panic
x takk troops evict programs seize prisoners and mercilessly hunt down resistors
x net construction crews build the optik highway with relentless precision blasting aside the old citys splendid structures
what are they doing
beating the competition
x takk troops storm closer by the hundreds
theyve got us outnumbered
weve got to choose our battles wisely
he leads them down a secret portal into group moves along a catwalk coming to a view of x takks herd captured resistor programs lining them up for execution
rush why is x net doing this
a kid program runs to this captured father program
let my daddy go
x takks haul kid program clear then blast the captives with de rezz weapons
captives glitch thrash and expire
how long has this been going on
like any other day
except a high rise buildings lights flicker off
a subway escalator stops
a traffic light turns red on both sides
cars honk tempers flare
a tv store all tvs in the window flip to one channel which happens to be running a commercial for x net theme total data security
x takk troops line up more captive programs
sinclair never told us about this
x net is creating the very terror that makes people want the security of x net
no more glitches freeze ups or shut downs
once x net is open plexor will destroy all other systems
all data flow will be controlled by his master user sinclair
all data flow sinclairs to control and abuse
bank accounts medical histories your blockbuster account your buying patterns your e mail
and to think rush all this time youve been working trying to impress a him
x takk troops blast captive programs
atm machine goes berserk
block full of pedestrians suddenly and simultaneously cant get their cell phones to work
gps navigation system map flips around
turn left now
turn right now
suv driver panics pulls a hard turn and smashes a bus
sinclair betrayed me
finally you get it
tron was our late hope
weve got to stop this
x takks hear rushs shouts
an overwhelming force
flynn and mega shove rush into a tunnel closing the portal flynn hastens their journey
rush was trying to expose us
they didnt see us
mega boole and quantz move along shoving krod and rush
weve got to tell people on the outside plexor shut down all the i o ports
only he communicates with the outside
sinclair holds all the cards
flynn turns on rush one of sinclairs cards
how did you get here
megan randall sent me
points out mega her user
she fixed your lab and sent me here to take out tron
i remember her
smart wise beyond her years
i cant believe shed fall for sinclairs lies
he glances at mega then shoves rush along
flynn mega fighters bring rush and krod into the clandestine fighter base
like a wartime casualty center with corrupted fighter programs lining corridors
what happened to them
try to attack plexor head on this is what happens
because of you there will be millions more
they arrive at a laser barred jail block where a dozen big x takk troops are held prisoner
lock up these two
well hold them for ransom
or use them for target practice
flynn and mega turn to go
boole and quantz use prod lances to herd rush and krod
you think im sinclairs flunky but im not
rush speaks low so x net captives cant hear
im sorry about tron
yeah were sorry
we were just doing a job we had no way of knowing the truth
no way at all
flynn i was wrong about you
youve been doing the right thing in here
plexor has to be shut down
sinclair has to be exposed
like he said
krod and i are ready to help
flynn puzzles over rush
mega what do you read in him
mega circles rush scanning his circuits
independent operating instructions
he will act as necessary to increase probability of his own survival
you dont know me
he cannot to be trusted
youre the one whos been lying to me the whole time
rush points a finger at mega bolt of attraction energy shoots off his finger zaps her on the nose
megas circuits overload she flies back rush startled looks at his finger
fighters muscle rush and krod away
flynn holds mega anger re ignited
megas been risking her existence for our cause lamer
thats more than youll ever do
to fighters lock them away
fighters toss rush and krod in the jail block with the big x takk soldiers
does finger signs body circuit language
x net rules man
rush peers out of his cage watching mega go
she turns for a final scowl then exits
x takk troops sound alert
outside the main portal energy zaps and splinters above ground circuits collecting to become i beem reforming running stumbling
some body parts out of sync catching up
state encryption code
breathless he loses count
zaps beside himself
you are positive tron was destroyed
i observed it directly
rush turned tron into vaporware
x takk troops trade looks impressed
rush claims to be a user
he must be
he is awesomely skilled
users do not exist
he is but a randomized program he got lucky
to our benefit
rush and krod were surrounded by stealth fighters
they were led by another user called flynn
plexors circuitry strobes in dark troubled hues
an image appears on his archive screen flynn
yeah thats the one
he is the one behind this scheme to crash x net
i know where they are
rush and krod need our help
and what of mega
we couldnt find her
im certain they captured her too
plexor processes his cranial circuits burn deep amber
tron is gone but his user lives
plexor turns to i beem grateful
removes i beems flimsy broken disk studies it gently
good work does not go unrewarded at x net
would you like to be upgraded
yes plexor very much so
plexor energizes a reward portal
shimmering golden light beckons i beem
he eagerly enters and gets zapped
i beem emerges out the other side a zombie like x net drone joining a security crew
plexor enters raises his disk
ruby red beam connects
sinclair paces amid a buzz of manic activity
tvs show news of escalating global data crashes
in comes a marketing vp
youre not going to believe this
sales office has been flooded with calls
major banks airlines city governments the presidents of nations they all want to sign up for x net now
were not even on line yet and were a hit
sinclair absorbs his good fortune
were the only port in the storm
execs cheer trade high fives
sinclair notices a blip on his private data screen
the office clears doors shut
sinclair alone now interacts with his screen
text intruder has been eliminated
but there remains an area of uncertainty
the user called flynn is here
sinclair reads the text blind sided
sees a photo of flynn
flynn commanded the intruder tron
youve got to be wrong about this
i was programmed error free
sinclair ponders the unimaginable
he leads a group who seek to prevent the opening of x net
the one called rush has joined them
what lies has flynn filled him with
or what truths
sinclair peers at the screen text agitation growing
a news article pops up recounting the lab accident and flynns death
x net launch countdown ticks
this world can never know all i have done
you have a plan to contain flynn
dont just contain him
and the one called rush
sinclair mulls for two seconds then he knows too much
get rid of him
rush and krod get chummy with cell mate x takks
they mock fight together getting insider tips
and whatever you do dont let them hit you here
indicates a circuit nexus on his lower spine
all x net programs have a weak spot there
hear that krod
never let them get to your weak spot
krod twists around playing with his spinal nexus
i never knew that
pull back to see flynn secretly observes rush
boole arrives behind him
were ready for you now
they head upstairs
flynn reviews fighter training
troops throw disks battle in pairs repair weapons tweak armor circuitry
flynn carries trons dark disk contemplating it
he moves past a line up of his finest fighters
if x net is allowed to open its the beginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace
we cant let plexor get away with this
our game plan has not changed
tron was specially programmed to break into x net and shut down power supplies
we would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system
trons role was essential one of you must take his place
he holds up trons disk
who among you can power trons disk and carry out his mission
all fighters take a step forward
its the most dangerous job
if youre not up for it nobodys going to blame you
all stand firm
flynn lays trons disk in the first fighters hands
fighter summons his will causing the disk to glow faintly
but it soon goes dark again
next fighter holds the disk bearing down animating the circuits
but he buckles and the disk falls dims
mega worries one by one fighters fail to power trons disk
flynn reaches the end of the line
mega puts her hands out to receive the disk
flynn hesitates then hands her trons disk
mega clenches it concentrating deeply
her energy infuses the disk animating its circuits stronger than anyone
bur soon her eyes strobe her body circuits overload
she lets go
trons disk thunks the floor goes dark
mega hardens her resolve
there are other ways to crash plexor
i will return to him he still trusts me
i will get close and crash him with direct contact its futile
plexors personal defense measures are massive
other fighters chime in but they dont know what to do
a fighter sentry dashes in
enemy scouts headed this way
rush krod and x tekk prisoners heard commotion in the main hideout area above
phalanx of x net security cruisers moves in mashing circuitry x tekk troops rowst civilian programs
plexor commands lead cruiser
disperse to all sectors
cruisers with x takks split in several directions
x takk squads crash fleeing programs
cruisers with x takk troops ravage grid moving into x net cruisers crash through
assembler units spew freshly programmed bridges over memory leak swamps
x takk troops hustle deeper
x takks storm in
specialized units scan memory leaks detect code fragments schematic images of tron
the invader tron crashed here
plexor surveys the place
this was a preferred gaming arena for the user called flynn
his moves are predictable recursive easily traced
plexor activates a q minator
device emits a plane of coherent pulsing energy which scans the area illuminates the racing data bit patterns within all circuits programs and surfaces
an x ray like device that reveals all computer machine code underlying every cyberspace object
a trail of code burns hot neon green
x net cruisers crash the city
plexor commands lead cruiser sweeps q minator
running civilian programs are rendered naked by the beam bodies revealed as volumes of buzzing data bits
cruisers deploy de rezz beams slicing open structures
flashing bitstorm screaming civilian programs the wrath of x net is unleashed upon the city
walls slice and crumble x net cruisers blast their way in coming to a stop in precise formation
plexor emerges from lead cruiser
the place is empty
not a fighter in sight
search every buffer and cache
get us out of here
plexor and x takks hustle down finding rush krod and the x takk prisoners behind bars
x takk specialists hack the system power down jail bars
prisoners step forth and retrieve their impounded disks
dude are we glad to see you
you destroyed tron
where is mega
shes not with you
shes with flynn
i mean totally with flynn
cuts off krod covers flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first
duped she contains sensitive data
flynn cannot be allowed to hack her
rush and krod notice behind plexor and his soldiers boole quantz and finity fighters move into position
they signal rush and krod not to blow their cover
rush makes krod comply
an ambush is ready to spring
yeah only we kicked flynns butt too
you should have seen it
flynn wont be a problem
x takk prisoners are confused
why were you imprisoned
fighters pounce throwing disks rush grabs a prod lance nails two x takks on their spinal nexus
they go down hard
delete them all
plexor hurls an energy ball rush ducks grazed by its fractal comet trail
fighters beat back plexor
his concerns shift
he ducks into an ascension shaft rush and krod are left fighting back to back out manned three to one
plexor races upward but is blocked by a unit of fighters
plexor pulls off his special triangular death disk flings it
disk ricochets off three fighters knocking them out
another lethal fling and the remains fighters fall
plexor retrieves his death disk with heart stopping accuracy darts into its a trap
x takk troops react bolting for their cruisers
floor circuits activate x takks zap and freeze
fighters appear from all directions
disks fly x takks wield stout mazer weapons even the corrupted fighter programs pitch in working in clever teams chipping away at plexors forces
but x takks have tougher armor and more awesome weapons
x takk mazer cuts down fighters by the dozen leaving them corrupted or shut down
flynn struggles to help wounded fighters he captures a mazer and uses it against x takks
but flynn cant move well on his bad leg
he watches his troops getting trounced
over that way
move around their flank
a mazer blast strikes flynns bad leg
mega appears throws her disk with deadly accuracy
the offending x takk soldier crashes
millions of bits spray over main arena fractal fireworks
mega grabs flynn from falling
they make for a bridge
flynn slaps a wall panel
trigger circuit activates surging down into
circuit energizes a sector of floor circuits which overload and blaze frying twenty x takks
rush and krod use puny prod lances against fearsome x takks
rush charges an x takk dude krod gets cornered by another
rush dodges his death blow spine zapping his foe
krod prepares to die as x takk bully pins him with a mazer and squeezes the trigger
x takk bully seizes freezes crashes
mazer barrel falls away from krod hes lucky to be alive
rush stows zap wand grabs mazer and yanks krod to his feet
ill never let you forget it
rush were screwed
now everybodys after us
nah were cool
were with them
boole and quantz sweep past gathering rush and krod into their unit
they charge up the ascension shaft
plexor hurls death disk takes out fighters
he spins looks up glimpses flynn and mega running along a ledge
he heads after them working his way upward
rush and krod emerge behind an x takk cruiser
they knock out two x takk soldiers steal their mazer weapons
fighter specialists hustle in attach encryption pods to the cruiser
data meltdown radiates from the key burning through the cruiser like paper
can i do one
rush spots plexor heading to upper levels
flynn and mega help corrupted fighters toward the bridge
a wounded fighter is struck down
triangular death disk swings wide takes out another then the last
mega and flynn spin to see plexor steps forward retrieving his death disk
blocking their exit
mega move aside
i will finish him
instead she shields flynns body
strike us down
there will always be more to oppose you
sinclairs circuits snap with rage
what programming has he installed in you
go with the others
im not leaving you with this phreak
plexor brings back his death disk
in the shadows rush creeping along the periphery gaining position on plexor
plexor get over the control thing
plexor readies his disk to fire drop the disk
he pivots hurls death disk at rush
rush dives clear sends his data energy into surrounding circuits
circuits activate around plexor surging pain data into his body
ill be damned
but plexor resists rushs data infusion freezing the circuits around his feet
cutting off the flow
death disk slices walls arcing back toward plexor rush leaps at plexor
plexor is solid state like a cast iron statue
rush flips airborne goes down hard
plexor considers rush astonished by his audacity
sucks air is that all youve got
its a milliseconds distraction death disk returns to plexors hand but swings wide and grazes his arm leaving a swath of painful corruption
x takks hustle in with hefty negabyte blasters
flynn mega and flynn dash across the bridge
negabyte beams slice walls erasing all data in their path
rush flynn and mega dive into a tunnel escaping by inches
rush mega and flynn pursued rendezvous with krod boole and quantz
down the pipe
rush helps krod quantz and boole into a data pipe
one by one they whirl away in the flow of chromatic data
flynn and mega have a breathless moment to consider rush
hes better than i thought
hes been sent for a reason
dont know yet
sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan
mega struggles to compute
rush turns to help flynn down the pipe
flynns wounded leg gives out he slips
rush holds him but loses his balance slides down
but she hesitates velcronic beams snag her from behind pulling her back onto the ledge
rush tumbles down the flume glancing back to see mega hauled away by x takk troops
fighters krod rush and flynn surf down the data whirl accelerating away from the hot zone
x takks jump in after them but are all swallowed by the flow gone
bashed and ruined littered with fallen fighters
plexor nurses his injured arm commanding the mop up
x takks bring mega to their leader
we got her
mega stands defiant
plexor regards her sternly
extends his hand to her shoulder cupping the back of her neck
you committed a fatal error
data energy surges from his eyes flushing her body circuits
she fights intensifying input but soon weakens
she glitches and shuts down falling into the arms of x takks
their strategies and tactics lie encrypted in her memory
i will hack from her what i need
flynn leads the way surfing the chromatic hyper speed flow with quantz and boole
rush and krod struggle to master the technique rolling slipping recovering grabbing each other
i got it i got it i got it
boole surfs around them heading into a squirrely curve
krod swings high out of control
dumps in front of rush who flips him upright
rush and krod swerve and gathers speed shooting past quantz boole and flynn pivoting to surf backwards
i remember now
nothing to it
check it out
rush flips up and surfs on his hands
krod attempts to match the move
rush and krod crane around to see data pipe spills into a massive data flume
rush and krod plummet into surging hot data out of control
flynn and fighters expertly surf huge waves
flynn boole and quantz drag rush and krod from data shallows
everyones circuits are hot and overloaded
not a problem
they let him go him go
krod glitches collapses
rush gets to his feet head spinning
they took mega
she can handle herself for a while
how do we attack plexor next
flynn sizes up his new convert
youre with us now
do you know hard it is
opposing the power of plexor
its like the forty sixth level of conquerdome
while winning a side game of tetras ultra doing six instant messages and debugging a demo
boole quantz and krod are confused but flynn gets it
all at the same time
flynn accepts a handshake from rush
were going to need all the help we can get
boole can we make it to the dark zone from here
there is one possible route
well meet up with the code monkeys and combine forces
group sets out across a vast region of unpowered circuitry
hordes of captured programs are lined up for termination
among them wounded fighters from the hide out raid
we gave it everything
we can resist
they move close holding each other
x takks fire
de rezz beams zap them to bits
computer users react with frustration as their programs crash users correspond in appearance to the programs who just got zapped
web ads sell the virtues of x net
fire sprinklers fire off for no reason
workers rush away sprayed from above
assembly line full of partially assembled video recorders get dowsed with water
pilots react navigational instruments glitch and fail
x net sales rise higher as tv news grows bleaker
sinclair is distracted by a data file news stories about the death of flynn
the laboratory accident
lording over the grand scale construction
sterile design sleek lines enormous capacity
x net drone workers assemble beams girders circuitry
x net optik highway network blasts through old systems and extends across cyberspace with alarming speed
is completion on schedule
plexor boards his cruiser which speeds onto a completed stretch of x net optik highway
hes the only vehicle in sight hogging a thousand brand new lanes of data expressway
plexor accelerates relishing the thrill of unchecked power plexors cruiser speeds through a new as yet unused x net switching station
its heavily secured
x takk troops defer to their supreme leader
plexor veers onto a proprietary side route bound for firewall apertures cool anticipating plexors arrival
encryption portal opens
plexors cruiser glides in
firewalls reactivate blazing red hot sealing the fortress
powerful armored x takk guards stand in pairs at every portal corner and column
plexor strides past steps into a special gate
data beams react with his circuitry
encryption key resolves
plexor strides across the spare sleek space
on a slab lies mega radiated from above by reader beams
plexor considers her glowing body circuits
studies emerging data patterns
satisfied he halts the process
beams go dark
mega awakens sits up
she sees the device then plexor
you treat me like ive been corrupted
i cannot predict the random effects flynn might have caused in you
you programmed me to gather intelligence
thats all ive ever done
how long have you known flynn
enough time to gain his trust
your behavior was highly authentic
it had to be
have you allowed flynn to complete a full interface with you
i am programmed to allow such access only to you plexor
her eyes lock on him
he is satisfied
flynn claims to be a user
as did the one called rush
users do not exist
you have seen nothing to make you doubt this
they possess no powers beyond those of routine programs
i have no knowledge of such powers
she steps down
they walk out of the chamber
still there is something about them i cannot compute
flynn plans to attack me doesnt he
and rush will fight by his side
where will they strike
flynn does not decide until the hour of his attack
but he trusts me completely
when he knows the place i will know it as well
they will be met with a final thrashing
yes let them come
they pass through the gate arrive in the corridor
have you further instructions for me
none for now
but stay close
they lock gazes
barcode data surges between them
you came to me full of glitches and random routines
look at you now
what an extraordinary piece of programming i have made of you
i created x net to the same standard of flawless beauty
soon its perfection will become all that is and all that ever will be
all events remain under your control
with a smirk and a final jolt of data plexor leaves her
plexor crosses into his inner sanctum
raises his disk initiates ruby beam link with sinclair
mega appears on a balcony above in the shadows secretly observing plexor
howling barren dim
circuitry left unpowered for eons
rush and krod follow flynn and fighters into treacherous canyons across vast planes
rush hears something and pulls the group behind cover
three massive x net x porter vehicles rumble by
imprisoned in the rear are hundreds of programs
cruisers blast a path through mountains and speed away
those programs think theyre just being transferred
can we take out those x net guys
our forces are too thin
we cant risk a battle that would reveal this position
from another direction appear two code monkey programs
we configured a base
good to see you guys
when did the x net goons start patrolling all the way out here
theyre everywhere now
taking all programs by force
there is much to report
they head down into deteriorating silicon lattice
flynn rush krod and fighters arrive to a meager encampment
this is rush and his main man krod
they defected from plexors forces to fight with us
a buzz of hope penetrates gloom
nobody has defected from plexor before
we made progress decoding x nets power supply encryption
in a make shift lab code monkeys demonstrate working at mind boggling speed assembling a small intricate hologon device conical pyramid shaped encryption key
ive seen that somewhere
its the encryption pattern on plexors disk
weve got mole programs who score chunks of plexors personal code anywhere they can find it
these guys fit the pieces together
it can take a quadrillion combinations
we just snagged the last piece but the battle cost us big time
how many of you crashed
heads shake somberly
the teraflop boys
all that survive you see standing here
flynn falters on his bad leg
quantz and boole support him
time is running out
rush approaches code monkeys as they toil blur speed trying to fit the final code piece a flat square
pyramidal hologon looks exactly like the x net desk toy we saw in rushs cubicle
i get tired just watching these dudes
rush sees compilers try to fit the square inside the pyramid
just for laughs try putting the circle on top of the pyramid
unison thats incongruous
if im wrong ding me
what have we got to lose
code monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid
square spins into a circle latches and lights the entire hologon lattice
intricate d code patterns animates
good thing you didnt terminate us
how do we use this thing to shut down plexor
picks up hologon its a copy of plexors master key
we can break into any x net facility and fry the power supply
but once plexor knows we have it hell change the code
weve got one shot
then we should take out the power supply to plexors main server
take out plexors central server
hang on guys thats not as easy as it sounds i was inside the main server i saw how its laid out
i used to work there
ill recognize where everything is
we can take it
hit plexor where he lives
even with this key it wont we can pull it off cant we flynn
one final assault on plexors central server
shut him down forever
all eyes on flynn
rushs naivete has ignited false hope in the fighters
of course we can
flynn forces a smile
hey the future depends on us
how could we fail
sinclair comes off the secured elevator finds meg and dewey at work on quantum digitizer
its almost fixed
ill be able to bring back rush soon excellent work
unfortunately im shutting down this project
something came up
the company is at stake
i cant go into details
but rush would have no way to return
i will never hold you responsible
this is a tough call but its mine
dismantle and destroy all of this equipment and software
im not asking
he shoots a look and exits
compiler crews work at megahertz speed
optik highways extend and converge
switching stations assemble
crews shift to new assignments
pull wide to see dismal ground below
dark zone emitting woeful blips of random energy
pillars descend from x net crews above and smash into the old silicon planting themselves deep and impervious
rush stands on a vista point aghast as x net construction dominates the landscape
its a bummer being on the losing team huh rush
flynn sits nearby trying to patch his corrupted leg
well trash x net
then well go back to the our world and expose what sinclairs done
he looks at krod boole quantz and code monkeys in the distance preparing for battle
do they have any idea our world exists
do they understand what a user is
programs once connected freely with their users
but plexor shut down the i o ports severing all links
he controls all contact with the world we once knew
programs operate on his instructions or none at all
its nothing to brag about
were getting our butts kicked
it there a way to contact meg
she can transport us back to our world
maybe its better if we fight sinclair on his own turf
flynn lays a somber gaze on his eager fighters
i gave up the idea of going back a long time ago
you should too
what do you mean
sinclair didnt get where he is by being dumb
even if we survive plexors forces in here sinclair will make sure we never get back home
meg said im sure shell do everything she can
it might not be enough
flynn removes a cover plate from his leg trying to hide the damage from rush
suspicious rush pulls the plate aside
flynns data corruption has worsened
his leg throbs with the drab glow of irreversible memory drain
why didnt you tell anyone it was this bad
flynn looks at his leg
then at rush
i think meg suspects the truth about sinclair
thats why she sent you here
she knew youre the one guy who could find out
i thought she hated me
she believed in you more than you believed in yourself
it sinks in
do we really have a shot at winning against plexor
we have his master key
and we have mega working on the inside
are you sure about her
i get the feeling she plays both sides
plexor programmed her to perform his will
hes a control freak
i programmed her to have a will of her own
whatever she decides its up to her
sometimes youve got to trust the bigger plan
krod and fighters approach
ready to rock and roll
rush is right about our final attack
if weve only got one shot we should go for plexors central server
if we insert the hologon key in the main power supply we can trigger a meltdown
plexor will be have his best troops standing in our way
getting past them was the ultimate task i programmed tron to carry out
he takes up trons dark disk
i turbo charged him to burn hot and burn fast
who else could handle the operating code in this disk
he extends the disk to rush
uhhh i dont think so
it could mean the difference between winning and losing
hey ill try
rush holds off krod takes the disk
what do i do
waves of rushs data energy surge into disk circuitry
he buckles and shakes
its all about giving as much as you get
let it become a part of you
rush clenches teeth concentrates
grips the disk
energy surges back and forth up rushs arms around the disk
he holds tight ready to scream awesome dude
dont let go
fighters are amazed as trons disk powers up and rushs body circuits dazzle in the ruby circuitry patterns of tron
damn look at that
he did it
rush looks at his arms astounded
his circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red
disk animates and unfolds revealing infinite surface variations
rush feels new power surging inside his body
his eyes harden keen like trons
rush leaps backward goes airborne lands on a ledge high above
excellent move dude
rushs voice is a little deeper with a digital edge
it surprises him
he cocks his disk and throws
disk rockets across the landscape a mile away and strikes an x net survey post blasting it to bits
disk arcs high shoots back toward rush
rush looks worried for a second ready to duck dont flinch rush
its your disk now
disk snaps back into rushs hand painlessly
throbbing with energy
oh man this is good
rush pulls a new light wand from a thigh bracket
it extends into a hundred foot vaulting pole
rush vaults across the canyon lands with precision
light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond
where can i get one of those
another two vaults and a leap rush tosses his disk into a spiral steps off it mid air like stairs and lands perfectly rejoining the group
cheers from krod quantz boole and code monkeys
flynn shakes rushs hand energy surges between them
its for real quantz
weve got a chance to take down plexor
plexor reviews a line of elite x takks
all are decked in thick battle gear gripping an array of menacing ultra tech weapons
any three of you could crash an army of flynns best
but ive prepare for his random acts by designing massive redundancy
widen to reveal battalion of x takks lined in precise rows filling the vast hall
since adolf hitler no one has displayed such an awesome military machine
mega sneaks in alone
she pulls her disk off her back and raises it above her head
data energizes around her
she clenches hard trying to make the connection
a ruby beam converges off her disk reaching skyward
meg and dewey work to dismantle the lab
meg walks past stops
reads fresh text on a computer screen does meg exist
this your idea of a joke
cybavor programming complete
x net specialists drops the sides on a cubic cage
a frozen dog like cybavor creature stands like a statue
x net specialist activates
cybavor comes alive
plexor summons an x net worker drone
install yourself over there
worker drone does as hes told
he freezes in place
cybavor leaps like a hyena bounds the length of the hall
dives at the worker drone
and devours him mercilessly
energy sparks fly circuits zap as the cybavor digest the energy grows larger then splits down the middle like dna then regrows the missing halves
now the cybavor is a pair of nasty snarling cybavors
surveying his perfect defenses he notices one thing missing
where is mega
only you are authorized to monitor her coordinates
await my command
x takks file out in perfect lines turn perfect corners dispersing into the compound
each one moves in exactly the same way
plexor turns sharply to exit encountering
standing there obediently
on the fortress perimeter x takks stand watch at the base of a deep security moat
they turn eyes scanning
behind them a light pole extends into the canyon then swings across
its tronified rush using his vaulting pole to ferry fighters across the moat edges
he returns to the far side landing momentarily on a lone central pinnacle to make the distance
rush vaults back to gather krod whos the last to cross
dont take this the wrong way
dont drop me
he hugs krod and vaults them across
krod clings and struggles then yelps x takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges
on top of the pinnacle rush and krod hunker
flynn signals from the far side stay down
x takks patrol below pausing to gaze up
atop the pinnacle krods circuits energy zap with fear
rush holds him down
at last x takks move on
rush extends his light pole to the moat floor vaults to the far side with krod
krod stabilizes looks around
yeah i recognize this place
i know where everything is
he heads off encounters a dead end
quantz pulls him the right way
boole and code monk b t help flynn to a secluded data buffer
rush up there
rush leaps to a high circuitry nexus
i hope youre right about mega
rush touches circuitry energizing it with data
megas image appears in circuitry energy patterns
where is flynn
were all here
i arranged for your entry
an encryption portal has been left unlocked
do you know the way
rush looks down to code monk j r
he gives a high sign
mega watches glowing circuity image of rush
we got it
rushs image vanishes
mega thinks for a moment were not sure what then walks around a corner
bumps smack into plexor
flanked by his two snarling cybavors
you contacted them
i gave them the portal address
they will attempt entry soon
we will be waiting
patrols of x takks pass
rush leaps to a vantage point them
scouts a route signals flynn krod boole quantz and the code monkeys
fighter team scales a narrow ledge near the blazing firewall
its like a sheet of molten lead pouring endlessly before them
a lethal barrier
this is all yours rush
rush pulls his disk holds it over his head and steps under the molten data flow
he struggles against raw power disk heats up white splashing aside the molten data
code monkeys flynn and krod quantz and boole dive between rushs legs emerging on the other side
rush leaps out of the firewall clutching his white hot disk
to himself that way to the portal
lets do it
they head for the fortress along a surreptitious route avoiding x takk patrols
plexor with mega and the cybavors two paces behind leads an army of x takks
a cybavor growls at mega
she growls back
there it is
thats the portal
plexor masses his forces around a closed encryption portal
it is a dark semispheric aperture left unlocked but closed
converge on all levels
outside patrols close in behind these coordinates
x takks come from all directions all levels
flynn pauses to see x net patrols in motion across bridges through tunnels
they come to a dark encryption portal seen from their exterior view
this is it
flynn withdraws the hologon
the sooner rush gets this into the main power supply the sooner x net shuts down
and the more of us come out of here to tell about it
rush takes the hologon stows it
pumped looks between code monkeys boole and quantz
oh man i think im leaking
youll do great
your recognize patterns better than any of us
youll know plexors moves before he does
i hope youre right
are you really a user
is there such a thing
is that what makes you so good
all programs hang on rushs answer
flynn and i come from a realm no better or worse than here
one thing i know neither place works unless youre looking out for the other guy
and weve got a word for what all of you are
lets do it
fighters hustle under the shadow of the portal
approaching the closed semispheric aperture
x takks stand thick weapons pointed at the closed aperture
plexor marks time
cybavors poise to attack
mega emotions rising takes a step back
flynn falters on his wounded leg
fighters steady him
rush steps forward places a hand on the semispheric aperture
plexor tenses eager for the slaughter
x takks cock weapons take careful aim
flynn code monkeys quantz boole krod
gathering near rush portal opens around them revealing a stunning view of the inside of the fortress
not an x takk in sight
nothing to it
rush leads group inside
plexor grows impatient
x net specialist activates portal
semispheric aperture irises open to reveal x takk patrol
charging in from outside
no fighters in sight
inside x takks and outside x takks take orders literally they fire at each other
many crash zap and fizzle
cybavors leap in devouring corrupted x takks
the two cybavors use energy food to bifurcate into four
they do so instantly
youve been tricked
he spins to find mega gone
mega has betrayed me for the last time
she is with the fighters
crash them all
mega runs from the scene
around a corner she collides with rush flynn krod fighters
im proud of you mega
i linked with meg
she instructed me
she glances over the new tronified rush
despite herself shes impressed
but theres no time for talk
which way to the power supply
rush leaps to a high ledge to confirm massive throbbing power supply core cube lies at the center of the fortresss concentric squares
high sign to krod
there it is
and here they come
rumble precedes army of x takks coming to get them
break out the toys
x takks are upon them and the battle is joined
x net disks fly by the hundreds
krod and code monkeys fire a sqram projectile which opens mid air into a super wide circular magnetic field net
sqram field sucks in x net disk and zaps them to ash
x takks charge
rush flips down from above throws tron disk disk ricochets of ten x takks mows them down
rush retrieves his disk lands near krod and fighters
block this choke point slow them down
can you guys do it
not a problem
he throws his disk behind his back takes out an approaching x net goon
rush hurries away with mega and flynn
krod quantz boole and code monkeys are besieged by a hundred x takks
plexor enters the battle arena with his four cybavors
he scans keenly then heads off another direction
flynn hobbles helped by mega
rush leads them around a corner in sight of main power supply
massive reactive core containment cube
rush comes to the edge of a deep narrow moat
bottom is a channel of roiling molten chromatic data
we have to get across
six x takks are upon them disks flying negabyte eraser beams swinging
flynn takes a hit in the chest
rush and mega dodge fling their disks with lethal accuracy x takks crash and fall tumbling into the moat abyss flashing as they hit the molten bottom
krod boole and quantz bait a phalanx of x takks code monkeys spring a degaussing charge which cuts off a column at the base
column tumbles crashing x takks blocking the way
high fives among krod and fighters
one small x takk breaks through zapping through the air reforming zapping closer
fighters turn to blast him
but krod recognizes the pattern wait
i know that dude
quantz stuns an x takk soldier code monkeys hack his x net armor
armor powers down revealing i beem
i beem shakes off his brainwashing
krod my friend
who are these guys
were taking out plexor
you with us or them
x takks attack the group including i beem
i beem zaps away reappearing next to an x takk
he steals the x takks negabyte blaster and mows down three x takks saving trapped boole
i beem joins fighters as they press deeper engaging the next x takk onslaught
rush and mega haul flynn along a narrow ledge
you can make it across
he points to a thin ledge on the other side far below
rush extends his light pole to the ledge moves to gather flynn for a vault crossing
no take mega
ill stay here and run interference
you havent got a chance by yourself
ah these guys are wimps
its bravado they know his odds are dismal
flynn slumps into an alcove which is only big enough for him
he pulls a supply of spiked mini disks ready to defend himself
were not leaving you
my body is weak but my will is strong
i promise no matter what they do to me ill survive this
trust the bigger plan
hes fading fast
but flynn x takks attack along the ledge
rush throws his arm around mega and vaults across the moat landing on the far side gaining a slim foot hold below a core entry point
flynn chooses his moment leans out and throws
his mini disks take out x takks on the ledge
their bodies tumble into the moat flashing as they hit
flynn spins the wall behind him opens
at the end of a square corridor stands plexor
flanked by his four snarling cybavor beasts
your moment of obsolescence is upon you
across the moat rush and mega climb to the entry point
flynn plays for time stalling plexor so he doesnt catch sight of them
its the better idea
thats why mega chose my side
if an idea is erased from all memory banks it can be neither good nor bad
when each alternative has been removed x net will simply be
with a hand signal he commands his cybavors
they raise up poised to attack flynn
do what you want
the yearning for freedom will last forever
he flicks a finger
cybavors gallop at flynn
rush and mega gain footing at the entry point
they turn at the sound of digital snarling
across the moat a gut wrenching sight all four cybavors pounce on flynn hurling him off the ledge mauling him as they go down dividing into eight plummeting toward the
molten data far below
plexor steps out of his corridor relishing the view remains of fallen bodies flash into the inferno
plexor sees mega and rush on the other side
bridges instantly extend from outer square to core cube
x takks stream across firing rush and mega duck inside entry point pelted by disks
before them a vast brilliant energized lattice
power surges in rings drawing down huge columns
every piece of geometry is based on perfect squares made of mirror finished rare earth elements
rush pulls the hologon key into view
facets resonate with energy patterns like those in the core
we plug this into the control cell x net is history
lets do it for flynn
they share a heartbeat of solidarity
x takks stream in firing
rush and mega charge the center throwing disks fighting back to back
problem is energy rings move continuously down the columns and the columns are spaced close leaving just enough time between ring passes to jump through
he and mega jump nearly raked by down flowing energy rings
x takks fire negabyte blasters but many of the beams are caught in the energy flow and sucked away
thats how intense this place is
x takk soldier is grazed stumbles into energy column
ring rakes down and zaps him nasty reducing him to bits sucking his energy to the levels below
rush and mega encounter oncoming x takks they must split up
they fling disks taking out x takks dodging fire working their way deeper
meg and rush throw their disks simultaneously
both disks score hits then arc to return
rush and mega catch each others disk
they each look at the strange disks its just not the same
the do a quick swap and keep fighting
the control cell
rush and mega battle off three x takks the way is clear
rush leaps crashes planes of silicon
stows his disk pulls out the hologon
spots the control cells key receptacle shapes match
rush moves to insert the hologon
a disk strikes his arm hologon flies wild
plexor drops from above riding an optik shaft
where did you get that
no one knows this code but me
your software has the biggest flaw there is plexor
you cant see you own mistakes
plexor snatches his death disk corners rush for the kill
megas disk crashes silicon comes at plexor but his defense field repels it
he slams it aside and its raked away by downward flowing energy rings
rush dives at plexor
hes like a statue
but this time rush holds him and infuses tron energy breaking down plexors defense field eating into his body circuits
its fractal zapping fireworks evenly matched foes battling face to face
do it mega
mega scoops hologon off floor makes for control cell plexors hand shoots out grabs her stops her like iron
plexor exerts his power holds rush and mega by the throats with his two hands backing them toward a surface ripping with hot energy rings
rush and mega struggle an inch from death plexor stops annoyed
turns and sees krod fighters and i beem have arrived firing blasters at plexors spinal nexus
it hardly makes a dent but it creates a fleeting opportunity for rush rush ducks forward shoots his disk off his back smacking plexor in the throat
mega falls clear rush hurls plexor against energy rings energy rakes down his body but he fights the effects an does not melt down
he step away shakes off the damage retrieves his disk into a hand
mega snags the hologon she tosses it to rush whos already airborne rush catches hologon sails to the control unit jams hologon into its receptacle
plexor cocks his death disk eyes flash electro psychosis hologon reacts with central cell shockwaves radiate energy rings go dim then dark silicon shatters to ash x takks power down
x net armor de rezzes leaving innocent civilian programs
they shake off the mind control and rise unshackled
and plexor like all things x net chatters and glitches
his code erodes his bits darken the fiber of his being erodes from inside
now whos obsolete
rush executes a final leap extending his feet for the final blow straight at plexor crash shattering him to bits
rush finally breathes
sees i beem krod quantz boole code monkeys
ill never let you forget it
boole tosses rush his tron disk
rush mega krod i beem fighters and liberated programs stow disks and step to a high vantage point
before them expands a vista of cyberspace
power down of x net radiates in all directions leaving everything else intact
beautiful exotic old data networks instantly begin to regenerate into the open space
at last were free
sinclair commands the podium in a world exposed to increasing data corruption i hereby switch on the first global network offering guaranteed data security
flawless performance zero downtime
the world works hard the world deserves
he throws a switch
huge monitors blaze with x net logos and graphic portals
x net instantly crashes
all screens jam glitch and die
crowd is stunned
sinclair is mortified
krod i beem boole quantz and code monkeys cheer
mega embraces rush
energy sizzles between them
i underestimated you
she presses her lips to his
to i beem you knew she always liked him
is she pinging his eprom
i cant see from here
but out of triumph a sudden concern rushs body shoots data energy into mega into ground circuits
lightshow overload intensifies and spreads
mega backs away in pain
whoa ouch what
rush what is it
rushs body drains away into the energized circuitry
he reaches a hand to mega
pain energy zaps her but she clasps his hand anyway
code monkeys attempt desperate measures but soon its over
bits of rush dissipate into surrounding circuitry then beam skyward in blazing curtain like a quantum aurora borealis
mega is left with a handful of nothing
its the way it should be
hes going back to the place he belongs
rushs energy body hurls across cyberspace
bits streak light bends rush materializes in the target chair
human flesh real clothes
same as the moment he left
he bolts up realizes where he is
looks at his hands
sees jo jo the rat staring at him
meg and dewey hurry over to unstrap rush
meg holds his hands checks the integrity of his body
you made it
like a bad cold im always coming back
he made it
rush looks around
miles krod and a group of oddly familiar co workers
people who look just like i beem quantz boole and the code monkeys
double takes on meg i met a program you wrote
shes just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you
mega told me all about what you did in there
she gave you my coordinates
thats how you uploaded me
they look across the room
at the control console stands a man with his back to us
hes curiously examining megs equipment
shes done an amazing job here rush
in the flesh
i told you to trust the bigger plan
id come to suspect flynn was alive inside
but i had no way to know for sure
you picked the right guy to send in
working down here i became convinced someone tried to murder flynn
but the only person i could confide in was the guy i suspected most
sinclair charges in furious
trailed by security men
what are you people doing down here
get back to work
x net has crashed
well all be ruined
speak for yourself sinclair
sinclair wheels to see flynn alive standing in front of him
trapped by the ugly truth sinclair turns rage on meg
i ordered you to destroy this equipment
rush gets in sinclairs face
hey jerk she doesnt do your dirty work
neither do i
you lied to me to all of us
you want to deal with somebody
im the guy who crashed x net
sinclair goes for rush
rush delivers a solid punch
sinclair grabs his bloody nose
youre fired everybody get out
and im the boss again
not only are you fired youre going to have a lot of explaining to do to the sec the justice department and the fbi
to security men hold him until the police get here
yes sir mr
security men haul out sinclair
flynn addresses the group
x net is dead
but encom lives
were going to bring this company back to its place as the leader in finding the next big thing
ill need to be free to do the dreaming
so effective immediately im appointing two bold bright courageous people to head worldwide operations
he presents rush and meg
you both earned it
i love it
well take it
to miles krod you get a division to run
to phlegman does that mean a bigger cubicle
cheers all around
flynn approaches rush and meg
put on some coffee
you two are going to be putting in a lot of overtime together
meg turns to rush
do you remember how along time ago you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek
rush goes for the lips
