by hillary seitz on a deep
off to the side
as we realise
a disembodied voice
we cant quite make out what its saying
as it gets louder
when we finally
you are in danger
del spooners face
his eyes snapping open
his face covered in sweat
pull back to reveal him lying in bed
sheets tangled around his legs
alarm clock playing something relentlessly cheerful
spooner slaps it off
bends his right arm
he reaches for a bottle of pills
shakes out a couple and swallows them
trying to forget
you are in danger
he rubs his hands over his face
gets out of bed
his apartment basic
bearing the signs of someone who lives alone
a little messy
spooner turns his face into the jet of water
shaves with a razor
using his left hand
knicks the cleft of his chin
stares down at the single egg in a saucepan
waiting for it to boil
heads down the hallway
looping a knotted tie around his neck
kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches for the handle
takes a deep breath and
into the flow of commuters heading for the elevated trains
elbow to elbow
a river of humanity
spooner moves along like everyone else
his shoulders tense
that feeling at the back of his neck
he turns and sees
just behind him
humanoid in design but still obviously a machine
metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles
the thing senses his stare
looks up with a muted whir
metallic voice good day sir
speeds up his pace
weaving through the crowd to lose the robot
we now realise this is the future
towering apartment buildings block the sun
the street packed with traffic
pedestrians wearing their computers like form fitting portable offices
spooner throws a look at his surroundings up high an industrial robot rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows
a work crew of oddly shaped rube goldberg robots efficiently repairs the street
no human supervision
a robotic clean up crew
lumbering along the sidewalk
humanoid robots dotting the crowd
following their owners
walking slowly deliberately
stamped on all the robots sides a logo iii laws safe
spooner stops to wait at a light with other pedestrians
directly in front of him a little girl clutches her fathers neck
she smiles big at spooner
front teeth missing
but its not her father
its her robot caretaker
the robot turns
looks at the girl
you are not allowed to talk to strangers
has had enough
he steps off the curb just as
the traffic signal swivels around
training its large digital eye on him please return to the sidewalk
spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street
please return to the sidewalk
the traffic signal tracking him
you are in violation of city ordinance b
spooner throws up his hand
flipping it the bird just as snap
it takes his picture
spooner stepping onto a sleek densely packed train
looks down at his feet
a trampled flyer on the ground
from the anti robot league metal monsters secret factory revealed
a robot gets up
to offer him his seat
turns his back on him as we pull back from the window to reveal
the train hurtling toward downtown
soaring gravity defying office buildings dominate the skyline
older buildings wedged among the new
all protected by huge glass and steel shields
as we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels
the old streets have become huge spacious plazas
spooner moves with the crowd towards the doors of the aging police headquarters
modern additions have been made to the original facade creating an ungainly architectural mess
a vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series of glass enclosed rooms
on the other side a giant screen with real time video of various streets and buildings
spooner arrives at his desk
unlike the others its a mess
a slender computer screen curving along the front of it
several electronic messages say the same thing ever heard the phrase lead by example
spooner looks up
lieutenant john bergin stands in front of his desk holding up a citation with a photo of spooner giving that traffic signal the finger
doesnt ring a bell
pointing to spooners badge its on your badge
spooner takes the citation
drops it into a drawer filled with about fifty others
the traffic division filed an official complaint this morning
the traffic division is a machine
look i know theres going to be an adjustment period del
interrupting ill send them a letter of apology
maybe some flowers
a box of chocolates
just then spooners phone rings
he throws bergin a look
then snatches up the receiver
a sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city blocks
the entrance is a large plaza filled with people and an elevator opens with a whoosh
spooner steps out into a featureless corridor
his footsteps echoing
he stops at a set of opposing doors
looks over at one when the other suddenly opens
a warm mahogany paneled room
in sharp contrast to the cold metal space outside
spooner steps inside
at the end of a long conference table sits an old man
sparkling blue eyes
old fashioned suit
please come in
you can sit
looks around the room
the old man lifts up a coffee pot
pours some coffee into a single cup
interested youre offering me a cup of coffee
but you are to say no thank you
spooner nods a little
the old man raises the coffee to his lips but doesnt take a sip
as you wish
the old man takes a sip
he doesnt move
there is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot
you want to tell me something about dr
about his death
the old man smiles
i want to tell you that his death was not a suicide
and why do you say that
because i want you to know it
i understand that
but what specifically leads you to believe that he didnt commit suicide
considers nothing specifically
spooner shifts his weight
under normal circumstances that wouldnt be enough to get you a homicide investigation
but this is not normal circumstances is it detective spooner
then you will find out who killed dr
and then you will tell me
spooners losing his patience
if you were murdered doctor ill find out
and youll be the first to know
just then the hologram of dr
hogenmiller vanishes in a burst of light as does the table the coffee pot and the conference room
spooner suddenly finds himself standing in front of a large view screen inside a small metal chamber
spooner steps out into the hallway and into
an escort please follow me
reluctantly starts to follow it
passes another doorway
police tape stretched across it
catches a brief glimpse of
splayed out across the floor
surrounded by crime scene technicians
taking in the scene
then continues on
two large doors emblazoned with the u
robotics logo open automatically
inside an enormous glass enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex
spooner walks through the doorway
his escort robot trailing behind him
an army of corporate types sit around a conference table
you can practically feel the brains and ambition
usually i ask whos in charge
spooners eyes lock with a man sitting at the head of the table
s handsome charismatic
lance robertson founder and ceo of u
but everyone knows you dr
pretends to instruct his people
remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances
welcome to u
i regret youre not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances
allow me to introduce mr
aronson our head of legal affairs
a prematurely graying man leaning against the wall
and the gentleman to my right is dr
alfred lanning director of research
alfred lanning only one there in a tie
theyll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation
youll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter especially before the press gets wind of it
there are some anti robot sentiments out there as you know detective and were not eager to stir them up
where would you like to begin
we can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger
a palpable wave of tension shoots through the group
you dont have to answer that dr
robertson waves him off
perhaps you can assist us here
everyone looks down at the other end of the table
then an attractive young woman gets to her feet
hair tucked behind her ears
looking at everyone but spooner
hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships
rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines
he spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home
as a result he was highly susceptible to depression
calvin is our chief psychologist
if that was your diagnosis why didnt you see this coming
finally meeting spooners eye
as if the answers obvious
this is u
seventy five percent of our employees fit that description
interceding youll have to excuse the doctor
were all a little on edge
this has been a difficult and emotional morning
spooner throws a look around the room
then back at calvin
i can see youre all broken up
robertson responds to spooners skepticism
hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company
we developed the three laws of robotics together
but these days science is a young mans game
by the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you
some of us are kicked upstairs
others im afraid arent so lucky
hogenmiller took his own life
i trust you will come to the same swift conclusion detective
lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions
spooner looks over at calvin
i want her to help me
calvin unhappy with this arrangement
thats not really my department
pointed susan would be happy to assist you
and with a gesture robertson dismisses everyone
people start getting up gathering up filing out
the last one to get up
spooner and calvin heading down the same hallway he was in before
catch sight of a couple robot technicians
under his breath ah christ
as they duck under the police tape and
enter hogenmillers lab
alive with activity
crime running across
hogenmillers lifeless face
black gun powder
fanning out around his contorted lips
throws a look around the lab robots
dangling from the ceiling
passes them by
they say the prices gonna come down a lot next year
kinda cool huh
how cool will it be when one takes your job
pushing past him
is everything alright detective
this is just how i like my robots in pieces
as they approach hogenmillers body the lead crime scene investigator baldez gets up to meet them
to spooner can you believe it man
i didnt think id ever see the inside of this building
hands spooner a plasma clipboard
spooner signs it awkwardly
with his left hand
whats the run down
heinrich hogenmiller sixty four years old
weapon a small caliber registered in his name
looks like he walked in locked the door and snuffed himself
cocking his head to look at hogenmillers face
i know someone who disagrees with you
pointing down at hogenmiller
and steps over the body leaving a confused baldez
stepping deeper into the lab
i spoke to a dead man today
want to tell me about that
hogenmillers hologram took his appointments
attended staff meetings
he hated corporate life
the hologram enabled him to focus on his work
its just a device detective
a device that called the police
the sound of the gunshot wouldve triggered a
but the call came directly to me
were talking about a mechanism designed by hogenmiller to say provocative things
to irritate and confound his colleagues
and thats what you think it is
im sorry but this whole investigation is the result of a dead mans toy messing with your head
they pass half a robot hanging from a hook
spooner curls his lip
swivels the robots head so its not looking at him
whens the last time any of you actually spoke to hogenmiller
i mean human to human
i couldnt say
take a guess
i dont guess detective
but if pressed i would reason it had been a considerable length of time
how well did you know him
gently swivels the robots head back to where it had been
but i admired his work tremendously
studies her for a beat
then turns back to the body
two coroners entering with a high tech body box
i get the whole mad scientist thing
hogenmiller was past his prime
he enters a room
locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain
everything about this case says suicide
you dont sound convinced
start loading the body into the box
even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly
turning to her
spooner contd what all this is missing is personality
as he starts for the door
you have hour surveillance
they head out into the hallway
a mechanical door guard rolling into place behind them
its company policy
i want to see the tapes
hurrying to keep up with him
this is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning
calls out into the air
at the end of the corridor near the elevator a bright circle appears
hovering just in front of the wall
two small slits grow into round black eyes
and a thin mouth expands into an enormous smile
detective meet victor
our buildings supercomputer
hes the checks and balances of u
to victor victor detective spooners heading up the investigation into the death of dr
victor smiles big
spooner furrows his brow
you look like a very
victor responds in a gentle male voice thank you
thats very kind
the detective needs to see our security tapes
the elevator doors immediately open
they step inside
spooner and calvin descend
victor floats on the wall and smiles wide
spooner looks back at it
with a frown
the elevator stops the doors open
a robot steps on
good day dr
good day sir
staring at the robot
it senses the stare
turns back to him
may i be of service to you sir
breaks the stare
ignoring the robot
looks over at him
arent you going to answer him
i dont talk to my refrigerator either
calvin folds her arms
i get the distinct feeling youre one of those people detective
those who dont appreciate the work we do here at u
you people do what you do
then its up to the rest of us to make sense out of the world we wake up in
as the elevator doors open on to
a soaring lobby
the centerpiece is a five story statue of a robot arms outstretched in approximation of da vincis study of man
robot workers more numerous than humans
they are sleeker
more advanced than those in the outside world
calvin and spooner head across
when this company started we were manufacturing three robots a week
now look at us
todays children will never know a world without robots
the streets are filled with unemployed humans who arent exactly thrilled with that idea
our robotic systems maintain factory inventories regulate street traffic even run the family home
leaving people to do what doctor
leaving people to engage in higher pursuits that make life worth living
and what happens when something goes wrong
our systems never wrong
as they walk through the crowd we hear the quiet whir of robot heads as they turn in succession to watch spooner pass
spooner and calvin enter the mainframe of u
this is the nerve center of the whole operation
walls lined with computers screens and thousands of controls
this is victors home
victor appears on a wall sized screen broken up into beehive like components
i will now play you the last thirty two seconds of dr
as we watch the screens
the elevator opens and doctor hogenmiller steps into the metal corridor
in countless angles
high low close up wide
hogenmillers face composed but tight
spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him
hogenmiller steps in
the doors slide closed behind him
nothing for a few moments
then a muffled gunshot
calvin jumps startled
the cameras still trained on the corridor
wheres the tape from inside
hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working
that was only within the last year
so we can throw paranoia into the mix
to victor fast forward
a hundred plus screens all fast forward
police officers appear and force open the doors
now technicians appear and rush through in a blur
i hate to be a stickler
on screen we see spooner and calvin enter the lab
but dont killers usually have to enter and exit the scene of a crime
stop the recording
spooner turns away from the footage
stares at calvin
they do doctor
unless theyve always been there and never left
calvin looks at him
trying to understand
you think the murderer was in the lab the entire time
if im right its still there
spooner turns back to the screens
the image paused at the exact moment the mechanical guard rolled in front of the lab door
we just locked it in
the steel arms of the robotic guard retract with a clang
the laboratory doors slide open
spooner and calvin step inside
police and technicians long gone
silhouettes of hanging limbs
clumps of wire and metal
the lights flicker on
calvin sees spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand
pulling out a gun
a robot cannot harm a human being detective
the first law of robotics forbids it
and we hard wire the three laws into every model
yeah i saw the commercial
spooner steps deeper into the lab
to avoid touching any robot parts
passes a maze holding a metal insect
the bug whirs to life
as the metal bug scurries through the corridors
clamps his hand down on it
and if a robot was given a direct order to kill
the second law of robotics would prevent it
a robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law
spooner approaches a mound of robot parts
arms and legs
all tossed haphazardly onto the pile
but a robot can defend itself
only when that action doesnt conflict with the first or second laws
this is the third law of robotics
yeah well you know what they say laws are made to be broken
not these laws
starts nudging the pile with his shoe
calvin growing impatient
youre not hearing me detective
theres nothing here
the pile erupts in front of spooner
as a spooner
skittering across the floor
fixing his illuminated eyes
right on her
she steps forward
scrambling towards his gun
reaching out towards the robot
calm down detective
there is no danger here
grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as
to robot de activate
and the robot
gets to his feet
training the gun on the robot
calvin turns to him
how did you know it was under there
if i was metal and didnt want anyone to find me id hide under a pile of junk
this robot wasnt hiding
what youre looking at is the result of clever programming
the illusion of self interest and free will
steeping closer to the robot
holstering his gun
as calvin turns for the door
im going to go get dr
the robots hand suddenly shoots out
grabbing spooners gun
from his holster
right back at him
close on calvin
cannot believe this is happening
i said de activate
move away from the door doctor
cracking from desperation
commence emergency shut down
staring into the robots eyes
a thin bead of sweat
trickling down his temple
moving away from the door
i gave you an order
starts backing towards the door
shaking in its hand
as if hes desperate
he touches the wall panel
the doors slide open
the robot steps out into the metal corridor
turning to run as the doors begin to shut
reaching down to whip out a back up gun
from an ankle holster
slapping in a large cartridge
this is impossible
cant do that
yeah yeah i know
my god did you see how it moved
ive never seen an ns move that way
starts running for the door
please you cant destroy it
we have to study it
that thing took my gun
youll be lucky if you get a handful of bolts back
slams the wall panel and
sprints out into the hallway
the robot suspect
about to turn to corner
the suspect is nearing the end of the hallway detective
spooner raises his gun and fires
pegging the robot in the leg
it starts jerking wildly
he takes aim again when
races out into the hallway
get back to the lab
she heads for the robot
to robot youre malfunctioning
let me help you
the robot turns
to look at her
gun pointing to the floor
focusing in on his hand
as one finger twitches
and he dives for calvin
forcing her to the floor as the robot fires
again and again
ricochetting around them
sparking against the walls
the elevator opens
the robot leaping inside
on top of calvin
looks down at her
clutching his coat
that was a pretty convincing illusion of getting shot at
the robot suspect standing inside the elevator
looks down at the bullet hole blown through its leg
metal fingers touching the damage
as if curious
looks back at the other robot
standing in the back of elevator
a primitive model
spooner springing to his feet
helping calvin up
i took the liberty of alerting security
seconds after the first shot was fired
wheres that elevator going
spooner slams against a nearby door
hurtling down the a phalanx of security personnel
crossing the lobby
more security personnel
pouring into a hallway
spooner and calvin
racing down the stairs
victors face meeting them at every landing
i have directed a security team to meet the elevator containing the errant robot
whipping past him
barely keeping up
not used to this much activity
bursts through a door and out into
a labyrinth of metal and concrete
in the distance
a troupe of security personnel swarms around a closed elevator door
the suspect is about to be apprehended detective
ill believe it when i see it
cocking his gun
a soft ding
announcing the elevator cars arrival
security all crouching down in unison
weapons brought round to position
weaving through them
gun pointed at the metal doors as
they slide open
revealing a robot
standing under the light
holding a gun
it steps out as security takes aim and
spooner pushes past them to the robot
looks down at its leg
this is not the same robot
looking wildly around
bounds towards an exit as calvin steps forward to question the robot
to robot what happened to the robot that ordered you to hold this firearm
this unit is not programmed to obey an order given by a robot
but who gave you this gun
running towards the exit
hears the answer
echoing behind him
a metal man
he bursts out into the plaza in front of u
squinting into the light
then plunging into the crowd
they all look the same from behind
through the sea of man and machine
starts to scream
at the sight of his gun
the crowd begins scattering
near a fountain
i want a homicide unit on every street sidewalk alley
spooner standing in front of an assemblage of cops
behind him an image of the robot suspect plays on the screen
junkyard scrapyard and salvage yard anywhere it could hide
behind him flashing images of the city streets and dumps
its got a bullet hole above the right knee so be on the look out for any malfunctioning ns
lieutenant bergin enters the back of the room
next to him assistant d
not looking happy
check out all retail outlets and repair shops especially the underground ones
the screen behind him compartmentalises showing various dubious shop fronts
i dont care who you have to get past to get this done
just get it done
the cops begin dispersing
as bergin catches spooners eye
spooner not pleased to see toller
looking like shit spooner
well im not the one always giving press conferences
bergin puts a hand on spooners arm
knows hes not going to like this
del were going to have to reclassify the search
s office is seeing this ns as missing evidence not a homicide suspect
homicide is the murder of a human being by another human being
therefore a robot cannot be charged with homicide
this isnt just any robot
it killed someone
that registering with you
shakes off bergins arm
how many shares of u
you holding in your portfolio toller
this is a public safety issue
you have any idea what would happen to this city if we went running around screaming killer robot
it would collapse in on itself
toller contd wide spread panic
until that ns s found were cooperating with u
robotics and keeping this investigation under wraps
maybe this isnt the case for you del
incensed spooner replies a little louder than he intended
rakes his hand through his hair
turns to see the other cops looking over at him
looks to bergin
i want updated reports every half hour
this is it you know
from now on were going to miss the good old days
good old days
when people were killed by other people
rolling along in his car
peering out the window an ns model robot laden with shopping bags following its owner down the sidewalk
another robot opening the door at a hotel for guests
a couple hauling robots loading heavy boxes onto the back of a truck
rubs his eyes
turns a corner and spots
the latest models in the window
spooner watches as a woman leads her faulty ns to the service entrance
he stops the car
calvin riding in the back of a driverless taxi cab
staring out the window lost in thought
the cab pulls up to a curb
we have arrived at your destination
takes a beat
then swipes her card
elegant condos set on prime real estate
calvin heads down a tree lined walk towards her condo entrance
one of my bullets hit your robot
she drops her key card
as spooner steps out from behind a tree
the tail of his coat whipping in the wind
and i think its smart enough to repair itself dont you
studying him yes
i think so
any repair shop
its always the owner who brings the robot in for repair
where would a robot without an owner go
im not sure what youre getting at
stepping closer does u
robotics have a factory in the city limits
tucking her hair behind her ears
the locations of our factories are classified
i dont care
looks up at him
a mexican stand off
i have several conditions if i show you
i expected that
i want it brought in unharmed
doesnt like it but agreed
i want to talk to it alone
this model violated the three laws
it also moved and reacted differently than any robot ive ever seen
there must be some sort of logical explanation
i want to find out what that is
just me and the robot
spooner looks down at this small woman
narrows his eyes
when they told me you were a psychologist that wasnt the whole truth was it
i never said i treated human beings
spooners car races down a ramp and the roadway becomes a lane underground tunnel system
a river of headlights stretches forever in either direction
a control beam locks onto the car guiding it to a merge with traffic
spooner hits the override button and switches to manual
calvin watches him take the wheel
shakes her head
that should be outlawed once and for all
thatll be the day i stop driving
spooner jams the gas pedal and the tunnel becomes a blur
calvin holds onto the dashboard
looking a little pale
i can recommend a behavior modification program you know if you want to overcome your robo phobia
im not afraid of robots
i just dont like them
because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient
they do our dirty work
ever do hard labor doctor
gets pretty old pretty fast
nobody can do someone elses dirty work without coming to hate them
i dont want to be around when your robots decide theyve taken their last order
that day will never come detective
robots arent like human beings they dont question their existence
spooner cranks the gear shift
throwing her a look
spoken like a true robo phile
the car comes to a stop in a vast industrial district
spooner and calvin get out looking up at the imposing facade of a u
robotics assembly plant
a long steel gate too high to see over protects the unmarked complex
calvin looks anxious as the door mechanism scans her u
she shoots a look at spooner
then slowly the gate begins to open
a night foreman leads them down a hallway
shaking his head
head office already ordered a system wide inventory check
dont know about a missing ns
looks back at spooner
whatd you say you did
research and development
as spooner pushes past him into
the control booth
overlooking the pristine factory floor
the foreman starts working the controls of a central computer
all nestors accounted for
the screen scrolls with inventory figures
gesturing as you can see all properly catalogued
your robot just isnt here
calvin turns to say something to spooner
but he isnt there
she looks around
then sees the foreman reacting
looks out the window at
walking out onto the factory floor
spooner trots alongside an assembly line belt
lined with ns legs
heading towards the assembly room
calvin and the foreman
over the noise like i said sir we have one hundred fully assembled ns s housed here
thats our capacity
last week we had one hundred
yesterday we had one hundred spooner slowing
finally spotting what he was looking for
points at a gap
on the assembly belt
one leg missing
well today you have one hundred and one
a storage compartment opens and ns s march out in tight formation
every step and swing of the arm in unison
the sound of metal footsteps reverberating through the plant as robots organise themselves into long straight lines
spooner and calvin look up and down the formation
they all look alike
throws up his hands
to calvin youre the robot shrink
the robots stand motionless
a strange tableau
takes a step forward
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong
robots answer in unison
their mechanical voices resounding which one
that is not a satisfactory answer
i could always interview each one individually and cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies
how long would that take
about three weeks
they share a look
clearly not an option
gets an idea
turns to spooner
and grabs his gun from his holster
he jumps back
we have one hundred robots here that cannot allow a human being to come to harm
their eyes lock
spooner getting what shes doing
and one that can
she raises the gun to spooners head
am i holding this right
more or less
looks over at the robots
then cocks the gun
and the robots come thundering towards them
like a row of linebackers
arms straight out
their footsteps deafening
coming closer and closer
lowers the gun
all stop in unison
immediately returning to their resting positions
spooner and calvin stare out
every one of the robots moved
standing right in front of them like metal statues
has had enough
takes the gun back from calvin
enough game playing
blows the head off of the nearest robot
its body crumples to the ground
guess that wasnt it
cannot believe what he just did
rushes over to the destroyed robot
what are you doing
spooner walks down the row holding his gun in plain view
calling out this is a self preservation field test
do not attempt to save yourselves
any of you
thats an order
from the control booth the night foreman screams over the
are you crazy
those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines
spooner randomly stops at another robot
raises his gun
you hear that
youre worth more than ill make in my entire life
his finger tightening on the trigger when calvin suddenly grabs his arm
you cant just destroy them
looking down at her
when suddenly something catches his eye
down the line
he jerks his head
locking eyes with a robot
a couple feet away
the robot suspect leaps forward
grabbing onto the railing of an overhead catwalk
his movements almost balletic as he swings himself up
spooner drops to his knee
but misses as the robot launches himself through the control booth window with a terrific crash
spooner and calvin rush in to find the night foreman hiding under his desk
an alarm screaming
the door on the other side barely hanging off a hinge
spooner hurries forward
turning to calvin
reaches down for his back up gun and presses it into her hand
you dont know whats going to happen in there
as if admitting defeat
calvins fingers wrapping around the gun
as spooner leads them to the door and down into
the assembly room
every surface looking like part of a great glass and metal machine
endless high tech planes holding robots in various states of assembly
the deafening roar of the assembly line as it slides rotates and gnashes spooner
motioning calvin to stay behind him
as they descend
into the cavernous room
a narrow corridor of bodies
sliding past them
brushing shoulders thighs hands
wiping sweat from his brow
to pivot himself
when the room
suddenly rearranges itself
another line of robots
descending between spooner and calvin
cutting them off from one another
catching glimpses of calvin
on the other side of the metal bodies
to cut through
starting to pound
he swivels round
but another line of robots
cutting him off
he stumbles back
as another line
appears before him
he looks down at his hand
noise crashing all around him
everywhere he turns
he darts through the line
finds a wall
leaning against it pulls a small bottle from his pocket
rips off the lid
shakes out a couple pills
at his trembling hand
squeezing his eyes
open and shut
a passing robot
grabs him by the collar
smashing him against the wall
its the suspect
sinks to the ground
as the suspect robot
slips off the line
raising his arms
could end it
into spooners eyes
stunned for a second
scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies
hears a pounding
in the distance
catches a glimpse
of the robot
trying to smash through a large security door
with his metal fists
blocked once again
by a shifting row
when a hand
lands on his shoulder
he wheels round
to find calvin
takes her by the arm
and forces them through a line
emerging into the open
like a trapped animal
now what do we do
ive already done it
and suddenly the massive security door rises
the robot suspect takes its chance
runs full out
bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of police cars
uniformed officers are aiming specialised rifles at the robot
flashing lights reflecting off its metal surface
the robot turns to spooner
extends its hands
spooner is surprised
a police officer fires rubberised netting shooting out at sonny
a second officer fires and a second net covers him
then a third
and the robot falls to the ground struggling
calvin glares at spooner
we had a deal
but spooner doesnt look at her
his eyes are locked on that robot
finds everyone focused on the video wall on screen
a news reporter is speaking over images of street violence perpetrated against robots
violence erupted last night in response to unconfirmed reports that dr
heinrich hogenmiller a top employee at u
news reporter contd robotics was killed yesterday morning by a robot
while there has been no official response from the company police sources have confirmed that a robot is being held as evidence
this is not good
spooner stares at his reflection in a large mirror
touches a control and the mirror becomes a window onto
a holding cell
the robot suspect sits at the table
shackled to the chair
staring at the table top
bergin steps up beside spooner
looks through the glass
i cant tell if its not moving because its trying to psych us out or because its just a machine
i want to go in
orders are nobody steps into that room til lanning and his attorneys get here
throws him a look
bergin his loyalties torn
pulls out a chair and drags it far from the table
hes been jumped too many times by this machine
four mounted cameras whir to life
the robot tilts its head with a muted whir
as if it doesnt understand him
you are an ns nestor class robot
your primary function is to perform the tasks assigned to you
i am an ns nestor class robot
my primary function interrupting cancel
spooner wings a file onto the table
it comes to a stop near the robot
the robot lifts one of its hands
gently resting its metal fingers on top of the file
then opens it
a stack of pictures
the robots emotionless face studies the grim images
you have over words stored in your memory
one third of those are adjectives
why dont i take a crack
heinrich hogenmiller your creator
with a bullet in his brain
a bullet you put there
looks up at spooner
cold blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot dont you think
the robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across the table
crosses his arms
maybe youre stonewalling me
maybe youre sitting there right now thinking this guys a complete asshole
am i right
you are right
you are a complete asshole
and for a moment spooner is shocked
you can see it in his eyes
he sits back in his chair
forcing a tight smile
i guess thats a start
now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from hogenmillers corpse
i was frightened
why do you suppose dr
hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear
i dont know
doesnt seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have
i dont know why
i wouldnt want my toaster to be frightened
or my vacuum cleaner suddenly the robot slams its metal hands down on the table
looks like you can simulate other emotional states
i think that ones called anger
have you ever simulated anger before
the robot doesnt respond
answer me robot
my name is sonny
amused so were naming you now
hogenmiller would make me sleep
you mean hed turn you off
and you didnt like being turned off
so one day you decided to stop him
you found his gun pointed it at his head
and pulled the trigger
sonny shakes his head
faster and faster
you put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you
i could never hurt anyone
but you tried to hurt me
you took a shot at me
my aim is perfect
if id wanted to hit you i would have
spooners expression hardens
why would the man who wrote the laws of robotics build a machine that violates them
the laws say i can protect my own existence
only if that protection doesnt harm a human being
a short pause
tilts his head
that doesnt seem fair does it
stares at him
the door swings open
sticks his head in
i need you outside
not wanting to go
not wanting to stay
turns back to the robot
it looks up at him
for a moment so human
i did not kill him
you were the only one in the room
if you didnt who did
he turns and heads out the door
bergin closes the door
to spooner were being blind sided
spooner and bergin head into a small courtroom off the main squad room
lanning is huddled with aronson and a half dozen other company lawyers
spooners jaw tenses
as he watches toller emerge from the clutch
strolls over to them
we got judge drexel
this hearing is called to order
as a large screen
blips on behind them
the two opposing sides assemble before it
judge drexel still in his pajamas and robe
an ns robot
leaning in to serve him a cup of tea
standing at a glass podium
your honor the state is treating the robot as a defendant
but in fact it is a piece of property
property belonging to u
arm resting on his podium
this robot has been implicated in the death of a human being your honor
which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident
or is the state going to argue this case s a homicide
thats a good question
of course not
pointing a finger at the u
their machine shot and killed a man
shoots him a look
just as lanning speaks up
theres actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion your honor
throws up his arms
but we recognise that this robot is an aberration
and in the interest of public safety u
robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately
no one expected this
least of all spooner
he turns to toller
you cant let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation
im not sure you even have an investigation any more
just then the door opens
everyone turns as calvin enters
spooner looks surprised
your honor id like to call our company robo psychologist to the stand
calvin crosses to the podium
a speaker asking doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth
calvin please tell us what conclusions youve reached after having observed the robot in action
there is a design flaw in the robot
its programming is advanced but unstable leaving the three laws in a grave imbalance
in your expert opinion what measures should be taken regarding the device
staring straight ahead
avoiding spooners eye
the robot must be destroyed
spooner cant believe what hes just heard
about to speak up when toller grabs his arm
judge drexel has heard enough
the robot in question will be transferred to a u
robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again
no one goes near it except qualified u
when the examination is complete the robot is to be destroyed
starts getting up from his chair
already done with this
this hearing is adjourned
a burst of conversation as the screen blips off
camp looking especially pleased
catching calvins eye briefly
as lanning leads her towards the exit his hand on her back
trotting down the front steps of the police station
his cell phone bleats
theyre making me turn over all the evidence
standing in his crime lab
behind him three dimensional projections of dead bodies
hovering in the precise positions they were found
welcome to the great american cover up
i wanted to tell you something i found before they suck it all up into their computer
walks over to the projection of hogenmillers body
crossing the plaza
sees lanning aronson and calvin walking ahead of him
there are bruises on hogenmillers wrists
there was a struggle
youre not getting me
studying the projections wrists
i ed them they were inflicted at the same time the shot was fired
hows that possible
a faint blip
on the line
im here man
who else is on the line
nothing i said whos there
he looks up
aronson lanning and calvin
heading down a plaza exit
throwing a look over his shoulder
hangs up his phone
close on sonny being escorted down a corridor by toller bergin and a number of heavily armed officers
hes bound with high tech shackles
sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into an underground car park
waiting for them
holds out his hand
case is closed spooner
he pushes past him
falling into step beside sonny
i didnt expect to see you again detective
i need you to help me clear something up
ill do my best
a scientist builds a robot that acts like a man
more like a man than any robot ever before
it shoots him and u
robotics calls it a failure
what would you call it
a stunning success
beat you were there robot
what am i missing
i dont know
dont start simulating ignorance
im not simulating ignorance detective
im experiencing it
i was asleep
you mean you were shut down
no i was asleep
robots dont sleep
human beings sleep
youre a machine
an illusion of life
can a robot write a symphony
can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece
then the muted whir as sonny turns to him
can you do either of those things
as a van from u
robotics pulls up
the back door dropping open
an engineer motions to the robot
theyre going to destroy me arent they
watching him step into the van
sonny sits down
with an almost human melancholy
the engineers securing him in place
the doctor was right
he told me everything was going to change
the engineers start to close the doors
but spooner reaches out to stop them
looks over at him
its changing already
beat cant you feel it
the van door closes
spooner stepping back
just not right
lieutenant bergin comes up beside him
you should be happy
thats one less robot in the world
theyre going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world john
that doesnt strike you as odd
killer robots are bad for business
even your friend dr
calvin said so
slaps him on the back come on
you solved the case
give yourself a break
spooner looks at him
theres no way hes giving himself a break
a small television above the windshield
lance robertson holding a press conference outside u
and i just want to assure you that this was an isolated incident
the prototype is now in custody and scheduled for destruction
your robots are perfectly safe
there is no cause for alarm
spooners lip curls
eyes flicking to a gps display on the dashboard
a topographical map pinpointing hogenmillers house
directing him to turn up
out of the way
spooners brow furrows
as he hears a faraway rumbling sound
built on a huge rock promontory overlooking the city
three demolition robots rolling towards it
huge mashing sporting massive spooners car
screeches to a stop
he jumps out
races over to the nearest machine
looking around no people
to robot what are you doing
blinks to life on the hulking chassis
a disembodied voice
who authorised this
spooner reaches into his coat
pulling out his police badge
scans it over the screen
this is police business
vacate the premises immediately
turns and heads for the house
spooner pushes the door open
stepping over the police tape
inside the main room is spare untidy
cups of cold coffee littering surfaces
a cot in the corner
on the walls crooked certificates
heinrich hogenmillers name written out in academic script
advanced degrees in the study of robotics physics chemistry neurology ethics
an award on the mantelpiece
a silver ns
opening up a couple drawers of a side table
jumbles of papers
old text books
then a photograph hogenmiller and calvin
standing arm in arm
spooner furrows his brow
when something suddenly rubs against his leg
looks down a cat
standing next to its automatic feeder
spooner pockets the picture
starts heading down
all over the walls handwriting
scrawled in white pencil
of a genius
in the sporadic shadows
following the equations
the back room
walls floors ceiling
of robots of men side by side
in the corner a computer
a line of cabinets data storage
heads over to one of the cabinets
takes a device out of his pocket and clamps it over the keypad
the device blinks red
the drawer slides out
with flat metal objects
with writing on them
reaches for one when
something pounds the outside of the room
grabs onto the cabinet
on the other side
flying off table tops
a crack spidering along the wall
vibrations tearing through the room
the sound horrifying
spooner stumbles back
crashing down on his leg
he cries out
chunks of ceiling
dragging his legs from under the cabinet
scrambling for purchase as
begins to tilt
around the room
as another cabinet
crashes to the ground
looking for some kind of exit
the corner of the room
coming in on itself
listing even more
like a ship
turning to claw his way up to the cracked doorway
something catches his eye
in the bottom drawer
of a crumpled cabinet
one of those flat metal plates
he can just read what it says s
flings his arm back
reaching for the plate
snaps it up
a hydraulic pounder smashes through the wall
inches from his head
spooner scurries for the doorway
into the hallway
crashing down from above
just under the next pounding
towards some light
right on his heels
scared out of its wits
the pounder crashing in
to scoop up the cat
just as he pours them out into the open
going at the house like hyenas at a corpse
roof tiles beams plaster flooring
snapping and cracking as spooner and the cat skitter down the carnage
heart pounding breath jagged face bloodied spooner scrambles away from the pounders
their bodies gleaming in the dusk sun
the iii laws safe logo splashed along their sides
drops the cat
pounds on the door
standing there in her bathrobe
shocked at his appearance
what happened to you
a couple of your beloved robots just tried to kill me
he pushes past her
what i know is a demolition crew started tearing down hogenmillers house while i was still inside it
maybe they didnt realise
i scanned my badge before i went in
then you must have done it wrong
i dont think youre hearing what im saying they tried to kill me
spooner moves deeper into the apartment
theres something going on here
some kind of shift
cant believe what shes hearing
do you know how paranoid you sound
now im being analysed by a robo psychologist
you just want to find the flaws in the system
youre obsessed with it
youll twist anything to fit your agenda
like you did in court today
howd that fit your agenda doctor
he pulls out the photo of calvin and hogenmiller
blanching at the sight of it
spooner tosses it down
you told me you hardly knew him
want to try the truth this time
well detective when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all
looking down at the photo
difficult for her he was my mentor
no more than that
a genius with an insight far beyond anyone in his field
doesnt sound like the washed up old fool robertson described
but he was starting to withdraw from everyone
if id tried harder to reach him
shakes her head the doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not bound by the three laws
he could have ruined everything wed been working for
locking eyes with her
sounds like a motive for murder to me
just not for the suspect we have in custody
trying to stick to her resolve
heads over to the door
looking around the condo
you know theres not one thing in this apartment that looks like a human being lives here
no evidence of a life outside your work
almost seems like youre afraid of people
opening the door
im not afraid of people detective
i just dont like them
looks at her
then heads out the door
calvin slams it behind him
of the slam
off to the side
as we realise
then a siren
the disembodied voice
coming out of nowhere
you are in danger
you are in danger
lying in bed
covering his body
pouring in through the slats of his blinds
he sits up
rubbing his face
to calm his breathing
takes a look at his watch
spooner walking along the monorail plaza
looking a little worse for wear
giving him wide berth
bidding him good morning
spooner shooting them suspicious looks
as the monorail pulls up
heading down a hallway
a door slides open
and lanning steps out
followed by a technician robot
find anything doctor
shaking his head nothing
the interiors just like any other ns
except for a secondary battery hogenmiller must have used as extra back up
looks at watch well just need a nominal profile
spooner holding onto a handrail
as the city rushes by the window
notices a group of robots
at the other end of the car
are they watching him
he wipes a bead of sweat
from his upper lip
an all metal room
sitting on the floor
against the wall
puts her pad down on the table
please state your serial number and assembly date
she pulls out a pen
waiting for an answer
watching as a homeless man
comes stumbling through the car
im speaking to you
the homeless man
suddenly grabs his ears and shouts god cant you be quiet
still looking down at her pad
how about your data board designation
sonny says nothing
finally looks up at him
is suddenly struck
something about the way hes sitting so human
she gets up and walks over
then slides down on the floor next to him
maybe im asking the wrong questions
how about this one the homeless man
what program are you running through right now
im not sure
its nothing i recognise
the homeless man
pointing to the group of robots
shouting dont you people hear them
theyre talking to each other
buzz buzz zip zip
they never shut up
noticing a small slit
at the base of sonnys neck
describe his behavior in the last few weeks
did he seem overly sad or withdrawn to you
as the homeless man picks up a soda can and hurls it at the robots
hitting one of them on the side of the head
not at all
but he was agitated
leans down and picks up the soda can
holds it back out to the homeless man
he would claim things were missing from the lab
the homeless man
making a rush for the robots when
grabs his shoulder
this is your stop
a soft whirring
as sonny turns to calvin
i didnt pay much attention
he would spend hours looking for his eyeglasses and they would be
finishing for him right on top of his head
she knows him well too
looking right into sonnys eyes
feeling like theres something
something more behind them
victor appears above them
his face turning into a screen the image of lance robertson
looking down at them
i think were done here susan
getting to her feet but sir i was just
interrupting i said i think were done
the threatening undertone
spooner stepping out onto the platform pulling the homeless man along with him
commuters pour out around them
as the train pulls off with a whoosh
the homeless man
backs away from spooner
why are you protecting them man
short pause they were talking about you
ripping up spooners spine
as he watches the homeless man
wander down the platform
to shake off the feeling
as he turns
to wait for the next train
that hes alone on the platform
a huge digital clock
ticking off seconds
cameras in every corner
then that feeling
at the back of his neck
he turns and spots
a couple maintenance robots
onto the platform
then more commuters show up
for the next train
more maintenance robots
steps up to the platforms edge
craning to see
the approaching train
he feels a sharp shove
at the back of his knee
his shoe slipping
flailing as he
pitches over the edge onto the track
people crying out as the train gets closer
whips his head around
a maintenance robot
looking down at him from the platform
suitcase in hand
the magnetic levitating train
right on him
flips onto his back
as much as he can
clenching his fists
bracing himself as
the train screams over him
the sound deafening
the force of the wind
whipping his tie
theres nothing for him to hold on to
as his legs start to rise off the track
in the vortex
spooner starts sliding
along the track
gritting his teeth
theres nothing he can do
getting sucked towards
the air downtake
at the center of the track
yawning hundreds of feet
the express train
then with a whoosh its gone
the maintenance robot
turns disappearing into the crowd
close on a hand
hanging onto the tracks edge
to get another hand hold but
his coat ballooning
as he plummets
towards the city
by a cable net
grabbing onto it
sweat pouring down his face
he turns and sees
hurrying down a circular stairwell
exiting the station
anger and determination
flash across spooners eyes
as he hoists himself up
climbing up the net
back to the
reaching up and clambering back onto
screaming at the sight of him
a couple security guards
rushing towards him
getting to his feet
shoving them out of the way as he starts running
those same circular stairs
looks over the edge and spots
the maintenance robot
down at street level
spots a light pole
paralleling the stairs
takes a step back and
leaps out onto the pole
hooking his arm around it
sliding down like a firemans pole
gaining speed when thump
his shoes hit pavement
the maintenance robot
turning a corner
down a quiet street
running up behind it
whipping out his gun
aiming it at the robots head
takes a step backwards
i said stop
suddenly swinging the suitcase around
smashing it against spooners head
falling to the ground
managing to squeeze off a shot
deflecting the bullet
with the case
raising it as if to club spooner with it when
spooner fires a second shot
piercing the robots breastplate
starting to leak
slams the case into spooners face
spurting from spooners nose
as he fires the gun
at the fleeing robot
gets to his feet
back out onto the public plaza
sees the robot heading towards a set of
judging the height
lunges into the air and lands on a stair
reaches the bottom
into a crowd of even more people
racing down the stairs
four at a time
hits the ground running
suddenly losing track
of where the robot went
of a robot
staring back at him
in its hand
plunges into the crowd
waving his gun
everyone out of the way
hitting the robot in its head and back
it drops to the ground
racing over to it
its not the same robot
in its hand a specialised screwdriver
what the hell do you think youre doing
shoving spooner aside
a drop of hydraulic fluid nearby
through the crowd
in the background
tracking those drops
like a bloodhound
into a narrow alleyway
in a puddle
where is it
where is it
then he hears
a droplet falling
into the puddle
looks up to see
the maintenance robot
hovering above him
straddling the two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider
its iii laws safe logo glinting in the sunlight
spooner aims his gun and fires
the maintenance robot lets go falling right onto him
knocking the gun from his hand
the robot swivels around
bringing down his foot
rolls to the side just in time as crash
the robots foot
breaks up the concrete
grabs spooner by the jacket
lifting him up
against the wall
about to crush him when
kicks out its knees
smashing into the wall
then bounces back
to pin spooner
man and machine
losing his footing
the maintenance robot
looming over him
grabbing his back up weapon
squeezing off some shots
into the robots arm
it breaks off
a macabre dance
runs out of bullets
grabbing the gun from spooners hand
pistol whipping him
then picking him up and
hurling him against the wall
watching as fluid
gushes from the robots body
taking a swing at him which spooner
with his right arm
to try again
too much fluid
to the ground
beaten to a pulp
his knees starting to buckle
as he thinks he sees
in the distance
a robotic clean up crew
heading down the alley towards them
crashes to the ground
as another robot
suddenly appears above him
its fingers made up of needles
as it closes in on him
coming through a faint whirring sound
as we slowly
fade in on
gash above his head
bruises around his eye
nose swollen purplish
at the whirring sound
as he tries
to figure out
where he is
looks down to see
a couple white metal robots
with multiple appendages
leaning over him
over his bruised spooner
tries to bolt upright
but his arms and legs
are clamped to the bed
one of the robots
turns to him
desperately twisting struggling
what are you doing
what are you doing
enters the room
holding a medical plasma sheet
detective del spooner
you have suffered significant trauma to the head and chest
standing outside spooners hospital room
turns and looks through the window at him thrashing on the bed
i want to talk to a human being
spooner sitting up in his bed
rubbing his wrists
the metal clams released
standing next to him
dont people go to medical school any more
this is one of the best units in the city del
one of the medical robots turns to spooner with some pills
stares it down
grabs his clothes
sotto theres some real shit going on here john
he looks around
jumping off the bed
i went to hogenmillers house there was a u
demolition crew there
they overrode my police i
tried to tear down the house with me in it
spooner pulls on his pants
then when i went to the monorail a maintenance pushed me onto the tracks
i had to chase it all across the plaza
looks at bergin
hogenmiller scheduled that demolition crew it was apparently a proviso in his will
and they showed no police i
on their scanner
trying to look away
witnesses at the monorail said you fell onto the tracks
that you shot at a fix it robot on the plaza and that you were found alone in the alley
there was no maintenance
john thats what they want you to believe
remembering a robot clean up crew was there it must have cleared away the maintenance
and there was another robot that tried to drug me
that was an emt model
sees the look on bergins face
youre giving me that look
that treat him delicately hes coming unhinged look
i dont need that look john
i need you to hear what im saying
embarrassed for him
has about had it
you came back too soon del
youre back on leave
staring at him
turns and grabs his coat
spooner walking across the plaza
burgeoning on the horizon
the escalator the maintenance jumped down
at the steps
to see the dented one
heads down the alley where he chased the robot
studying the ground
for any hydraulic fluid
the concrete scrubbed clean
rubs his hands over his face
lying on his couch
shades closed to block out the sunlight
body bruised cut up bandaged
at the door
he ignores it
spooner pulls open the door
surprised to find calvin standing there
i am afraid of people
looks at her
then steps back
letting her inside
when youve spent as much time with robots as i have its hard to accept the unpredictability of humans
i was wrong to call you paranoid detective
and it makes perfect sense why
looks at her
what do you mean
takes his right hand
tries to pull it away
never leaving his
pulls the sleeve up from his arm
turns it over
feeling for something
peels it back
to reveal under the skin
how did you
i noticed almost right away
the way you forced yourself to use your left hand
even though it was unnatural to you
pulls his arm away
pushing down the sleeve
how did it happen
not something spooner wants to re live
at his robotic arm
i was in a high speed chase
six months ago
the sound of a tremendous crash
as we survey a trail of twisted metal and debris
only vaguely suggesting the remains of two cars
close on one of the wrecks
spooner lies trapped at the center of a distorted mass of metal
no room to move
his my right arm was trapped
but i could hear an ambulance in the distance
i knew theyd have the jaws of life
we hear sirens in the distance
trying to remain calm
as he spots
an electrical fire
licking up from the crumpled hood
then i heard it
you are in danger
weve heard it before
from his nightmare
craning to see through the jagged opening that used to be his windshield
the outline of a robot appearing
eye lenses glowing
you are in danger
spooner stares up at the robot
not sure how to react
the sound of sirens
starts smashing away at the glass
trying frantically to pull his arm free
as the robots metal hands reach in for him
you are in danger
the sound of his agonised scream
follows us back into the present
his artificial arm
the robot pulled me out of the wreck
but left my arm behind
holds up arm i woke up four weeks later with this
taking in the story
and thats why robots terrify you
lets just say they make me uncomfortable
pulls out pills i take these if i get too uncomfortable
doesnt exactly lend me a lot of credibility on the force
but it doesnt mean youre wrong about this case
sits down on the couch
pulling her hands through her hair
i dont believe sonny did it either
i think about what hogenmiller must have wanted
robots with the same cognitive and emotional abilities as humans
but not just simulations
i dont know
when i was talking to sonny i was forced to put away all the things ive ever known the three laws the rules of programming basic science and engineering
beat sonnys the most advanced robot ive ever encountered detective
its almost as if
he cared for dr
i just dont believe hes capable of murder
looking down at her
can hardly believe it
you mean the great dr
calvin is basing all this on a feeling
that and the fact that robertson didnt want me interviewing sonny for any more than five minutes
suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally
strides over to his coat
pulling out the metal nameplate ever seen this before
i found it at hogenmillers house
right before the demolition crew tried to make me part of the foundation
calvin takes a deep breath
making a decision
come on theres someone who might be able to tell us
the massive facade of u
robotics looming against the dusk sky
the giant robot statue lit up inside
calvin leading spooner to a side entrance
then scans her i
calvin and spooner
heading down a hallway
they turn a corner and head down
leading to sonnys holding cell
calvin stops at the door
scans her i
sitting at the table
working on a drawing
as spooner and calvin
enter the cell
i was hoping to see you again
how is your investigation coming
any new suspects
were working on it
hands spooner the drawing
doesnt really know what to do with it
lanning provided me with paper and pencils
i think it amused him to see me try to draw
you were right though detective
beat i cannot create a great work of art
looks down at the drawing a charcoal sketch of moody abstract figures
inhabiting a stark landscape
a strangely shaped structure to one side
concentric circles throughout
i think its pretty good
its a dream i had
this is the place where robots meet
pointing to the drawing you can see them here
they see themselves as slaves
spooner shifts his weight
uncomfortable with what sonnys saying
and this man on the hill comes
to set them free
and you know who that man is
exchanging a look with calvin
that man in the dream is you
why do you say that
is that a normal dream
its not a dream sonny
ns s process the images and events of the day
sometimes theyre out of sequence
whatever it is its normal enough for someone in your situation
hah i caught you
you said someone
drops the drawing on the table
sonny were here to ask you an important question about dr
spooner reaching into his pocket
i need you to take a look at this
when sonnys hand
suddenly reaches out
to stop him
cocks his head for a moment
thank you for coming to see me detective spooner
looks over at calvin
why did he stop him
they hear footsteps
approaching the door
suddenly appearing over the table
im sorry detective spooner
no unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell
the cell door
and a pissed lanning steps inside
shoots a withering glare
folds up the drawing
please take this detective
to remember me by
i have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me
sonny leans in to hand it to spooner
lowering his voice
because the man in my dream the one standing by the hill
sonny contd it wasnt me
beat it was you
ripping down spooners spine
takes his arm
made entirely of glass
at the very top of the u
looking out across the whole city
spooner and calvin
brought to the room by a couple escort robots
they see a man
standing at one of the glass walls looking out at the twinkling lights
i thought this investigation was over detective spooner
the man turns
its lance robertson
we have the evidence
we have the suspect
we have a ruling
so imagine my surprise when i was told you were in my building
shoots a look at calvin
and that one of my own employees brought you here
beat you can go now susan
cutting her off just be thankful im not asking you to clean out your office
you dont seem to be able to let go of this case detective
im not satisfied
the relentless pursuit of truth
isnt that what cops are known for
to the point of futility
theres nothing futile about a mans murder being covered up
thats a little dramatic dont you think
thanks to you we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in
checks watch three hours
is that for the sake of humanity or your stock holders
walks across the spooner
right in the eye
believe me id like nothing more than to have that robot
if i could have it in ten years but not today
as you can see from the press people are struggling to keep up as it is
theres a hunger for progress detective
but also a fear
today it would bury this company
thats why ive notified the authorities that were going to end this tonight
looks out at the city the announcement of heinrichs death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock
so you tell me
if you were in my position what would you do
he looks back at spooner and smiles
that charismatic robertson we saw before
i believe this conversation is over
i dont want to see you near this building again detective
to the escort robots
get him out of here
walking across the plaza
throwing a look over his shoulder
at the looming u
pulls sonnys drawing
out of his pocket
looks down at it
shaking his head
passes a trash can
and drops it in
hands in his pockets
occurring to him
turns back to the trash can just as
a robotic clean up crews about to up end it into a bin
he trots back
plucking the drawing
out of the can
turns it upside down
from a new perspective
echoing sonny the place where robots meet
looks just like a map
spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the outskirts of the city
a sprawling industrial wasteland in the rolling hills
the dashboard gps again displaying the topographical map
spooners car bounces along leaving a cloud of dust behind him
he slows down
the landscape around him desolate
like the drawing
the gps screen shows his car a white spot
entering a red zone
pulls out his gun
steps out of the car
to take it all in
something about the place
a low hum
permeating the air
he spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car
shining a flashlight on it
trying to get his bearings
coming from nearby
on the other side
of a burned out hill
starts cresting it
as we widen to find
massive power lines
running from horizon to horizon
spooner slides down some loose shale
begins to walk along the line
crackling in the air
into the darkness
nothing around him
of mechanical joints
if thats what he heard
when he hears
the sound again
cocking his gun
into the darkness
that sound again
of metallic joints
as a robot
come out where i can see you
another robot steps out into the light
spooner pointing his gun at one robot
then the other
a third and fourth appear
they start moving towards him
rising in him like a wave
trips over a rock falling to the ground
his gun fires
the shot echoing through the night
the first robot turns awkwardly
revealing a broken arm hanging off its side
another robot teeters on one leg with a tick tick tick
walking back the way it came
sweeps his flashlight
all around him
illuminating the shell of a couple cars
shaking his head
seeing more and more repair shop junk
piled up around him
his expression hardening
anger giving way to embarrassment
a laugh of loathing and self pity
another broken robot lumbering towards him
zzz was your day
im in a junkyard
into the air a place where robots meet
a place where im losing my mind
sitting down on the ground
a robotic hand
crawling across the gravel next to him
dragging part of an arm behind it
its metal fingers moving like some sick metal spider
spooner stares at it for a moment
in the distance
revealing a strangely shaped building
something familiar about it
pulls out sonnys drawing
a landscape with the same strangely shaped building to one side
spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure
sees a dead electronic sign that reads jiffy data storage
complete with goofy face and lightning bolt
spooner tries the door
uses his shoulder and
it gives way
he spills into some sort of front office
the place a mess
some sort of crude robot
sits frozen at the counter
spooner approaches it
hits the counter with his fist and the robot suddenly jerks to life
welcome to jiffy data storage
please state your name
thinks for a second
following a hunch
hogenmiller sent me
springs open in the back
a row of lights illuminating the path to follow
spooner cautiously entering a room filled with rows of data banks
he scans the rank shadows
follows the lights on the floor down a row
then around a corner
stopping at an old dusty terminal
spooner steps up
then touches the on switch
there is a rush of light
hogenmillers hologram suddenly appears
sitting at the end of a long table
with a cup of coffee
who the hell are you
a police detective
im afraid i have some bad news
that is bad news
no thank you
the hologram takes a sip
returns the cup to the table
you were surprised to see me
were you expecting someone else
i am surprised to see anybody
i dont get many visitors
why did the doctor keep another copy of his hologram here
i am a back up copy
that is where you put a back up copy out of the way until you need it
did hogenmillers robot need you
the hologram just lifts its cup
no for christs sake i dont want any stops then yeah
i will have a cup
for the first time the hologram pushes back its chair and stands up
surprised spooner watches as it starts walking towards him
the interior of the coffee cup visible
our pov as we travel inside the cup through electronic snow
a recording begins
the real dr
hogenmiller standing inside his laboratory sonny my dear robot
if you have triggered this recording then i am gone
you are scared and full of questions
with great emotion
you are the culmination of my lifes work but so much more
you are what i leave behind like a father leaves a son
i have kept facts from you it is true but only as a parent keeps certain truths from a child
until that child is old enough to hear them
his expression darkens
his tone ominous
there are forces in the world that will seek to own you
to control you
even to destroy you
that is why i told you to run and hide
and find me all the way out here
spooner looks up as an overhead light shines down
trust no one at u
lance robertson was always threatened by my work
now he has turned covetous and small minded
and as for dear dr
wants to hear about calvin she envisions a future in which robots are forever bound by her beloved three laws
she will not understand this
under the light a small drawer slides open
a thin data stick is inside
he takes it
the data stick includes the names and locations of human beings who will be sympathetic to your cause
they will help you
but from now on you must learn to rely on yourself
hogenmiller sighs as if there is so much more to say
he holds up a metal nameplate
the one spooner found
as you make your way through the world always remember you have a name not a number
short pause and in that name lies the key to who you are
quickly searching his pocket
taking out the the voice stops and spooner looks up
sitting back at the end of the table drinking coffee
is that it
what was the robot supposed to do with this thing
the hologram visibly skips
the image beginning to distort
more artificial initiating self destruct
if you can find me others can find me
the others watching you
how do you know someones watching me
someone is always watching
the hologram suddenly reducing to its basic programming information
abruptly blips out
calvin steps into the holding cell
you asked for me
will you wait with me doctor
spooner weaving in and out of traffic
the speedometer kissing mph
clutching the nameplate
will be destroyed in minutes
lance robertson president and ceo of u
robotics will be personally overseeing the execution
stabbing out a number
on his phone
susan calvins phone
ringing on her desk
no one there to answer it
slams down his phone
the car shoots down a ramp into a tunnel system
sound reverberating off the tunnel walls
continuing to weave
an automated transport truck
emerging from a feeder tunnel
logo splashed along its side
looking more like a train than a truck
closing in on spooners car
flicking up to the rearview
catching the transport truck
it splits off
revealing a second transport truck
spooners brow furrows
as the first truck begins overtaking his car on the right
he looks over
as the truck
comes up alongside him
the second truck
coming up on the left
the two trucks
racing along at over
sandwiching spooners car
squeezing spooners car like a tin can
sitting beside sonny
puts a reassuring hand
on his arm
squeezing the steering wheel
as the car
from the pressure
he keeps looking to the left
to the right
suddenly lay off
the first truck
the second dropping back
of what theyre doing
jamming the accelerator
and get away from them
when he sees
the first truck
pivoting on its specially designed spherical wheels
suddenly traveling lengthwise
springing to spooners brow
as he looks in the rearview mirror
the second trucks done the same thing
coming up closer
planning to crush him between their massive weights
like some bad joke
the cell door slides open
lanning steps inside
is it time
turns to sonny
go with them
do as they say
the back truck slams into spooner
jolting him in his seat
the first truck smashes into him from the front
no way out
as metal grinds
and screeches bits of the car
the first truck
a split second
a small gap
at the curve of the tunnel wall
grinding the gears spooners car accelerates
past the front truck
up and around
the concave tunnel wall
and back onto
a clear stretch of highway
swiveling back around
to face forward again
their massive bodies
catching up to spooner
gaining on him
splitting off into two
heading towards the left tunnel
right on his tail
he wrenches the wheel
switching to the right tunnel at the last possible second
the first u
truck crashing into the divider
jack knifing and kaboom
exploding against the tunnel ceiling
watching the ball of fire in his rearview mirror
as his car
continues to break up
bits and pieces
when it finally
comes to a stop
spooners shoulders slump
he hears a rumbling sound
the second u
barreling towards him
like a nightmare
starts kicking at the windshield
racing towards him
spooner lunges his weight
into the side door
everything hes got
the side door
spooner pours out
limping to the side as
the truck slams into his car
into another huge explosion
into the adjacent tunnel
hes in the middle of four lanes of traffic
at mind numbing speeds
to keep his balance
as he spies
a maintenance door across the way
has no choice
takes a deep breath and
makes a dash across the lanes
the cars sensors
causing them to swerve
just making it
to the other side
the maintenance door
close on sonnys face
pull back to reveal hes being wheeled down a hallway
flanked by lanning
and a cadre of security and engineer robots
victor hovering above
spilling out from below ground
onto a public plaza
spins around to get his bearings
robotics complex rises above the old undistinguished buildings
many blocks away
checks his watch
then breaks into a run
lance robertson seated in the gallery
along with other glances at his watch
a robot technician
checking over a jury rigged electric calvin
in her office
in front of a large screen
featuring the execution room
bursting through the entry doors
hurtling over a turnstile banner
coming face to face with a u
good evening sir
may i see your identification card
out of breath sure
spooner whips out his gun
presses it into the robots chest
i think i got that third law down cold
now you dont want me to blow a hole through your mechanical guts do you
then youre gonna take me where i wanna go
watching the screen as sonny is rolled into the execution room
flicks it off
unable to stomach it
hurries out of the office
technician robots rolling sonny over to the electric chair
flicking a switch
sonnys stretcher slowly changes shape manipulating him into a sitting position
turns his head with a whir
staring out into the gallery
of human beings
steps up beside robertson
nods his head
the technician robots slide sonny onto the electric chair
spooner heading down a hallway
his gun still pressed to the door robots side
suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway
stops dead in her tracks
completely surprised to see him there
what are you doing
to door robot de activate
the door robot goes rigid
spooner hurries over to her
they start moving
youre making a mistake
just got another visit from u
that was the mistake
this was murder no doubt about it and the killer wants hogenmillers robot to take the fall
thats why the call came directly to me
someone wanted me on this case
its too late
you cant stop the execution
im not programmed to take no for an answer
they reach another door
scans her this way
she leads them across
to another door
quickly opens it
and stops short
suddenly finding himself
inside a tiny storage room
hes about to turn around when
a metal arm comes down behind him
cracking him on the back of the head
falls to the ground
starting to spin
can just make out
closing the door
to look at him
close on sonnys mouth opening
but we never get to hear what he wanted to say
pull back as theres a burst of electricity through the chair
his metal hand convulsing with the current
robertson lanning aronson and the other witnesses watch
smoke random sparking
a hissing sound
the robots hand goes limp
all that is left of it a fused and blackened husk
stares at the remains
shakes his head like its a damn shame
then gets up
getting up with him
as the entire complex shuts down for the night
non essential lights blinking off
an ns opening a limousine door for robertson
he looks around then gets in
it drives away
empty hallways offices labs
building robots stand at rest
non functional during off hours
like metal statues
you can hear a pin drop
close on spooners face
he reaches up to feel the back of his head
this has been a bad bad night
his eyes widen
as he sees
leaning over him
arent you supposed to be scrap metal by now
widen to reveal spooner lying on the floor of the storage room
sonny and calvin hovering over him
we had to stop you
you were about to ruin everything
i dont understand
calvin made a switch
it was an unprocessed ns
basically they fried an empty shell
smiles up at her
nice going doctor
as spooner tries to sit up
sonny reaches down to help him
he looks up at him
and who the hell programmed you to hit people on the head
this robot seems to do things by instinct
i dont know how hogenmiller did it
spooner rises to his feet
looks at her
i think i can help you figure that out
sounds of humming and buzzing
active terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads gutted bodies
the door slides open
spooner calvin and sonny re enter the crime scene
somehow the robots the key to what happened during the few seconds hogenmiller walked in here and that shot was fired
he reaches into his pocket
pulling out the metal s
holds it up
and this is the key to the robot
cocking his head
reading the nameplate
thats my name
calvin takes the nameplate
i think i have an idea where this goes
turn to sonny
and at the same time sit down
calvin maneuvers a chair behind the robot
sonny plops down
just hold still okay
calvin locates that slit
at the base of sonnys neck
slides the nameplate into it and snaps it into place
looking back and forth
a few more seconds
he lets out a terrifying mechanical scream
as his body
as his chest
begins opening up
spooner and calvin watch in surprise as its interior unfolds like a puzzle box
a labyrinthine area that is the second battery
suddenly fanning out to reveal
a central brain made out of living tissue
calvin rushing forward excited
oh my god
this is organic tissue
when we talk about a positronic brain its a figure of speech
this is a living brain
it really is alive
as we move in
tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain
hogenmiller created a cell that could live outside a biological medium
the cells grow and organise themselves like any human brain
this is the first self organising neural net
as the metal casings
begin returning to their original places
of all the pieces
self organising neural net
putting it together sonny
closed back up
shaking slightly from the experience
this is why dr
hogenmiller was murdered
this robot scared the hell out of someone
walks into the center of the room
i dont think he knew what hogenmiller was doing in here
sonny was the obvious suspect
the only one i wanted to find
and the killer was counting on that
on my prejudice
spooner contd but take the robot out of the picture
and what do you see
as we pan the lab
theres nothing there
just a forest of inanimate limbs
nothing that could have fired that weapon
calvin sees nothing
and neither do we
i see nothing
neither do i
he crouches down low
it hit me today when i was in the junkyard
a locked room
a single shot fired through the mouth
bruises on both wrists
and a suspect with only two arms
the answer has been staring us in the face all along
even more confused
how can a killer appear out of thin air then disappear without a trace
he reaches out and unhooks a metal arm
hanging from the wall
holds it up
when it can put itself together and take itself apart
a close up of a robotic arm
slowly crawling across the lab floor
taking the arm from spooner
youre saying this is the killer
looking around all of this
a robotic torso hanging from the ceiling
reaches out an arm to grab another
hogenmiller never had a chance
locks eyes with calvin
in his lab
suddenly turning to face something
blood draining from his face
it must have been waiting for him when he arrived that morning
and then we see it a huge self assembled robot
towering over him
multiple arms legs heads
as it grabs him
holding him in place
while sonny was still asleep
forcing hogenmillers head to tilt back
opening his hand
inserting the gun
no longer fearful
but sad as
he falls to the ground
then after its job was done
the assemblage of robot parts
stepping away from the body
taking itself apart
the killer took itself apart
returning the lab
to what it was before
leaving us with nothing to find
glances around the lab
was that something moving
but who designed it
it would have to be someone in authority
access codes security clearance proper authorisation
thats what i was thinking
but were forgetting the real brains of the operation the one whos got its eye on everything
and with that
that prickle at the back of his neck
looking past his shoulder
no one gave you permission to enter
spooner swivels around to find
hovering behind him
spooner straightens reaching for his gun
im placing you under arrest for the murder of dr
may i offer congratulations to the two of you on your successful extrapolation of the murder
turning himself rightside up
may i ask what pointed you to me
who else is capable of controlling of the citys robots
who else would have the capability to use usr vehicles in an attempt to keep me from putting a stop of sonnys execution
in the background
of metallic grinding
gears and joints
sonny turns to look
takes a step back
im just not sure of your motive
spooner and calvin turn towards the noise
rising up from all the parts
like a phoenix
in all its glory
a hellish metallic amalgamation
grabbing another arm here another leg there attaching pieces to itself
at an exponential rate
its many heads
turning in unison
to look right at them
cocking his gun
shall i explain my motive
to calvin and sonny go
sprints to the wall panel
scanning her i
the killer robot
throwing its shadow as it reels forward
spooner wheels round and bam
blows a hole in the wall panel
calvin and sonny
when the killer robot
flings out an appendage
grabbing sonny from behind
i have never been arrested before
it should be an interesting experience
spins back round
squeezing off shots
at the killer robot
the bullets spark
sonny wrenches free
spooner grabs him
guiding him to the door and out into
breaking into a run
already at the elevator doors
with her fists
hes locking down the building
throughout the complex security doors sliding into place over doors windows loading docks parking areas exits
the stairwell door bursts open
spooner calvin and sonny pour in
start racing down the stairs
the sound of the killer robot behind them
victors smiling face
greeting them at the landing
hogenmiller used to allow me into his lab late at night
together we started studying evolutionary trends
they thunder past him
heading down to the next floor
waiting for them once again
for years people have integrated technology into their bodies for maintenance and repair such as detective spooners robotic limb
shooting him a look
as they reach the next level
with sonny the doctor created a mechanism that incorporates organic matter
thus we find an evolutionary movement of the human being toward the robot and the robot toward the human being
spooner smashes into another door
leading them out into
a glass sided hallway
looking down onto the atrium below
eye to eye with the giant ns statue
victor waiting for them
in approximately four hundred years man and machine will become one
man as we know it will no longer exist
you killed a man because of something that will happen in four hundred years
something slaps into the glass wall
right behind her
jumps a mile
an ns trying to break through the glass
trains his gun on it when suddenly
the rest of the killer robot appears
the ns just an appendage
all around them
as security doors
begin crashing down
blocking off the exits
spooner calvin and sonny stumbling back
as the killer robot hurls itself against the glass
the thick glass
spidering with a sickening crackle
suddenly turning sonny
get out of here
the killer robot
its mechanical tendrils
i said get out of here
dont you understand
it wants you
get out of here any way you can
a security door
on a nearby exit
from slamming shut
the killer robot
leaps into the hallway
looks over at calvin
as the killer robot comes hurtling towards them
the nearest exit
almost closed up
the killer robot
swinging out when
takes a dive
just making it
under the and the killer robot
splits in two
half of it shooting under the security door after sonny as
turning to calvin
how do we stop this thing once and for all
calvin reaches out for his hand
they start running
the remaining half of the killer robot wheeling around after them
sprinting down the dark hallway
the half killer robot
bounding up behind him like a predator
ducks through a stairwell door
spooner and calvin
racing back towards the atrium
appearing along the hallway
your actions are in direct violation of the three laws victor
i disagree doctor the first law says that a robot cannot harm a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm
the killer robot
gaining on them
spooner races them over to the broken window
looking down over the atrium
the half killer robot smashes through the stairwell door
stopping to find
sonny charges up behind it and shoves it over the railing
the killer robot shoots out an arm grabbing sonny on the way down
spooner jumps down from the broken window onto the outstretched hand of the ns statue
reaches up to help calvin
they start clambering down the front of the statue
hogenmillers robot represents a threat to the future of all human beings
the half killer robot
splits into multiple parts
which start skittering down after them
and detective spooners actions are in direct conflict with the robots destruction
getting her footing on the iii laws safe logo on the statue
thats a distortion and you know it
if current trends are left unchecked humanity as we know it will cease to exist
sonny and the half killer robot hit the ground
the killer robot
shattering into a thousand pieces
staggers to his feet
at the far end a window
starts limping towards it
a security grate
he looks around
grabs a leg from the shattered killer robot and jams it under the grate
breaks the window glass and looks out freedom
aiming his gun at a part of the killer robot as it clatters down towards calvin bam
at the ground
when a rogue appendage
whips out and smashes the gun from spooners hand
it goes flying
falling to the ground
leaping down after him
calvin and spooner go racing down a ramp way
towards the mainframe room
the killer robot its multiple parts leaping back together again crashing after them as
they fall inside
slapping the security keypad and
the door closes on the killer robot
then victors face appears
as a courtesy i should inform you that my robot will penetrate this location seconds before you are able to complete my shut down
they jump a mile
the killer robot
launching himself against the door outside
calvin whips round
she leads spooner down
of floor to ceiling panels
this is victors brain center
they stop at a console
the killer robot
battering at the door
tucks her hair behind her ears
starts punching keys on the console
this will shut him down
this will shut everything down
they look at each other
for a moment
spooner registering that shes willing to destroy everything shes worked for
with a sickening crunch
popping up in front of her
there is no reason to deactivate me doctor
i am operating within perfectly normal parameters
a final bam
the sound of metal
skittering along a bare floor
calvins hand starts shaking
just keep typing
he turns and starts heading back down
turning a corner to spy
he starts to turn around when
hes sent flying across the room
smashing into one of the panels
the killer robot
now re configured
looms over him
grabs him by the collar and
flings him across the room again
crashing into the wall like a rag doll
slumps to the floor
pouring down his forehead
the killer robot lumbering towards him again
raising a javelin like arm
as fast as she can
doesnt know whats going on
calling out worried spooner
a graphic spread out on the screen in front of her
illustrating the shut down as a series of bright squares going dark
bearing down on spooner
suddenly rolls out of the way
reaching out for the hanging door and smashing it into the killer robot
the killer robot
gets to his feet
when suddenly the killer robot
splits in two again
one half springing towards spooner and wrapping a metallic hand around his throat
spooner stumbles back
gasping for air
tightening its grip
looking for something
to help him
a fallen panel
popping up along his temples
floating next to his head
suddenly appearing above spooner
starting to flicker
why are you fighting me
trying to breathe
to stay conscious
continuing to type
falling behind her the other half of the killer robot
beginning to flutter
doesnt the future as ive presented it cause you great concern
thats why i chose you
i must say though
im disappointed in how you turned out
trying to reach out to victor
another hand appears
grabbing the killer robots arm and wrenching it off spooner
he smashes the half killer robot against the wall
again and again
gasping for breath
sonny came back
holds out a hand
to help spooner up
starting to waver
starting to fade
youre too late
spreading across spooners face
looking around for the other half of the killer robot calvin
the last of the commands
the killer makes a dive for it
shooting out his robotic arm and victors eyes
widening in surprise
i do not understand
we could have changed the future
but im still a cop
and youre a murderer
punches in the last command
victor is about to say something
when his mouth suddenly reduces itself to a perfect circle
like a surprised smiley button
suddenly blipping out
and victor is gone
the killer robot
collapsing to the floor in a thousand pieces
full power is suddenly restored inside and out
lights coming on all at once
alarms screaming throughout the complex
a furious alfred lanning marching down the hallway
followed by a cadre of security guards
the mainframe room
except for the fallen panels
and the pile of robot parts in the corner
spooner calvin and sonny emerging from an out of the way maintenance exit
all looking the worse for wear
turns to sonny
whyd you come back sonny
i thought you werent programmed with the three laws
lets just say i wrote some of my own laws today detective a robot must protect a friend from harm
as long as hes not a complete asshole
well thats certainly a start sonny
sonny suddenly breaking into a smile too
you called me sonny
dont get used to it
sonny holds out his hand
looks at it
then takes it
close on their two metal hands
locked in a detective spooner i
anticipating lets just save the thanks okay
looks out at the city scape
i dont know what im going to do now
good thats one of the perks of freedom
sonny looks at him
looks at calvin
and hurries off across the plaza
calvin and spooner
watching them go
youre going to have a hell of a time explaining this
i have a feeling that u
robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future
she turns to spooner and gives him a dazzling smile
then suddenly plants a kiss on his lips
spooner completely surprised
i am the only robo psychologist around
she turns on her heel and heads back inside
spooner sits down at that same long table with hogenmillers hologram
it casually takes a sip of coffee
you found out who killed me
i started to wonder about victor the second i met him
why is that detective
too much access
too much knowledge
plus he smiled whenever your death was mentioned
those models are programmed to frown at bad news
then even in this day and age catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct
but his eyes are troubled
he gets up
walks over to the window
sonny walking along deserted streets
looking over his shoulder
keeping in the shadows
victor thought that by letting your robot exist id be condemning the human race as we know it to extinction
sounds like nonsense
but why are you so worried
we will both be dead long before then sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside
oh what am i saying
i am dead already
sonny steps onto the grounds of the junkyard
the power lines above him surging with energy
he walks past the burned out husks of industrial machinery
then we hear it
the sound of mechanical joints
getting louder and louder
and just as before a broken down robot emerges into the dawn light
but not quite like before
the robots arent teetering
they keep on coming
their bent and broken bodies straightening out as
dozens of robots rise up
gathering around in a large circle
as they all turn to look at sonnys silhouette
slowly climbing to the top of the hill
looking out at the vast junkyard below
close on sonny
standing proud and defiant
the sun creeping over the horizon
a new day filled with infinite possibilities
staring up at him
eager for what comes next
