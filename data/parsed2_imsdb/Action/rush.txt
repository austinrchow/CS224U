written by peter morgan december th dark clouds passing overhead
the bad weather that has hovered over the eifel mountains in germany the past three days is on its way out
a pupil dilates and contracts in the light
the eye stares
the first rays of sunshine break through
the voices of international tv commentators in different languages
in places the track is still dangerously wet but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken
the race is going ahead
the eye belongs to a year old formula racing driver wearing a fireproof balaclava
highly intelligent he also happens to be world champion
his name is painted on the side of his ferrari
my grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live or how much we achieve we are remembered for very little
so make sure its the right things
niki stares up at the clouds
his eyelids flicker
wrestling with an all important decision
is it going to carry on raining
or become dry
should he be using slicks or wets
we widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major grand prix
all around us
engines scream into life as drivers start their cars
an official walks through the cars holding aloft a sign one minute
deafening angry thunder as engines rev impatiently
this is bullshit
we have no control over our legacy
we cannot choose what we are remembered for
a ferrari mechanic rushes towards niki and shouts in italian above the noise we see sub titles
mass usa slicks
le vuoi cambiare anche tu
mass is going on slicks
you want to change
niki looks in his wing mirror back to see a red mclaren white helmet number several rows behind him
a team of mechanics hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres
otherwise i wouldnt be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole
and the season
niki then looks over at the car in pole position beside him
another mclaren but with number and a union jack
what about hunt
has he changed
no hes going on wets
the car in pole position james hunt surrounded by tv crews mechanics girlfriends hangers on
the maclaren team is less than half the size of ferraris but hunt makes up for this with magnetism
the rock star of f
nikis face a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rivals glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava flirting with several hot looking girls
i dont know why it became such a big thing
we were just drivers
busting each others balls
to me this is perfectly normal
but other people saw it differently
niki contid that whatever it was between us went deeper
and changed us both somehow
niki stares then
be allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato
then we go on wets too
the ten second board is held up
niki pulls down his visor
as he and hunts eyes meet for a split second eyes staring
niki selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine
the dashboard needle climbs through maybe that explains the state of mind i was in
and why it happened
the other thing im remembered for
a beat on august st that same year
caption august st
the starter waves the flag
nikis foot hits the floor his engine screams that deafening stomach rearranging high pitch scream drowning out the roar of the crowd
nikis car is catapaulted forward violently the wheel spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt
niki gets away first
a good start
but within seconds theres a mclaren car right behind him breathing down his neck
his arch rival
but as the mclaren roars past niki sees a white helmet
its not hunt
on his bald slick tyres
niki curses under his breath
he screwed up
made the wrong decision
should have gone on slicks
he urgently needs to change tyres
niki swerves angrily into the pits
ferraris pit is right at one end
commentary from all the worlds tv stations explaining the crazy panicked situation as all the drivers come into the pits to change to dry tyres
a traffic jam of formula cars
the ferrari team frantically work
changing nikis tyres
four men with air guns two men with rapid duty jacks
the same italian mechanic appears plugs in his headset to the car
ti aveto detto di usare le slicks
i told you to go on slicks
niki looks up to see the name james hunt written on the black helmet roar out of the pits ahead with new tyres on
niki screams at the mechanics who are struggling
the airguns make a high pitched noise
somethings not right
whats going on
thump new slick tyres hit the tarmac engines scream and niki exit the pits in pursuit of hunt
but the delay has cost him dear
archive tv commentary from the worlds race commentators stations informs us of the positions
mass leading hunt in rd lauda in th
niki gives it everything hes got
tearing through the gears trying to catch james hunt breaking as late as he can engine screaming
he flies over the take off hump between pflanzgarten and swallowtail passes one car after another
into th place now
pulling off outrageous manoeuvres
v the world flies past in a blur
the steering wheel shakes
the car is right on the edge
cannot be driven any harder
niki approaches the streckenteil adenauer brucke section of the course
turns left at the bergwerk corner
thump his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the inside
niki tries to counter steer but is travelling at mph
the car jerks horribly to the right
crunch hits the embankment then bang hits the barrier and is thrown across the track
fire breaks out in the engine
nikis eyes widen in horror with another car bearing down upon him
the oncoming car crashes head on into our car crash a sickening terrifying impact
the car explodes
seventy litres of burning high octane gasoline with niki strapped inside unable to undo his seatbelt
locked in a blast furnace
niki screams as the flames engulf him
trapped inside his car
burning smoke fills his helmet scarring his lungs
pandemonium commentary in different languages as panicked tv commentators helplessly describe whats happening
nikis pov he can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other drivers rushing towards niki
their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo nikis seatbelt
fire extinguishers blast at the car
dry powder extinguishers
covering nikis helmet
blurring his vision as he cries out in agony inhaling the powder
on the side of the car the painted name niki lauda blisters and melts
then sound fades
as niki blacks out losing consciousness
over this the sound of a ringing phone
were in a busy hospital a e unit
a regular saturday late afternoon
the phone continues to ring
finally an attractive station nurse in her s run off her feet breathlessly picks up the phone
she covers her ears straining to hear listening to what is being said
then her expression changes
the nurse hangs up
then calls out to her nurse and doctor colleagues
that was the race track
theres been an accident
a drivers been injured and is on his way in
instantly the atmosphere changes
a hive of activity as doctors and nurses prepare themselves for a major trauma
all patients with minor injuries are cleared out of the way
the nurse rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons telling them to stand by
swing doors open and a pair of shoeless bare feet walks through and into the accident and emergency unit
camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls
to reveal a tall good looking driver james hunt mid s tanned athletic surfer long blonde hair
a man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an englishman
blood trickles from his nose there is bruising to his lip and the formation already of a nasty black eye but make no mistake
drop dead gorgeous
i think the racetrack telephoned ahead that i was coming
james notices all the nurses staring
whats the matter
no one seen a spot of blood before
are you all right
the attractive nurse is examining james opening his overalls checking for wounds cuts and bruises
we all thought youd been in an accident
if you call a friendly disagreement with another driver an accident
what did you disagree about
none of your business
thats going to need a couple of stitches
its a nasty cut
it was a nasty blow
done with a bloody spanner
what did you do
only what she begged me to do
the nurse notices bruising on jamess chest
she examines him testing his ribs for fractures his chest
james looks up
their eyes meet
be happy to show you if you like
crash the door flies open as james and the nurse stumble through mid embrace tearing at one anothers clothes
the apartment is basic
like that of a poor student
ashtrays filled with half smoked joints
empty beer cans
a cage containing two budgerigars
a mattress on the floor
newspapers with headlines about the dockers strike englands crumbling economy rolls royce being bailed out by the government subtle reminders of britain in transition leaving behind its strong imperial past
james and the nurse stand against the wall still half dressed but already passionately making love
i have a theory why women like racing drivers
its not because they respect what we do
driving round and round in circles
mostly they think thats pathetic
and theyre probably right
a beat its our closeness to death
james and the nurse continue noisily tirelessly making love in the shower
the closer you are to death the more alive you feel
the more alive you are
and they can see that in you
feel that in you
the way you live
willing to risk everything
james v o contid with no thought for tomorrow
as if each day is your last
its a wonderful way to live
and the only way to drive
the only way to get that tenth of a second on everyone else
the lovemaking becomes more intense
to dare to be one step bolder
one step faster
james is covered in perspiration out on the edge
sure one step closer to death
james and the nurse both screaming as they approach orgasm
but one step closer to victory too
james and the nurse both climax together
and collapse on the bed
a grotty old race track in south london
james and the nurse arrive at crystal palace race track in his battered old mini
they get out
she looks up seeing the mechanics the racing teams the cars
ive never been to a grand prix before
you still havent
this is formula
a lower division
where people like me mess about in the hope of finding sponsors or being talent spotted to race in formula
james leads the nurse into
the pits where james introduces her to his team
everyone this is nursie
nursie this is doc our designer
how do you do
bubbles our chief mechanic
how do you do
le patron alexander lord hesketh
how do you do
is everyone in formula this posh
glass of champagne nursie
clos de mesnil
its also ten in the morning
you havent brought us a bore have you
james strips off changing into his racing overalls
nursies anything but a bore
the nurse meanwhile drifts over to look at the car where bubbles is making last minute checks
thats the car
the dastle mk
with the lotus twin cam sixteen hundred engine
shes no beauty
but goes like the clappers
an odd looking car
a bit like a giant go kart blue with yellow strips along the side and jamess name in small letters
it looks small dangerously fragile
the nurse is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound
she sees james bent over behind the truck
nothing to be worried about
does it before every race
good sign actually
means hes stoked
james continues vomiting
theres a lie that all drivers tell themselves
death is something that happens to other people
thats how you find the courage to get in the car in the first place
james emerges wiping his mouth
all right superstar
never better patron
because bad things only happen to others right
have a gargle with this
james takes a quick swig of the champagne
gargles then swallows puts on his balaclava
problem is deep down you know thats a lie
that it could happen to you at any moment
quick toke of this
hesketh passes over a joint which james inhales taking a huge lungful from
so how do you make that terror go away
well booze is good for that
and wacky baccy
but better than everything else is
james goes to the nurse
and kisses her full on the lips then puts on his helmet and athletically vaults into the car
james hits the ignition and a deafening high pitched scream as the engine starts
they could never have predicted it those pioneers that invented the automobile that it would possess us like this in our imaginations our dreams
nursie men love women
but even more than that men love cars
james notices another driver niki lauda his car already unloaded number and mechanics working on it
is there a difference
james looks over
on the side of the car painted markings in the form of a signature niki lauda
all bloody goosesteppers
james is neck and neck with niki
they go into a corner
niki gets there first
up ahead though approaching the second bend
james sees the tiniest slimmest crack to overtake
no right minded driver would risk it
only a suicidal maniac
which just happens to describe james perfectly
james goes for it
and forces niki to slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash
hesketh bubbles doc and the nurse watch from the sidelines
that move was suicide
it was also quite brilliant
god hes got balls
james carries on driving
but on the flat niki suddenly comes out of nowhere
as if his car has bhp more
and overtakes james
niki begins to pull away
and has the englishman beaten
james sees red mist
and in an act of do or die vengeful madness james goes into a corner far too fast
yanks his steering wheel
and outrageously shunts nikis car
an unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness
niki and jamess cars both veer off
go into wild lethal spins
but luckily for james he ends up facing the right way
and despite being badly shaken dizzy james is able to change gears and continue driving
nikis car by contrast has stalled
and now ends up facing the wrong way on the track
nikis eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow like a herd of wildebeest heading towards him
niki rips open his seat belt is about to get out of his car when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car
niki ducks then bravely leaps for cover as
smash one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car it would have killed him instantly
wham another car narrowly misses him
crash another car forces niki into an evasive dive
cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues
niki battered shaken has had an unbelievably close escape
he rips off his helmet furious
and now we see niki laudas face for the first time
something unmistakably rat like about him
james is on the podium having won
hes with the nurse and hesketh and bubbles and his team spraying them with champagne
niki walks past the podium holding his blue helmet and shouts out still incandescent
that was my line
i had that corner
you mean the one you spun out of
and finished facing the other way
i think that corner had you
that move was total suicide
what if i hadnt braked
wed have crashed
but we didnt did we
thanks to your impeccable survival instincts
james makes chicken noises
whats your name
james simon wallis hunt
remember it my little jerry friend
because one day he will be world champion
remember ze name
it rhymes with
beeeep a car horn hoots nearby blocking out jamess c word insult
a word that happens to describe you perfectly
niki gives james the finger screw you asshole
the nurse watches niki go
who was that
chippy little kraut
niki continues to walk off middle finger raised
to establish the austrian capital
over this the sound of nikis voice
in my home town vienna my family is famous for one thing
my grandfather was a businessman my father too
niki is in front of a mirror and dresses smartly in a jacket and open necked shirt evidently a little nervous
so when they heard i wanted to race cars for a living they had a few things to say
a large forbidding dining room
nikis father and terrifying grandfather are eating supper
grandfather shakes his head clearly disapproves and barks in german
we see subtitles never
racing is for playboys and dilettantes
frivolous amateurs with nothing in their heads
the name lauda appears on the front pages with politicians and economists not on the back pages with
gestures in contempt footballers and skiers
if you want my money you do as i say and follow me into my business
niki stares at his grandfather
its in moments like this that you discover who you really are
and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for ever niki gets to his feet
keep your money
dont invest in me
but when im world champion and i have the trophy and my name is not just on the back pages but on the front too you will regret it
niki walks out the old mans insults ringing in his ears
you dare sit at my table and lecture me on what i will or wont regret
consider yourself disowned
niki is in a meeting with visibly concerned bankers and lawyers
they speak in german
herr lauda you still havent repaid the other
totalling millions of schillings
plus your grandfather called to inform us he will no longer be offering security
there is no room for failure
i understand that
but i was still a lauda
niki is driving his car
beside him is the attache case on his lap
his car passes under a motorway sign reading flughafen
which meant i was still a businessman above everything else
a private jet
a balding blazered englishman in late middle age louis stanley owner of brm racing disembarks onto the tarmac
it just so happens that the business i deal in is speed
niki sits with louis stanley in an airport cafe
contracts are open on the table
niki is signing
louis stanley is counter signing
in return for your money you get a car mechanics and a place on the team
plus fifty per cent of starting fees and bonuses for podium finishes
whos the number one driver
clay regazzoni and you will defer to him at all times
niki takes out his cheque book and pen
he looks up
why would i defer to him if i am paying his wages
niki writes the cheque
stanleys smile fades
because hes a proven winner at the highest level a good guy and someone who quite frankly could teach you a thing or two
niki ignores this continues scrutinizing the contract
there is one clause missing
the one about mechanics exclusivity
we have a cardinal rule at brm
all information is shared between all our drivers
and i made it perfectly clear that my mechanics work for me
no one else
this is something i cannot sign
niki takes back the cheque
ill have the lawyers amend it
while youre at it you can tell them to amend the clause for podium finishes
podium is first three places not just wins
niki puts the cheque in his attache case
snaps it shut taking it with him
youll get the money on signature as agreed
see you at winter testing
niki gets to his feet and leaves
stanley watches the attache case disappear
if that little git drives half as well as he negotiates were going to be fine
an awards ceremony is in progress
the room is thick with cigar and cigarette smoke
a presenter on stage wearing black tie
im delighted to say the winner of the british guild of motoring writers award for the most promising driver of the year is james hunt
a loud boisterous cheer goes up at the hesketh racing table
james turns to a new different girlfriend beside him gives her a lingering kiss on the lips then gets to his feet shakes hands with hesketh and bubbles and skips
up to the podium
my parents always wanted me to be a doctor or stockbroker and gave me a first class education
but to no avail
my brothers are the success stories
i get bored easily
i have a hot head an inability to tolerate discipline
i fall out with people left and right
im quick to settle matters with my fists
the only creatures ive ever loved and treated well are budgerigars
in any normal area of life id be
a total liability
all ive got going for me is im quick in a car
a good looking woman calls out
thats not all
so thank you for acknowledging that
and giving me this
indicating trophy im going to give it to my dad and tell him to put it on the mantle piece and imagine its a first class degree in medicine
afterwards everyone is celebrating
thanks to james every pretty woman in the club is around
the trophy is perched beside bottles of champagne
well done superstar
one more season in f then ill move you up
to the big time
you dont think im ready now
ive got to find you a car first
and the money
the economics of formula are terrifying
you dont want him to do what lauda did
pop hesketh opens a bottle of champagne
bubbles contid the goosestepper
james makes the chicken noises again
said he no longer wanted to risk his life with a bunch of crazy amateurs and losers
is that what he called us
nothing wrong with being an amateur
said if he was going to risk his life he would only do so on the big roulette table
so he got himself a drive with brm
he never won a thing
not a single bloody race
amateurs are what made this country great
took out a loan apparently
paid for it himself
in war as in lovemaking amateurs are invariably better than professionals
a hundred and fifty grand
a hundred and fifty grand
already sick with envy
thats either an act of utter lunacy or the ballsiest thing i ever heard
the paul ricard circuit near marseilles in the south of france
where all winter training and testing is done
an attractive woman agnes greets him
here for pre season testing
take a seat please
ill get someone to come and collect you
niki watches as she telephones the brm workshops
theres someone here for you
misunderstanding speaking louder she hangs up
niki decides against pointing out her mistake
theyll be right here
the receptionist continues with her work
niki watches her unsure what to say small talk not his forte
worked here long
just wondered if youve worked here long
almost eight years
and they didnt promote you yet
yes several times
i am the agnes
if youre looking for the receptionist shes on her lunch
niki is thrown
a total jerk
he is about to say something when the door opens and
two other f drivers walk in
glamorous long haired tanned fashionable like rock stars they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with agnes
what are you doing answering the phones
what have you done to the weather
they make her laugh
niki feels invisible
he gets to his feet
and goes to the car that has come to collect him
as he goes unseen by niki agnes watches him
ignoring the other drivers
the car pulls up outside the workshops
niki gets out of the car and is greeted by louis stanley and the brm team
niki let me introduce you to our number driver clay regazzoni
and our number jean pierre beltoise
the intimidating muscular moustachioed figure of clay regazzoni the swiss driver
niki and clay shake hands
and these are your mechanics reporting exclusively to you
as per contract
regazzoni beltoise and stanley exchange looks as niki shakes hands ad libbed greetings with his mechanics
you want to see the car
niki is led into the workshop to see a red and white marlboro sponsored car number with a tall air intake duct just above the drivers helmet
there she is
same as regazzonis
identical in every detail
niki scrutinizes the car
she looks heavy
how much does she weigh
why so heavy
its a litre v engine that thing weighs k alone
what horsepower are you getting out of it
needs to be and the engine needs to be k lighter
we already tried
did you use magnesium parts
the mechanics look at one another skeptically
shooting from above the entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces
now spread all over the workshop floor
nikis team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night making the adjustments which niki is suggesting
any solid plate strip it out
more disbelieving skeptical looks
the car is in pieces on the floor
niki brews coffee to keep people alert
and when weve done that we need to look at the aerodynamics
front and rear wing
more mutinous looks
who is this asshole
daylight breaks over the race track
the doors to the workshop open and the mechanics and niki emerge their work done
niki goes to shake hands with the mechanics
but theyre exhausted
refuse to shake hands with this nut
later one of the brm cars screams round the race track
niki watches on the sidelines as clay regazzoni is time testing his car
he walks over to where louis stanley and several mechanics are doing the timings
what was his time
two minutes six seconds
now put him in my car and hell go round under two minutes
six seconds faster
niki looks up to see agnes the attractive track manager again on the other side of the track
niki waves hi
agnes waves back
niki raises his eyebrow
regazzoni gets into nikis car
regazzoni races round the track at full speed
regazzoni roars past the finishing line in nikis car
louis stanley looks at the stop watch
his expression changes
stanley comes into the workshop where niki and his mechanics are in conversation getting changed
what did you do to the car
thats information i will share with you under certain conditions only
stanley stares bracing himself
a guaranteed place in the team and a paid contract on equal terms with regazzoni for two years
are you crazy
clays a senior figure in formula one
youre a rookie
the only reason we took you on was because you were paying us
well as of now if you want me to stay we rip up the contract
i dont pay you a cent
was he quicker in my car
he was wasnt he
did he go under two minutes
quiet one fifty six
so have a think work out your priorities and get back to me
niki turns and goes
not even my wife speaks to me like that
clay regazzoni emerges from testing his car
still amazed by the improved performance
talking to his mechanics
he removes his helmet then stops
in the distance he sees niki talking to agnes the attractive track manager
they are clearly hitting it off
niki is in the showers then getting changed for his date with agnes
he is about to go when he stops and sees
clay regazzoni getting undressed looking at niki
clay speaks english with an italian accent
i know what youre going to say
that its none of my business
if its the track manager youre taking on your date tonight
niki immediately becomes defensive
its none of your business
okay but if you want my advice
id let this one go
im not questioning your taste
shes a great girl
regazzoni contid but agness last boyfriend was a british formula driver who has a reputation for two things
for being a suicidal jerk on the track and for going all night and all day afterwards
and all night again in bed
hes an ok driver but an immortal fuck apparently
i dont know about you but thats not an act id like to follow
shrugs but if that doesnt bother you
whats his name
can hardly believe it
you share information i share information
clay slaps niki on his back and goes into the showers
thats what team mates are for
quiet defeated thanks
a restaurant in marseilles
through the window we can see agnes the attractive track manager sitting at a table alone
waiting for niki
reverse angle to reveal niki is sitting in a car across the street
he stares at agnes in the restaurant
then starts his car and drives off
set in acres one of englands great country houses
home to the fermor hesketh family since
james and a new girlfriend drive up the gravel drive in his anything but grandiose mini
it splutters to a stop just in time
they are greeted by uniformed staff who take his tatty bags from his filthy car
the hesketh racing workshops situated in the converted stables on the estate
hesketh leads a blindfolded james in
keep them closed
wait for it wait for it
hesketh removes jamess blindfold
what do you say
james opens his eyes to see a gorgeous f racing car plain white no stickers
isnt she a beauty
converted by the brilliant doc
doc postlethwaite takes a modest bow
james shakes hands with everyone including his brother and manager peter
she is a beauty
havent you made a mistake
thats not a formula car
she is superstar
because i got together with the beancounters and it turns out that the economics of f are not so significantly different to the economics of formula
bubbles clears his throat dutifully bites his tongue
so we thought if we were going to be messing about losing money we might as well be doing it with the big boys
are you serious
never been more serious in my life
james embraces hesketh in excitement kisses him
actually i got the idea after what you said about the austrian chap who bought his way in rather than waste his time in the lower divisions
i thought bloody hell hes right
james slips into the cockpit
well done the goosestepper
indicates car no sponsorship superstar
i hope you approve
i do patron
no vulgar logos for cigarettes or condoms
just plain white
with the union jack
and racing overalls which read
hesketh indicates jamess hanging racing overalls
breakfast of champions
unless its me of course in which case its two kippers porridge boiled eggs and half a dozen slices of toast
so when do we start
soon as youre ready
im ready now
thats my boy
hesketh pops champagne
they wont know whats hit them
to establish a formula race track on grand prix week end
a helicopter comes in to land
the hesketh racing team makes a grand entrance with a retinue of butlers girls rolls royces oysters champagne
a famous ex champion tv reporter is there stirling moss providing skeptical commentary about heskeths debut
hard to tell whether lord hesketh and his team of upper class enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the racing community or just comedy
they walk around in their own branded clothing
alexanders jacket reads le patron
he speaks to moss
rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise curiosity and frequently disapproval at these new arrivals
its certainly the first time i can remember seeing a butler serving caviar and oysters in the pits
suddenly pandemonium breaks out
something has happened
a bad accident on the track
holding ear piece reports are reaching me of a serious accident that has just taken place in qualifying
all smiles fade
the party atmosphere changes in a flash
panic breaks out
the sound of sirens
ambulances rushing to the scene of the accident
all the journalists and tv crews rush off too
hesketh bubbles and james look at one another put down their champagne glasses and follow
a car has crashed into badly installed armco guard rails splitting the railing in two
the driver has been decapitated
his helmeted head lies cleanly severed on the ground
a goldfish bowl of blood
its a horrific accident
people scream and look away
even hardened medical professionals
james hesketh bubbles arrive on the scene of the accident
but they are kept away at a distance
it seems the driver
just twenty six years old
was killed on impact
and the death toll in formula shows no sign of slowing down
james dressed in his overalls is violently retching
sick with nerves
a tv plays in the pits
in the last five years alone formula has lost piers courage jo siffert peter revson jochen rindt francois cevert roger williamson
on tv quickfire clips of the terrible violent deaths
bubbles hastily switches off the tv as james walks past
james walks out of the paddock towards his car
other drivers gathered in concerned groups talking
they should cancel the race
then a distinctive austrian accent
no one came to see him anyway
he made a mistake
went into the corner too fast
is that right
so says the nobody who had to pay for his own drive
hows that working out by the way
hows it at the back
not planning on being there for long
look forward to you showing me the way today
be happy to
ill have you inside lap one
james walks off to his car shaking his head
niki walks to his car putting on his helmet
niki is on the podium spraying champagne
he is wearing the victors garland
meanwhile jamess car is embarrassingly being brought back by a tow truck
niki watches from the podium
his eyes meet jamess
james and bubbles and peter hunt jamess blazer wearing manager and elder brother sit together at a table in the corner
a frank post mortem
drinking and talking
niki humiliated me today
he lapped me three times
he lapped carlos pace six times
thats supposed to console me
what do i need to do
shut up moneyman
didnt ask you
your brothers right
youve got to change your attitude
we all do
and match it with a whole different mental approach
bet he doesnt go out every night drink and screw himself stupid
so speaks the jealous married man
so speaks the manager whos wasting his time making ten per cent of absolutely nothing
youve just got to take it more seriously
yourself more seriously
something hes never done
don t patronize me pete
we need you to spend less time in bars and nightclubs
make that no time
and more time with the mechanics setting up the car
thats what lauda does
hours a day
james rolls his eyes
god knows theres nothing wrong with your talent
its purely a character issue right now
and the good news is ive got sigmund freud horsely failed driver par excellence and a washed up accountant to lecture me on it
closes eyes jesus james
bubbles walks off
peter hunt walks off
james calls out
i didnt mean that
the grand hesketh estate in the northamptonshire countryside
james is in the workshops his hands and arms filthy hes been working on the car but now his eyes are closed
around him people are working on the car
along the beau rivage long left into massenet into the short right of casino
sharp right into mirabeau then sharp left into loews mind the guard rails
is alexander around
james opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs a drop dead gorgeous figure and the beautiful smiling face of suzy miller the most successful model of the
then went to the house to take a call
hell be back shortly
only he wanted to show off his pride and joy
suzy indicates the car
rhymes with boy if you ask me
i cant believe what im seeing
its just so small
for something that costs so much
and so flimsy
theres no comfort
just a little coffin surrounded by high octane fuel being driven round at miles per hour
james contid becoming grave to all intents and purposes a bomb
why dont they make it safer
no one wants it to be
its like saying why not make bullfighting safer
its a blood sport
the risk of death turns people on
without it i guess itd be half the fun
which is fine for the voyeurs fine for tv fine for everyone
a beat except us drivers
suzy looks james up and down
sees the bare feet the rock star good looks
youre james arent you
you fit the description
shaking hands suzy
friend of alexs
i know exactly
in the background one of the mechanics shows doc a picture of suzy from a tabloid newspaper
shes clearly the most famous model in britain and a star in her own right
what was the description
mostly positive in terms of appearance
negative only in terms of character
ive been told to avoid you
he says youre a bad boy
not any more
new me very professional
early to bed
early to rise
all very dull
round the clock work practise and focus
tedious but apparently the only way to vin against ze goosestepper
is that what you were doing when you came in
memorizing the circuit in this case monaco which is next up
eyes closed know your way round in your sleep
a beat i know
ive always been a great believer in getting there on the day putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else
but they dont want me to do that anymore
they want my body like a temple
my mind like monk
and your soul
what does that mean
you cant be so disciplined in all areas of your life can you
they want me to stop messing around get married and settle down with the next nice girl i meet
they think it would be good for me
what do you think
sounds bloody awful
suzy laughs again
but since theyre right about most things theyre probably right about that too
james looks suzy up and down
you dont fancy getting married do you
the sound of ringing bells
londons grandest catholic church in the heart of knightsbridge
james and suzy top hat and tails flowing white wedding dress looking ravishing emerge from the church
james and suzy fall into a passionate sexy embrace for the paparazzi cameras
loud cheers go up led by hesketh and they make their way to the waiting convoy of cars
on his way james spots a serious faced hesketh and doc postlethwaite in conversation with some formula types in the crowd
suzy is pulled away for photos
clearly a bigger star even than james
james turns to bubbles indicates hesketh
i dont want to ruin your day
bubbles stares then reluctantly
it seems your revenge against the goosestepper might have to wait a little longer than youd hoped
a beat hes just been signed by ferrari
but thats the best team in the world
they could have anyone
did he pay his way in there too
apparently they took back regazzoni and he insisted they give lauda a trial
thinks hes a genius
setting up the cars
then is pulled away to pose in photographs with suzy and her family
ferraris state of the art practise facilities and private test track in northern italy
closed circuit television with cameras and a complex track timing system and computers
enzo ferrari himself the commendatore a formidable white haired patriarch in onassis dark glasses reads newspapers sitting by the race tracks barely looking up as two red ferraris roar round
luca di montezemolo the young dynamic aristocratic manager of the scuderia by contrast watches eagle eyed
the two cars stop and niki and clay regazzoni gets out
niki talks in a mix of italian and english to his mechanic giving them typically blunt feedback
drives like a pig
you cant say that
its a ferrari
ive driven better milk floats
it understeers like crazy and the weight distribution is a disaster
the mechanic gulps then walks over to where the terrifying commendatore and luca di montezemolo are sitting and passes on the information
he says the car is magnificent a masterpiece but he has suggestions for one or two minor refinements
a large press conference with motoring journalists and television crews from all over the world attending
enzo ferrari and luca di montezemolo addresses the conference in italian which is translated by a translator
we are happy to welcome back to the ferrari family our good friend clay regazzoni
and also to introduce from austria niki lauda
a burst of flash photography
niki and regazzoni sit side by side
a car drives fast on country roads in northern italy
clay regazzoni is driving niki is in the passenger seat
our good friend clay regazzoni
regazzoni contid youre friend and family to the commendatore as long as you win
the minute you dont
mimes execution i understand
i would be the same
but it isnt just business is it
what we do
which is why were prepared to risk our lives for it
if i thought i had more talent and could earn better money doing something else i would
but how do you know you will make money here
you havent yet
but i will
smiles if you can i can
regazzoni shakes his head cant help smiling
you know are you ever not an asshole
why am i an asshole
you know by now im both quicker than you and better at setting up the car
you cant deal with that then youre the asshole
regazzoni pulls up outside the house
regazzoni contid i brought you along today because you seem like a lonely kind of guy
i thought if i introduce you to some nice people itd be good for you
make your own friends
regazzoni walks ahead disappears through the front door where he is warmly welcomed and invited into a party
niki calls after him
niki stares through the window
inside a very appealing looking bunch young good looking cool sexy guests all having a good time
by contrast niki catches his own reflection in the glass reflection
inside regazzoni is surrounded by friends telling a story
then turns to walk away
as he goes the front door opens
and a beautiful dark haired woman marlene emerges loading several bags into a car
wearing a white dress
are you leaving
can you give me a lift to the nearest town
anywhere with a train station
nearest town is half an hours drive
the car drives
the radio plays
marlene sings along
niki cant help noticing something
he turns down the music
marlenes smile fades
what are you doing
you hear that noise when you accelerate
your drive belt is loose
and when you brake your foot goes all the way down
means theres air in the system
apart from the rear brakes are imbalanced
the front right wheel is flat and it feels like a crack in the engine block
which explains why youre drifting so much
how can you tell
god gave me an ok mind but a really good ass which can feel everything in a car
you dont know what youre talking about
the car is fine
and it just had a service a week ago
not a good one
a very good one
from a proper garage
it cost a fortune
this car is good as new
white smoke pours from the engine
the car has broken down
niki has tried fixing it but to no avail
niki has a fan belt in his hand but its all but disintegrated under the heat of the over worked engine
nikis hands are covered in oil
he is pushing a pen into a large crack in the engine slick with oil and grease
nothing i can do here
the car needs a garage
youre not in a hurry are you
as long as im back in maranello by monday morning
niki walks out into the road
sticks out his thumb
so who are you anyway
marlene breaks into german
we see sub titles
youre from vienna arent you
we can speak german
how do you know curd
its his house
he is or was until yesterday my boyfriend
i must have been mad
there is something very attractive about an older man when they behave like one
but when they behave like a frightened child
marlene gets to her feet
cmon let me do this
otherwise well never get out of here
were in italy after all
marlene indicates that niki should take a back seat hitches up her skirt showing long tanned legs
immediately a passing car screeches to a halt then reverses noisily to pull level
marlene smiles at niki
not bad eh
admit it youre impressed
marlene smiles flirtatiously at the handsome young italian men driving the open topped sports car
but the italian men walk right past her not seeing her as if shes invisible and stare at niki
in italian excuse me
are you niki lauda
in italian oh my god
i told you it was him
blown away do you need a ride
yes we do
the italian man gestures to his car as his friend loads marlenes luggage inside
an honour please
but on one condition
the italian man whisper in nikis ear
marlene stares not understanding as niki protests but then slowly reluctantly gets into the car
he starts the engine
marlene watches as the italian men strap themselves in with the seat belts tightening them
giggling like schoolboys
will someone please tell me whats going on
marlene turns to niki
who are you anyway
what do you do
you dont know
hes a formula i driver
who just signed for ferrari
formula drivers have long hair are sexy have shirts open to here
anyway look at the way hes driving
like an old man
niki is driving in the slow lane
like a pensioner
no need to drive fast
it only increases the percentage of risk
were not in a hurry
no one is paying me
right now with zero incentive or reward why would i drive fast
marlene looks at him with her dark green eyes
in german because im asking you to
in german and do you always get what you want
in german usually
niki stares trying to resist
he does a lightning double declutch
slam nikis foot hits the floor the engine screams the rev counter flies to the right
and the open topped sports car lurches into warp drive
marlene is thrown back hard in her seat jesus her eyes widen in terror and amazement
oh my god
the italian men scream in excitement holding on for dear life as niki his heart not a beat over takes the car to breaking point in a way its never
been driven before
niki overtakes everyone on the motorway fearlessly weaving between cars at twice their speed
we close on nikis eyes remaining dead calm as his passengers scream all around him as he accelerates through the other cars on the motorway
his eyes remain calm his wheels a blur of speed and we
calm eyes and wheels moving in a blur of speed
were in the middle of a grand prix and niki is driving at the limit
ahead of him a familiar sight
the back of james hunts hesketh
marlene watches on tv in the pits as niki is engaged in an epic tussle with james
commentators note the improvement in jamess technique maturity and performance
but then puff a plume of smoke comes out of jamess engine
the engine has blown
immediately james loses speed and niki sails past overtaking effortlessly
taking the chequered flag
television commentary in various languages tells us niki lauda has become world champion
nikis car pulls in to be mobbed by jubilant mechanics as he gets out of his car removing his helmet embraced by a delighted luca di montezemolo
then falling into a passionate kiss with marlene
champion of the world he is immediately swallowed up by reporters who are demanding interviews in italian german english
an impromptu party in the paddock area
the victors garland still round his neck proudly holding the fia world champion trophy his hair matted with champagne niki passes through the crowds accepting everyones congratulations
he runs into james whos in bare feet as usual
marlene is pulled away to talk to someone else
though with a car like that the rest of us never stood a chance
maybe the fact the car is so good might have something to do with me
youre still in a ferrari
and im still in a hesketh
on equal terms the way it was in formula id beat you and you know it
you might get lucky and win one race
because youre aggressive
but in the long run over the course of a season no chance
because youre not serious
youre just a party guy
which is why everyone likes you
now try saying that and tell me youre not jealous
but all that affection all those smiles is also a sign of their disrespect
they dont fear you
whereas compare that to me
whom no one likes
not even his own team mates
because im relentless
i dont screw up
i go to bed early
i look after myself look after my car
and then soon as the race is finished i go home
you should go home more often too
i heard you got married
so where is she
in new york
you know ive never seen you with her once
niki turns to marlene lets go
jamess mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway towards easton neston
screeches to a halt
james gets out of the car
is greeted by staff whom he uncharacteristically ignores storming past
james walks into the workshops where bubbles horsley is busy doing something
right whatever it takes to beat lauda just say it your word is my command
ill do it
there are no lengths to which i will not go
and i mean it this time
james stops noticing bubbless expression
whats the matter
then james notices what bubbles is doing
what are you doing
then james notices the lack of activity in the workshops
none of the usual mechanics or engineers
where is everyone
bubbles looks up
unsure how to break it to him
an old drawing room
the open fire roars
but hesketh is uncharacteristically quiet
do you know what the date is today
do you have any idea of the significance of that date
im assuming it refers to some animal you are allowed or no longer allowed to slaughter on your estate
actually its the deadline for securing sponsorship for the forthcoming formula season
a beat which elapsed at midnight last night
and we didnt attract any
we arent looking for sponsorship
condoms and cigarettes
except we are
ive made something of a miscalculation
turns out not like the lower divisions at all
what are you saying
im saying its over superstar
the banks have stepped in
read me the riot act
started laying everyone off
probably have to sell this place
fun while it lasted would do it all again and all that
ashen i darent tell you the actual figures
james stares at a devastated hesketh
james is on the phone to his brother peter while playing scale electrix cars on a track alone barefoot
i need a drive pete
need you to find me a drive
listens what does that mean
my reputation precedes me
crash the electric toy car crashes
is that what they said
a beat did they at least say a quick arsehole
listens bollocks to lotus
find me someone else
ill go mad otherwise
click james hangs up
suzy walks in
sees his mood
something will turn up
james opens a bottle of scotch pours himself a drink
but i doubt that will help in the meantime
james knocks back the drink
why dont we go away for the week end
before i leave again for new york
james carries on drinking
talk to me james
dont make a stranger of me
james doesnt react
i cant watch this
suzy picks up her coat and bag
what were you hoping for
a well adjusted knight in shining armour
no danger of that
let me give you some advice
im all ears
dont go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving in circles looking for normality
well i certainly didnt get that
should have gone for one of my brothers
there goes that self pity again
how striking it is whats that
the gulf between appearance and reality
look at you all sunshine blonde beauty and smiles
yet the reality is
a frightened immature depressed self pitying child
at least theres something behind the facade
with a nasty temper
fuck off to new york dear
there must be a moisturizer or eye shadow somewhere that needs your vapid mush to flog it
how quickly beauty can turn ugly
james carries on drinking
the following morning
the phone rings
piercing the darkness
james clearly the worse for wear is talking to his beloved budgies
a surprising vulnerability and childlike innocence about james
he strokes the birds with real tenderness
the phone continues ringing
james picks it up
james listens then hears something on the phone that makes him sit up
james is waking rapidly now
just get me in a room with them pete
yes i can do today
checks watch i can be there in an hour
james starts scribbling down the address
the headquarters of mclaren racing in colnbrook bucks
a small unassuming building on the poyle trading estate
bare brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade with the words mclaren racing in large white letters
a large boardroom
team director teddy mayer american from pennsylvania short lawyerly s hair turning grey sits at the head of the table
next to him is aussie marlboro spokesman john hogan and mclaren team manager and chief mechanic alastair caldwell
the atmosphere is tense uncomfortable
ill come straight to the point
our esteemed lead driver
fitti fucking paldi
has ditched us for another team at the last minute
and we need a replacement
thankfully a few hands have already gone up
like jackie ickx
im quicker than jackie
but hes consistent dependable
hell dress up nice
say the right things
what do you want
a driver or a brushes salesman
we want to be successful
so do i
but i measure that in podium finishes and beating niki lauda not being a show pony for sponsors
ive heard about this thing with lauda
rolls eyes everyone has
you really think you can beat him
hes world champion
i beat him in formula
this season alone hes had eight podiums five wins youve had what
only because ive been in the wrong car
i beat him when the playing field was level
id beat him again in a mclaren
james contid its the only car out there as good as the ferrari
which is why im here begging
james stares imploringly
ill do whatever you ask
even put on a suit talk to sponsors and say the right thing
a beat just give me the drive
caldwell hogan and mayer look at one another
various shots to establish
south africa in the apartheid era
we notice black race fans unable to get into the track
welcome to the kyalami racetrack where the big news is
crowds flood to the spectator stands
the pit lane stretches into the distance filled with cars drivers and mechanics
that britains james hunt in his first race for mclaren has qualified fastest beating niki laudas ferrari to pole by two hundredths of a second
in the crowds to watch the race none other than movie stars richard burton and liz taylor
we pick out richard burton and liz taylor waving to screaming niki and jamess cars lined up in positions and on the starting grid
james proudly indicates to niki
i noticed that too
level playing field now my ratty little friend
lets see where we are at the end of lap one
niki calls after james as he walks to his car
lets see where we are in six races time
james turns makes a ratty face at niki
richard burton and liz taylor are shown into the vip area of the paddock
they take their seats
bored already will this take very long
an official introduces burton to various people among them richard burton
suzy miller also known as mrs
there it is
the deep dark sonorous welsh baritone voice
scarred by alcohol and cigarettes
one of the racers
extending hand also known as mr
he indicates liz who is deeply bored
what does a girl have to do to get a drink around here
their eyes meet
and no eyes are more beautiful than suzys
an immediate connection between them
their hands hold a fraction too long as they shake
nikis car roars past the finishing line first
james closely behind
james and niki are on the podium together
my car wasnt right today
next time ill have you
jamess car takes the chequered flag finishing first
in the pits teddy mayer alastair caldwell and john hogan leap to their feet in delight
punching the air
afterwards james and niki are on the podium together
what did i tell you
youd better get used to this
james walks off to celebrate with the mclaren team
niki stares darkly threatened watching james go
then goes to talk to luca de montezemolo and the ferrari team
a huge furore as several officials and ferrari team members and tv crews surround jamess car
raised voices debating the width of the car hunt furious people almost coming to blows
the car is too wide
five eighths of an inch
which makes it illegal
if you want to compete you have to change it
you cant just change it
that means rebuilding the car
who lodged the complaint
it was ferrari wasnt it
the two rival pit crews mclaren and ferrari scream abuse at one another in italian and english a highly charged and explosive atmosphere
niki watches from the inside of the ferrari trailer
the mclaren mechanics supervised by alastair caldwell are making adjustments to the car to make it legal
we have to move the wing forward
to make it legal
but thatll have a knock on effect on the oil coolers
james watches already fearing the worst as the car is stripped down effectively being rebuilt
bang jamess car shudders violently the wheels shake as the drive shaft snaps
boom a loud explosion
a thick plume of black smoke billows from the engine
crash james spins out
and a tyre bounces along the track
jamess car has crashed into a wall
i cant stand it
the tyre continues bouncing people diving out of its path before the tyre finally smashes into a hot dog stand
james storms back into the pits screaming at mayer caldwell and the mechanics
what have you done
the cars evil
later the victorious niki wearing the garland is all smiles giving winner interviews surrounded by marlene and a delighted luca di montezemolo
james is also giving interviews but in a total fury
vibrating with anger
still complaining about the disqualification
complaining about a conspiracy
niki finishes talking to journalists and walks off through crowds and bumps into james
six races in
hows it going so far
just got a little problem with a bad loser rat and his team of italian saboteurs whove destroyed my car
what are you talking about
i won that race in spain
and you know it
in an illegal car
the aerofoil was five eighths of an inch too long
something that doesnt have the slightest effect on car speed
now weve had to totally rebuild the car and its become a monster
at least its a legal monster
a car that was beating you week in week out so you have to resort to this
he drives in an illegal car and he calls me the cheat
let me tell you two weeks before that race in spain we put inch rims on the rear wheels
we get an extra half second speed on each lap
but the old man tells me we cant use those rims they make the car too wide
against the rules
so we go back to inch rims making the car slower again
rules are rules
for all of us
youre just a bad loser who cant accept that
tapping head to marlene komm hes crazy
sick in the head
niki turns to marlene speaks in german
den trottel lassen wir alleine
leave this jerk alone
no wonder she left him
niki and marlene go
james is left staring
james walks into the crowded mclaren pits
sees teddy mayer and alastair caldwell
is there something i should know about suzy
where is she
wasnt she supposed to be here today
caldwell nervously indicates the sunday newspapers
we kept it from you
didnt want to tell you before the race
james looks at the newspapers then his expression changes
lurid headlines about suzy hunt in new york with richard burton
pictures all over the front pages of richard burton elizabeth taylor suzy and james
jamess face falls
a jumbo jet roars down the runway and takes off
the unmistakable skyline
among the ten thousand craggy rooftops and skyscrapers
a grand five star hotel overlooking central park in manhattans mid town district
a huge collection of paparazzi snappers and journalist hacks is camped outside the hotel
immediately a surge of activity here he is
a burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the journalists as james gets out of the taxi and runs the gauntlet of humiliation
into the hotel
a large hotel suite
there are flowers everywhere
newspapers are all over the table
james sits opposite suzy
he sees an expensive gift recently opened
a diamond necklace
that from him
even the uninitiated eye can tell its worth a fortune
why have you come here james
to get you back
you dont want me back
you never wanted to be married in the first place
you did it because you hoped it might change you
settle you down
help with the racing
not because you loved me
and who knows if it had been just the drinking or the dope or the infidelity or the moods
it might even have worked
but when its all of them
no youre not terrible
who you are
at this point in your life
and god help anyone that wants more
will he be able to give you more
he has quite the bad boy reputation himself
whats important is how it feels to me
and it feels like he adores me
a flicker behind jamess eyes
hes aware of the delicacy of the situation and how it looks
having raided your larder
plundered your safe
smash and grab and so forth
so hes assured me hell take care of the financial side
and will be very generous
james manages a brave smile
ill give him a call
his lawyers will contact you
james notices the vast unmade bed
where until recently two people had slept
james emerges from the hotel into the storm of paparazzi again
he manages a brave smile
its all very amicable
my wife has found herself a new backer
i mean lover
which makes her happy
burton has found a way of feeling young again
lets hope his pockets are deep
theyll need to be
laughter and ive found a way to be single again without it costing me a penny which has to go down as the biggest win of my career
laughter from the journalists who are hungrily writing down the copy
but jamess hollow smile fools no one
james sits alone in the first class section
a loser on the track and a loser in love too
being played out in the full glare of publicity
on the front pages
being read by everyone on the plane
a stewardess looks over catches his eye
james and the stewardess fucking
nothing to do with pleasure
an analgesic a way of blocking out the pain
james catches his own reflection in the mirror
eyes burning with anger and self loathing
over this we fade in the roar of car engines
jamess teeth still clenched
eyes still burning with anger
driving flat out
at the limit
suzys words still ringing in his ears
make that beyond the limit
at the point of no return
the car shaking
weaving recklessly through other cars
where death has become a real option
because he doesnt care anymore
because its all he deserves anyway
and in that moment in reaching his lowest point james has unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an advantage over everyone else
the fact that he doesnt care
the fact that death has become an option
the fact that there is no risk he is not prepared to take
so every corner is tighter every braking point later every gap is an opening no matter how tiny
the chequered flag waves as jamess car roars across the finish line
james screams with released rage
laudas engine blows up afterwards teddy mayer alastair caldwell and john hogan celebrate in delight
nikis car is pursued by jamess
they disappear behind a copse of trees
out of sight
when they re emerge james is ahead of niki having overtaken him to the delight of the partisan crowd
the chequered flag waves again as jamess car roars across the finish line
james screams in catharsis and triumph
eyes wide and staring with concentration
we notice screaming girl fans cheering him now
a blazer wearing fia official addresses a room full of sports and motoring journalists tv crews etc
following an inquiry into the disqualification of driver james hunt from the spanish grand prix it has been decided to overturn this disqualification
and to restore his victory and reinstate his points
james teddy mayer alastair caldwell and all the mechanics are watching on tv
cheering and whooping
a crowded press room
in opposite corners of the room james and niki are giving interviews to different press and tv journalists
stirling moss is talking to james
james a few weeks ago you were out of the running for this season completely now youre right back in it
screaming girls in the background shouting james we love you
james stares across the room at niki
a combination of factors not all of which im prepared to discuss here
justice being done re the disqualification in spain helps and having my old car back of course
in the other corner niki is doing his interviews in german we see sub titles
mathematically in theory its now possible for hunt to catch you
are you worried
not at all
for him to catch me hed have to win all the remaining races and id have to lose them
and pigs would have to fly
laughter among the confident germans
now if youll excuse me i have a private family matter to attend to
niki takes marlenes hand and leads her away
to establish the viennese skyline
niki and marlene get married
in stark contrast to jamess wedding
its a small intimate affair
away from the cameras
and a witness from the pub
a small aeroplane takes off
niki and an instructor are in the plane
in the cockpit
with marlene who watches
niki is learning to fly
marlene watches as niki soaks up the instruction asking questions happy
its another side to him completely
niki and marlene in a pool
then nikis expression changes
his smile fades
marlene is fast asleep
she wakes to discover the bed is empty beside her
marlene walks through the house looking for niki
then finds him on a balcony
come to bed
marlene notices his mood
whats the matter
its the enemy you know
niki looks up at marlene
it weakens you
puts doubt in your mind
because all of a sudden you have something to lose
marlene stares at him
when you call happiness an enemy then its too late
a beat then you have lost already
marlene turns and goes
niki is left alone
we can tell from his expression he is struggling with something for the first time
the notoriously difficult and treacherous german race track
testing is underway
a car from one of the other teams skids and crashes violently
the driver is badly hurt
screaming in pain
his leg is crushed
bone is sticking out
a brutal compound fracture
he is taken away
in the pits everyone is shaken
james regazzoni and other drivers nervously talk among themselves as the ambulance races past
nikis face visibly pale
more frightened than ever
huge crowds arrive at the nurburgring
heavy rain falling
television commentary informs us about the nurburgrings terrible reputation as a graveyard track
james arrives at the race track to find alastair caldwell waiting for him a concerned look on his face
weve just been told a drivers meeting has been called
about sixty people drivers and all the different team representatives are assembled in the room where a blazered fia official and a member of the drivers safety committee are sitting
behind a table
a buzz of anticipation and curiosity
whats going on
what is all this about
niki gets to his feet raises his hands calling for silence
i called this meeting because as all drivers know the nurburgring is a race track from the stone ages
the most stupid barbaric outdated dangerous track in the world
youve all seen the rain which has been falling this morning
those of you with experience know the ring needs perfect conditions to be even remotely acceptable in terms of risk
as you can see today is anything but perfect so i called this meeting to take a vote to cancel the race
a ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers
there would be no change to the situation as far as points is concerned
the race would simply be cancelled
teddy mayer looks over at ferrari representatives
this is bullshit
another driver guy edwards gets to his feet
if the race is cancelled none of us get our race fees
you leave without your fee but you might leave with your life
another voice pierces the controversy
it also means you would effectively win the championship
its james hunt who is standing up
so i can see why this suits you just fine
there would be no points for me either
but there would be one race less where i or anyone else could catch you
uproar in the room
james is right
this is just tactics
ferraris dirty tricks
weve seen it before
maybe its just that hes frightened
laughter among the drivers
which asshole said this
no hand goes up
no one has the courage to own up
yes i am frightened
always a little bit when i race
i accept every time i get in my car there is chance that i could die
but not one per cent more
and today with the rain the risk is more
how dare you accuse me of lack of courage
let me remind you
i have the track record here
i am the only person in history to do the ring in under minutes
so actually its to my advantage to race here today
because im quicker than all of you
a stunned silence
one voice pierces the room
then lets race
its james who stares at niki a ripple of excitement and enthusiasm among the other drivers
theres a hundred thousand fans out there who would never forgive us if we didnt
and some of us need our race fees
all those in favour of cancelling the race
niki puts his hand up
one or two other racers too
all those in favour of racing
james puts his hand up
clearly the more popular charismatic figure among the drivers everyone else follows
gentlemen start your engines
a clear victory for james
he has swung the room
everyone leaves the room
james and teddy mayer give one another a discreet hi five
but we rack focus through the crowd to see niki staring at james accusingly
holding his gaze
rrrroaaar an explosion of noise as we widen and find ourselves on the starting grid of the german grand prix
an official walks through the cars holding aloft a sign one minute
deafening angry thunder as cars rev their engines
a pupil dilates and contracts in the light
the eye stares
this time the eye belongs to james
he stares up at the clouds
his eyelids flicker
wrestling with an all important decision
is it going to carry on raining
or become dry
alastair caldwell comes up to james and shouts above the noise no time to plug his headset in
jochens going on slicks
you want to change
james looks in his wing mirror back to his colleague jochen masss car number several rows behind him
a team of mclaren mechanics hastily changing the tyres to bald dry tyres slicks
then james looks over at the car beside him
has niki changed
hes going on wets
nikis car surrounded by italian ferrari mechanics
then we go on wets too
james pulls down his visor
as he and nikis eyes meet for a split second then
the starter waves the flag
jamess foot hits the floor his engine screams at almost rpms drowning out the roar of the crowd
the car is catapaulted forward the wheel spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt
james and niki both make good starts and are neck and neck but within seconds theres a mclaren right behind them gaining fast
james realizes its his team mate jochen mass in a white helmet
on his slick tyres
mass was right to gamble on the track drying out
james curses under his breath
james screwed up
made the wrong decision
he urgently needs to change tyres
with barely one lap completed
he swerves angrily into the pits
commentary from all the worlds tv stations explaining the crazy panicked situation as james comes into the pits to change to dry tyres
the mclaren team frantically changes the tyres
four men with air guns two men with rapid duty jacks
alastair caldwell appears talks to james
i told you to go on slicks
you didnt take my advice
he made the same mistake
james looks in his mirror to see nikis red helmet behind him in the pits then
thump new slick tyres hit the tarmac
james gets the signal clear
jamess foot hits the floor
he roars out with new tyres leaving niki behind him in the pits
archive commentary from the worlds tv stations informs us that james roars up into rd position
james gives it everything hes got
tearing through the gears breaking as late as he can engine screaming
the world flies past in a blur
the steering wheel shakes
the car cannot be driven any harder
no thought for safety
no thought of failure
failure is unimaginable
he turns into the final straight then stops when he sees something ahead
something has clearly happened
the race is being stopped
james brakes slowing down
he pulls level with a uniformed marshall
we dont know yet
nikis pov a continuation of the opening scene
burning smoke fills nikis helmet burning his lungs
he cries out in agony
we can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other drivers rushing towards him as their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo
we notice it is the same drivers that were critical of niki in the drivers meeting
harald ertl brett lunger arturo fire extinguishers blast at the car
covering nikis helmet
filling his lungs with chemicals along with the smoke and fumes blurring his vision as he screams horribly
the sound of panicked tv commentary in different languages
then sound fades
as niki blacks out losing consciousness
over this the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades
august st i discovered comas exist for a reason
nikis pov the door to a helicopter opens as it arrives at mannheim university hospital
the sound of shouting voices
hospital staff pull reach towards niki pull his stretcher out
nikis internal voice groans cries out at the pain
some things are better not remembered
crash doors burst open and niki is rushed into emergency
neon ceiling lights pass overhead
the sound of difficult breathing
his stretcher is surrounded by doctors talking urgently making quick assessments
nikis pov fading in and out of consciousness
bursts of concerned urgent overlapping dialogue among the german doctors which niki can barely make out
two narrow barely open slits of light
nikis swollen eye lids
nikis pov barely making out marlene standing beside the senior burns specialist doctor
niki hears voices
its not the burns to his face that are the danger
its the burns to his lungs
his blood oxygen level is currently
which is not enough to maintain life
niki slips out of consciousness again
marlene is distraught in tears
tv news giving the latest information on nikis condition
james sits watching the news on tv in his apartment while feeding his budgerigars the collection has grown
he feels terrible
he goes to his desk pulls out paper and pen
james tries to find the right words tries to write tries to put his feelings on paper but words in general and letters in particular have never been his thing
james scrunches up the pieces of paper throws it away
the budgerigars sensing his distress flutter and peep
v feels someone touching his forehead and his hands with oil
and the sound of a woman weeping
durch diese heilige salbung helfe dir der herr in seinem reichen erbarmen er stehe dir bei mit der kraft des heiligen geistes
nikis eyes barely crack open barely manage to focus to see an elderly priest is giving him the last rites in german
the sound of marlene crying somewhere in the room
der herr der dich von sunden befreit rette dich in seiner gnade richte er dich auf
niki strains to move
a sense of excruciating pain
he fights to open his eyes give an indication
any indication of the fact that he is hearing this and is alive and able to fight for life
but to no avail
the priest continues giving last rites
marlene continues to cry
the priest touches nikis shoulder
cant you tell
niki screams inside
wanting to be heard
wanting to give them a sign
hes still there
but its no use
niki blacks out again
the pain is too great
sunrise marlene has been sitting in the hospital all night supported by members of family and several friends
nikis mother and father
presently the door to the intensive care unit opens and a doctor comes out beckoning her
bitte kommen sie
and just spoke
marlene scrambles to her feet
what did he say
tell the priest to fuck off
im still alive
marlene covers her mouth laughs nervously already in tears
she and the doctor rush into the intensive care unit
shooting through the window we see marlene approach nikis bed
she sees niki
trying to control her expression
not give away to him how horrified she is
nikis face is grotesque
his head has swollen to double its size
the skin has burned off on his head his eyes
marlene bravely composes herself
then without displaying the shock she feels she goes over and kisses him
the starters flag drops
on television we see the austrian grand prix start
niki watches the race on television while beginning his rehab in bed in pain as bandages are changed
on tv james narrowly misses out on a podium but still gains on niki in his points total
hunt finishes th niki continues his rehab in the hospital now out of bed
on tv the starters flag drops
another grand prix starts
this time at zandvoort in the netherlands
niki watches the race on television as doctors put a vacuuum pump into his lungs
james leads driving the perfect race
we need to vacuum the lungs
without this they cant heal
but it will hurt
an unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs to try to hoover out the impurities
commentators on tv talk about how hunt is catching up with lauda on points
it spurs niki on through gritted teeth
the chequered flag
james crosses the line in first position
the doctors tell niki hes had enough vacuum treatment
hes had more than enough pain
but niki waves them aside
the doctor nods
the vacuum is turned on again
niki screams in agony
marlene and nikis family cannot bear to watch
he watches as on tv james is on the victory podium spraying champagne
niki continues screaming in pain watching the canadian gp on tv as
for the first time james has taken the lead in points
niki stares at the tv his expression changes
niki screams again
marlene nikis family and the doctors are deeply distressed cannot bring themselves to watch as
we widen to reveal what niki is doing
what has caused these unbearable bloodcurdling screams of agony
i know what youre all thinking
now we see
with great difficulty niki has put his racing helmet on for the first time
pressing into his open burn wounds
but if you love me all of you you wont say a word
he is almost unconscious with pain
his legs are weak
but he has done it
the italian grand prix
television commentary sets the scene
james and the mclaren team arrive in the pits to see a vast commotion going on elsewhere
whats going on
what about him
they said he was half dead
james pushes through the pitlanes until he reaches the crowded ferrari pits
he sees a racer in the background
the name lauda on his overalls
niki turns round
james sets eyes on him for the first time
james reels visibly horrified by his appearance
his bandages are blood stained
he has no hair
niki sees the horror in jamess face
sees the shock
and recognizes in that moment this is how its going to be this is how people will respond to him forever
its that bad huh
james opens his mouth
tries to say something
in the hospital i told them to tell me straight no bullshit how bad it would be
they said with time itd be fine
but it wont
i can tell seeing your reaction
i am going to spend the rest of my life with a face that frightens people
niki stares at james at his rivals beauty his blonde tanned perfection
his matinee idol movie star looks
thats a tough one to get used to
i wrote you a letter at the time
a beat james contid the drivers meeting in germany
before the race
i swayed the room
that race should never have gone ahead
so in some ways
i feel responsible for what happened
trust me watching you win those points and all those races while i was in hospital fighting for my life
you were equally responsible for getting me better
that could have been meant generously
but in this case it wasnt
it was a cold slap in the face
niki turns and goes
a packed press conference
the worlds media
nikis accident and recovery as a story has reached way beyond f race fans
this is front page news around the globe
niki walks out onto the podium all eyes staring at him the sense of a ghoulish voyeuristic freak show
niki sits on the podium in front of microphones flanked on both sides by ferrari drivers and top brass
but no one wants to talk to them
everyones here to talk to niki
how are you feeling niki
can you confirm for us exactly which procedures you have had
and the expectations for your recovery
i had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face
it doesnt look too good but one unexpected advantage is its impossible to perspire through a skin graft so sweat will never run in my eyes again which is good
for a driver
at the back of the hall james hunt creeps in unseen by anyone disguised in a hat to listen
when they heard about your condition ferrari immediately hired another driver carlos reutemann
before even my first operation
is he your replacement now
just another team mate
keen to make an impression
so lets see where mr
reutemann finishes today
james hunt and mclaren have caught up a lot while you were away
a beat is there a question now
or are you just trying to piss me off
you think you can still win
i have the better car
im the better driver
but hes a clever guy and has used the time well while i was lying half dead in hospital to win some points
what did your wife say when she saw your face
she said sweetie you dont need a face to drive
only a right foot
im being serious
do you really think your marriage can survive
with the way you look now
niki squints into the lights
and im being serious too
which asshole said this
no one moves
niki disgusted rips off his microphone
press conference over
niki walks out
the press conference breaks up
james sees the reporter who asked the question laughing with his friends
james watches as the reporter leaves
james goes after the reporter and calls him
the reporter turns recognizes james
ive got something for you on that last question
the british journalist smiles great thanks james
pulls out a tape recorder
james takes him to one side then
whack whack whack james punches his lights out then takes the tape recorder stuffs it into the journalists mouth
now go home to your wife and ask her how you look
crash a final sickening blow splits the reporters nose
james walks out to his car
banks of photographers
commentators talk in different languages
everyone talking about nikis comeback
niki is in his car
the mechanics are talking to him in italian
but niki hears nothing
he looks at the steering wheel the shell of the car the gear stick
and then we see
his hands are shaking violently
hes utterly terrified
the light turns green
other cars including jamess roar forward
but niki is frozen
nikis mind is a mess terrified he starts slowly
finding his courage
commentators point out its madness
it was clearly too soon
ferrari were right to hire a replacement
niki is a wreck
niki suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident
niki shakes himself out
gradually building up speed ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him
niki begins to accelerate
gently at first
then a bit more
blocking out further flashbacks
watching niki from the hospital where he had his treatment is the doctor who treated him
commentators look up
notice nikis slow increase in speed
maybe theres life in him yet
niki changes gears smoothly
he begins to overtake
the old feelings come back
marlene watches from the pits
can hardly bring herself to look
commentators begin to get excited
lauda has started to overtake the back markers
an incredible sequence
as niki gains more confidence more speed and begins to work his way through the field
commentators now buzzing with excitement
this is incredible as niki overtakes first carlos reutemann the driver hired to replace him then others working his way through the field
james sees niki coming up behind him
cannot believe his eyes
james move to block nikis path
niki attacks fearlessly
despite terrible pain
niki moves to overtake james
utterly intimidated by nikis bravery james panics and loses control of the car
he spins out
commentators cannot believe their eyes
hunts blown it
laudas overtaken him
its a miracle
it defies belief
as niki crosses the line
the italian crowds are ecstatic
niki is a national hero
lazarus back from the dead
tv commentary in different languages elaborates on what an extraordinary superhuman achievement they have just seen
what a race
what a man
what a season
now it all boils down to the final race in japan
hunt walks past staring at a triumphant niki
the doctor in the hospital shakes his head cannot believe what he has just witnessed
the ferrari mechanics that had initially so disliked niki are overwhelmed by what he has achieved
a reluctant modest niki carried on shoulders surrounded by luca di montezemolo marlene and the press
mount fuji towers imperiously dramatically above the japanese race track dominating the skyline on a clear day
television cameras and press photographers assemble at the race track for the biggest sporting event of the year
james sits alone in his hotel suite
speaking to an old trusted friend at the other end
the man was in a coma
his doctors pronounced him dead
then he comes back and does that
bubbles horsley back at home in england
at a breakfast table
what did you expect
that niki would give you the championship lying down
of course not
hes a fighter
hes going to come at you with everything hes got
but you can do this
as a driver youre his equal better maybe
and god knows youre quick and brave enough
need to find the respect for yourself to close out when it really matters
you dont much like yourself james thats the problem therefore dont believe you deserve it
a knock at jamess hotel room door
ive got to go
james hangs up and goes to the door
he snaps it open to reveal
two gorgeous looking boac stewardesses standing outside
smart blue blazers short skirts white gloves blue caps
weve come for the party
the party we were told was going on in room
sure enough on jamess door the number
who sent you here
on the phone
he didnt give his name
did he speak with an accent
james cant believe it
im afraid it was a joke
liking the look of james awwww
any other time
james closes the door
goes back into his hotel room
then after a moment
he snaps open the door
the stewardesses are about to disappear into the elevator
the following morning day barely breaks
the skies are ominously dark over tokyo
thick black clouds
its raining heavily
niki wakes up and looks out of the window
sees the heavy rain which is falling outside
his expression changes
james wakes up
james looks around bleary eyed
hes in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it
the two stewardesses are still asleep in the bed beside him
uniforms discarded on the floor
memories are now flooding back
jesus what was he thinking
james leaps out of bed
niki is being massaged by willi dungl in his hotel room in preparation for the race
niki continues to stare out of the window
they speak in german
we see sub titles
cant see the mountain
the locals here believe if you can see the mountain in the morning it brings good luck
nikis pov the view
nothing but mist dark skies and rain
inside the race track puddles everywhere
the rain continues to fall
the circuit is covered in water
drivers and the teams arrive at the race track
james and teddy mayer and alastair caldwell among them
spectators are huddled under umbrellas
tv crews struggle to keep expensive equipment dry
an american voice comes over the tannoy
all drivers to the control tower please
james looks at caldwell
a drivers meeting has been called
all the drivers are in a small room arguing and remonstrating with fia officials and blazer wearing powers that be
a japanese official akiyama is trying to keep the peace
one at a time
local japanese drivers are complaining in japanese we see sub titles
you cant send us out in that
its a death sentence
you have to postpone the race
james mayer and caldwell arrive in a corridor outside the meeting room
nikis talking to them about cancelling the race
jamess pov he can see niki his wounds horribly visible remonstrating with the japanese official about the dangerous track conditions
james turns to teddy and alastair
i dont want any part of this
im not going to be responsible for turning the room again
but you have no option
you have to race james
its your only shot
if you dont niki wins
im not voting against niki again
or forcing fellow drivers to risk their lives
world championship or not
james raises his hands and walks off
caldwell shouts after him james wait
then mayer reassures caldwell
dont worry this race is going ahead
the tv rights have been sold all around the world
mayer can see that a vote is taking place in the room
many of the drivers have their hands in the air voting
the japanese official is struggling to keep order in the room
the drivers can vote all they like
a round of applause in the room as the drivers vote to cancel the race
but unseen by the drivers
the fia officials tv network executives and the blazered powers that be are in dark conspiratorial discussion
making the decision that the race goes ahead
newscasters from all over the world in several different languages announce that a decision has been made
the japanese grand prix is definitely going ahead
the drivers have been called to the starting grid
in the pits alongside james
a series of shots of the other drivers
being sent out like lambs to the slaughter
visibly terrified mouthing prayers smoking last cigarettes meditating crossing themselves hands shaking
among them the japanese drivers
all laughter gone now
realizing what theyve got into
risking their lives
finally we come to rest on niki
niki puts on his balaclava over his still raw wounds wincing with pain as he puts on his helmet
james is piggy backed to his car by mechanics so his feet dont get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track
james lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat
he straps himself in
alistair caldwell approaches with a power drill
leans towards james with the screaming drill
what are you doing
zzzz zzzz zzzz caldwell drill holes in jamess visor
to let the condensation out
but it will also let the water in
not if youre leading
caldwell stares at james
this race is all about the start
whoevers in front will see everything
caldwell gestures nothing
they shake hands
james starts the engine with a roar
nikis engine replies with a loud roar
he looks over at james
james turns to face niki
as james and niki stare at one another
all around them the world slows down
comes to a standstill
a connection between them
unspoken realization of where they have both got to
what this moment means
for them both
its what they have been waiting for
all this time
niki raises his hand
in a gesture only james sees
james raises his in return
a private salute
from a bygone era
and in that moment enemies become brothers
risking their lives
the moments truce is broken
they return to the task at hand
hunts foot hits the floor
nikis foot hits the floor
james gets the better start
his car aquaplanes like crazy skating over the water totally out of control
caldwell and mayer watch from the pit wall
hold onto it james
miraculously james steadies the car
the spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist
the other cars are wrapped inside it
but james has a clear view ahead
he slams his foot down
its the perfect start for hunt
niki can see nothing
surrounded by spray water noise
other cars are spinning all around him
niki bravely accelerates into blindness
but laudas car is right on his tail
barely visible in the spray
james goes to a corner then his car twitches aquaplanes again
almost losing it completely
hunt turns too tightly
he almost lost his car right there
bubbles horsley alexander hesketh and a number of the characters from the hesketh racing days are all watching
james struggles to hold onto his car
he steadies it maintaining the lead
jamess spray makes it impossible for niki to see
niki cant blink his eyes
half blind niki tries to overtake
gives it everything hes got breaking as late as he can tearing through the gears
for niki the world flies past in a near blind blur
the steering wheel shakes
the car cannot be driven any harder
but the visibility is terrible
the spray tears into his scarred eyes
he is unable to see anything but
marlenes beautiful face staring at him
kissing him tenderly
james continues to race flat out
foot to the floor
his car aquaplanes again
almost skidding out
suzy hunt is watching on television as richard burton talks in the background on the telephone
urging him on come on james
a sign is held up as james races
but there are problems with the car
one of the tyres
his front tyre
its completely frayed
caldwell and teddy mayer watch in horror from the pits and on tv
they can see the shaking car
hunts car has problems
the englishman is definitely getting slower
alastair caldwell holds up a sign
with just a few laps to go mclaren are calling for hunt to come into the pits to change tyres
jamess car roars past the pits refusing to stop
but hunt is refusing
simply ignoring his teams orders
hes made the calculation that he can still hold onto the lead
hesketh and bubbles cover their eyes
what are you doing
i cant bear it
suddenly a ferrari in jamess wing mirror
unmistakably even in the spray he can see the distinctive red helmet
jamess blood runs cold
james tries to fend niki off
swerves this way and that
but his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best
niki overtakes him
james screams in agony and frustration
hes lost it
and has no one to blame but himself
his own arrogance
nikis overtaken him
james roars past
has finished in third place
but that is no consolation
niki has beaten him
as far as hes concerned
james has lost
jamess car arrives in the pits
in a fury
for refusing to listen
what a disgrace
what a fool
but he is engulfed
james gets out of his car raging
but teddy mayer is celebrating wildly
alastair caldwell too
the worlds media descends on james
what are you talking about
you did it
what about niki
he overtook me
i saw it
a ferrari with a red helmet
that wasnt niki
that was regazzoni
said it was too dangerous refused to drive
gestures youre champion of the world kiddo
teddy mayer takes jamess number from the side of his car and tears it in two leaving number
jamess face as he realizes
then explodes with happiness
hesketh and bubbles cheer in celebration
he did it
he bloody well did it
a television plays in the emergency ward of the hospital
nursie catches sight of the victory patients cheering and applauding
nursie allows herself a smile
burton is at the door in tuxedo waiting to go
suzy dressed glamorously smiles
well done james
then turns the tv off
and follows burton out
james is embraced by caldwell and mayer
across the race track the sound of helicopter blades turning
james looks over to see
niki in the helicopter with marlene and a pilot
niki now the ex world champion looks over to see a triumphant james surrounded by press mclaren colleagues etc are you ok
niki turns takes marlenes hand as he answers
its just one race
the helicopter lifts into the air and flies off
james watches as the helicopter carrying niki flies away then turns to see
the worlds press begins to descend on him and the biggest party of james hunts life is about to begin
in the background the two japanese drivers are giving interviews again
they didnt just survive masahiro hasemi got the fastest lap of the race and noritake takahara came th
and at that moment magically the sun breaks through and the snowy peak of mount fuji is finally revealed
of newspaper headlines television talk shows lucrative endorsements tv commercials sponsorship public billboards
jamess world championship victory has made him a rich man
his movie star looks make him an international star and marketing mans dream
girls more girls and even more girls
james dashing in a white suit plays trumpet on the uks most famous talk show
were on the runway of an airport in northern italy
a stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac
a still drunk james hunt and several good looking women rowdy friends and hangers on spill out of the limo
they cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet passing other jets when james stops
hes seen something that has caught his eye
james sends his friends on ahead to their waiting jet and walks over to a small private jet a learjet
i heard you were spending more and more time in one of these
a hunched pilot doing final checks
the figure turns
his wounds have healed a little but its still a painful sight
do you fly
you should try it
if something goes wrong up there youre on the edge but have to stay within the rules
stick to regulations
suppress the ego
its good discipline for the racing
and there i was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight
i should have known better
what brings you here
james indicates his rowdy cool looking friends
a friends wedding
at least i think it was a wedding
might have been a birthday
all a bit of a blur
how about you
been at fiorano
pre season testing
im not sure i meant it as a compliment
but it is one
relentlessness is good
means youre a fighter
that you never give up
behind my back i know some of you guys call me the rat
because i look like one
its meant as an insult
but i dont mind it
rats are ugly sure
and no one likes them
but theyre intelligent
with a strong survival instinct
james cant help smiling
so when do you start testing
are you mad
i didnt just win the biggest thing of my life so i could get right back to work
you need to
to prove to all the people who will always say you only won it because
because of your accident
is that other people niki
on the all important day when it came down to it we raced on equal terms in equally good cars
james contid you bottled and i had the guts to see it through
you won that race
and believe me if i had to lose that title to anyone im happy it was you
but that doesnt change the fact you have to win again
because thats what it means to be a winner no
its a permanent condition
never stops or goes away
it stays with you always
sounds like losing to me
some of life needs to be for pleasure niki
whats the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun
how is that winning
the plane load of jamess friends call out
i could learn from you
in hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum
pumping the shit out of my lungs
it was agony
while doing it i was watching television
you winning all those races
and i was cursing you
that bastard hunt i would shout i hate that guy
one day the doctor said mr
lauda may i offer one piece of advice
stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life
it can be a blessing too
i said who are you confucius
he said a wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends
and you know hes right
look at us
we were a pair of kids when we first met
hotheaded jerks in formula
now were both champions of the world
no not bad
so dont let me down now
i need you busting my balls
get back to work
i will niki
but i intend to enjoy myself first
and so should you
you think you can
a blank look
see you on race day champ
niki watches him pulled into his plane by his laughing cool friends
an unmistakable flicker of envy in his eyes
then niki turns alone and resumes his safety checks
jamess plane roars down the runway and takes off into the azure blue sky
