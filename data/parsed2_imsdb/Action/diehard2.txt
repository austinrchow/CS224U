de souza november while were in black we hear a pneumatic ka chunk and then holy shit whoa whoa john mcclane long topcoat flapping comes running out of the terminal
towards an airport cop in plastic covered uniform who is supervising a tow truck driver who in turn is manhandling a sedate sedan with virginia plates and a grandmother on board sign on the rear window
im here im here false alarm lets just let her down nice and easy sure
at the impound lot
next time read the sign
you dont understand im just meeting my wifes plane you gotta give me this car back
tomorrow to four you pay bucks we give it back
this is my mother in laws car
she already hates me because im not a see im a cop

i only moved cause my wife got promoted look maybe we can settle this right here were in washington heartbeat of democracy one hand washes the other he realizes the truck is driving away one way while the cop is i going off the other way mcclane votes for the cop hey cmon its christmas so ask santa to bring you another car
you son of a beep drowns out his last word
mcclave sweeps aside his coat finds the beeper on his belt
he looks at the obviously unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement then runs into the terminal
christmas music wafting through the building from a school choir perched in front of a massive three story window
blase travelers pause in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic voices
mcclane shoves his way through some people when they glare at him he quickly applauds the kids pulls up at an information booth the girl there is watching a little
tv on the shelf out of sight from the public
on tv and that white christmas information girl may be here for a while if pointing that new storm front moves right over there
to the metro area this afternoon as predicted
mcclane nods serves across the slick linoleum
st newscaster contd correspondent leonard adkins is in a warmer clime with a story that grows hotter by the minute
he fairly skids to a halt at a line of phone booths and outside each booth a long line of people with their armfuls of luggage and gifts
mcclanes beeper goes off again
ho ho ho
thru omitted thru a plane takes off
we pull back and realize were in a motel room
the tv is on and we see the tv picture change to a tropical airfield
khaki clad heavily armed soldiers form a cordon as a stiff backed handsome man of in handcuffs and leg chains is hustled aboard a plane
security was tight today at escalon airport in the republic of val verde where government authorities escorted general ramon esperanza to the military transport that will bring him to the
united states to stand trial for narcotics trafficking
a hand thrusts in front of the camera fingers clenching and curling oddly
a half naked man is doing tai chi exercises
this is colonel william stuart u
his body is hard with scars from knives and bullets
on the tv the words file tape blink under esperanzas image
here resplendent in a latin american uniform reviewing troops in the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign documents with american military officers
he hands a colonel the pen just used on the document a souvenir
only two years ago the controversial general lead his countrys army in its campaign against communists insurgents a campaign fought with american money and advisors
esperanzas fall from power caused ripples not only in his country
s recent election but closer to home i as well
picture changes to some washington steps
the american colonel we just
saw exits a federal building with some junior officers and attorneys avoids reporters
when high ranking pentagon officials were chargedwith supplying i him with weapons despite the congressional ban
the exercises finished stuart freezes in an eerie pose until beeps an alarm the man uncoils
goes to the closet
but mounting evidence that esperanzas forces violated the neutrality of neighboring countries made congress withhold funds funds which esperanza i s accused of replacing by going into thelucrative business of
one topcoat one suit there shirt and tie laid out like a costume not usually worn
on the shelf above one package in stewart puts on the shirt
in the pocket is a pen the same pen we just saw on tv
if we havent realized it yet we realize it now t s is the same man
suddenly stuart whirls like a gunfighter
but all hes got in his hand is the remote control snatched from the nightstand
it clicks off close on the hallway door as stuart comes out the package in i his hand the huer ticking away
we widen truck with him as he moves down the corridor
and now we see them ten more tall hard men all coming into the hallway from their adjoining rooms within seconds of each other all carrying similar gift wrapped packages
they get into two adjoining
elevators the stark lights above their heads and their unmoving expressions making them look like aliens ready to beam up
as the doors close we mcclane squeezes past an enormous woman exiting a phone booth with a present as big as she is
catching his breath he drops his quarter dials
aru omitted thru holly mcclane is here airphone at her ear and a beautiful sunset over the planes wing visible through the nearby window
with the compaq portable computer filofax and calculator piled on it holly
s seat back table looks like a traveling office
this is lieutenant mcclane somebody there beep me
id like to think im somebody
did you land
john wake up
its the nineties
microchips microwaves faxes and airphones
as far as im concerned progress peaked with the frozen pizza
were going to land about thirty minutes late i wanted you to know
just speeding on sugar thanks to your parents
i really appreciate you coming a day late honey
nothing i like better than a weekend with the munsters
mom give you any trouble about borrowing her new car
how bout if when you land we dont drive over the river and through the woods to grandmas house but check into the airport motel
youre on lieutenant
they both hang up
the older woman beside holly smiles at her
isnt technology wonderful
my husband doesnt think so
well i do
i used to carry around those awful mace things she opens her purse and displays a taser stun gun
older woman contd now i zap any bastard who screws with me
i tried it on my little dog poor thing limped for a week
as holly tries to smile politely we coming out of the phone booth and almost colliding with colonel stuart
excuse me pause as they dance away from each other
then do i know you
get that a lot
been on tv
you and me both pal
the hell with it
now its stuarts turn to look at mcclane oddly then he moves off
mcclane looks after him trying to place him
heads for the bar
charming until the sub woofer roar of a big jet screams by practically in the little churchs backyard
now we notice that the church is a little run down trim needing paint sidewalk cracked and a neat sign confirms our a dwp van pulls up snow tires crunching
on the driveway here
two men baker and thompson get out in official dwp wardrobe
but we remember the trim bodies trimmer hair
and we remember those gift wrapped packages which one of these guys carries
on a tv here the newscast continues now back to the tropical airport
esperanza is at the top of the steps waving to the press like a triumphant hero not a felon en route to prison
the plane doors close and it taxis down the runway
widen from the set which an elderly custodian is watching while he eats some instant soup
the doorbell rings
the custodian answers it
on tv although esperanza was baker removed as commander in sorry to bother you sir
chief earlier this year were checking our equipment
the agreement to extradite any problems with the conduit him was not reached until box in your backyard
yesterday and washington insiders say it was a phone custodian call that made it happen gee i dont know anything a phone call from an about that
angry american president
baker and thompson glance at each other
would you mind if we take a look
the three men walk down the main aisle of the church
dust motes dance in the colored light
dont seem right somehow closing a church down
oh i know the parish is gonna keep using it but it wont be the same
been here a lot of years and i been right here with it
theyve arrived at a rear window
focus change to a green conduit box on the the churchs rear lawn half covered in snow
focus back through the glass
thompson looks questioningly at baker who nods
i kinda feel a part of me is dying along with this church
well youre right about that
blam blam glam
bullets rip through the end of the christmas package slam the custodian up and into a row of pews which baker rips the rest of the smoking package away from
his weapon s i s it over his shoulder and begins to shove the pews aside to make a larger open area
thompson meanwhile takes out a very futuristic transceiver
he turns it on getting a red light enters a number code on the keypad and gets a green light
theres an eerie quality to the transmission
this is team one
this is leonard adkins in val verde where the war on drugs has finally taken its first prisoner
with an annoyed expression thompson clicks off the newscast
two painters pull up in a van
move around the back and start to pull out ladders and cans
busting our asses christmas week like theyre gonna land extra planes if we finish suddenly two men oreilly and sh don are there
both painters are shot
quickly the two men toss their bodies into the rear get into the van
and back it into the airport garage
oreilly enters a number code into a transceiver into radio as iffey team two
a cyclone fence and a microwave dome fenced in with a sign burke and kahn two more of those clean cut men are here just now parking and going to
the rear of their rented station wagon
quickly they open the trunk slide out a long olive drab tube and a tripod
kahn kicks spikes on the tripod into the frozen around to anchor it tilt up as a snaps the tube on top of it swings it around towards the installation
when hey you
has pulled over across the road
both officers get out
cocking a shotgun this is
a restricted area
mind telling us what youre doing
a quick look between them
swivels the long firing the two men tube around
with kahn loading and vjmeln launch a missile at the police car
explodes the two cops halfway out swallowed up in the as the cop car burns the two men turn pivot the weapon back towards the transmitter
the missile trail arcs neatly over the fence lands on target the top of the tower its the heart soul brain of dulles
we hear snatches of air traffic control as the camera pans the big room
we see planes outside the airport lights already on against the grey of the snow
its damn impressive
camera settles on trudeau
chief air traffic controller hes lived through hijackings the olympics reagans mass firings and hes still going heart bypass notwithstanding
chief engineer barnes is as good as a right ventricle anyway
an alarm rings
lighting a cigarette he hovers over barnes
we just lost faa approach control
weather may have screwed up the line
switch over to our own back up and run a check
barnes hits a switch
the alarm stops
widen from mcclane at the bar his coat on a stool beside him
hes on his second scotch
on the bar tv we see samantha sam copeland a reporter with live superd over her body
she is clearly somewhere inside this airport here at dulles the quiet men from the justice department wait to put handcuffs on the man who has come to symbolize the
enemy in americas fight against cocaine
this battle may be almost won
but the war is still in doubt
wntw for nighttime news
camera adjusts to
show a man as he opens a phone booth
its very quick but we realize that while in there he
wasnt using the phone but one of the transceivers we saw before
this is major garber stuarts second in command but his efficiency and chilly courage are second to none
camera follows him to a table
c oc hrane and miller two more of those neat trim young men are there in neat eoring topcoats
that was the colonel all perimeter teams are in place
cochrane covers one ear and we see that he has a radio earplug
he listens intently then grins
flurries all along h e virginia coast
new storm moving in from the northeast
sharing the smile god loves the infantry
carry out your assignment
well regroup at field hq
setting his watch three fifty one
they syncronize their watches and then mi l e leaves the bar
camera pans him out
he walks right past mcclane who doesnt notice him
a beat after mil ergs exit two airport cops in snow flecked jackets come into the bar
seeing them the bartender is already pouring coffee for them
but also see the cops and very casually cochrane ulls the earplug from his ear
equally casually garber vs wed if is foot to slide the two long christmas package at his feet under the table
this gets his attention
his eyes narrow
he looks from the two or d inary looking men towards the airport cops wonders why they got fidgety
now he watches who looks at his watch signals cochrane
but as cochrane bends to pick up his wrapped package
and as he moves something dangles inside his jacket
is it a holster
turns to watch them exit sees them split up outside the bar
quickly mcclane goes over to the airport cops
excuse me officers
this may be a total wild goose chase but i think i just saw he stops
the cop hes talking to is the asshole who towed away the car
mcclane turns throws money near his glass and quickly exits the bar
trying to get the half dozen uniformed us marshals or the three justice department lawyers to talk to them without success
but one reporter sam notices i as she watches garber joins him nudging her cameraman hey
better than these loxes
very quietly sam and the cameraman do their best to slip away from the pack
everything on schedule
tapping airport phones right now
got a slight problem with personnel last minute replacement
whats the status of the security here
nodding towards the like we figured
a joke but suddenly both men are in the glare of a portable light
can we have a few words with you
you can have two fuck and you
and the interview is over and hes out the door
mcclanes head panning the holiday crowd then seeing cochrane
quickly he follows cochrane downwards into where a tourist junket gets between mcclane and his quarry a glimpse of him at a door marked no admittance then hes gone
mcclane runs up too late the door is shut again
he looks around sees a luggage worker flashes his badge
as the guy obeys got a cop on duty around here
airport police get em
clatters and bumps machine sounds
mcclane moves cautiously along
he jumps as a large shadow moves nearby but its a big case on a conveyor belt
now he stoops to go under another conveyor belt the different tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off ramps discharging luggage from one to another and then he
one has his jacket off and just now dusts off his hands like a man finishing a job
the other one has one of those transceivers
they turn see mcclane with his badge in his left hand his right hidden under the long coat which is draped over his shoulder like clint eastwoods serape in a
this is a restricted area
you boys too impatient to wait for the skycaps
work for th amine
lets see some id instantly both men dive to the outside drawing guns
dropping hiswallet mcclane jumps aside as shots whizz past mcclanes coat takes the bullet hits in mid air as he lands on a conveyor belt which carries him up and
over the gunmen
they fire up at him he aims
back and then a suitcase falling from another belt and knocks his gun away
the gun clatters on the floor
seeing it the two men exchange a glance split up
drops from the belt crouches near big gears
desperate he looks around for a weapon anything
then he notices all the luggage going past suitcases camera cases a bicycle
moving forward expertly gun ready
a ski pole smacks down on his wrist
the gun drops onto a conveyor belt fires then moves away obscured by moving luggage
j mcclane steps in punches miller gets hit hard himself both roll over onto the new belt
hearing the shot he tries to pinpoint the location but with all the echoes its hard
fighting hand to hand
miller starts pressing the ski pole against mcclanes throat pt lane tries to do the same thine back they spin smash into a pile of suitcases some of which m
j er gets in a powerful punch gets free camera follows miller as his hand gropes for the pistol
and then mcclane rit into view with fucking hairspray right in the guys eyes
miller howls blinded but then blam
a bullet explodes tcan in mcclanes hand
cochrane is there
mcclane leaps like tarzan to the bottom of the i empty return belt the momentum swings him right towards cochrane who fires once more before mcclanes kick nearly toc e
stfhis head he loses the gun but jesus these guys are tough and now cochrane leaps up and grabs mcclanes belt and clothes and theyre both hanging suddenly theyre both too damn high to get off
half on the belt half off he fends off the other man and sees the belt goes through a hatchway a hatchway with virtually no clearance
mcclane punches cochrane again again but the guys gonna kill them both one way or the other mcclane kicks him again again finally his grip loosens at the last minute
mcclane jumps to a thick conduit and then cochrane gets jammed the conduit breaks free from its molly bolts but doesnt drop and three feet away the guy screams and then his neck snaps and his body twitches and jerks and the machinery jams smoking winces as blood splatters and then reacts as the foot tall conduit pipe creaks bends topples he rides it down led bjthe luggage guy two airport cops run in panting for breath rubbing his eyes he sees their approach starts to run
he races down a long aisle past cartons of freight
starts to smile theres a door just ahead hes gonna make it hes gonna make it suddenly a ching ching sound makes him turn its the ching ching of with
john mcclane on the back
mcclane dives out of the saddle like the lone ranger takes miller down
x as the bicycle flips over mcclane gets to his feet first and finds a gun in his face and in that instant you guessed it miller f scapes
x brilliant asshole
im a cop that was the bad guy
wheres your i
starts to reach into his jacket remembers
he looks around the huge room and its clanking conveyor belts
hollys working away on her laptop computer when x no you did not explain anything all you did was shove me a here in this cattle car sir you were
told when you boarded that we were overbooked holly looks up idlely and then reacts as she sees her nemesis from months ago here waving his ticket and fending off the stewardess friendly hands
done i accept it
but why the hell cant i get the first class meal my network paid for instead of this swill
im sorry sir i cant do that now if youll just sit down
do youknow who i am
weve all seen your program
your episode flying junkyards was a very objective look at air safety
it wasnt nearly
as edifying as bimbos of the sky was it connie
you think youre funny
looking at her nametag ive got your number pushing him in seat x and ive got yours so park it pal
thornberg simmers and then he sees holly
mister thornberg you cannot monopolize my you cannot put me near that woman
camera adjusts to feature holly and the stewardess growing fascination with her
means he has filed a restraining order against me
im not allowed within fifty feet of him to stew ardess and by seating me here youre violating a court order i could sue you and this airline this woman
has assaulted me and besmirched my kneeling sotto
whatd you do
i knocked out two of his teeth
would you like some champagne
as it is zipped into a body bag our view of the mangled head and shoulders mercifully brief
the body is set on a gurney
we widen and see airport police and coroners people about to make off with it
and the media now drooling over this new story dropped right into their laps
as flashbulbs pop and cameras roll sam notices one of the cops hands mcclane his wallet
as he pockets it he notes the crowd milling about the luggage area
i continued whoa wait a second
this is a crime scene
arent you going to seal off this area
thats up to the captain
up to the captain
take me up to the captain too
baker guards the rear door with an assault rifle
he reacts tense as a figure appears running up from the snowy expanse behind the church
its filer the man who escaped from mcclane
baker waves him in
kahn and bi are digging in theme y rd with pickaxes and hardly o at him
i stuarts poring over maps of the airport
he looks up nonplussed wipes away snow that falls from mii s shoulder to the table top
we ran into trouble a policeman
he killed cochrane i barely got away
did you finish your assignment
but then the damage is minor
drawing a pistol but the penalty could be severe
in a blur of motion stuart is on his feet the pistol is at millers temple
as mil a shudders fail me again and it wont be an empty chamber
mcclane comes in first double taking the name on the door the man himself a year veteran of bureaucratic wars that have earned him this little kingdom rises behind his
a glance at a fax mcclane
im the one who yeah i know
you think that la badge is gonna get you a free lunch x or something down here
just a little professional courtesy
in an airport christmas week
you gotta be kidding
forget the courtesy
how about lust the professional
your boys dust walked away from a crime scene you need to seal it off get a forensics team in dust it shoot and what do we do with all
the luggage for all the airplanes while we play charlie chan
you store them somewhere oh
and meanwhile every hour a few more thousand people come and they want to put their luggage on airplanes so we store them and their luggage in some other somewhere
hell why dont we shut down the whole fucking airport
whaddya think theyll say upstairs when i tell them that
why dont you try it and find out
because i dont need a forensics investigation to file away some punk stealing luggage luggage
that punk pulled a glock seven on me
know what that is
a porcelain gun from germany
it doesnt show up on airport x ray machines
and it costs more than you earn in a month
youd be surprised what i earn in a month
if its more than a dollar eighty nine yeah mcclane dont start believing your own press
on mcclanes look waving the fax x yeah i know who you are that nakatomi thing in la
just cause the tv thought you were hot shit dont make it so
this time youre in my little pond and im the big fish that runs it
now you capped some lowlife fine
ill send your fucking captain in l
a fucking commendation
he hits a buzzer
immediately two burly airport cops appear in the doorway
fi continued now get the hell out of my office before i have you thrown out of my airport
mcclane moves towards the door his hands waving off the would be bouncers
turning at the door one question carmine which sets off the metal detectors first the shit in your brains or the lead in your ass
mcclane comes out of lorenzos office steaming
he walks down the corridor looks back at one of the stocky airport cops fakes a smile when the guy turns away mcclane punches the wall
then a clatter announces the passage of the morgue guys the body on their gurney
mcclane moves aside watches them thinking
getting an idea
the girl here lost in a romance novel excuse me
he reaches over gently takes typing paper and a stamp pad
mcclane catches up to the morgue guys as they reach their wagon
ver quickly showing gotta check something
before they can react hes unzipped the bag yanked out the guys right hand
whatre you doing
inking the guys fingers didnt you ever have an airport stiff before
we need an faa id on your he presses the fingers against the paper checks them
the hand hes released remains straight up
yup hes dead
and hes gone as they look after him puzzled
cruising along its fighter escort a few wingtips away
now the fighter wags its wings and peels away
camera moves from the cockpit back through the rest of the plane
ay alle va nos escorto
es bueno el peligro es pasado
estamos segur hasta los estados unidos
tres horas y media
by now we are on esperanza
looking astonishingly carefree x he smiles at the young corporal guarding him puffs on a cigar
x and casually examines the military chronometer on his handcuffed x wrist
we push in on it
x widen from stuarts huer showing the exact same time
now we see that the church is full of electronic equipment in fact it looks very much like a mini version of an airport control tower complete with radar screens
and a big glass board to mark positions on
camera follows a man with a pizza sized radar dish as he crosses the room a crony unrolling wire behind him
crane up as the man climbs into the steeple
up up up until hes in the belfry where a prerigged tripod waits for the dish
as he clamps it in place we see the yard behind the church and the sparkle of welding tools someone is making connections to the now open conduit box and
excuse me honey can i borrow your office for a minute
before she can answer hes over the counter and reaching for her phone
the office hes in shows us that al powell has moved up in the world and twinkies have move up along with him
swallowing answering records
powell hey partner

holly holds out her glass

mcclane comes out deep in thought gets on an walkway
suddenly the click of heels makes him turn
sam coleman is trotting down the linoleum next to the walkway trying to keep up with him
the ghost of christmas past

sam coleman wadc news as mcclane reacts hey i know how you feel about the media but were not all like that putz thornberg he crossed the line

the guy makes geraldo look like walter chronkite

and hes at the end of the walkway and he quickly disappears into the crowd leaving sam pissed puzzled
and out of breath
lorenzo has joined the regulars here to cover his ass well the press was here crawling all over the esperanza story
so they got it right on the fucking news bloodstains and all

annoyed but obeying i got it
oh my god
everyone turns at the chill in barnes voice
what is it
but barnes doesnt reply
just tries and fails to point out the window
x slowly without any fuss and with a pattern of sorts that would be pretty if the impact wasnt so frightening
slowly all the jesus
as stuarts tech throws more and more switches and more and more runways go dark
go to emegency lighting
controllers code x yellow
people leap into action
meanwhile trudeau and the others move around the tower the camera following in a turn watch as the lights keep going out
back up systems wont come up

what i want is very important
all react mcclane as much as anyone
a plane is going to be landing at this airport in minutes
it is fm foreign military
trudeau nods this plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the u
but now there will be a change of plans
this plane will not be met by anyone
it will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested
that will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it
at the same time i want a cargo conversion fully fueled
as trudeau tries to make headway with stuart mcclave leans over to barnes
whats all that about
a has the furthest flight capacity of anything weve got here
take out the seats and save some weight add the wing tanks and it could go to australia africa asia hell the whole goddamn world
meaning they pull esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere theres no extradition treaties
theyre talking to us on our own goddamn system
they gotta be close ill have my men tear this airport about time carmine

turning shouting security
back to mcclane youre out of here
and already two big airport cops are trotting over
as trudeau reacts unsure mr

sam coleman wntw news
trudeau theres a lot of rumors flying around oh no no way this is off limits coleman you know that
together with mcclane shes shoved into the elevator
anything you can think of theyll think of too
but the elevator doors close on him and now lorenzo turns a key on the control panel then speaks into his walkie talkie
lobby security come in
into radio tomlinson here and lorenzo here with two unauthorized personnel in the fucking tower
get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator
get them out and post a guard or youre gonna have a pink slip in your christmas stocking
rattled the guard signals a comrade hustles to obey
anything who can think of
cant fuck with
mcclane punches buttons
but its on override
big drug dealer on the way to prison
gunfight in airport
every controller in the coffee shop getting beeped and hauling ass and you rocking the boat
come on mcclane just a few words
opening the control how about fuck and you
i already got that from colonel stuart thanks
mcclane stops as if zapped by a taser
the guy who got canned by congress thats who he was huh
who he who
but mcclane has already jumped up and grabbed the light fixture and now in a gymnasts move kicks out the ceiling hatch and disappears through the roof
x the door opens
the guards there react to the open ceiling
x sam shrugs
claustrophobic i guess
tilt up from a big map of the airport
lots of ad lib brainstorming some of it breaking through some how one reedy hesitant voice cuts through with nothing but confidence guys guys all we have to do is
find a way to transmit x yeah right
somebody run down to radio shack and get a transmitter we have one
the new terminal wing theyre building
twenty airlines when its done
all with their reservation computers all tied into a nice big antenna array so they can talk to their home offices its just sitting there waiting to go on line
thats vhf itll scatter doesnt matter the planes we want to reach are right overhead
i could rig our frequency in minutes
wire in a crossover and were hot
the planes wouldnt even know the difference
get what you need
borrow steal kill
heading for the elevator i want my swat team to go with him as cover
firm tough whatever we can think of they can think of too
he says it like he thought of it himself
then attention tower
you have two more minutes to stack the planes in your inbound pattern over your outside radio marker
after that you will be able
to receive only
any attempt to restore your systems will be met by severe penalties
at the elevator lorenzo pauses stage whispers hes bluffing lorenzo leaves
trudeau aint so sure
damn it you cant do this
i am doing this
pause to barnes put me on all bands
trudeau waits as switches are thrown and then takes the jack from the ear phone he wears and jacks it into a panel
this is dulles approach to all aircraft holding
at potomic vortac
we are experiencing
severe technical problems here
as concerned crews in each listen to our nav and approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute
we want you to continue holding at the outer marker as directed and wait for further instructions
as as soon as were back on line well expedite your landings on a
fuel emergency basis
he turns to a tech face ashen
change the boards
angle on a bank of arrival monitors
already a quarter of the planes are delayed by weather but now in a domino like pattern all the remaining flight data changes to delayed
camera adjusts to show people reacting with frustration and concern
pretty dark and creepy for a place only years old
a flashlight beam pans the lens
we see the two lobby guards as they search the basement
they move away from the camera
mcclane appears in the gloom close to camera clothes now a little greasy and dirty from his little escape
sotto to himself i dont believe this
another fucking elevator
another fucking basement
why does this always happen to me
he moves through the cavernous maze and then reacts to music
moves towards it
and arrives in or something like it here in an area reached only my somebody with a groundhog in his ancestry is a space with some battered chairs a legged
card table a cot made up with faded but neat covers some s vintage
but lovingly scotch taped pin ups and a tiny kitchen precariously propped up on a big purple plumbling valve on the wall
the source of
the music a spinning on the old machine
mcclanes hand picks it up and we widen as he looks at it curiously
a hand reaches for mcclanes shoulder
mcclanes instincts take over in a flash he whirls and his would be attacker is pinned against a wall
its a wizened man in his s who now raises his hands to show he aint looking for trouble
who the fuck are you
in response the man points to the nametag on his coveralls
marvin im marvin
thought you was tryin to steal my records thats all
he moves to them possessively
theyre valuble you know
me i like those old s
wont find me switching like everybody else to these new fangled s
mcclane reacts to that peers at him
youre what the janitor
janitor and proud of it
dont need any of this new fangled custodial engineer crap
just do my job and screw the fancy talk
you know youre not supposed to be down here
just like youre not supposed to be living here
w who said i was living here
mcclane shows his badge
come on marvin
i wasnt born yesterday
carmine lorenzo know you dont go home after you punch out
c come on officer i can barely get by even with my pension
you know im a vet ww
if it wasnt for guys like me you kids be eatin sushi today
im just trying to
save a few
bucks i could
get fired if you tell
mcclane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks
examines it as he speaks
im a veteran myself marvin
and a married one
my wife may be in some trouble upstairs
i gotta find out
this set up of yours
i wont tell a soul
provided you patch me into this panel let me eavesdrop on the tower
what do you say
you a cop or a lawyer
there hasnt been this much activity here since gorbachov dropped in
five swat officers check gear leave the office at lorenzos signal im sending the swat team over for barnes now we dont need the goddamn christmas tourists seeing guns and
flipping out so theyll take him the long way around
we widen as marvin connects them to one set of bolts then another
mcclave shakes his head
through the annex skywalk to the new terminal
that way nobody sees them we dont have any panic
and we dont want any disasters
barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array
aside to marvin christ
theyre gonna try something cute
wheres this annex skywalk
sounds like the pissant worlds fair
he rummages around finds a big wrinkled map smoothes it out
yeah must be this
connects to the new terminal marvin points to an elevated walkway connecting the two complexes
looking at map shit its a fucking bottleneck
anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this
its a perfect place for an ambush
barnes nervous throws things into a metal case
his fellow engineers watch curious as he exits with the five swat cops
camera follows the four men past all of it useless all of the operators watching their only hope barnes
a mound of crinkled papers is flattened against the card table
we widen see it is an architects plans of the entire dulles netherworld cribbed by marvin and now festooned with his various multi color jotes and notes
and heres the skywalk
now check this out
like the japs had all over iwo jima
thats where i got wounded
but we put those little twerps in their place once and for all
pointing to the map these are air ducts for all the terminals
marvin contd so i put you in the boiler room where they start and you come out there
maybe a mile
its a pisser of a crawl
and thats the easy part firs you gotta be an acrobat
with a cordless drill marvin unhinges the access door
last bolt it falls with a sheet metal slam
mcclane winces as a blast of air hits him and as
perspiration breaks out on his forehead we realize its hot air
winter up there
summer down here
he aims marvins flashlight down there isnt enchanted with what he sees
he turns takes marvins map
i owe you one marvin
how about a sixpack of malt liquor
how bout a case of johnny walker
on mcclanes look hey i may be homeless but i aint tasteless
a big history of flight mural high on the wall here half finished ceilings partially open a worker on the scaffold and three others on the floor still hammering and
barnes and the cops come in
barnes looks out the windows here still covered with factory plastic and tape
into his cellular phone were in the annex skywalk
i can see the dish
ill call you as soon as its hot for a protocol test
mcclane moves forward stops immediately
looks up at marvin who grins
hes high above the huge boiler room
the only way across is on a narrow beam
mcclane takes a breath starts across the beam
theres a scary moment at first but he gets quickly confident a bit too confident midway he starts to lose his balance and all but runs to the far end
jumps to safety
as he pulls himself up he hears marvin clapping behind him
with a scowl mcclane checks his map pushes on
barnes and the swat cops run forward get on the slidewalk impatient they run even while on it
reaches into the open slidewalk control panel hits a switch
jerks to a halt the six men n it almost tumbling
oblivious the worker turns his bwck on them again
put that back on
the cop runs forward
swat cop contd hey
what do i look like to you
the man turns
its rei one of the ones who killed the real painters
he ha a gun
o ri llly a sitting dunk
i he shoots him
the other three workers turn and now we see that they are h s eldqn hs ockley and mulkey stuarts soldiers all
as bullets rake the slidewalk and ping off its walls they jump over the railing take cover another cop killed on the move
is cut badly on the arm by flying glass he cringes behind a dumpster while the three remaining cops exchange fire with the four soldiers
bullets hit near his metal case
he takes a deep breath rescues it
in the tunnels he tosses off his sweater into the darkness
underneath his shirt is already sweat stained
and then he hears the gunfire its close
he gets his bearings lunges through a wall of steam a third airport
his partner kills the gunman sj oi k e
y who took out his friend and then hes killed himself
the last swat cop breaks cover and gets cut down
barnes suddenl alizes hes all alone
footsteps approach him
he looks up
ulke is ri ht above him suddenly a ventilation grate by mulke head kicks out sending the guy sprawling
mcclane jump own firing
mu ey has caught the damn thing on reflex and now he twitches bactcwards the bullets sparking off the grate before they drill through him
mcclane rolls fires a reilly across the gallery who takes x cover
then bullets hit all around mcclane he sees mcclane fires upwards and then veering he runs under the scaffolding bullets ping off the metal behind him as aae l tries
to nail him from ground level meanwhile x shelf tries to shoot down and under
x deliberately smashes into the cross bars he passes one after another the smack of his body into them sounding like linebackers in combat aims but then the half of
the scaffolding beneath him gives way
he falls screaming lands with a crunch beside barnes has a moment of satisfaction then oh fuck he runs and dives sideways as the rest of the scaffolding falls towards
him paint and glue and ha f the murals tile grid coming down witwi t
lands hard the plywood boards from the top of the scaffold sweeping him off his feet his gun skitters across the linoleum towards the far end of the slidewalk he
rolls over and sees he too has ducked the falling scaffold but hes already on his feet already bending to grab his dropped mac rom the slidewalk bringing it up aiming mcclane spins on the floor and slams the nearest piece of the metal scaffold into the open slidewalk electronics
it shorts out spectacularly and then it whirrs into high gear tread shredding the slidewalk in overdrive oreilly is flung right over mcclanes head
he slams into the wall at the end of the walkway headfirst
theres a sickening crack as his neck goes and then he twitches and slides to the floor a smear of blood on the slick wall
mcclane takes a long overdue breath
then he picks up his pistol checks thebodies to make sure theres no surprises and goes over to barnes
the antenna array both look at it and then the antenna array outside blows up pieces shattering the glass window
mcclane and barnes duck but theyre too far away to be damanged
something to jerk you off make lorenzo sacrifice his best men and make you waste time
time you dont have
time they dont have
x thornberg on an inside aisle seat glances out the window
releases his seat belt
and goes over to the glass pressing
his nose against it like a kid in a candy store
lights in the sky other airplanes
holly looks at him
she cant help not looking at him hes practically in her lap
i think youre closer than fifty yards
so is that plane
despite herself she looks out
theres quite a few out there were in a regular traffic jam
theres nothing regular about it
i see youre intrigued
thats my gift mrs
i make people curious
dont you mean nauseous
the people have a right to know mrs
you got in the way of that
you endangered my children
and you didnt do it for anything as noble as the people
the only time you see the people is when youre climbing over their backs
mcclane is doing a damn decent field dressing on barnes
into his cellular phone me
but lorenzos x swat team is dead
and the antenna array is toast
start looking for x a new miracle
an eerie alien type voice makes them both jump mcclane raises his gun
its coming from a transceiver beside one of the dead men
curious barnes slides over picks it up
listens with mcclane to the garbled spine chilling noise
i say again annex team
annex team report in
he looks at stuart concerned
here garber no longer sounds human
some kind of scrambler so even if we scan their frequency we cant listen in
descramble mode must activate on this code panel
these guys are pros
so are you
break the code eight numbers thats x x times possible combinations
next time you kill one of these guys get them to enter the code first
kahn descends from the choir loft and joins stuart and grant
sir we just monitored a call from their chief engineer
our people took out their swat team
you were right
they went for the antenna array
were right on schedule
except losing our own team wasnt part of the plan
he comes to a decision
picks up the phone
voice flat firm stern
around and above him his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals
you were warned not to try and restore your systems
they listen fearful youve wasted lives and time on a futile and obvious target
now you have to pay the penalty
they hear this too over barnes cellular tie in to the tower
mcclane grabs it
theres five dead officers here colonel stuart isnt that penalty enough
this interchange is broadcast here lorenzo shouts into the mcclane
keep out of this
you he stops seeing the chilling look trudeau is giving him
has reacted to both the mention of his name and of mcclanes
his brow furrows
policeman hero who saved the nakatomi hostages
i read about you in people magazine
you seemed out of your league on nightline though
we were both famous for five minutes
saw you get shit canned by congress on tv
how much drug money is esperanza paying you to turn traitor
i think cardinal richlieu said it best treason is merely a matter of dates
and this country has to learn it cant keep cutting the legs off men
like general esperanza men with the guts to stand up to soviet agression
and lesson one starts with killing policemen
whats lesson two the neutron bomb
i think we can find something in between
aside off mike give me a flight number one low on fuel
another man hands him a slip of paper
he reads it switches to another mike or frequency
windsor flight one four teen this is dulles approach
do you copy
everyone here reacts to stuarts voice and the chilling lie hes just told in an affable good of boy tone thats totally different than anything weve heard
approach this is one fourteen
where the devil have you been
we been right here old man
but our systems didnt come back on line until just this second
both ashen faced christ helsbringing them youre cleared for approach down
why are they on runway
report to the listening
tower at the outer marker
barnes roger approach and about heartsick time ive got people its our frequency
why up here flying on petrol shouldnt they
the son of a bitch
the replying to pilot goddamn son of a bitch ill bet
okay calibrate your altimeter at setting mcclanes voice two nine nine two
you over to tower
thats the runway between here and the new terminal
he wants to make all of
us watch it
camera pushes in on him as he turns and looks out the window
dont do it
you bastards dont do it
desperate mcclane runs to the spilled paint grabs turpentine rags pieces of scaffolding
what are you doing
whatever the fuck i can barnes
whatever the fuck i can
into cabin mike ladies and gentlemen as youve probably noticed weve started our descent
were sorry about the inconvenience but well all be on the ground in a few minutes
the spent and exhausted people react
some break into applause and cheers of hip hip
but one nice english granny clearly not an experienced air traveler still looks tense
a stewardess pauses to pat her shoulder reassuringly
just like british rail luv
late but we get you there
barnes holds one end of
a painters dropcloth mcclane now wearing barnes coat drops out the broken window to the snow below
there hes a tiny shadow on the white field
he turns runs across the
wind whipped snow quickly hiding him from barnes
off mike to thompson x activate ils landing system
but x recalibrate sea level
p son the main tech here obeys with an unhealthy grin
he punches dials a screen lights up stuart plays with his x mike button to create static as he switches the incoming plane x from the approach operator to the
tower operator both of x course played by him
x the crew reacts as their ils lights up
high fives all around
the sound of engines
cant we cut in jam them everythings dead
theres somebody out there light sizzles in the distance dances
trudeau fumbles up a pair of binoculars
hell get himself killed hes made two torches from wads of fabric wound on the scaffold pieces now he uses his lighter to ignite them
he waves the impromtu flares in a crazy pattern we hear the approaching at the window watching come on see the torch see the everyone watches the dancing lights and
listens to dulles this is windsor one fourteen
inside the outer marker
doing a different voice roger windsor
this is dulles tower
we have radar contact and show you on ils
you are in the glide path and looking good
wait a minute
something down there through the snow
looked like a light
puzzled but covering probably our runway systems coming back up
dont worry about it youre coming in on instruments
now he can hear the planes engines and for a fleeting moment he sees its lights between gusts of snow no
no jesus mary mother of god no
helpless listening watching the lanes lights intermittently visible here too growing closer dropping dropping feet
looking good windsor
watch it theres a knot cross wind and the runways icy atta boy atta four hundred feet two hund suddenly from out of the darkness the crew sees the runway
right l continued he slams controls the plane tilts engines screaming the crew brilliant and skilled but its not enough not enough the nose comes up but a wingtip dips catches the tarmac and thats all it takes the plane flips luggage tumbles in the cabin people scream for a split second we hear the screams of men women children and then all we hear and see is an explosion
as the plane breaks up and flaming debris scatters
behind the plane watching the fireball roll away from him
he gives the scream of an
animal in a trap and falls to his knees
everyone recoils at the explosion which turns this room blood red with reflected light
chunks of metal and plastic boil through the sky
something hits the glass here starring it and smearing it with what we hope is only grease
somewhere sirens wail
silence here too
his men look at him
except for thampsm who clearly enjoyed his part in the above their faces are blank
maybe theyre admiring stuarts incredible coolness
that concludes our object lesson for this evening
if the we requested is ready on time and general esperanza lands unmolested further lessons can be avoided
firemen and medics scramble over a chaos of metal and fabric that used to be an airplane
water everywhere snow melted for a hundred yards around from the explosion
pieces of luggage fragments of peoples lives toys purses books a womans bloody shoe
mcclane weaves through the workers glazed eyes looking at the plane
tower this is rescue three
no x survivors
repeat no surviv he stops looking puzzled at mcclane who is torn bloody
sees the look
relax pal im not a survivor
im just another victim
he grabs the rescue worker by the collar
the last fucking victim hell ever have
val verde military transport night a
esperanza glances at his watch
then with a slight grimace and moan he begins
to massage his chained lower legs with his x cuffed hands
dios los calambres
to his guard muchacho si possible a removar eses
with a grin de donde a yo caminar si
the young guard shakes his head
x desculpe me mi general
no tengo x el permiso
x esperanzas eyes flash for a moment and then he smiles paternally fumbles a cigar out of his breast pocket
bueno joven bueno
tu eres un soldado excelente
ahora en vez del libertad dame un fosforo
flattered the kid lights him up
in the silence since the crash no sounds here except the faint monitoring of the tower and aircraft chatter and the muted audio of a tv
garber breaks the silence
theyve done everything weve anticpated
so far stuart smiles tightly at the unvoiced question
dont worry captain
if this goes into extra innings
well well just call an our man in the other teams locker room
and almost in afterthought he wipes the flight number from the clear glass board
camera pushes to the television
sam coleman is on camera live supered over her face
shes outside on the airfield her news helicopter beside her
in the distance behind barricades we see the crash site
hundreds of people in the terminal heard or saw the crash but still there has been no official word from authorities
meanwhile despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy several dozen airliners are visible from where i stand endlessly circling the field
rumors abound that somehow the accident has interfered with normal landing procedures here
i continued other reports say there were difficulties in the tower before the crash and that they may have even contributed to it
one thing is certain with weather conditions worsening the problem here and in the sky above us will continue to grow
this is samantha coleman at x dulles international airport
phones ringing off the
wall pitiful attempts at damage control
a doctor gives barnes a proper bandage on his cut
mcclane sits dazed on a bench eyes looking at nothing the coffee someone gave him ignored
we have to warn those planes we got a lunatic down here who likes to pretend hes the tower
get up to the cab and get us on the air
on the air
with your goddamn brain
mcclane blinks coming around to reality
you dont have to say anything mcclane
we all know how you feel
ive been a cop years
lost kids to hostages
all of it was
taking care of business
taking care of peoplle
tonight everything i did everything i tried
i never felt so useless
feeling his pain our own swat teams gone
we called the government for help
theyre sending in a special army unit
tactical terrorist team
mcclane sees something else there in his eyes
your wifes plane
as mcclane tenses they keep broadcasting even though we cant answer
theyll run out of fuel in minutes
camera pushes in on mcclane
thornberg at the window again
listen dick that is your name
dick if youre going eo keep getting this close you think you could change aftershaves
a stronger mouthwash would be nice
he glares at her moves down the aisle
he goes into the coach section moves to the row with his news crew
he shakes a sleeping assistant awake
uh yeah what
l continued did you pack the radio mikes from the shoot or put them in your carry on
are you crazy
i wouldnt let those assholes check em i love you
get one of the receivers
puzzled the man pulls his bag from under the seat gets one out
can you tune in the cockpit frequency
i want to hear whats going on
should be on our band
he tunes the mikes receiver monitoring
with an earplug
you just said it would work it is working
but all i get is
the weather recording
like the tower isnt there
camera tightens on thornberg
wheels start spinning
leaving he pats victors shoulder
stay on it
tell me if anything changes
lights in the sky cut through the swirling snow
two army x helicopters dance through the air towards us and set down with a x roar their backwash creating a yukon like storm
x waiting here are trudeau the justice department men we saw earlier lorenzo worried about his status and mcclane plain worried
as the rotors keep turning soldiers and the chopper crews hustle out of the choppers the wind blowing over them and their equipment
a powerfully built major in his late s walks forward past the waiting men like someone in a receiving line
everyone shouts over the noise
were the triple ts
im major grant
i justice man rollins
department of justice
chief of air operations
you want something
you got it
this is it
a dozen men
grant stops looks at him
who are you
oh yeah youre the one who tried to save that plane tonight
you showed some balls out there mcclane
now show some sense and let the pros handle things
unfortunately the pros are on the other side
colonel stuart is one of your boys not any more hes not
to the group gentlemen we are here to take down colonel stuart
and we will take him down
you see i served with him
and i taught him everything he knows
but what if he took some night courses
grant reacts recovers
cto his men all right hustle
command post will be in the airport police office
i want to be tied into the tower and every sysytem thats still working in fifteen minutes
you heard the man troop
gear and weapons get hustled into the building as the choppers trudeau
as he turns did things just get better
barnes huddled with the engineers
big portable lights
we set up on the field and and wait for those lunatics to shoot them out
and where do we get those big portable lights
borrow them from batman
that gets my vote your vote
you voted for dukakis
exasperated to another what about the airphone idea
eighteen planes up there only five have those phones
we got through to three of them still trying with the others
great that leaves thirteen accidents waiting to happen
are they still bucking headwinds
thats eating up most of their fuel
just checked the weather
headwinds slamming right into everybody over the outer marker
the planes with enough fuel were already shunted to suddenly barnes expression changes
the outer marker
on t eir loo s its a beacon right
a radio beacon that sends out this boop boop boop so they know theyre over it right
so who says that radio signal has to be just boop boop boop
we switch the tower freqency over to the one for the beacon and we can talk to the planes and those bas ar s w o did this will never
and as faces brighten for the first time in hours we widen from a tubular electronic device with torn out wires at both ends as it clunks down on a
the second triple t sergeant wipes grease from his hands shows it to the men here
traced the signal found it in the luggage area
theyve been tapped into the tower all night
mcclane and trudeau look at lorenzo who looks away embarassed
the young corporal has set up his radio gear in the receptionists area
now he tunes in that garble
thats all we keep hearing
can you do anything with it
shaking his head if i had a few hours
checking his watch my wife has less than two
i only got transferred in yesterday regular comm man got appendicitis
but word is nobodys better at this than major grant
except colonel stuart
the kid cant answer
then grant appears the man from the justice department in tow
as he moves trudeau
you brief me on that plane he asked for ill fill you in on my orders
in my office
my office meaning lorenzos
lorenzo glowers at that but the little group moves in that direction then the justice guy puts up his hand to block mcclane no civilians
trudeau looks at mcclane sympathetic and then the door shuts
the navigator suddenly sits upright at his phones
what the fuck what is it
the outer marker beeper
its not beeping
and saying this he turns up a dial tention all aircraft in dulles landing pattern
this is chief engineer leslie barnes
d i have been authorized to brief you in full
at this time this is the only channel available to us
here is the situation
approximately hours ago between business class and coach
grinning victor pulls thornberg through the curtain pokes an earplug into thornbergs ear
we tighten on him
the terrorists have cut all our systems and now have control of everything except this channel
holy shit we we gotta get this on tape victor grins
and pulls a microcassette recorder from his shirt pocket
it is already jacked into the receiver and turning
thornberg all but cackles
we believe this channel is secure but your own transmissions are not
do not repeat do not attempt to reply on your own frequencies to this broadcast
these people have already caused one crash by impersonating jesus
holly looking suspiciously at the little piece of the two men still visible
barnes is using a telephone which is jury rigged with some electronic lines
into a telephone repeat do not accept any instructions claiming to be from our tower unless you hear your own flight recorder access code
we will get this from your respective airlines and use it for confirmation
where thornbergs expression is like a man having sex
repeat the terrorists have cut off the two systems that can allow you to land the field lights for a manual landing and the ils for an instrument one
a special us army unit is already here and preparing to take out the terrorists
camera tightens on thornberg orgasm
tight on a cracked mirror
marvin is checking himself out in a nice long topcoat which has unfortunately recently been covered with grease and grime not to mention the bullet holes
camera adjusts as mcclane comes in
thought youd be upstairs by now hanging out with the top brass
they kind of busted me down to buck private
i know that feeling
interested in a nice coat
the linings ripped and it needs some invisible mending
think you can get me on line upstairs again
marvin chuckles moves over to a table and pulls aside a cloth
all electronic stuff there
i was just a kid working those radios on the b s
but i kept up
still read popular mechanics
these transistor things im on top of em marvin realizes that mcclane hasa funny expression
you okay son
mcclane stares at the table
and one of the scrambled transceivers one with a green l
stuart is in the pulpit his men attentive
weve pussied out around the world over and over again
we drop the shah fuck marcos throw noriega overboard
you know what they think around the globe
the worst thing that can happen to you is to have america as a friend
and now that stain head gorbachov hes got some nice english suits and a wife without gold teeth so now the commies are nice
gentlemen we are soldiers and we do not believe in fairy tales sweet though they may seem
well tonight the pattern ends
the dominos will fall no more and the ramparts will remain upri ca ing out
general esperanzas plane just came on the scope
stuart hurries up into the choir loft camera adjusting
he takes up the phone
attention dulles tower
i am lighting up a runway now
do not repeat do not attempt to land any planes
remember i am monitoring you
and now like magic one distant runway twinkles on
almost immediately the chatter from the sky picks up questions
what do we do
dulles tower to fm i
dulles tower to fm
this is fm dulles
we read you
you are to come in on runway fifteen x repeat runway fifteen
by now the camera is in the rear cabin
just in time to see esperanza strangle the nice young corporal with the chain from his handcuffs
he lets the body drop nice and soft so it doesnt make a sound
taking the handcuff key from the body he frees himself
x mcclane is examining the scrambler excited
the codes still punched
where did you get this
came with the coat over near the luggage belts
looks like one of them japanese radios
cant hold a candle to a nice zenith if you ask me
you like it huh
how about twenty dollars
how about i let you live
handing it over
man knows how to bargain
dulles this is contrary to our instructions
we are to land on runway one and be met by representitives of your justice he stops
hes seen esperanza who has come into the cockpit holding the corporals pistol
capitain please tell the tower you will proceed as ordered
proceeding to runway suddenly the co pilot leaps for esperanza
esperanza whirls shoots twice one shot kills him but one shatters and wind and snow thunder inside like a wall
everyone has reacted to the shot and noise and now another tilt up from the pilots body on the floor already flecked with esperanza is at the controls trying to
see through the swirling whirlwind
cursing he flies with one hand with the other he reaches up and feels above the radio panel for something he expects to be there and it is one of
the distinctive eagle nest this is falcon
eagle nest this is falcon
they hear the garbled alien sound stuart is startled to hear this but grabs his transceiver go ahead falcon repeat i have lost cabin pressure
x near zero visibility
i must drop out of the storm
i can land but i must land now on the first outgoing runway
repea i cannot circle around to runway fifteen
mcclane listens grinning
he takes the airport map from his pocket hands it the marvin
you show me a shortcut to runway fifteen and you got yourself a liner for that coat
he snaps his fingers
someone produces a map points out nodding into roger falcon
that would be
eleven west its a straight run from the ocean as he descends from the eye of the storm the snow in the cockpit abates a bit
now we can see the airfield and the illuminated runway which is perpendicular to the plane
thank you for telling me eagle nest
but if you could show it to me as well i would be grateful
in the church stuart grins at esperanzas coo
a switch is thrown
the first runway goes off and a new runway lights up directly in front of the plane
what the fuck happened to fifteen
fumbling with the map up to my ass in fucking terrorists again
i gotta start reading my goddamn horoscope
his finger moves along the runway to the code numbers
eleven w w bingo
camera pushes to the whits wall numbers here w
an arrow indicates access grid
eagle nest do you copy
im coming down now
we copy falcon
well have you in five minutes
not if i can help it asshole
he turns and begins running down the tunnel
he tosses the command mike to one of his men throws a weapon over his shoulder and leads garber thompson and kahn in a rush x out the rear door
reactions as the previous lit runway goes dark and a different wincing against the blowing snow and wind the general expertly trims his descent
he reaches for a co pilots control and sweeps the dead man to the floor bites down on his cigar
the plane begins to vibrate but he humms to himself
hes the scum of the earth
but one hell of a pilot
mcclane breathless reaches the ladder
the grid above him is bigger than a doorway made of heavy industrial steel
x isee your lights
mcclane checks his pistol clip with a snap
come to poppa you son of a bitch he flies up the ladder and bruises his shoulder against the locked grid
their breath clouding inside the still cold jeep as it bounces along
garber shines a flashlight into the falling snow illuminates a snow covered runway number sign eight west
the miltary plane roars overhead
mcclane shoots off the lock apparatus of the grid
a ricochet pings off one of the grids hydraulic hinges and mcclane winces as metal splinters sail by
then he begins to muscle the heavy grid upwards
a field of snow and ice
but now a black rectangle emerges from it its the tunnel grid snow falling through it the damn thing must weight over pounds mcclane gets his head and shoulders up
looks at about to hit the runway mcclane pushes upwards grunts when he shifts his grip his skin rips on the cold metal with a grimace he pushes his rifle
out starts to follow the damaged hydraulic hinge suddenly snaps with a squish of thick fluid
the pound grid thuds down on mcclanes back
he groans stunned
screeches down on the runway
a mcclane dazed trapped he looks up and sees b the plane mile away coming right towards him c mcclane struggling still pinned to the runway like a bug in
the natural history museum
now we hear the roar of the
jets engines d the plane mile away e mcclanes feet still in the tunnel they grope for leverage on the steps and slip
now they kick away at air its
coming coming coming
desperate mcclane sees that part of the rifle is half under the grid
now he puts all his energy into levering the rifle against the steel
slowly slowly sweat breaking out on his forehead he levers the rifle higher and higher the rifle in turn levering the grid upward an inch at a time finally its
high enough for him to jam the rifles bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole
mcclane dives out of the hole
mcclane rolls away from the wheels which miss him by inches
the plane smacks into the half open grid which goes flying the plane hardly dented the rifle snapping like a toothpick the scrambler crunching like a bug mcclave kisses asphalt
winces at the scorch of jet exhaust five feet over his head
skids roughly to a stop a hundred yards away
mccl ane gets to his feet sucks in air and heads for the plane
close enough to see the plane as it stops there
esperanza secures the controls moves to the doorway and spins the wheelock
it opens with a hiss and the steps drop down
x r continued breathing deeply x freedom
mcclanes fist smacks in knocking esperanza back from the door
mcclane comes up the steps gun leveled at the startled fugitive
thought youd pull this off didnt you
i guess you didnt count on me being here
actually i didnt count on me being here
w who are you
just a cop whos spent half his career busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers
looks like its business as usual
think this will look good on my record
suddenly bullets ping on the hatch inches from mcclanes head
ncclane dives and rolls into the cabin fires twice out the door and then almost on instinct whirls esperanzas snatched up the rifle from the dead corporal but x mcclanes
shot hits him in the shoulder
with a howl esperanza falls backwards but hangs on to the gun
garber and another man are there rifles up mcclane fires blowing a hole in h m so throat and as x garbers slugs come closer mcclane ives into the cockpit
bullets smacking all around him from garber and esperanza mcclane slams the door behind him locks it
bullets ping into the door which indents from the hits which dont penetrate it
garber helps esperanza down the steps
stuart runs to him
indicating the wound im all right he said he was a policeman
a policeman push to stuart
he knows which policeman
he went in the cockpit hes going to hell
mcclane reacts to the
two dead men sharing the tiny space with him
the snow and glass everywhere
and then he crawls to the door gingerly tries it
it wont move
he tries harder
a rescue axe is across the door like a barricade
mcclane looks worried and then mcclane
i assume its you mcclane
x stuart esperanza and two of the others ring the nose of the plane weapons out
garber the last man comes up delayed by locking mcclane in the cabin
youre ite a little soldier
so consider this a mi itary unera and he opens fire
the others instantly join in
mcclane ducks as five machine guns begin to rip the place apart
whats left of the glass implodes and ricochets begin slamming around the room mcclane eats floor but the snaking lines of bullets criss cross the cockpit searching him out glass
rakes his forehead blood misting his vision he crawls n to the door throws his weight against it nothing having decimated the front of the plane stuart signals and now they flank the sides
whats left of the window glass reflects their fire like a fourth of july show esperanza alone smiles as he shoots hes hit in the left hand
how many grenades we have
pop pop pop
each man pulls two pins throws then they run for their jeep carrying the body of their comrade x clunk clunk clunkclunk
ten grenades land and bounce here like hailstones from hell
mcclane rolls over and suddenly sees camera pushes to it eject
in one move vaults into the seat snaps on the belt grabs the with a woosh and a roar the ejection seat rockets upwards the steel vanguard above mcclanes head
punching through whats left of the canopy
the cockpit explodes
its all so fast and eye searing were not sure if mcclane is clear but then we see no sound now just the whoosh of the air going past the
ejection seat is tumbling whomp
the chute opens with violent yank
he drops from frame
at the jeep stuart and his men react as water from melting snow x runs past their feet
garber points to the ghostly image of the chute half a mile away but stuart turns at the sound of sirens
the calvary is coming
and its not his
fall back to the church
x helping the wounded esperanza they vanish into the darkness
billowing as something struggles under it
wheres the fucking door
he staggers out from under the yards of silk covered in snow fights the vertigo from his flight runs off
the stewardess sticks her head into the cockpit
theyre getting pretty squirrely back there
in fact so am i
were right over washington
see if you can get any tv
thatll settle em down
works for me
ill she stops
shes seen almost on empty she reacts
no one says anything
she composes herself
holly types a line on her computer
then she reacts to the x sound of crumpled paper
camera adjusts as she looks at thornberg
hes listening to the tape recording with an earplug and then drafting his own document
he crosses out a line adds a word looks at it proudly
x sotto to himself boy am i good
writing your acceptance speech for the video sleaze awards
i continued in odd good humor try pulitzer mrs
but now that stewardess reaches up and turns on the tv projector
as the lights darken thornberg decides this is perfect cover
pretending hes getting a blanket overhead he slips his credit card in one of airphones
then he moves down the aisle phone i inside his jacket
sir please we may be landing at any moment the seat belt light is i im going to be sick he makes a croaking noise to sell it stumbles into
dials then this is richard thornberg
put me through to the news director
i know hes getting ready for the broadcast thats why i want him
now get him or start typing your resume
the doctor patches mcclanes right hand one of the soldiers gives mcclane a cigarette
but hes hurt
i killed one more man
thats six x theyve lost all together
maybe if we knew how many they had to start with we could get excited
but if they got fifty guys its a little early to break out the x champagne
mcclane we dont need a loose cannon on this deck
what if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt
r last i heard they cant do that again
and if i grabbed esperanza the situation would be over
maybe theyre more creative than you think
mcclane were here to jerk off that cocksucker until he tries to take off period
this time youre the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time
mcclane stands glares at the two officers
he flips away the cigarette walks away pissed
the story of my life
but the enlisted men seem sympathetic
and so does who now pulls mcclane aside
you said they showed up there right away
that means theyre on the field or close i think i know where
interested mcclanefollows barnes around the corner
barnes unfolds some
these are the old plans when the longer runways went in
thats twelve years ago
and it looks like they did some modifications on site
moved tracon phone ils all the underground stuff so they could handle drainage
if im right all of it would run along the edge of the airport property and go right past this neighborhood
continued so if they know this too they could be sitting around the fireplace and hanging their fucking stockings in one of these houses
well seventy eighty per cent five percent either way are you sure or not
i was sure about tying into the antenna array
and i got five officers killed
you didnt do that you did your i had a choice and i made it
but those cops didnt have a choice and neither do those soldiers now
im an engineer mcclane
its supposed to a wires and circuits
iron and steel
not flesh and blood
if im wrong again
i dont want anyone else to get orders that could get them killed
after a moment then how would you feel about a volunteer
the passengers patience has begun to frazzle
the older woman beside holly is no exception
somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess thats for sure
its hard to blame anyone for the yeah
what about that porker willard scott
i shoulda taken the bus
at least they can pull over for food and gas
i reacts to what the womans said
as the stewardess passes holly signals her rises halfway to meet her
was just wondering
our flight was only supposed to
be hours x do we have enough fuel for all this endless circling
the stewardess face eases into an official smile
oh of course we do
they anticipate little proems like this
she moves away
we tighten on holly
shes chilled by the lie
worried she turns
looks at the airphone
x his beeper shows as he climbs something we widen
he and barnes are outside a house that backs up to the airport
both peer over the fence
its a modest dc suburban tract job
people trim a tree
it could be norman rockwell
these people are hanging their goddamn stockings
they drop down into the snow crunch to the next fence
look no tree people having dinner a menorah burning on the windowsill
and these people arent
i a new angle a theyve come to a corner now they go back to the street spread barnes map out on the hood of barnes still humming car
far behind them we see the illuminated airport tower centered in the dark blot that should be brightly active runways
barnes reaches inside his jacket fumbles in his jammed plastic pocket thingie for a little flashlight
he checks the map
four more possibles
and a church
they cross the intersection on foot walk over a lawn
its further to the next place more prosperous yard
suddenly mcclane puts up his hand barnes stops both look at baker is walking almost casually around the rear of the house
mcclane and barnes huddle whisper
could be a sentry and he could just be out for a walk then why is he going over his own footprints
indeed gars steady progress has made a trench around the church property and the distinctive print of his galoshes now makes double images
get ready to call the marines
i thought they were army
who the fuck cares just be ready
saying this mcclane takes his own gun from his holster and puts it in the back of his trousers
then moves off
barnes takes out a cellular phone lurks under a tree
moves from shadow to shadow and tree to tree like an indian i stalking a settler
holly drops her credit card in the airphone
starts to dial
baker is only a yard away
closer closer and then beep
x instantly whips his head around the hidden mac coming up but e he winter outerwear slows him
dives on him
x reacts begins to dial the phone
reacts to the dial reads no svc
he raises the antenna realizes hes got to move runs towards the street
crash into the fence with a crack
mcclane ha baker gun x hand and slams it down on the fence n again blood wells the gun drops ker ow taking mcclane away x from the weapon they
trade bru unches through the rear window here we see the fence give and bend x again but the sound is muffled by the wind and the glass
lorenzo writes as grant reacts youre where you crazy idiot why didnt you hes down the block standing on a snow covered car just get here
this is it move your fat ass will ya
grant signals his sergeant and then its like d day as all the soldiers and some cops hustle out halfway to their feet the snow bloody between them s ke
x karate kicks mcclane back into a tree dazing him baker jumps x in rips mcclanes coat open and grabs for the holster
as his hand comes up empty mcclane grins head butts him
airport police cars and the army truck skid around a corner soldiers on the benches grant standing rocking like a commuter telford only one unarmed still monitoring the radio gentlemen
a situation here
click click snap
ammo clips are broken out all piggybacked like combat hardened troops do it two banana clips taped together with blue tape
x baker yanks a combat knife from his boot anddives on mcclane bo i hit the wall of the churchs detached garage snow and ice fall from the roof but
both men ignore it mcclanes left hand cant force awai akers right hand and the knife
the bastard is strong and now his left jumps out and pins mcclanes right so it cant help the knife creeps towards mcclanes throat
mcclane is fucke and then his desperate eyes look at something nearby we focus change its a big icicle with his last strength mcclane
breaks out of bakers grip grabs the icicle and stabs it right in bakers eye
baker screams and falls back mcclane rolls with him and with both hands presses the icicle home six more inches right into the son of a bitchs brain
the body twitches dies
mcclane falls against the garage as the snow turns crimson all around
catches his breath
and then reacts to a whistle
is in the street
moving in a crouch mcclave heads towards him
barnes points to their truck far down the street they move forward silently and expertly shadows starting to surround the church
grant and lorenzo come over
mcclane what the hell do you think youre doing playing john wayne
howd you like to spend the rest of the night in a cell shut the fuck up and do something useful
seal off the street
you cant talk to me like that oh no carmine
bureaucrat out of mr
with pleasure sir
i and lorenzo is hustled away
mcclane takes out a cigarette
i was wrong
youre not an asshole
i lighting him up no you were right
im just your kind of asshole
flanking the church now sir
x close up the back then we go in
fire only on my order
mcclane and barnes watch as the soldiers start to close the net
moves forward on the lawn into a prone firing position and then his gun muzzle hits a trip wire in the snow
stuarts men react to and alarm instantly go to assigned jobs
some grab weapons others
smashthe equipment here
esperanza bandaged throws a coat on grabs a pistol
everyone dives for cover as a stained glass window is broken and x a rifle pokes out
gunfire lights up the street reflects on the snow
gentlemen you know what to do x j i continued looks all around all change their ammo clips putting ones with blue adhesive tape into their weapons and then they
retreat tr om the front windows
we pan them out the rear and to the fence behind the church which they smash through
taking cover behind a parked car he hears the sound of fuck
and hes on his feet firing his pistol here outclassed by the assault rifles grant signals his men they follow mcclane rush the church there is no more fire from
front some of the men smash through the doors others run alongside the church stuart leads his men and esperanza towards what looks like bushes about
yards behind it but as m
ar and r reach them and grab at fabric we realize it is a snow camouflaged tarpulin
mcclane is first here ducks as gunfire erupts ahead of him then he fires at the muzzle blasts in the darkness then reacts to the sound of gasoline motors as
stuart and esperanza and the remaining men escape on hidden snowmobiles
mcclane fires twice at the garber is on it mcclanes bullets rip through his chest as he falls off it spins out rolls over
the airport police crash in behind the tailing soldiers
barnes looks at the smoking ruins
it could land our dont touch it
there were trip wires outside they
could have they did
camera rakes to the sergeant who is by a blinking booby trap hidden under a panel
got one here too looks like c and the mother fucker is primed evacuate
the soldiers and barnes rush out bowling over lorenzo just as hes heading in
as all dive into the snow the church explodes stained glass windows givingthedestruction an eerie beauty as they shatter as debris rains down everyone struggles to their feet
lorenzo spits out snow looks around
where the fuck is mcclane
hes riding the snowmobile that cracked u carrying the dead mans assault rifle like the duke on a horse
hes coming up on the rear of the other vehicles
big bounce over a mogul
as the mobile settles mcclane pulls the rifle forward
he steadies it alongside the windshield of the snowmobile
we see stuarts head
this is for flight one fourteen mother fucker he fires
but he looks back at the sound of shots
hand signals his flanking riders
two of them peel off kan riding double with esperanza vax x riding alone
burke swttfches ammo clips to a red taped clip
he aims at the approaching snowmobiles fires again untouched
now as he sweeps past esperanza fires his mcclane ducks as bullets blow out his windshield
he swerves and theres the other snowmobile that turned
burke fires x on full auto riddled with bullets mcclanes snowmobile careens out of control goesairborne mcclane tumbles from the seat and the mobile explodes against a runway wind register
he looks back at the mini fireball signals his men to regroup
all dwindle in the landscape of the empty airfield
mcclanes hand comes into view
face bloodied by glass jacket ragged body bruised he should be looking for x a doctor
instead hes pawing through the snow looking for the assault rifle
and finds it the stock broken
mcclane pulls off the clip
he peels off a round into his hand then another
theres paper wads where brass should meet lead
paleing he rummages in the snow finds one of the soldiers backpacks
more clips inside
first clip has live ammo
second clip blanks camera pushes in on mcclane until he looks at the red blue tape and makes the connection
oh my god
to his feet and runs
this is colonel stuart
is our plane prepared
stuart and his men on foot near the halted snowmobiles
light in the distance hangers the terminal
its in hanger eleven
x thats the most remote building weve got
stuart looks at his map then the hanger mentioned not far
were on our way
if theres another attempt to stop us like the one you just made i will fire several stinger missiles into your terminal
do i make myself clear
please have a ground crew there to confirm the planes condition
x the army trucks are parked by the still intact church garage
in the b
fire fighters spray down the smoking ruin ice forming and sparkling everywhere
grant uses the field radio telford has set up in the back of the truck
youre quite capable of confirming it yourself colonel
please dont ask us to gift wrap potential hostages for you
if you remember me colonel youll remember i know the drill as well as you do
check out your own fucking plane
we move out in five minutes
body armor for everyone full metal jackets
we will take them in the hanger or we will shoot that fucking plane out of the sky
lorenzo take your men back to the airport and seal off every exit in case anyone tries to break out on the ground
you got it
a chaotic meeting of news staffers the producer waves for quiet hovers over a speaker phone
dick this is nuts first you do siamese twin drag queens not hard news and second every station in i town has people out at the airport and none of
them has heard even a whisper of this shit youre running well none of them is me
you want proof
try this and he plays the microcassette
we hear barnes earlier in the tv station stunned reaction
i want you to go live now
key me in from the files a publicity shot whatever connies got one
and a map steal one from weather were on it were on it were cutting in in five minutes
tell the affiliates if they want in they got three minutes to shout
network here we come
local police keep curious neighbors behind barricades while soldiers get ready at the trucks
i was in grenada he says
all laugh the bitter laughter of the battlefield
grenada five minutes of firefight five weeks of surfing
laughter which subsides a bit as grant looks at his watch
a look duplicated by the others
oblivious to this i wish i was with you guys for that
so do we kid
then we wouldnt have to do this
and in a flash grant draws his combat knife and slits the kids throat
telford flops back off the bench
grant is already digging into x the cargo pocket of his trousers and he comes out with a transceiver the same distinctive scrambled transceiver used by stuarts men
eagle nest this is hatchling
on schedule and in place
stuart holds his transceiver while he looks up at the plane prepared for him
one of his men comes out gives him the thumbs up sign
we are secure here
you have a green light
repeat green light
whistling stacking dolls shoes more flotsom from the airport sea hes scavenged
at a sound he turns x shivering battered trying to come down a ladder
he falls the x rest of the way
close the back of the truck they drive away
lorenzo getting x in his car gives them a thumbs up
y j grant grinning returns it
x a sports event is superceded by a special bulletin card
camera pans and we see were in a bar in the coming on screen this is a special bulletin from wzdc x news
there was a plane crash earlier this evening at dulles where other aircraft continue to circle with no explanation from airport or faa officials
now with an exclusive kla report here is dick thornberg reporting from the skies over washington
that gets all the sports fans attention
now a super of i th rnbergs face comes up in the corner of the newsroom
im one of the thousand people who has been circling our nations capitol under the assumption that whatever problem was going on far below me was a normal one
but the truth is far from normal the truth is terrifying
people walking along
and then jumping out of the way of x marvin drives happy as hell beside him in the seat usually x reserved for the sick or elderly is mcclane slowly
coming back to normal from his ordeal
this is a recording of a conversation between dulles tower and the captive aircraft overhead
with a smug smile thornberg plays the tape again
the people listen as the tape of barnes earlier broadcast plays
the golf cart skids to a halt at the receptionists desk
lorenzo comes thundering out of his office
are you out of your fucking mind
this mans been through serious shit give him a break who the fuck are you
pointing to his marvin the janitor
dont need that
custodial enginner crap grant the terrorist team where are they
they left to shoot those bastards out of the sky theyre not gonna do that theyre gonna get on the same goddamn plane and leave with him
before the army canned him stuart must have loaded that unit with his own guys but that firefight at the house a side show to jerk us off buy them
youre completely around the fucking bend mcclane
and you know what else
reaching for handcuffs youre under arrest mcclane steps back raises the assault rifle fires
j i i new angle lorenzo staggers back in shock and then realizes hes wha how showing the clip these are the bullets they used out there tonight
holy shit this is chief lorenzo
i want every officer recalled now and assembled in body armor with full weaponry in the motor pool in five minutes
its time to kick ass
he slams the phone down checks his pistol ammo and rushes out the door a startled and appreciative mcclane beside him
as the tape recording concludes the patrons are in shock
already several begin to run out
camera pans away from the terminal bar towards a gift shop
there all the portable tvs on display are broadcasting the same thing
a customer hearing this drops a crystal vase
as tape ends since then this reporter has learned that the terrorists have virtual control of the entire airport a fact the authorities have suppressed
the terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met and now that special army commandoes have arrived at the airport the liklihood of a full scale and deadly battle
is dangerously close suddenly full of screaming people
a mass exodus
people fight for cabs
i t int
cab theyre watching this here too
christ that fucking asshole mcclane is in lorenzos police car a dozen other police cars full of officers behind lights spinning
lorenzo leans out the window like ward bond on wagon train
converge on hanger on all four sides
when the city blues get here with their backup they can pick up the pieces
aside to mcclane mcclane you meet my nephew
the other guy in the car is the asshole who towed the car
as mcclane reacts the caravan roars forward sirens wailing and lorenzos car smashes into a taxi
camera cranes up and we see that the police cars have run smack into the panic in the front of the airport
shouting barking orders move that piece of shit
henderson get some crowd control
goddamn it clear the area
mcclane jumps out of the car looks around and sees thru omitted thru watching the scene trying to get it on video
widen from the tv screen
thornbergs broadcast is here too
a woman screams
a man tries to get out of his seat and a steward forces him back
as it sinks in x my god
then something else sinks in she looks at the empty airphone cradle on the wall gets quickly out of her seat in mid stride she stops takes her seatmates purse
then she sidesteps some panicked people goes to the kitchen area
and finds one of the special keys for the lavatories
and so it continues a standoff between terrorists and authorities with the lives of thousands at stake
but at least this time in this place the truth at least is not among the hostages because richard x thornberc put his life and his talent x on the
line for humanity and country
x behind him holly silently opens the lavatory door
and if this should be my final wham
she zaps him with the old ladys taser
he twitches drops
she picks up the phone
x amen to that asshole
into phone sweetly were sorry but mr
thornberg is experiencing electrical problems
we now resume our regular programming
mcclane sam and the cameraman forcing their way through the crowd sam absorbing what mcclanes told her
you give me this story ill have your baby
thanks but im looking for a different kind of ride
and he points to across the tarmac thru omitte thru stuart and his a n d at doors on high scaffolds to look out at the landing field hidden in
the driving snow
stuart looks at his watch
here on watch
something gleams in the distance
he sps into his radio truck lights
i weapons are cocked soldiers muscles coil into scrambled radio hatchling report in
what is your position
my position is im gonna get my ass reamed out by the best goddamn soldier on the planet cause im two minutes late
stuart grins signals for the hanger door to be opened
the big door rumbles upwards
theres the truck headlights now illuminating the waiting plane
grant jumps down from the cab gets a warm greeting from stuart in the headlight beams
grant salutes him then pivots to salute esperanza
congratulations on your escape sir
thank you major
save them until we are all safe and excuse a left handed salute eh
as the men gather my congratulations gentlemen
youve won a victory for democracy
my pride and admiration
and a kick ass vacation
get on board
with a cheer they run up the stairs to the plane
up and off the ground like an elevator
too rough for you cowboy
i dont like flying
then what are you doing here
i like losing worse
the abandoned trucks lights still glare into the camera and then something shadows them the taxis out of the hanger rolls towards the runway
the soldiers take seats cocky smiles on their faces mcclane and the others fly along listening to the continuing apirplane and tower traffic which is growing panicky
hanger eleven shit
f l the hanger below them night the plane
in a slow wide turn the hanger empty light spilling into the snow sam taps the cameraman whos already on the case
get em to stop
hover low block their path
play chicken with a ton plane
hey im crazy but not that crazy dulles this is western one forty request clearance on first available runway
repeat request emergency negative one fourteen our
situation is unchanged
well mine just changed goddamn it
were down to fumes and we have to land
and in five minutes were coming in one way or another
to the pilot thats my wifes plane goddamnit
im still not getting in front of it
pause mcclane furious but the pilot equally tough
okay then how about on top of it
i continued and as both men realize theyve cut a dangerous deal andstart to smile we x the pilot and co pilot look at each other as their fuel gauge
beeps and flashes yellow
ladies and gentlemen
our situation is critical
the cabin attendants are lugging thornbergs unconscious body down the aisle
they strap him in as holly and the others listen chilled to we have no choice but to attempt an emergency landing
please put on your safety belts and assume crash positions as instucted by the cabin attendants
ihru omitted thru engines glowing through the snow x turning dropping the door slides open mcclane slips out x takes a deep breath and moves to the skid
x diving diving yea though i walk through the valley of death to her amazement she hears another voice mumbling tearfully
its thornburg half conscious
i i didnt mean any harm i just wanted ratings i had to do it it was sweeps week the taxis along camera pans back and discovers the chopper mcclane
on its skid as it drops lower matches speed with the pane
esperanza stuart grant
starting to feel like what they think they are heroes
knocking some off ive had enough fucking snow for a lifetime
they dont get much of it in the tropics
mcclane sitting on the skid now drops to a handhold as the skids come treacherously close to the plane wing
mcclanes feet grope for the wing surface but the two aircraft one still earthbound move apart
mcclave tries again makes it peels away vanishes in the snowstorm
panting he wedges himself against an engine pod and starts to take off his jacket
esperanza lights a cigar and then frowns
somethings wrong we cant take off he looks out the window and reacts to hydraulics groaning because mcclane is jamming his jacket into the groove where it hinges
they cant fucking believe this
then i ill do him
following to esperanza you just get us in the air general
youre the only one who can do it
stuart and grant cock their weapons move to the door
grant opens it
grant stands there wind whipping him
no mcclane just the jacket flapping in the groaning aerilon
grant starts out wham
mcclane appears from behind the door trips him
grants gun bounces off the wing falls to the ground rushing past below
in the doorway tries to aim but are indistinguishable in the driving snow
each holding on to the wing with one hand fighting with the other grant pounds away on mcclanes face but mcclane doesnt hit back he just grins like a maniac
pushes grant pushes pushes r continued through his teeth as too bad mcclane the sound of metal sliding a knife appears in grants hand i really liked you too late he realizes hes over the front edge of the wing
he screams and falls right into the engine intake
theres an awful grinding sound a scream mcclane winces as red snow splatters him it could be hamburger pouring out but before we can dwell on it the engine pod
wipes red snow from his arm
i like you better dead
a fire indicator goes on
esperanza hits extinguisher handles it increases power to the other engines
trying to see finally a glimpse of what has to be mcclane with a savage grin stuart takes off his rifle discards the bulky coat knife in hand he steps
moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing
looks over and down at he reaches for it
gets it fucker is tight
wincing he turns it a bit then looks up just in time to see stuart knife whizzing down mcclane rolls but the knife catches his shoulder
in pain he manances to kick stuarts knee stuart falls almost goes over the wing mcclane goes back to work on the fuel port it turns another turn and then
he has to abandon it to deal with another charge from stuart
he turns the plane
now hes on the runway proper
fighting for the knife
all his strength mcclane jams stuarts knife hand the aerilon crack
the next wiggle of the metal crunches both hand and knife
stuart screams and loosens his grip on mcclane who punches him away goes back to work on the fuel port
but hes hardly at it when stuart recovers and mangled hand held clawlike kicks mcclanes injured shoulder kicks again blood on stuarts shoe mcclane is being worked over the edge
of the wing
he catches at the last moment now he ignores stuarts blows because mcclane feels for the fuel port turn turn it opens
fuel spigots down mcclane feels the wetness on his hand a ribbon of fuel twists behind the moving plane slick and light stuart stomps on mcclanes hands on the wing
crunch stomps again mcclane smiles and then stuart kicks him off the wing
drops feet slams into the snow at the edge of the runway bounces like litter thrown from a moving car the big rear tire almost rolls over him with a
victorious shout he yanks the coat from the aerilon throws it away heads for the door sees this smiles crawls to a painful sitting position
face impassive he watches the jet move away
and incongrous as it seems he lights a cigarette looks off at x running along the runway for mile now battered like a car wreck victim now he looks up
into the dark sky trying to find the sound of jet engines
then he sees careening down in a desperate fight against gravity mcclave takes a long pull on the cigarette until the tip is about to close it he looks back
and for the first time sees winding endlessly down the runway hey colonel happy fucking new year
and he throws the cigarette into the fuel
sees the flame racing towards him turns to shout to esperanza responds to the cry guns it x starts to rise the wheels go into the air x j j
b rear of plane b but as the craft rises so does the flame climbing the fuel ribbon right into the sky and to the nearest engine which turns at the explosion in time for a wall of fire that shoots up the wing and through the cockpit floor and then hes on fire is blown to little pieces as a fireball blows right out the door
taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then it explodes itself wings and tail and body going nine different directions
dives for the ground as the explosion rolls towards him
they watch the fireball in the distance gets to his knees and looks at the huge conflagration
towards the sky honey
theres your landing lights
blackness and driven snow outside and then in an almost cinematic fade through the glass we see the burning wreckage and more importantly the line of fire running clean and
straight for almost a mile a line right along the runway
the pilot grabs controls desperately trims the plane the passengers react as they level a bit it descends a bit erratic but now its alongside the line of fire coming
in from the wrong end of the runway and then the wheels bounce once twice and then a tire blows but the pilots x hold it as it swerves and finally skids to a halt turning onto x the grassy field
already we hear rescue sirens
listening to headset one forty is down
they used the fire to see i they used the fucking fire to see
they can all do that lets tell they already know
and sure enough there it is the sound of engines and now the lights come down from the sky in a neat and patient row the closest filling the screen
the others dwindling down to the size of stars
stumbles along maybe thinking hes dead or dreaming
ignoring the giant plane landing beside him ignoring the flames beyond that his concentration is totally on hollys plane now another giant plane skids down behind him its an assembly
line like b s coming home from war then he sees what hes praying for breaks into a run holly holly holly
hears this just as she goes down the rescue chute ushed by stewardess controlling their own tears catches her at the bottom like a child carries her away
groggy he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess
she steps over him puts her high heels back on walks off
it crunches down on the frozen earth near the runway
sam and her cameraman hit the ground running
see embracing and then shes nursing his wounds hearing his story the cameraman brings up his lens
god thats beautiful yeah
it sure is
and she yanks out his power cord watches it dreamily
as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers pour down the steps into arms of friends families loved ones
sets holly down kisses her then both turn at a honk
marvin is there in an airport cart
he looks at the chaos
damned if im cleaning up this mess
mcclane and holly get in the cart
marvin drives them away light blinking
and we pullback until mcclane and holly are just part of the crowd
