ward aaron latham allright bowl bid ridin here for e
fourth down on the georgia tech
kane sets em down
smashing into the mud as a football offensive line comes set frosted breath steaming across to the defensive line digging in ready to explode
quarterback barking signals
the ball is snapped and we go to slow motion as the lines crash together in the slop
joe rolls to the right looking downfield
a huge defensive end bears down on him
the end whips on by grabbing for jersey slipping off
but big number is closing the gap
on the run joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone just as catches him and buries him face down in the swamp
we follow the ball spiraling through the slanting rain
ray griffen black running back glances back for it two defensive backs with him
all three leap in unison climbing as high as they can clutching clawing for the ball
the ball floats down kisses off the tangle of fingers splashes to the ground and rolls to a stop in the mud
the bang of the final gun snaps us back to live action
joe on his knees in the muck stares at the goal line then drops his head in defeat
betraying little emotion coach sam winters wiry intense early s takes off his headset lets it drop heads across the field
coach this is the second year in a row youve failed to go to a bowl game
do you feel your programs in decline
coach winters stands outside his office surrounded by reporters a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face
keeping his cool no were just a young team on the verge
well be back in a major bowl next year
elsewhere in the locker room we pick up a weary mud splattered joe kane taking off his pads in front of his locker
alvin mack black linebacker comes by
alvin exudes danger big fast and hostile on the field slightly surly a sense of repressed anger off it
good throw joe
it was there
so was half their team
trailing off shit another christmas at home
next year man
next year we sell out
next year we dominate
still fielding questions
you still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with joe kane
what are you gonna do to address this need
a little edgy stop wastin my time talkin to you guys for a start
as winters gets up to go we hear im not gonna lead you into the fog here sam
chancellor grant wilson grey haired eminence sits behind his desk
seated across from him are coach winters and galen howard the athletic director
im concerned about our program
its always been a source of pride to our students and alumni but two straight so so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund raising both public and
half joking then stop raising the entrance requirements on me
we never could have gotten alvin mack in here under the new guidelines
as chancellor my first responsibility is to the academic interests of this university
wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall
a football rests on the yard line which is marked million
the end zone yards away is
at a time when were committed to a million dollar building program alumni donations are down the last two years
because theyve also voiced their displeasure to their legislators we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds
the athletic fund is suffering too
season tickets sales are off merchandisings slow
you layin all this at my door
theres been a recession on
yes but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors the dollar club
these people are recession proof
they sit in my box every game and theyre much more generous when were ranked and going to bowl games
two of them as you know are on the board of regents including the chairman
what are you trying to say to me grant
after years my jobs in jeopardy
im not prepared to discuss your job right now i just want you to be aware of the situation
the alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks
i dont pretend to be an expert on football sam and ill deny that this conversation ever took place but i do know we need to win next year
coach winters flanked by two assistant coaches humes and clayton walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to a waiting car
at the end of the tunnel a scarecrow effigy of coach winters hangs from an overhead pipe
ignoring the effigy tickets are in your coat
itinerary and player profiles are in your briefcase
we got a am tomorrow in philly with this kid darnell jefferson
coach winters stops looks up at the effigy
humes and clayton fear an outburst a display of rage
looks like ive lost weight
he strides on
humes and clayton race to catch up
this kids the gamebreaker weve been lookin for
a boeing roars into the night sky
had a yard kickoff return against taft
michigans been down to see him twice
winters humes clayton and joe kane sit across from darnell jefferson and reverend wallace in a tattered parlor room
other boys of various ages and color look in from the adjoining door
darnell is black good looking street hip the letters d
shaved in block letters into his fade
darnell you have the potential to start for us as a freshman
that yard kickoff return you made against taft
one of the greatest runs ive ever seen a high school player make
now michigan is set at tailback for two years
you wont play till youre a junior
with joe here gettin you the ball runnin thunder right youll be all american with us as a sophomore
yes but im really more concerned with darnells education
he came here late
hes got some catching up to do
believe me education is the first priority in our program
thats why all the players are smarter than me
after all a football coach is smart enough to understand the game but dumb enough to think its important
this gets a little chuckle from the reverend
it was intended to
we see a run down tenant shack on the edge of a large cotton field
two foot christmas tree on an apple cart
alvin macks mother opens a christmas present as alvin and his two sisters look on
its an engraved lionshead doorknocker the kind youde find on the door of an affluent home
the inscription reads the macks
alvins mother thinks its beautiful but isnt sure what to do with it
its real pretty alvin
when i turn pro ill get you the house to go with it
winters daughter louanne is on the phone with her father
louanne is sexy clothes too tight but good natured somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador
she holds a hopelessly out of style sweater her dads given her for christmas
lying its real nice dad
winters sits on the bed eating chinese take out the phone cradled in his neck talking to louanne
i knew youde like it lou
put some fresh flowers on your moms grave for me
ill be home in a couple days
battered and old in a declining pennsylvania neighborhood hard by a steel works
joe sits on the couch with his older brother frank watching the bowl game he would have been in had e
won their last game
his father a grizzled man in his fifties nods in and out in a tattered armchair
all three have been drinking beer their empties scattered around
frank tosses joe an iron city beer
have another vitamin i joey
didnt think wede see you here this christmas little brother
you wont next year
getting up yeh well we wont rent your place on the couch
as joes father heads for the kitchen he hangs his empty beer can by the pull tab on a branch of the christmas tree
we see that the whole tree is covered with cans
darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall
youre from e
i was just sittin here by the fire doin my homework and decided to give you a call
see how youre doin
we see who darnell is talking to autumn haley beautiful black girl stylish long straight hair definitely not street
coach winters has been telling me about you
im looking forward to seeing you when you come to visit
ill be your guide
you are coming to visit arent you
we pull back and reveal autumn in an office with other telephones a coed on every one
coach myers supervises with a clipboard of names and numbers
joe leads darnell down to the end of the tunnel where autumn is waiting
he introduces them
shes even more attractive than darnell thought shed be
she takes darnells hand and leads him out onto the field where hes greeted by the e
band playing the school fight song
the cheerleaders whip into action legs kicking pom poms whirling
the band parts and darnell walks out into the seat stadium an awesome sight for any young man
autumn points to the giant diamond vision scoreboard
darnells name and picture appear
the stadium p
announcer cuts in
now for the starting line up for the e
at tailback number darnell jefferson
you got that right
darnell in his excitement does a little end zone dance
slaps hands with joe
romantic ivy league look lit by soft glo footlights
darnell and autumn walk side by side stopping outside autumns dorm
thanks for showin me around autumn
i dont meet too many females like you
you got a lotta class
maybe ill check you out in the fall
i hope so darnell
he leans down to kiss her
she hesitates not sure about this then comes forward kisses him on the lips starts to let it deepen then breaks it off
as he watches her go up the steps we go to early february its national decision day and darnells home is under seige
darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an esu jersey with emblazoned on it
now you know where im going and what were indubitably going to be
music and titles end
a hot late summer day
over the deserted quad we see the title months later
it fades and we move to reveal a city bus pulling up at a curb adjacent to the quad
off steps darnell carrying one battered suitcase
joe kane and bud lite kaminsky offensive line tackle are there to greet him
hey darnell welcome to e
shaking hands yeh good to see you guys
what happened to the band and the dancin honies
regular students dont come back for two weeks yet
not that they woulda been here
now that youve enrolled youre just another wormshit freshman
a dorm devoted exclusively to football players
luxurious lounges study halls saunas recreation and media rooms
spacious living quarters
a world unto itself
joe and bud usher darnell into his room
heres your room
if you need anything call the hall manager
darnell looks around taking it all in
he tries to be cool but this is easily the nicest room hes ever had
see ya later
freshman placement test tomorrow at nine
joe and bud start down the hall
darnell turns back into his room then starts to pace off its dimensions heel to toe
college hang out bar catering to athletes and their admirers
a black harley davidson driven by joe kane with darnell on the back pulls up at the curb
they get off head inside
joe and darnell pass a table of three girls conspicuous among them is louanne winters
joe and darnell give her a nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players wait bud lite bobby collins good looking silver tongued ladies man and nd
string quarterback and steve lattimer heavily muscled surf punk defensive end
between them is a large pitcher of beer
uh oh the lead dog is back
there goes my cover of the media guide
hey bobby lats how ya doin

bud takes a good natured swipe at him
lattimer deflects it
joe notices bobby looking over at louanne
she gives bobby a surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her
he gives her the just a minute sign
you still seein louanne
now and then when the tide rises
dont want her to think this is some kindve exclusive deal
coach finds out youre nailin his daughter youll be playin dorm ball
ill bail before that
besides this is what he gets for not startin me
bobby laughs and heads over to louannes table as joe pours himself another beer
alvin enters the bar goes to joes table plops a copy of sports illustrated down in front of joe
hey man you seen this
on the cover is a picture of joe and one other quarterback tim waymen
the coverline reads heisman hopefuls the year ribbing joe you must be some very bad ass motherfucker
joe stares at the cover
hes more stunned than elated
you didnt know
i knew there was gonna be an article
i didnt know it was gonna be on the cover
shit we do all the work
you get all the pub
too bad were not allowed to hit you in practice
be fun to kick the shit out of a heisman trophy candidate
i guess youll have to wait till we get to the pros
to darnell beer boy get me some
are you serious
does it look like im serious
joe drains his beer pours another
lattimer starts to read form the article
listen to this
has a solid nucleus returning but the timberwolves coming off two disappointing seasons will only go as far as the strong right arm of heisman candidate joe kane will take
that right joe
you gonna lead us to the promised land
im gonna lead
but can you follow
muted chuckles but set faces
the challenge accepted
joe chugs his beer pours another
the crowd from the bud alvin lattimer darnell bobby and louanne follow joe down the hill behind the bar toward a busy two lane highway
joe a little drunker than the others starts howling at the moon like a timber wolf
the others join in
what are we doin joe
slightly slurred theres something i wanta try
gotta wake up our mojo
start settin the tone for the season
this is not a good time to be settin anything
youre in no shape
suddenly joe makes a dash out onto the highway
joe cmon joe dont be an asshole
god damnit whys he always doin shit like this
coachll fuckin kill me
alvin go get him will ya
hell no you go get his ass
joe stands on the white line cars and trucks whizzing by then lies down on his back arms at his side
cars and trucks blast toward us roar on by right on top of us honking spraying grime shaking the asphalt
bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly worried now
fuck this shit
pissed off bud sprints out to the white line
the draft wake of a passing truck almost blows him over
cmon joe thats enough
lets get the hell outa here
what if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass
whats the matter bud
cant you follow
bud hesitates a second scared but stung by this dare
torn god damnit god damnit
bud cant fight it
he lies down on the line his head touching joes feet
joe begins to howl again
bud joins in
alvin and the others cant believe it
startin to look like a loaf of wonder bread out there
theyre makin us look like pussies ya know
standin here suckin our thumbs
to alvin yeh and theres nobody from the defense out there
bobby and lattimer look at each other a beat
time to ante up
both turn to alvin
what are you lookin at
you think youre bad
alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop
bobby and lattimer smile go to follow
louanne grabs bobby holds him back
vaguely sexual bobby be careful o
please be careful
bobby smiles grabs her ass pulls her to him gives her a long passionate kiss then sprints out to the white line leaving her breathless
alvin bobby and lattimer lie down in front of bud
now theres a line of five a human highway median
everybody scared shitless howling their lungs out
louanne and darnell watch from the side of the road
this guy do this kinda shit a lot
they never mentioned this in recruiting
finally joe laughing wildly jumps up and they all scramble back to safety
out of breath but pumped up they exchange exhilarated high fives
alvin just shakes his head
twenty freshman football players including darnell are scattered at tables around the room writing furiously in test booklets as a proctor paces the room
darnell starts to write an answer stops stumped
worried he looks at the clock goes on to the next page
darnell and joe walk across campus
darnell carries a gleaming chromed trophy with a football player on top
hes still thinking about the test
i dont know
i left a lot of em blank
dont worry youll do all right
lotta people dont finish
not convinced yeh
what are you doin with the trophy
coach winters asked me to bring it to the meeting
i dont know what for
suddenly darnell sees autumn walking across the quad
ill see ya at the meeting
handing him the trophy take this for me will ya
joe starts to protest but darnell is already off racing across the quad quickly catching up with autumn
hey autumn hold up
whatre you doing here
i thought students didnt come back for two weeks
rather coolly i came back early to see a friend
youre looking fresh autumn
a package of pulchritudiness
what about getting together later tonight
maybe get a pizza
they got pizza in this town dont they
i cant tonight
how about tomorrow night
i dont think its a real good idea for us to see each other darnell
whats the matter
im not good enough for you all of a sudden
too young is that it
im not ya know
they held me back a year
no its not that
ive got a boyfriend
did you have this boyfriend when you showed me around
reluctant to admit it yes
yeah well it didnt seem to bother you then
im willing to overlook it now
i was mad at him
i caught him with another girl
a white girl
and youre still with this nigger
she nods slightly embarrassed
look i got to get going darnell
i didnt mean to lead you on
im glad you came here
she starts walking away
wait a minute
i can at least walk with you cant i
nothin wrong with that
she speeds up
he speeds up
im in a hurry
i can keep up
i run the forty in four four
shes just about to say something when ray griffen arrives
rays the starting tailback black handsome clean cut well spoken middle class
hey autumn this is exactly what autumn didnt want to happen
ray and darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters
cutting in offering his hand darnell jefferson
shaking darnells hand ray griffen
just as pointedly starting tailback
thats why they recruited me
autumn cant believe he said this
she starts to interject something to break the tension but never gets the chance
the two guys they recruited before you are handing out gatorade now
making the jerkoff motion better start strengthening your wrist
departing to ray give my best to miss lilly
autumns mortification is complete
to himself what the hell is that supposed to mean
establish the new modern keller center home of the e
the football meeting room
a quarter amphitheatre
the freshman including darnell down in front
nervous talking very little eyes playing over the pictures of former e
greats arranged on the wall of honor
behind them the upperclassmen bantering conversation punctuated with laughter
a door opens
the assistant coaches file in
the room hushes immediately
coach winters walks in
the upperclassmen break into applause the freshmen quickly take their cue and join in
good to see you again gentlemen
catching sight of darnell jefferson either take off the earring or put on a dress
the upperclassmen hoot as darnell embarrassed takes off his earring
i wanna talk a little about what were trying to do here
there are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life
the players nod reverentially at this established axiom of the football cannon
these people are full of shit
you see football is not like life
pause its better
more exciting more intense more fun
in life people are always wondering how they measure up whether theyre getting ahead or fallin behind
in football you know
every week you get a chance to show what youre made of a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who cant play this
game are left to agonize about
spreading smiles all around
its good to be a football player
last year we didnt make enough of those chances
last year everyone felt we let the school down
fuck the school
we let ourselves down
pointing to the wall of honor we let down a great tradition a year old line of champions
the smiles are gone
lots of set faces now
any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood an elite corps of warriors a select group of knights
that first time our starting unit takes the field the first time we huddle up thats our inner circle thats our round table
if i were an upperclassman id be real nervous about my seat cause we got some very talented new comers this year
guys who want a place at the table
producing darnells trophy from behind the podium this is the trophy one of our freshman darnell jefferson won as a pennsylvania state high school first team all american
you know what this says to me
the freshmen are hanging on every word
not a god damn thing
he smashes the trophy on the podium breaking it in half shattering the base
darnell and the other freshmen are agog
the upperclassmen stifle laughs particularly ray griffen
to the freshmen everybody here was a high school all american
to all the players whatever any of you have done before is out the window
were startin over
the table is empty
are you ready
the upperclassmen nod steely purposeful
we go to the freshmen
theyre not so sure
joe kane takes a snap fades to pass throws an out
the ball sails two feet over the receivers head
joes angry with himself
to winters hes too pumped up
tryin to win the damn heisman on every throw
im not sure hes ready for all this hype
little late to be worryin about that
if we dont follow up the sports illustrated cover with something itll look like we didnt believe in our own player
dont worry joes a tough kid
hell be allright
joe hands off to darnell
he sweeps right cuts it up blows past the end
in a spectacular display of broken field running darnell breaks to the sideline cuts back eluding the corner back and stiffarms the safety
alvin pursuing the play finally tackles him from behind stripping the ball at the same time
theres a wild scramble for the fumble
darnell is crushed under the pile as the defense recovers it ruining an otherwise brilliant run
the players unpile to reveal darnell writhing on the ground the wind knocked out of him
ray griffen runs by to take his place
hey nice writhing jefferson
you got all the moves
shouting to the team allright move it up
lets go yards run the next play
the scrimmage moves up yards leaving darnell behind
winters sprints over to lattimer grabs him by the face mask
cut the necktie tackle horseshit
you think youre in some kinda highlight reel
he left you huggin air
target his guts
drive right through his abdomen
i wanta see snot bubbles in his nose
i wanta see shit in his underwear
lattimer nods chastised
winters moves over to check on darnell
you injured jefferson or just hurt
gasping what do you mean
if youre hurt you can still play
if youre injured you cant
are you hurt or are you injured
i think im just hurt
then get up
winters extends a hand
darnell grabs it struggles shakily to his feet nice run
think what it coulda done for us if we still had the ball
handing him the ball this is a football
i want you to carry it with you wherever you go
never let it out of your sight
to the rest of the team any of you see him on campus take a swipe at the ball
try to knock it out of his hands
to darnell again if anybody but you returns this ball to me youll wish youde never been born
winters wheels off leaving a wobbly darnell alone with his football
this isnt gonna get it goddamnit
winters mad as hell is berating his assistant coaches who are sitting cowed in his office
i see tackling but i dont see hitting
i see effort but i dont see ferocity
what do you think theyre gonna motivate themselves
footballs just a game to most of these kids
this is our program our livelihood
its our job to make them care as much about it as we do
make them hate me if you have to
itll bring them together give them a focus
so get off your butts and put the fear of god in these guys
dead tired players toweling off dressing
the trainers room is crowded with aching cramped up contused players
across the way lattimer lifts weights alone in the weight room
clayton and humes consider this from outside winters office
shit lattimers an animal all of a sudden
hes gotta be on somethin
why do you always think my guys are juicin
i dont know
hes on the punt team for three years then gains pounds of rip in one summer and an attitude to go with it
winters whos heard all this comes by
were not doctors gentlemen
the ncaa has testing programs for this
lets let them worry about it
to clayton besides its not that hard to put on pounds in a summer if you really hit the gym
winters walks on into his office
clayton nods realizing this subject is now closed
darnell walks in wrung out from the days practice stumbles to the bed where he sees something that stops him lying there is his pennsylvania state all american trophy
coach winters actually smashed a replica
a smile appears on darnells tired face
for football players only
bud lite moves through the cafeteria line
what you got tonight
choice of three entrees
shrimp lasagna t bone steak
ill take all three
what a surprise
at another table with alvin and several other black players
lattimer is the only white
when do they give ya the scores on that placement test
i flunked it three times before i got in
long as youre in the program theyll get you through
maybe not with a degree but theyll keep you eligible
just dont do nothin embarrassing they cant cover you for
hell they even give alvin copies of his tests in advance
he sells em for a hundred bucks a pop to people in his class
course hes gotta have somebody read em to him
fuck you doughboy
i can read
see that shoe
points to his shoes that says nike
i still dont wanna flunk that test
i wanta get a degree
what do you think nigger
youre gonna be on the supreme court
all you need to know is how to sign an n
darnells stung by this
hed like to think of himself as capable of more
suddenly coach winters appears at the door a surprise visitor to the training table
all the players wearing baseball caps quickly doff them
winters is angry
whats the matter with you guys
youre supposed to be a team
winning depends on thinking and acting and going to war together
but you dont even eat like a team
you eat like two teams
a white one and a black one
what do i have to do
make out a seating chart
now get up
mix it up
the players all look at each other then reluctantly get up and change tables
darnell sits next to joe
mock introduction hi there
im a young black man
hey glad to meet ya
joe kane caucasian
so what doya think a that new garth brooks album
i love that motherfucker
coach winters surveys the scene sees that all the tables are integrated now
thats more like it
he turns and walks on out
immediately the players begin to drift back to their old tables
joe bud lite and bobby collins all suffering from various aches and pains are getting naperson and analgesic balm out of the non prescription drug cabinet
joe pops a nap and looks across to the weight room where a stunning co ed camille schaeffer works a knee lift
camilles the perfect marriage of southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation
joe leaves the others heads over pokes his head in
how ya doin
little late to be workin out isnt it
with a little edge only time i could get in here when the football team wasnt usin it
trying to get a rise out of her well if it wasnt for the football team might not be a weight room to use
you tryin to firm up a little or what
unfazed dont need to firm up
im strengthening my knee
had arthroscopic surgery
had my knee scoped once too
when youre finished here maybe we could get a yogurt compare scars
sorry i dont date football players
theyre all full of themselves
i saw you on the cover of sports illustrated so youre probably worse than most
thats real open minded of you
so you wont consider doin anything with me
well at least tell me what happened to your knee
whatd you do
fall outa your convertible
camille stops her knee lift turns to joe
we think shes going to fire on him
you know theres maybe one thing id do with you
ill play tennis with you
camille starts to walk away
you mean now
smashing a two fisted forehand right at us grunting with the exertion
joe scrambles to get it back but camilles a world class player
she attacks with a vengeance blasting every shot ala jimmy connors as bud lite and bobby collins watch amazed
we begin a series of cuts detailing camilles relentless dismantling of joe camille drilling a backhand down the line joe barely getting it back to the net
camille hitting a powerhouse service ace joe lunging and whiffing the return
camille crushing another forehand
joe crushes it back sends it over the fence and into the parking lot
camille serving again at match point
joe pops up a weak return
camille puts it away with a powerhouse overhead the ball almost knocking joe down
he flings his racket against the fence
camille comes to the net to shake hands but joe hangs back
thanks for the game heisman
you took it really well
and she walks away along to the net
joe goes after her pissed
whats this heisman crap
camilles taken aback not realizing shed struck a nerve
i didnt say anything about being a heisman candidate
i dont go around strokin myself about it
so whats this shit youre givin me
i just figured you were probably kissin yourself in the mirror every morning
you figured wrong
now joe walks away and camille goes after him
so what do you want an apology
i just gave you one
i want a rematch
some other sport
i took my beating
you owe me one
either that or we go out
camille considers tries to figure out what shed dislike least knowing itd be cheap to choose neither
ill think about it
camille walks off disappearing through the gate
joe walks off in the other direction
bud lite and bobby follow
real good date joe
remind me to take her out
opening day of school
we take cuts of students arriving football players checking out the new girls from atop the wall of the athletic dorm louanne and autumn greeting returning sisters at the sorority
students registering for classes etc
darnell sits across from william smith academic advisor
darnell ive reviewed your placement test and im afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas
what does that mean
i cant play football
it means youre going to have to take some remedial classes what we call zero level courses
specifically math and english
darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of his academic standing
you wont get college credit for them but they will help you prepare to take the placement test again at the end of the quarter
if you pass at that time youll be able to officially enter the university and take college level courses
youll still be able to take an american history survey course but it wont count on your record until you pass the placement test
but first things first
to start im approving a tutor for you
i dont need no tutor
and yes you do
a meeting of the football brain trust coach winters athletic director galen howard a publicist sharon braver and the sports information director s
also present is joe kane somewhat discomfited at being the center of all this attention
i think both joe and the university are best served by a straightforward heisman campaign
nothing too gimmicky
weve compiled a mailing list of around opinion makers newspapers football writers and sports anchors
first we send them a packet on joe and his achievements
bio stats plus human interest stuff commitment to academics charity work etc
then we update it each week with a postcard
heisman voters hate opening envelopes
joe is increasingly uneasy with all this
i havent really done any charity work
youre gonna start
weve got some things lined up
unfortunately because we werent in the top last year we only have one network t
game to give joe national exposure
although its a good one michigan
but well also be taping all our other games and buying satellite time
that way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to t
stations all over the country for their sportscasts
any questions joe
if joe was uneasy before hes overwhelmed now
he tries not to show it
after all who could turn down a heisman campaign
still its a megaton of pressure
you really think i got a shot to win this
plus its a good thing for the program
publicizes the school gives a boost to recruiting and its a great thing for you
jumps up your draft position the size of your first contract everything
its a hell of an opportunity
all you gotta do is back it up on the field and we have no doubts about that cause we know kane is able
nichols holds up a black campaign button with the phrase kane is able enblazoned on it in gold letters
this gets a rise out of everyone except joe whos still not sure about all this
joe lies on his bed staring up at the ceiling unable to get to sleep
the phone rings
camille whos been asleep rolls over and answers it
this is joe kane
what did you decide
still drowsy what
looking at the clock its in the morning
i wanta know what you decided
i dont know
i couldnt think of any other sports i could beat you at
then ill pick you up tonight at
he hangs up
autumn sits at a tutorial table looking at her notes
she becomes aware of someone approaching
she looks up to see darnell
what are you doin here
my advisor says i need a tutor
ya know just to get me over a couple rough spots
showing her a paper i saw your name on this list
i figured if you couldnt keep my attention nobody could
im sorry darnell but ive already been assigned
youre gonna have to find somebody else
im tutoring scott sherman
i asked coach winters to switch us
coach winters wouldnt do that
yeh he would
im a bigger prospect than sherman
pointing across the way hes a lineman on the scout team
autumn looks back to where darnell is pointing
sure enough scott sherman is hard at work with another tutor
autumn cant believe it
she tries to compose herself
darnell sits down across the table from her
cmon autumn you could teach me some real erudition
trying to whisper pissed will you stop using those big words
it sounds ridiculous
serious about this what doya mean
im improvin myself
i learn a new word out of the dictionary every day
mendacious pejorative antithetical commensurate
and you dont ever use them right
pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated
its just a con
and it makes you sound stupid no matter how big a prospect you are
darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality
his customary bravado melts away
even more reason for you to be my tutor
you already taught me something
autumn disarmed by his sudden humility has no real rebuttal
she would have had to tutor him anyway but now shes having trouble being angry about it
at another table looking distracted and bored as his tutor reads his history assignment to him
alvin takes out a walkman and puts the headphones on
we hear a horn beep
camille comes out the front door summoned by the horn
she stops at the sight of something
we reverse to reveal joe on his harley
we goin on that
i thought we might take a ride
i promised my dad id never get on one of those
what are you one of these trust fund princesses
its fine for me to play a game i dont know but i ask you to try somethin different and you hide behind your daddy
he holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her daring her
she burns but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her to decline this challenge
snatching the helmet all right
but we go slow
no cowboy stuff
joe smiles and kicks the starter
camille climbs on and they roar off
just outside town
joe and camille come down the highway at moderate speed
camilles hanging on for dear life but we can tell shes enjoying it
this speed o
joe immediately accelerates throwing camilles head back
her shriek is lost in the whine of the engine as they speed away from camera
slow down damnit
they approach a high banked turn beyond which appears to be a long sheer dropoff
joe looks back at camille smiles devilishly not looking where hes going
camille sees theyre heading straight for the edge
freaked joe look out
joe brakes fishtails but goes over the top of the bank off the edge flying out into oblivion camille screaming
as it plops down onto a wide ledge not visible from the road three feet below the top of the bank
joe lands it skids to a professional stop breaks into raucous laughter
camille jumps off the bike scared stiff and livid with anger
how could you do that you stupid punk
it isnt funny god dammit you coulda killed us
youre crazy you know that
take it easy
ive done that a hundred times
no big deal
then why are you shaking
embarrassed i dont know
i guess cause ive never done it with someone else on the bike
you just wanted to scare me
are you happy now
yeh pretty much
and the scream was even better than i thought itd be
every dog within hearing distance wants to mate with you now
camilles ready to throttle him then something catches her ear
sure enough there are several dogs barking in the distance
joe smiles at her
she looks away still angry but amused in spite of herself
working class sawdust floor george thoroughgoods who do you love on the jukebox
camille and joe are sitting in a booth
joe putting away the beers
you come here a lot
now and then
its not exactly a campus favorite
this is almost like hidin out
i like places where nobody knows me
this too low rent for you
no my dad owned a place like this
you mean he owned a chain of these
not everybody with a southern accent has their own plantation
my dad could never afford to send me here
i learned to play tennis on public courts
mighta been able to play pro someday if i hadnt hurt my knee
so youre just a scholarship jock like me
no ive just never been out with a jock before
is that what were doin here
i dont know
what doya think
joe gets up takes camilles hand and pulls her to her feet
they dance to a slow song
i think youre crazy for jeopardizing your scholarship and a pro future by jumping motorcycles off of highways
just tryin to keep my edge camille
the other guys look to me cause they think ill do anything
i lose that im just another guy and we all get our ass kicked
i dont know joe
you scare me
joe roars in on his motorcycle
finds himself face to face with a very unhappy coach winters
winters holds out his hand
joe hesitates a second then reluctantly hands over his motorcycle keys
i told you as long as youre in this program you dont take unnecessary risks off the field
a man in contention for the heisman trophy should be able to remember that
joe nods contrite
winters just walks on off
autumn is tutoring darnell checking her lesson notes
using the things we worked on yesterday i want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect of your life
something other than football
your father maybe
you could write about your dad
dont know that much about him
he was off in detroit workin in a car plant when i was born
got laid off tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money
he died in prison
some kinda heart problem
autumn wasnt ready for this level of hardship
she tries to press on gamely
how about your mother
she was always workin
usually two jobs
comin home one night she stopped to get us some root beer
got caught in a gang crossfire
shot three times
died on the way to the hospital
you want me to write about that
blown away no
good cause none of its true
autumn jumps up
raising her voice jesus christ darnell what a terrible thing to do to somebody
thats not funny
autumn realizes shes in the library and sits back down
had ya goin didnt i
soft library voice no you didnt
how could you make up somethin like that
contrite now sounded more interesting than the truth
my mom took a vacation to chicago when i was
never came back
dont know who my dad was
autumns anger melts away in the face of this painful truth
who took care of you
i started hangin with the j
did some time in the hall
reverand wallace saw me playin football on a juvenile probation team
took me in got me into high school
only reason they accepted me was cause i could play football
sorta like here
football saved my life
id be nowhere without football
autumn just nods still trying to take this all in
maybe you could write about football this once
pause ive seen a lotta shitty things in my life autumn
thats why i know when i see somethin good
autumn knows this is no line
he means it
shes seeing him with new eyes
moved by his pain engaged by his sincerity and more than a little taken by his regard for her
across the room with his tutor
lets review the chapter i read you yesterday
which two city states fought in the punic wars
detroit and buffalo
youre gonna be tested on this
a video projector projects various football formations on the wall
okay alvin this is mississippi states offensive set
nd and on our
what defense are you in
unless the set back shifts into the i
slide changes how about here
whats your assignment
kill the quarterback
slide changes hit the tight end so hard his girlfriend dies
slide changes kill everybody
joe watches bud lite darnell alvin and lattimer file in and unveil a life size cardboard stand up of joes sports illustrated cover pose
they whoop it up as joe tries to muster some enthusiasm
autumns pointing out a figure on a graph in darnells math book
as she explains darnell leans close to kiss her
autumn quickly leans away glances around to see if anyone saw darnells attempt
a group of football players sits in the back of the class
as the history professor lectures at the board darnell furiously takes notes
scott sherman seizing the opportunity leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football out of darnells left hand
darnell scott and two other freshman football players spring out of their seats scrambling after the loose ball
the prof and the other students watch appalled as darnell and the others dive under chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball
finally darnell winded and disheveled comes up with it
he and the others quickly return to their seats
the prof looks at darnell aghast
i lost my football
joe and camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball
joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point and pumps a fist in triumph
camille pissed at losing throws her racket and stomps around
darnell and autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on a secluded patch of lawn
darnell holds his football
as he begins to read aloud from east of eden autumn pokes the ball out of his hand
they both scramble for it darnell winding up slightly on top of her
they eye each other a beat
darnell bends down to kiss her
she lets herself kiss him for a second then gets up and starts to collect her books
several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board in the hall
the starting lineup for the first game has been posted
darnell traces his finger from the designation tailback over to the name ray griffen
he drops his eyes obviously disappointed
lattimer meanwhile is checking the defensive board
he finds his name posted as a starting defensive end
punching the air he dashes out of the building
place at the table
lattimer in his euphoria races out into the lot and begins head butting car windows
he breaks out three in a row and yells in triumph his forehead dripping blood
winters walking with the team trainer has seen this from across the street
he knows theres something dark at work here
is gonna test half the team before the game saturday
make sure lattimer knows about it
the chairs are arranged in several circles ten players to a circle like a bunch of formalized huddles
coach winters addresses the assembly
as the veteran players know we have pride night every year before our opening game
its a chance to get to know each other better share some thoughts and bring us closer together as a team
so to start off id like each player to tell the others in his group what he likes best about football and then what hes most proud of off the
ive asked some of the seniors to lead it off
i dont know
its the battle
the goin to war with the other guys
the team walks through several plays
they wear coats and ties but no socks
their ankles are taped
bein different from everybody else
havin our own dorm stayin in hotels the night before games
settin ourselves apart
before the game
an ncaa official gives lattimer a little test tube to urinate in for his drug test
lattimer goes into one of the restroom stalls reaches around to the back of the tank where a vial of clean urine is taped
he pours it in the test vial
havin a chance to be somebody
to do somethin that people look up to you for
your strength and your courage
not everybody can play football
were the lucky ones
the thing im most proud of myself for
darnell listening to a walkman is going through a pregame ritual by his locker pivoting from leg to leg switching the ball from arm to arm
just that im here
that im not dead or in jail
the great thing about football is you can lose yourself in it
joe sits off in a corner by himself his head back against the wall staring out into space the only movement the rhythmic tapping of his feet
theres no time to think to worry to have doubts
everything else fades away
you just move and react
the best thing is when you dominate
that feeling when you hit a guy real good really stick him and you hear that little moan
alvin his ass kicking game face on walks over to where lattimer is finishing decorating his face with indian war paint
they chuck each others pads then lattimer opens his mouth
alvin spits into it
then lattimer spits into alvins
darnell cant believe this shit
you know its killin him but you feel great
its just him and you and hes the one thats hurtin
we move in on the burning ferocity of alvins eyes and the players are bunched together in the tunnel slapping pads yelling encouragement
winters waves them forward
they start to run down the tunnel
camera runs with the players as the light at the end of the tunnel becomes larger and brighter
crowd noise becomes louder until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the light and voices roar
this is big time college football
announcer brad harvey and colorman harmon sloan are holding forth
welcome everybody to the wolf den where the e
timberwolves led by heisman candidate joe kane open their season against the tough mississippi state bulldogs under head coach jackie sherrill
the crowd stands waving banners as the e
kicker comes forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky
the mississippi state return man fields the ball at the four yard line and returns it to the where hes buried
the defense trots out and huddles up
all right lets get evil
minutes balls out
lets open a can of kick ass
kill em all
let the paramedics sort em out
the mississippi state offense breaks its huddle comes to the line of scrimmage
alvin prowling behind the line locks eyes with the tailback no
hey dont think i dont recognize you you little fuck
the tailback looks away
hey pay attention when im talkin to you nigger
youre the guy that shot my mother arent you
you were tryin to steal her fuckin car werent you cocksucker
i never heard of your mother
on the sidelines darnell is watching this exchange
to joe whats alvin saying to that guy
just gettin himself pumped up
he wasnt pumped up already
to tailback thought id never find you didnt ya
but i got you now nigger and im gonna kill you motherfucker
im gonna bust your guts open and watch you die
the ball is snapped
the quarterback pitches to the tailback as alvin charges into the hole screaming at the top of his lungs
the tailback eyes wide with fear cuts back away from alvin where hes promptly crunched by lattimer
the ball flies loose theres a scramble alvin comes up with it
the bench and stands erupt as lattimer and alvin but heads and trot off the field
atta baby alvin heads up
big pop steve way to stick em
turning to joe o
joe lets go up top
take it to em right away
joe leads the offense on
a disappointed darnell stands on the sidelines
in huddle o
lets put the women and children to bed and go lookin for dinner
dont let em up
strike orange left
joe begins to howl like a wolf
the others join in
a pack of timberwolves
they break the huddle come to the line of scrimmage
bud lite begins to sing
bali hi will call you anytime any day
here am i your special island
bud lines up opposite a big black defensive tackle
shut up snowflake
you think youre in the school play
no bali hi the endzone is calling
and the highway runs right over your ass
bullshit youre gonna be my bitch baby
you gonna be my punk bitch
singing again so long farewell auf wiedersehen good night i hate to go and leave this pretty sight
joe hits the count and the ball is snapped
bud lite and the big tackle fire out
bud drives a forearm into the stomach of the black tackle doubling him over
the black tackle comes back slamming a forearm up under buds chin snapping his neck back
joe meanwhile fades to pass pump fakes steps up
bud lite chicken fighting the black tackle sticks his fingers in the tackles eyes then cut blocks him to the ground
the tackle falls on bud and smashes a fist into his ribs
bud rolls him over
joe spots his flanker back maurice ward on a flag pattern
lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone
the crowd goes wild as bud lite pushes off the black tackles throat getting up from the pile
joe pumps a fist in the air hugs ward as the team celebrates
it reads e
in for griffen
darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action buttons his chinstrap races onto the field
kane hands to jefferson
he takes a handoff runs a trap up the middle is hit by three tacklers clawing at the ball
they bring him down but darnell doesnt fumble
he gets up still clutching the ball and starts back to the huddle with it
the referee hustles after him
excuse me son but were gonna need that football for another couple minutes
darnell suddenly realizing gives it up
even winters has to laugh
we go to lattimer sacking the quarterback tackling him high ripping his helmet off
lattimer runs off the field holding it up like a trophy
the gun sounds the game is over
accepting congratulations from his staff
guess well be on the payroll for another week
walking off the field together both their jerseys blood stained
good game man
really enjoyed it
yeh youre a strong motherfucker
shitty singer though
a reception of some sort for the players is in progress
darnell looking a little lost fills his cup from a punch bowl
a fat cat alumnus approaches him
good to see ya in there darnell
way to hold on to that pigskin
as he walks by he slips an envelope into darnells coat pocket
darnell opens it to find a dollar bill
surprised he goes over to alvin
hey some guy just gave me a dollar bill
dont worry youll get or hundred once youre startin depending on how you play
but were not supposed to get any are we
hey man you cant live on a month scholarship money
and the nc double assholes wont let us have jobs so you take your money where you can get it
taking darnells envelope ill keep it for you till you see the light
shit they oughta be payin us anyway
athletic department gets million just for goin to a bowl game
joe sits alone on his bed watching t
hes being interviewed in the locker room a bouquet of microphones in his face
this performance today two touchdown passes another you ran in
where do you think this puts you in the heisman race
joe hates this question
we go to the screen
uncomfortable i really have no idea
thats up to you guys
the image changes to espn anchor chris berman in the studio
now lets turn to our heisman watch
does the pose while remaining seated we begin with sports illustrated cover boy joe kane of e
who led his team to an impressive victory this afternoon
well if joe continues to raise kane he may well be able to dust off a large space on his trophy shelf
although the real test will come in four weeks against michigan and their heisman hopeful tim waymen
joe walks across campus headed for camilles dorm
michigan also won big today
timothy he could go all the way men will be looking to do so against the timberwolves
and of course the able kane will be looking to also
i cant wait
joe comes down the hall knocks on camilles door
disappointed he turns and walks away
the post game victory party is in full swing
all the players their girls and various groupies dancing drinking celebrating
bud lite and joe stand drinking beer watching the action
i dont know i never seem to make out at things like this
bobby whos overheard this walks by with louanne
you dont make out anywhere
or did you finally break the snatch barrier this summer
fuck you bobby
realizing louannes there excuse me louanne
sitting across the room with alvin but his attention is on autumn and ray out on the dance floor
forget it nigger
no chance for you there
griffins goin to medical school
she likes that light skinned respectable shit
youre just her ghetto toy
darnell challenged by this gets up and goes over to where ray and autumn are standing
a slow tune plays
to autumn can i have this one
i dont think so
what are you so worried about
you havent lost your starting job yet
autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand
turning to ray just one
ray reluctantly backs off
darnell and autumn start to dance
several players whove picked up on the tension watch them as they move around the floor
they try to pretend theyre just having a nice little chat
whispering take it easy darnell
this isnt a good time to push things
youre putting me in an awkward position
yeh well i got a little encouragement along the way
it was just
you meant it
i wouldnt be standing here now everybody thinkin im a stupid asshole if i didnt know you meant it
i wanna see you autumn
not in study hall
not like your student
like somebody to be taken seriously
i do take you seriously darnell but im still with ray
i cant just go paradin around town
i dont need to go paradin
well go someplace different
someplace nobodyll see us
she looks at him a long beat
she doesnt need this complication this conflict but she cant say no
god why am i even considering this
the song ends
ray moves in to reclaim her
to darnell all caught up on your arithmetic
darnell pissed gives ray a shove
yeh you only gained yards on carries
ray lunges back at him but quickly several players led by joe and bud lite step between them
darnell shrugs them off and leaves the party
to bud lite just what we need a little team unity
ray takes autumns arm pulls her out onto the patio
im gettin a little sick of this asshole autumn
i dont like you hangin out with him
i dont hang out with him
i tutor him
then have him get another tutor
i cant do that
i made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam
i cant bail out on him now
what the hell difference does it makes
theyll grease him through no matter what he does
nobodys ever gonna see his graduation
dont tell me youre falling for this guy
hes just another gang banger with speed
i just said i wanted to help him
what are you more afraid of losing your girl or your position
maybe you oughta think about what youre in danger of losing
maybe i will
autumn rips free of his grip and walks out of the party too
darnell sits alone on a bench under an old willow just staring out at the night
he hears a voice behind him
so where you wanna go
the partys still in full gear
ray is now chatting up a few of the groupies
joe and bud lite sit off in a corner
joes knocked back several beers
hes a little tipsy and lost in thought
maybe shes out with some guy
i dont think shes the type to screw around on ya
shoot ya maybe
it wouldnt be screwing around
its not like were going together
joes gaze falls on a sultry brunette sheri at a table across the way
shes eyeing joe big time
she wants him
he stares back at her
she doesnt blink
camille carrying an armload of books comes down the library steps having been studying late
as she heads for her dorm she sees joe and sheri going across the quad sheri draped around joe nuzzling him
joe looks over spots camille stops surprised embarrassed to see her
they exchange a look
camille upset turns and wheels off
joe wants to say something to her but cant get it out
we dont know where yet but they seem to be slipping and sliding clutching on to each other
youre right nobody would ever see us here
near closing time
darnell and autumn lurch and stumble around the ice collapsing against the boards now and then
there are few other skaters at this hour
yes i figure the key is to go places only white people go
next time well go bowling
autumn laughs as the house lights start to blink indicating its closing time
plus i saw this in rocky
i never believed a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad but now i know
they make their way to an opening in the boards stumble over to a bench begin to unlace
thanks that was fun sort of
you were pretty good for the first time
well its not really my first time
my dad took me skating once
he used to play ball for e
yeah howd you know that
i saw his picture on the wall of fame
you got his eyes
luckily you didnt get his thighs
she laughs looks at him a beat starts to come forward to kiss him
he puts a finger to her lips
make sure you mean it this time
she hesitates a beat then comes forward again
they fall into a deep kiss
we pull back to longshot
two people alone in the expanse of the ice rink
the lights flicker and go out
camille unable to sleep enters in her workout clothes
languid melancholy she goes to the treadmill as joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist
both are surprised to see the other
what are you doin here
i was just sweatin out some of the beer
camille just nods
long silent pause
i didnt go home with her
i thought about it
but i didnt
you drink too much
he turns starts toward the door
why didnt you
why didnt i what
go home with her
i dont know
i guess i figured maybe there was somethin goin on between you and me
camille hesitates not sure whether to believe him then gets off the bike and walks toward him
then whyd you pick her up in the first place
i was drunk
i needed some company
yeh i can see you havin a real far ranging discussion with sheri
i mean ya know physical company
i just needed to pounce on somebody i guess
camille really steamed now snatches the towel from around joes waist leaving him naked
why cant you pounce on me
arent i good enough to pounce on
camille snaps the towel at him driving him back
joes totally thrown by this reaction in her
well youre more conservative
youre not that kinda girl
she snaps the towel again backing him against the training table
insulted how do you know
youve never slept with me
she pounds on his chest pushing him back on the table
what makes you think shes such a great ride
climbing up on top of him im prettier my legs are longer
pulling down her leotard ive got better tits
exasperated why would you go to her when you have me
i didnt know i had you
softer leaning close well you do
he looks at her a beat then pulls her mouth down to his
they fall into a long white hot kiss
joe and camille are making love passionately energetically
camille still worked up rolls up on top
between kisses you shoulda looked for me at the library or dont you ever go there
rolling back on top i go there
i got a
in political science
i just dont go there on saturday nights
rolling back on top again i have a paper due monday
whatde she do
sit on your lap or just give you the nail me stare
shut up camille
joe rolls back on top the momentum carrying both of them off the table and out of sight
some students are taking a history test in blue books
checking attendance walks up to louanne
shes uneasy as the t
checks his chart
whats your name
can i see your i
louanne knows shes in deep trouble
a high tech room full of video machines and monitors used to run simultaneous views of different positions during the same play
a grim looking group of assistant coaches approaches winters as he runs through and reprograms the images on the screen
coach we ah
got a problem with bobby collins
into taking a test for him and got caught
they had a new t
whats the penalty
well the rules say automatic expulsion for both of them
fortunately weve got friends on the board of regents
i think we can beat this if we really go to bat for him
we got mack off when he turned in that other guys term paper
shaking his head but what kinda idiot would do something like that
well i guess bobby figured he was gonna flunk
i dont mean bobby
i mean what kinda guy would be dumb enough to take a test for him
it wasnt a guy
he must have banged her until she couldnt think straight
who was it
barely able to get it out it was
winters face goes dead
winters enraged is venting his spleen at louanne
jesus louanne how could you be so stupid
he was behind he needed help
youve destroyed my credibility at the university my authority with the players
christ it looks like im running a dirty program
and collins of all people
what the hells the matter with you louanne
crying i dont know
i thought he
he loves anything that winks back the little rat bastard
and what are you gonna do for school now
i use my influence to get you back in itll stink to high hell
the pressll crucify me
ill get in someplace
god louanne i told you to stay away from my players
that was my cardinal rule stay away from the damn players
theyve always been good enough for you
good enough to devote your life to
why arent they good enough for me
or are they too good
youre changing the subject louanne
were talkin about you breakin the rules
didnt you ever break the rules just a little
didnt you tell me once that per cent of the schools obey the ncaa rules and the other per cent go to bowl games
was that just a joke
she gets up and walks out of the room
winters closes his eyes and slumps down on the couch
darnell sits at his table waiting for autumn
autumn storms in obviously upset about something
she slaps a corrected test down in front of him
you seen this
you got a d on your math test
yeh i kinda figured that
i had some trouble on this last part
we went over that last week darnell
what is this time we spend in here
just a joke to you
i dont even think youve been listening to me
ive been listening to you baby
dont call me baby
i thought you wanted to learn
but if all you wanta do is fake your way through then get another tutor to waste time with
cmon autumn we just had a good time and now youre gettin all nuts behind this
its just one test
so far its the only test
i want you to study this whole chapter
by yourself without me here
when i come back well discuss it
be ready to do problems based on it
whatever you say teach
big grin i dont wish to be cast in a pejorative light so im dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities
she shakes her head and walks away
darnells grin fades
he looks at his test a hint of tears in his eyes
hes embarrassed and deeply worried
the players are dressing for monday practice but its strangely subdued
bobby collins opens his locker to find a bullet riddled practice jersey hanging inside
immediately the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter
coachd probably shoot ya lower
suddenly the room goes silent
standing in the doorway is coach winters
he says nothing looks around the room the players avoiding his gaze
his eyes come to rest on bobby
bobby tries to hide the shirt but winters has seen
winters just stares at bobby a beat then
you all played a fine game on saturday
take the day off
with that he turns and walks out the door
the players remain silent
bobby throws the shirt in the trash
winters walks in the front door past the desk up the stairs and down the hall to his daughters room
shes packing her things
he goes over to her takes her in his arms and hugs her tight
a tear rolls down louannes cheek
hits the floor
a very nervous bobby collins comes down the hall and knocks on coach winters door
cmon in collins
bobby enters and stands across from winters desk
winters doesnt invite him to sit
listen coach i just want you to know im really sorry about this whole thing with louanne
i was real glad to hear shes gonna be goin to junior college here
cutting him off shut up
i could easily take your case to the board of regents
youve had no prior infractions and i could argue that you were under abnormal pressure
pause but i wont
you embarrassed me you embarrassed my family you embarrassed the program
as of now you are no longer a member of this university or its football team
clean out your locker
bobby just stands there a beat in confusion and disbelief
there is no wavering no sympathy in winters eyes
finally dazed and disoriented bobby turns and walks out
joe is posed in front of the school library one of its more photogenic buildings
sportscaster lynn swann and his video crew wait to interview him as a makeup girl finishes applying makeup to joes face
publicist sharon braver watches like a hawk
to his cameraman we ready jerry
lets mark it
an assistant marks the take and swann turns to joe
joe this game is being billed as a potential heisman shootout
did you feel any added pressure this week
a phalanx of photographers crowd around snapping away as joe goes through passing drills
knowing that youre going head to head with heisman rival tim waymen
well ya know you try to block it out but its basically impossible
everybody seems to be talkin about it all the newspapers the interviews
joe is being interviewed by dallas perry on a local television show
the hype on t
tryin to get somethin goin
sharon braver steps directly in front of the video camera waves off the take
whats the problem
braver takes joe aside talks to him confidentially
what youre saying is true of course but i dont think its the message you want to send
joe and camille are sharing a pizza but not alone
a video spotlight shines on them as yet another crew rolls tape
it makes you seem a little nervous
like the pressure might be getting to you
this game is nationally televised so most heisman voters will be watching
i think a more casual approach is better
modest controlled casual
joe nods and heads back in front of the camera
to braver irritated we all set now
gets a nod lets mark it
the take is marked joe this game is being billed as a potential heisman shootout
a huge bonfire burns as a large segment of the student body has gathered in front of the timberwolf statue
the cheerleaders all wearing kane is able buttons whip the crowd up as joe is introduced on the podium
did you feel any added pressure this week knowing that youre going head to head with heisman rival tim waymen
the cheerleaders begin to chant lets go joe
on joe they assume the heisman trophy pose
joe seems slightly embarrassed by it all
no i dont really think too much about that kinda thing
swann shoots braver a poisonous look
joe and camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad tracks below
neither says anything
joe seems strangely preoccupied
camille decides to break the silence
your parents comin to the game tomorrow
my moms dead
my dad has never seen me play
guess hes not that interested in football
but youre one of the best players in the country
snapping hes just not into it o
silence whats goin on joe
you ask me out here like you wanta talk about somethin then you dont say anything
you worried about tomorrow
im worried about the days after that
i dont know
i feel like tomorrows gonna be my last game
i want to stay up make the time go slow
why would it be your last game
you afraid of getting hurt
no thatd be a relief
then at least i wouldnt be a failure
joe why are you thinking like this
why would you be a failure
youre having a great year youre a heisman trophy candidate you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros
testy how do you know whats waiting for me
you dont know me at all
hurt i dont know you
how can you say that
because you wouldnt be here now if you did
you only know the guy thats supposed to make millions in the pros
is that what you think
that im with you for the money
infuriated she slaps him across the face
fuck you joe
starting to cry i dont give a shit about your money
i dont even give a shit about football
and you know what
maybe youre right maybe i dont know you
she turns and storms away up the hill as we hear a train whistle
joe watches her go then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view
camille stops turns back sees joe headed for the tracks starts to worry
joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train
horrified camille runs down the embankment toward him
my god joe what are you doing
as the train approaches its horn blaring joe lies face down on the tracks his hands gripping the railroad ties
camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the train race over him
she falls to her knees screaming
under the train we see joe desperately hugging the ground head down toes dug in hands clutching the ties
its like a tornado under there dirt debris flying everywhere his clothes flapping wildly
the train passes
camille looks up afraid to breath as joe lies motionless on the tracks
suddenly he stirs pushes himself up to his knees
she lets out a scream of joy races toward him as he gets to his feet stumbles off the grade
she hugs him to her tears streaming down her face helps him over to the embankment
god joe oh god are you allright
drained yeh just got some dirt in my teeth
guess youve really seen the dark side now huh
you shouldve gotten out while you had the chance
before it all goes to hell
i dont wanta get out damnit
whats wrong joe
why would it all go to hell
im a kane camille
thats all it takes
were cut out to be drunks and fuck ups
we never live up to expectations
its in our blood
my dad brothers uncles we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up
my dad went the longest
waited till he was playin triple a ball before he hit the wall
sometimes i feel like im just waiting for my turn
the better i do the closer it gets
youre not like them you can beat all that
you can stop drinking you can break the chain
if i gave up that i wouldnt be much of a football player
and if i wasnt a football player what would i be
the question hangs in the air
youde still be joe
and id still love you
he pulls her to him kisses her hair they slump against each other
just dont say i never warned you
steve zabriskie and bo schembeckler in the foreground the jammed to capacity stadium in the background
this shot is going out on nationwide t
the college game of the week
to go and its been a great one
two undefeated teams goin after each other
michigan up by four but the lead has changed hands three times and you get the feeling that whoever has the ball last is gonna win it
joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage
well it was billed as a heisman shootout and its been all of that
both waymen and kane moving their teams up and down the field having big days
joe fades to pass looks right looks left cant find a receiver decides to run for it
he sprints up the middle a safety comes at him at the
we see joes p
he pushes the lunging safety away turns back just in time to be blasted by the other safety he never saw
joe is knocked down over the goal line and out cold
the crowd goes wild
kane back to pass cant find anybody gonna run it himself ten five hit at the goal line
great run by kane
joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him
hes still down
looks like hes hurt
we go to winters worried on the sideline as the celebration around him begins to die down
as hes carried off the field his arms around two linemens shoulders and lowered onto the bench
we go to a blurry image of a mans face waving something
we reverse to reveal a doctor waving smelling salts under joes nose
joe begins to come around
the doctor holds up two fingers
how many fingers am i holding up
michigan comes to the line of scrimmage
as tim waymen gets under center alvin begins to yell at him
youre the white boy that ratted my brother out
sent him to jail cocksucker
ran off with the fuckin money
left the blood to do the time huh
waymen begins to call signals
yeh youre the little bastard
account of you my bros datin his cell mate
you hear me powderpuff
gonna make you pay
you gonna be my cellmate now
you gonna have lbs
of pissed off nigger up your ass
in an eight man line looking for the run on third and short
the ball is snapped
waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback hides the ball on his hip fades to pass
on the sideline coach winters yells pass
alvins not fooled by the run he shakes his blocker and takes dead aim on waymen
just as waymen releases the ball alvin blasts him driving him into the turf
waymen fakes to simms mack on the blitz waymen is goin for it all
hit as he throws
the ball however flies through the air a perfect spiral
secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is a step behind
the ball comes down in the hands of the michigan tight end jerry hunt
hunt has got a step
hes got it
winters slams his headphones to the ground
great clutch throw under pressure
cant do it much better than that
the doctor examines joe shines a light in his eyes makes him track his finger etc
youre visions back to normal
you think you can go
yeh im fine
just a little headache
getting up shouting to his teamates o
offense lets get it back
alvin meanwhile plops down on the bench in disgust
damn tough to scare that little white boy
either his momma dropped him on his head or the motherfucker is deaf
coach winters goes to darnell
jefferson in for griffen
griffen slams his helmet to the ground
joe breaks the huddle as the e
offense comes to the line
ball on the michigan to go kane brings em to the line of scrimmage
joe fades to pass once again lets the rush come then flares out a screen pass to darnell
darnell grabs it and takes off slipping tackles cutting back juking
darnell finally runs out of bounds at the twenty
great run by jefferson the highly touted freshman the longest of the day for the wolves
and this one is turning out to be everything we thought it would be
coming back to the huddle pumped up
joe kneels in the center
time to put the women and children to bed and go looking for dinner
he begins to howl as do all the others
the call of the wild
strike eagle crown on
they clap hands come to the line
joe looks over the defense bends under center and barks signals the ball is snapped
action goes to slow motion
joe fakes to darnell fades to pass
the michigan cornerback comes on a blitz locked on joe
joe starts to roll but knows the corner will catch him
on the run he launches the ball toward darnell
darnell opens his hands to receive it but at the last second the michigan safety steps in front and intercepts it
kane looking for jefferson
intercepted by freeman
and that should do it
joe sinks to his knees in frustration
the blitzing cornerback does a quick pit pat on joes helmet
winters looks like hes been punched
as michigan and tim waymen celebrate on the sideline we go to steve zabriskie is doing the wrap up the emptying stadium behind him
well it was everything we expected it to be
fine performances on both sides of the field
players undress and shower in relative silence
no joy here
the edge in the much ballyhooed battle of the quarterbacks would probably have to go to michigans tim waymen who threw for touchdowns and ran for another
joe kane accounted for three e
touchdowns but had that crucial interception in the waning moments
and that proved to be the difference
the door of the locker room opens and a flood of reporters enter
joe hides back in the showers leaning his forehead against the wall the water coursing over him
darnell comes out of the locker room having showered and dressed
hes surprised to see autumn and her father talking to coach humes
is this your dad
how do you do mr
im darnell jefferson
nice run you made on that screen pass
another block and you might have scored
well get em next year
how do you and autumn know each other
you a friend of rays
darnell is jolted by this question
its obvious that autumn has never told her dad about him
filling the void ah i tutor him
darnell would like to crawl under a rock
math and english
theres a slight tone of condescension in mr
he realizes darnell hasnt passed his entrance exam
this is not lost on darnell
well stay on top of that darnell
id have been in real trouble if i hadnt gotten my degree
i played ball once
hurt my knee
yeh i know
i used to put a copy of my report card inside the webbing of my helmet to remind me that college was more important than football
forcing enthusiasm good idea
well i gotta get goin
nice to meet you mr
nice to meet you darnell
see you around autumn
before autumn can respond ray griffen approaches from the other direction
good to see you
you still havin dinner with us tonight
darnell embarrassed and humiliated hears all this as he walks away
autumn wants to go explain but cant in front of her father
the post game party
not as raucous as after the opening game victory
a few players are dancing but most are sitting drinking commiserating
to alvin anybody seen joe
probably out with camille
havent seen darnell either
lattimers sitting on the bed with a coed named leslie
theyre kissing softly light necking
lattimer starts to unbutton her blouse
she begins to demur
i think we better get back downstairs
no leslie were just getting to know each other
starting to get up no i think
lattimer grabs her arm roughly pulls her back to the bed
shes starting to get a little scared
cmon leslie you didnt come up here to stop now
he tries to kiss her again she pushes him away starts for the door
angered that steroid pump in his eyes he grabs her again throws her violently on the bed
what were you doin
leadin me on
he gets on the bed kneels above her
she starts to struggle
he slaps her across the face rips her blouse open
freaked she begins to scream and kick
enraged lattimer slaps her around picks her up shakes her like a rag doll slaps her some more throws her to the floor
picks her up again when suddenly the door bursts open and bud lite and alvin race in
throwing leslie on the bed again get outa here
bud lite and alvin charge lattimer try to wrestle him down but his hormone level is so high he fights like a bull
two other players charge in and finally all four are able to shackle lattimer
he continues to struggle a bit then gives up a panting sweating shaking hulk
this is it man
no more roids
this shit has gotta stop
lattimer breaks down and cries
joe lies on his bed a bottle of vodka next to his coca cola
he stares at the larger than life cardboard stand up of himself
he takes a drink then gets up and grabs his jacket
the phone rings
he looks at it a beat then walks out of the room
camilles on the phone waiting the one calling joe
she listens a few more rings hangs up concerned
winters sits at the main console replaying the game ending interception over and over
the phone rings
the rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on in winters office
all the assistant coaches are there
it looks like this will blow over
the girls father is a big booster contributed a lotta money
so he said they wont go to the press
he said that
yeh hes not exactly happy about all this but he doesnt wanta hurt the program
were still gonna have to suspend lattimer
there arent any charges
nobody outside the program knows about this
hes outa control lyle
we cant ignore this anymore
i dont know what pisses me off more that hes juicin or that hes doin such a shitty job of hidin it
hes never tested positive
if we suspend him without proof he could sue us for jeopardizing his draft status his pro career
yeh but we cant sit and wait till he kills somebody
i hate to lose him as much as you do but we gotta clean him up before he does somethin that lands the whole program on probation
plus we have to take some action or the girls dad is gonna start havin second thoughts
i dont care how many checks hes written
so what do we do
all eyes go to winters
bring him down here
close on a contrite but shaken steve lattimer
why so many
you oughta be grateful i didnt suspend you for the whole year
lattimer nods he knows its true
what are you gonna give as the reason
well say youve got a hamstring pull
relieved thank you coach
dont thank me
during those three weeks you better kick the roids cause when you come back im gonna personally test you before every game
im gonna watch the piss go into the bottle
you got that
barely audible shamed yes sir
start practicing your limp
not the we saw earlier
joe sits at a table in the back with darnell drinking tequila with a beer chaser
both are down in the dumps
at a nearby table theres a group of townies and their girlfriends
coupla real college heroes huh
tearin up the town
first time i ever lost a girl and a game on the same day
guess i never really had the girl
joe looks up to see one of the townies girls debbie giving him the once over and a little smile
joe smiles back not really interested
debbies boyfriend notices
you know that guy
then why you smilin at him
i dont know
he looks like that e
joe whats his name
so you go and smile at him
the boyfriend drunk and looking for trouble goes over to joes table
you been lookin at my girlfriend
a little drunk himself i dont know
which one is she
wise guy huh
the one who choked his ass off today
you got nothin better to do then look at my girlfriend
joe says nothing
hey heisman im talkin to you
you too good to talk to me
im not even interested in talkin to you
you think youre a bad ass
you think my girls hot for you
take your pads off youre just another pussy
joe gets up to go
the boyfriend grabs him joe pushes him away
the guy charges joe
the bar owner rushes to the phone as a full scale brawl begins
joe takes a blow knocks the boyfriend back into a table knocking beer bottles to the floor
the boyfriend falls on one opening a deep gash in his shoulder
grabbing him cmon we gotta get outa here
a speeding car goes by us weaving crossing the yellow line on the curves
joes driving darnells holding on
suddenly we hear sirens
joe sees flashing lights in the rear view mirror
winters is asleep
the phone rings
he picks it up
what is it now
joe sits across the desk from winters just the two of them
the guy went for me first
what was i supposed to do
doesnt make any difference
it made the papers all the wire services
the guy had to go to the hospital
worst of all they got you on drunk driving
you had a blood alcohol level
above the legal limit
we cant smooth that over joe
itd look like we were sprayin pledge on bird shit
we had to agree to send you to rehab
ill be a god damn joke
you cant do this to me
it was the only way we could get them to drop the assault and d
you go to trial on those we lose you for a year and risk ncaa investigation
cmon lotsa athletes have been through rehab
not in the middle of the season
not in the middle of a heisman campaign
youll only miss four games
youll be back in time for the last one georgia tech and a bowl if we get there
plus youve still got your senior year
yeh but what will i come back as
what kinda player
dont worry youll still be the man
youll still be the leader of this team
joe doesnt believe it but he manages a nod as he gets up to leave
im sorry coach
these things happen
joe walks on out winters watches him go then slams the desk in anger
drained he sinks back in his chair
darnells walking across campus toward class
autumn sees him calls out to him
cmon darnell i wanta talk to you
darnell doesnt slow up
autumn has to run to catch up
where you been i been callin you
darnell im sorry about saturday
it was an awkward situation
it wasnt awkward
it was educational
i realized how you see me
im good enough to tutor to go places with but not to tell your father about
thats not it
its just that my father expects me to be with somebody like ray
he wouldnt understand us
stopping why not
i dont know
he likes ray cause
hes a good student he acts right
he doesnt need football
hes class and im not right
i didnt say that
you dont have to autumn
im everything your dad used to be and dont want you fallin back into
you were right before autumn
i should have another tutor
thanks for everything you did for me
darnell walks away
autumn can only watch him go
joe finishes packing his bags
he sees a picture of camille on the dresser
picks it up looks at it a beat drops it in the trash
he carries his heisman cardboard standup into the shower pulls out a match and lights it
he watches it catch fire then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room
we hold on the burning standup as flames lick at joes smile
joe is shown into his room
he drops his bag sags onto the bed
four fuckin weeks
a tired and depressed group of e
football players undress after practice
bud and alvin sit in their pads lattimer standing in street clothes
bud softly sings dont cry for me argentina
shit the defense is gonna have to pitch shutouts now
to lattimer and youre gone for
what the hell did you take that shit for
nobody seemed to mind when i was knockin peoples dicks in the dirt
i bust chops too
i dont have to get all fucked up
not everybody has the ability you do alvin
you do what you have to do to play
well youre not playin much now are you
shit whole fuckin season down the drain
winters and galen howard are walking across the field after practice
the stadium is deserted
i been talkin to chancellor wilson
whats he wanta do now cut practice down to once a week
no hes happy with the way the seasons gone so far
the alumni have pretty much stayed off his back but with joe out now it could all be up for grabs again
he thinks hes gonna have trouble marchin the ball down the old fund raisin board huh
the facts are all we have left are freshman quarterbacks and nothin i saw at practice today convinced me that any of them are ready to step in
what are you sayin
we gotta get bobby collins back
wilson say that
he didnt have to
forget it galen collins is no all star either
yeh but hes good enough to get us a split of the next four games
look just because youre wilsons boy all of a sudden doesnt mean im gonna let him make me look like a fuckin whore
dont give me that high and mighty shit
theres a lotta people on the bubble here
four straight loses and were out of bowl contention
hows that gonna make you look
if youre too stupid to consider your own situation then maybe you oughta think about your assistant coaches
theyve got families to feed too
howard walks away pissed off leaving winters alone in the middle of the field
the seven members of the board of regents sit on one side of a long rectangular table the chairman in the middle
on the other side are coach winters bobby collins the president of the faculty senate edward learnihan academic advisor arthur shane president of the student body richard fowler and galen
fowler is addressing the board
therefore i respectfully submit that bobby collins should not be given special treatment just because hes a football player
would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if theyde been caught cheating
nobodys talking about letting the girl who took the test back in
winters could kill this kid
i think its also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken
beginning golf voice and speech improvement
id like to point out that mr
collins was still on schedule to get his degree
pointing to collins transcript in what swimming pool management
would you like to respond coach winters
winters rises sweating less from nervousness than from the odious nature of what he has to do
i dont know much about all this other stuff but i do know the punishment should fit the crime
cheatings bad but i dont think it deserves a life sentence
heres one of those athletes who takes college level courses who wants to graduate
i think bobby collins made a big mistake but hes already been suspended for several weeks
hes served his time
i think he deserves a second chance
like alvin mack
we gave him a second chance and since hes had incompletes withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level
youre using his body to make money for the athletic department you yourself are making three times what the chancellor is but obviously no one is making an effort to
see that this kid gets an education
hes helpin to pay for your physics lab too
if youre willin to go without a new office maybe i could hold him out a few games
save his body
alvin was way behind in school when he got here
you cant make up for in four years what it took to create
then he should never have been admitted in the first place
its not fair to other students who worked hard to get here
is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools
you hold everybody to the same standards youre discriminating against the poor kids
most of my players are farm boys inner city kids
football is their deliverance
deliverance from what
a valid education
you throw bobby collins and alvin out you take away their futures
in alvins case you probably cost him a couple million dollars in the pros
but this is not a football vocational school
its an institute of higher learning
yeh but when was the last time people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment
gentlemen please lets get back to the business at hand bobby collins
as you know i played football here
and i remember how hard it was to practice and then study when youre dead tired
so i have some sympathy for this young man
but i never cheated so the real question is his character
since you know him better than anyone else in this room and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks do you feel hes learned his
in other words can you vouch for his character
winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade
its killing him yes sir i can
bobby collins breaks into a wide triumphant smile
learnihan and winters come down the steps their faces set
as they split off another case like this ill take it all the way up to the governor
dont mess with me learnihan
ill have you teachin study hall
bobby collins walks in prior to practice
his teammates gather round slap him on the back high five etc
winters watches from his office disgusted
coach winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his upcoming opponent its like hes looking through it though his mind elsewhere something boiling up inside him
suddenly he smashes his fist into the screen breaking it into pieces
his hand bleeds
he doesnt care
he just sits there and seethes
camilles on the phone
hello my name is camille schaeffer
id like to speak to joe kane
joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket
a nurse knocks on his door
youve got a phone call
a camille schaeffer
joe says nothing not wanting to deal with this
she says shes your girlfriend i dont want to talk to her
the nurse leaves
joe gets up goes to the wall and starts pounding it with his right hand
im sorry he doesnt wish to speak to you right now
crushed and angry camille hangs up
bud lite is watching television
louanne enters on her way to bobby collins room carrying an armload of neatly pressed laundry
but lite gets up to bar her way
hey louanne how ya doin
fine bud ya know
goin to j
hopin to get back in here next year
just came by to give bobby some laundry i did for him
you two seein each other again
yeh he was even talking about us gettin a place off campus together until he got reinstated
i dont know how i woulda told my dad
bud just nods blankly
louanne starts to head for bobbys room
pained to say it i wouldnt go in there right now
bud doesnt have the heart to tell her
she finally realizes bobbys with another girl
guess im pretty stupid when it comes to men
i never learn do i
i think maybe men are just stupid when it comes to you
if you ever feel like ya know just talkin sometime gettin a beer let me know
my schedules pretty open
thanks bud handing him the clothes give him these will ya
louanne fighting back tears walks back down the hall with as much dignity as she can muster
winters comes to the door hesitates walks in and finds joe huddled on his bed
i wanta talk to you
joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up
dont sit up
if you can
joe gets unsteadily to his feet
he feels sick
winters reaches out to shake hands
joe does not reciprocate
hides his right hand behind his body
whats the matter joe
you wont shake hands with me
joe is silent you dont want me to see your hand do you
more silence so i guess what i heard was true huh
you been poundin the walls with your passin hand right
silence i tell you what joe you want to hit somethin hit me
joe doesnt move
i said hit me
im the one who put you in here
dont hit the damn wall
it aint the walls fault
go on hit me right now
joe is angry but he doesnt want to do anything about it
who else you wanta hit huh
youre daddy maybe
cause hes a no show prick
well im a daddy too and not a very good one at that
so just hit me instead
ill take your daddys beatin for him
go on you want to
hit me damnit
joe shakes his head
pushes joe in the chest hit me
im not gonna leave you alone until you hit me
shakes joe by shoulders the guysll thank you
theyve always wanted to do it
so do it now damnit
joe sinks to his knees
winters stares down at him then kneels also his own anger and frustration draining away
joe its o
i guess i need it more than you do
pause you gotta quit beatin up on yourself
let me see that hand
joe reveals his hand
its barked and cut but not badly swollen
playfully you can still throw with it you fuckin mook
pause look the nurses say this is the toughest time for you right now
i thought id stick around a little case you wanta play some cards pick a fight with the wall again whatever
you dont have to
yes i do
lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia
he carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into his toilet
syringes vials and bottles of pills all tumble into the water
the sun shines through the window
joe wakes up raises up looks over at winters who is asleep in a chair
joe gives him a little smile hes allright
winters gives him a nod of approval
detailing the timberwolves progress over the next four games
players shaking hands at midfield after the game
the scoreboard reads e
darnell in study hall with his new tutor concentrating on her explanation applying himself
steve lattimer in street clothes paces the sidelines jumping up and down in frustration his hamstring bandaged to sell the injury ruse
he catches himself gets back on his crutches
a newspaper fades up through the shot
it reads wolves offense fires blanks in loss to texas
darnell sits in a cafe drinking coffee and studying
ray comes in his arm around a co ed monica
they buy a pastry and leave not having seen darnell
darnell ponders this a second goes back to studying
a group of patients is gathered around a t
set in the rehab center watching a pre game show
one goes to joes room where joes lying on his cot
hey joe dont you wanta watch the game
its on cable
joe leans back staring at the ceiling
sportscaster dallas perry is holding forth on the local evening news
on the strength of a yard touchdown run by freshman darnell jefferson squeaked by the north carolina tarheels today to keeping their bowl hopes alive
darnell with his books on the way to the library passes the frat house where the victory party is in progress
he sees ray and autumn walking together
autumn sees him her face lights up
he gives her a slight smile keeps walking
she watches him with a certain longing
darnell alone in the library late at night studying
lattimer carrying his gear bag walks into the locker room
his teammates come over to shake his hand slap him on the back welcome him back to the team
joe sits on his bed listening to the e
hoping to get past a tough iowa hawkeyes team in their last game before the return of star quarterback joe kane
defense is on the field
alvin moves up opposite the offensive guard
i know you motherfucker
youre the prick who got my little sister pregnant
we aint seen you around lately
where you been huh
answer me motherfucker or im gonna peel your cap
the ball is hiked
iowa runs a sweep left
lattimer tries to get outside to contain but is blocked by the fullback who goes low and cuts his legs out from under him
alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the corner then suddenly cuts back
alvin has overrun the play slightly
we go to slow motion as he turns and is hit with a wicked crack back block by the guard he taunted
alvins leg flexes at a horrifying angle
we hear the snap of bone and tendon as alvin plummets to the ground writhing in pain grabbing his left leg
the doctor and trainers sprint out to the field
we move in on joes face as harvey is heard on the radio in the b
oh boy this does not look good harmon
theyre bringing the stretchers out
joes eyes close
he knows what this means
alvin is being strapped on the stretcher
wailing in pain oh shit oh shit ill kill that motherfucker
an ambulance carrying alvin emerges from the stadium
we hear cheering inside the siren outside
twelve seconds left iowa driving for the winning touchdown
fourth and goal at the one
trying to hold on without their star middle linebacker alvin mack
defensive line digs in
lattimer tries to suck up his remaining strength
iowa runs a blast to lattimers side
he fights through one block the ballcarrier coming right toward him
they meet in a titanic collision at the goal line
the back keeps driving twisting
lattimer tries to hold him but weaker than he was on steroids is unable to
the back falls over the goal line
as the iowa players celebrate all around him lattimer sits where he fell a beaten and humiliated young man
coach youve lost two of your last four
coach winters faces the press
why do your teams seem to nose dive at the end of the last couple seasons
this was a tough loss but this aint any nose dive
weve had some key players out but if we win next week well still win the conference and go to a major bowl on new years day
i mean i know you guys cant write but i thought you could at least count
alvin lies on a bed his leg bandaged and elevated
hes still a little groggy from anesthetic
coach winters stands beside him
you look good alvin
yeh i feel o
any of the guys been down yet
hell you know how football players are about hospitals and injuries
several beats of silence
then im never gonna play again am i
doctors arent always right alvin
but i just want you to know
youre the best defensive football player i ever coached
winters comes forward hugs him around the head gives him a smile walks out
tears brim in winters eyes as he leaves
alvins head goes back against the pillow
tears arent brimming here
theyre rolling down his cheeks
joe walks out with his suitcase
coach winters waits for him
shakes his hand
they get in the car
im proud of you joe
i know you had a difficult time
michigan is easy right
bourbon is tough
they share a laugh
winters pulls out two sets of round trip airline tickets
i got somethin for ya
coupla round trip tickets
go see your dad
get it cleaned up
joe takes the tickets just looks at him
on the phone im gonna have to take a test with the coach right there
you sure you got somethin better than blockers
this guy is foolproof
see ya saturday
lattimer hangs up picks up a hypodermic
stares at it a second sweat beading on his forehead
then plunges it an inch deep into his thigh
pulls it out sits on the bed a beat then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously biceps bulging
the coach is facing ray and darnell across his desk
i wanta do something different for this game
try to maximize our speed but keep you both in the lineup at the same time
ray im moving you to fullback
darnell youre startin at tail
ray is stunned darnell elated but neither says a word
ray youll be carrying the ball less and blocking more but theyll still have to respect your running and pass catching ability
not everybody can make a transition like this
you think you can handle it
tight lipped yes sir
we cant afford any hang dogs
camille comes off the court after tennis practice
shes surprised to find joe waiting for her
cool hello joe

good im happy for you
she starts to walk away heading for the bike racks
camille hold on o
im sorry that i didnt want

you couldnt even talk to me
what happened to theres somethin goin on between you and me
camille gets on her bike
cmon camille i was embarrassed
and pedals off
shouting after her i couldnt understand why anybody would wanta talk to me
she just keeps on going
a bus comes up the hill toward us on the main street of joes sooty little home town the huge stacks of moribund steel works filling the sky in the
the bus stops at a corner
joe steps off
hes not planning on staying long
joe goes to the front door
knocks gets no answer pushes the door open walks through the messy cluttered house to the back porch
seated in a metal folding chair smoking a cigarette looking out at the yard is joes dad
hes got a couple days growth of beard and although not drunk now he has the look of one
how ya doin dad
surprised to see him joe
they throw you out
i heard about your little set to
they had it on the news here
yeh they sent me to rehab
we know what thats worth
your brothers been through it three times
joe nods sadly
so what are you doin here
ive been thinking about some things dad
thats what that damn rehabll do
make you think about a lotta things you cant do nothing about
i kinda been wonderin why you never came to any of my games
all those years
oh i dont know
i guess i didnt wanta make you nervous
you mighta tried too hard and screwed up
or i mighta done real well
which woulda been harder on you dad
sensing the anger what do you mean
mighta made you feel bad
like maybe it wasnt written someplace that we all gotta go on our ass
like maybe you coulda done somethin more if youde tried a little harder
or maybe i didnt wanta see you gettin all excited all pumped up with pride when i knew one day it would all come crashin down
just like it did
i think i spent the last couple years hopin id die before that day
but you know what dad
that day came and im still here
and i got one more game this year
i dont know how well ill play or even how much but i want you there
how would you feel introducing your drunk dad to all your friends
you think about that
i could live with it if you could
handing him a ticket heres a ticket
fifty yard line
if you dont come ill never ask you again
and good luck
they give each other a short quick hug
joe walks back through the house
his dad stares out at the yard
darnell is up late again studying at one of the tables
he hears footsteps becomes aware of the presence of another person
he looks up to see autumn
havent seen him since the night i saw you
hed been goin out
why didnt you tell me
didnt wanta win you over that way
darnell looks back at his books
i just wondered how your studying was comin
you ready for tomorrow
i hope so
i been workin pretty hard
sitting down i talked to my dad last night
hows he doin
we talked about you
what did you say
eyes brimming i told him id gone out with you
i told him i wished i could still go bowling
darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet
he hugs her
darnell is bent over his test booklet
he writes furiously stops to think starts writing again
joe takes a snap fades to pass throws an out
the ball flutters badly falling short
i doubt if we can start him
simmering hes worse than that
hes outa shape
blowing his whistle all right thats enough for today
practice is cancelled
everybody off the field but kane
the players hesitate cmon what the hell are you standin around lookin at
get outa here
the players surprised at this turn of events begin to file off
even the coaches are baffled
winters walks over to joe who has no idea what this is about
didnt do much while you were in there did ya
well we didnt exactly have a team
you couldve worked out on your own
i had some other things to worry about
well were gonna make up for lost time
well start by hoppin the steps
hoppin the steps
what youre gonna punish me now
dont talk back to me joe
ill kick your ass
i went easy on you cause you had to get through detox but thats out to sea now
you let this team down you let this program down
start those steps
hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot laboring as he passes winters halfway up
now the left
joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the steps his quadriceps bursting with pain
hanging by his arms moving hand over hand along the crossbar of the goalpost panting with fatigue winters watching from below
bone weary now
winters has him run yards get down and do pushups run another yards do more pushups etc
joe staggers the yards drops to do his pushups can only do
winters yanks him to his feet pushes him forward to run again
guys who busted their butts all year
because of you they might not win the conference
because of you they might not go to a bowl
barely able to stand i didnt wanna leave
i just screwed up
you dogged on them
stopping exhausted no no i never dogged
i worked my ass off
i played hard
pushing him forward then you shoulda stayed in shape
keep runnin dammit
wobbling starting to break down i always played hard
i gave my everything for you
when you came to the center i thought you were really worried about me
but you dont give a shit
were all just a buncha sled dogs
if you had another guy who could throw youda left me in the fuckin hospital
falling to his knees sobbing the only thing that matters is the program the god damn program
winters pushes joe down to do his pushups
joe has to strain mightily to do two
nobody forced you to play football joe
not me not the program nobody
but when you sign on you commit yourself to pay the price to do whatever it takes
well you havent paid the price yet
you still owe this team
you owe this team big time
walking away get a shower
joe tries to get up but collapses face down on the turf as winters continues to walk away
lattimer lies on a table a catheter tube going into his side
a doctors aide supervises
lattimers dealer is there
whats this doin
takin doped urine outa your bladder and puttin clean back in
call it an oil change
coach winters watches unknowingly as lattimer pees the catheterized urine into a cup
the team is gathered around
conspicuous among them is lattimer whos painted his face like a skeleton
coach winters is whipping them up with a pre game rant
gotta get it done today boys
gotta ring that bell
minutes of mean
nothin but snot bubbles
gotta ring that bell gotta ring that championship bell
shouting ding motherfucking dong
pumped to the gills the e
team explodes in yells and races out into the tunnel
the yelling continues over and mixes with the cheering of the crowd as wolves movin left to right on your radio dial
looking to generate some offense
theyve been up and down the last few weeks
angle on bobby collins in the huddle
they break and the e
offense comes to the line
collins calls signals
we go to slow motion as he fades to pass
darnell fakes a block then rolls out for a screen pass
georgia techs defensive line comes hard
bobby flips the ball over the charging defenders
darnell catches it gets a good block from bud lite then tucks in behind ray who is out ahead blocking
theres only one linebacker to beat and darnell will be into the secondary
figuring ray will block the guy darnell begins to look for the safeties
ray however barely brushes the linebacker who doesnt even break stride
he lowers his head and drives into darnell his helmet hitting the football
theres a scramble
the yellow jackets free safety comes up with it
the crowd and the e
bench quickly deflated sit back down
darnell gets to his feet glares at ray but says nothing
he knows ray tanked the block
alvin sits alone in the living room listening to the e
game on the radio his leg propped up on an apple crate
his mother mends a pair of jeans in the b
so the wolves defense has held after the fumble and the yellow jackets will opt for the field goal
around a yarder
ball is down its away its long enough
georgia tech jumps out on top
alvins mother looks to see if theres any reaction from alvin
bobby collins fades back to pass is rushed throws a quick sideline but its a little short
the yellow jackets cornerback sprints up intercepts it and runs yards down the sideline for a touchdown
collins back to pass rushed now fires out in the flat
its picked off by hill
down the sideline
hes gonna go in untouched
touchdown georgia tech
a discouraged bunch of e
players drag into the locker room
some swear some bang their lockers
cmon guys were only down ten
lets get our fuckin shit together
darnell marches over to rays locker
you missed that block on purpose didnt you asshole
youre full of shit
you fumble you try to blame me
its autumn isnt it
thats what this is all about
the hell with autumn
you just cant take a hit
infuriated darnell goes for ray and they start swinging
darnell tackles ray they roll on the floor still swinging trying to beat the shit out of each other
finally several players manage to pull them apart
coach winters charges over
dont tell me who started it
i dont care
all i care about is this football team
we win together
we lose together
so whatever your problem is get over it
i dont want any more of this shit
as for the rest of you guys
heres what i think of the way you played
winters walks over to a table set up with cups of orange juice and gatorade
he swipes the cups off the table creating a small flood on the floor
then turns the table over
the players are shocked
theyve seldom seen him like this
pointing toward the yellow jackets locker room theyre laughin at you over there
makin plans for the evening
they never dreamed itd be this easy
you guys are nothin but bugs splattered on their windshield
you better stock up on potato chips cause youre gonna be watching a lotta t
on new years day
winters walks away as the players are left to contemplate their mistakes
winters goes over to joe
get warm joe
youre startin the second half
joe nods excited but uncertain
winters moves on to ray griffen
by the way
dont let me see you miss anymore blocks
players return to their bench for the start of the second half gather in a circle
joe looks up in the stands to the seat he reserved for his father
joe takes the snap from center fumbles it falls on it
joe looks to throw over the middle waits too long is sacked
joe underthrows darnell coming out of the backfield
clayton approaches winters on the sideline
joes too tentative too cautious out there
he seems flat
maybe we oughta give collins another shot
joe just needs to get the feel back
hell be allright
sam we cant afford to wait
snapping i said hell be allright
georgia tech up to nothing
the wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here
their defense has been keepin them in it
as he starts off the bench for the field coach winters comes up to him
joe i know that rehab was good for you
got rid of a lotta bad habits
but what about the rest of you
what happened to the joe kane that used to take command of this team the joe kane these guys id run through a bulldozer for
they put him out with the trash
what are you waitin for somebody to feel sorry for you cause youve had some problems
nobody in this stadium gives a shit
its time to step up joe
time to sit at the head of the table
as joe comes into the huddle
hes all business now
all right weve held these guys up long enough
give me time back here and ill rip em apart
shift green bolt
joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage yells go
the ball is snapped joe drops back hits darnell on the sideline
in quick succession we see joe complete a yarder to ray over the middle
fades to pass is rushed
forced out of the pocket scrambles for his life manages to get down to the yard line
he gets up surveys the distance to pay dirt
nice bit of scrambling by kane to get it to the four but its gonna bring up fourth and goal
no doubt about it with theyve gotta go for it here if theyre gonna get back in this game
winters puts his arm around ray who will take the play into the huddle
give it to me up the gut coach
theyve been ignoring me
i know i can score
no were gonna go with the sweep
winters gives ray a shove and he runs onto the field
ray is upset angry
he swears to himself
ray enters the huddle whispers in joes ear
the team breaks out comes to the line
joe looks over the defense screams signals as the crowd noise is building
we go to slow motion as the ball is snapped
ray takes one step forward then turns right leading the play
joe pitches to darnell who follows ray
georgia techs outside linebacker comes up to stop the play
ray stumbles before he can make the block
he drops out of our picture
darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline
the linebacker and cornerback are closing both have the angle on him
darnell starts to cut back
he lowers his shoulder to take the linebackers blow
suddenly out of nowhere ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker knocking him back into the cornerback taking them both out
darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line
the stands erupt
its the first thing theyve had to cheer about all day
winters just looks at the clock goes over to talk to his defense
darnell foregoes his touchdown dance
he runs over to ray grabs him by the helmet
monster block man
monster motherfuckin block
they butt heads and run off the field softly to himself all right defense
lets get evil
kill em all let the paramedics sort em out
georgia tech has the ball
they break their huddle
third and one
the wolves have got to stop them on this play if theyre gonna get the ball back
a first down here and its all she wrote
is out of timeouts
the georgia tech quarterback fakes to his fullback hands off to his tailback on the countertrap
the tailback runs behind his big pulling tackle both right at lattimer
lattimer takes on the tackle sheds his block
the back lowers his head starts to power into lattimer
lattimer lets out a fierce yell
lattimer explodes into the tailback the collision lifting the back off the ground whiplashing his neck vibrating his helmet
lattimers legs churn driving the tailback back and into the ground
we see the backs face
there are snot bubbles in his nose
no first down
lattimer jabs both arms in the air
the crowd goes nuts as the defense slaps helmets and runs off the field windmilling their arms whipping up the crowd
winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field
he meets lattimer looks into his eyes
sees the steroids there
he knows its the only way the kid could have done it
decides not to bust him
lattimer knows it
winters gives his helmet a little slap more in sympathy than praise
he catches the snap boots the ball away
darnell fields it at his starts toward the right sideline where hemmed in he looks like dead meat
suddenly he reverses his field racing for the opposite sideline where a picket line of blockers awaits him if he can get there
he turns on the jets barely beating two tacklers to the corner and then turns it up the left sideline picking up a wicked series of crack back blocks until
hes finally run out of bounds at the yellow jacket yard line
fans are on their feet
winters races over to joe
time for plays
if its not open in the end zone take the sideline
as the offense runs onto the field winters checks the scoreboard
joe brings the wolves up
ball on the yellow jacket
kane barking signals
joe takes the snap drops to pass finds no one rolls away from the rush
just as hes about to go out of bounds he fires a bullet down the sideline
ray griffen catches it and goes out of bounds at the twelve
joe runs over to coach winters knowing they have no more time outs as the refs move the chains
field goal here ties it but a tie may not get the wolves into a bowl
tough decision for winters
to joe you want me to send in the kicking team or you think you can handle it
give me the ball
lets do inside slot left blue lightning
joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle as the crowds roar goes off the charts
in huddle o
inside slot left blue lightning
lets put the women and children to bed and go lookin for fuckin dinner
he starts the wolf howl
the others join in howling for all theyre worth eleven jacked up warriors
they clap and break the huddle
the crowd is standing waving fists in unison toward the georgia tech end zone
joe looks up in the stands again at the seat he left for his father
its still empty
this ones for you dad
joe starts to call signals as bud lite sings bali hi
we go to slow motion as the ball is snapped
the georgia tech defense fires off the line throwing everything at joe
joe drops back five steps
bud lite picks up a blitzing linebacker knocks him over a fallen player
joe looks for darnell in the corner but another pass rusher breaks through forcing joe out of the pocket
its wartime as tackles and blockers collide hand fight go down scramble up collide again all in pursuit of joe
darnell realizing joes in trouble breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone
joe dodges one tackler shakes free of anothers ankle tackle heads back for the center of the field
he spots darnell breaking between defensive backs
just as hes buried by two massive linemen joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that darnell is heading for
the ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker
darnell and two defensive backs one from each side close on the ball as it cuts through the air a perfect spiral
the two defensive backs dive
the ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch landing in darnells
he clutches it to his chest rolls over holds the ball up for the ref to see
this time darnell does go into his touchdown dance
the crowd including autumn and her dad goes crazy
winters just gives a few quick nods watching almost wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other knowing none of them will hug him
joe bud and the others mob darnell
alvin listens to the celebration a few beats then switches off the radio knowing this is an experience hell never be a part of again
we leave him staring off into an uncertain future
the chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory congratulating each other
conspicuous among them are the fat cat alumnus who gave darnell the money and the chairman of the board of regents
looks like the timberwolves are back
probably brought the library with them
turning to galen howard give my sincere congratulations to coach winters
hell be delighted
the fat cat alumnus goes to a replica of the building fund football field and starts advancing the ball
this brings applause all around
as darnell comes off the field autumn runs out and hugs him leads him to her dad
daddy you remember darnell
yes i do
great catch darnell
thank you sir
i got somethin for you
darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat stained piece of paper
my entrance exam
coach winters said you got an
he looked it up
laughing ill kill him
walking toward the tunnel acknowledging the plaudits of the fans
he looks for camille doesnt see her
coach winters comes up next to him
hell of a throw joe
good to see you back
winters gives him a quick but firm hug
and dont worry about the heisman
well gear up for it next year
joe manages a weary smile
coming down the tunnel bobby collins next to him
both stop as louanne walks toward them
bobby smiles to himself in anticipation of her fawning over him
she walks right by him and up to bud
you still feel like gettin a beer
bobby quickly looks around for someone else to hit on hails a cheerleader
bud and louanne walk off together
louanne stops when she sees her father fearful of his reaction
hes not a football player any more
hes graduating this year
hes still got a bowl game
louanne waits not sure whether her fathers angry or not
so make sure he doesnt violate curfew
winters returns it and walks away
sitting on the bench his head in his hands weeping
an amazing conclusion to a great season
we can see steve lattimer down on the bench weeping tears of joy as e
goes back to a bowl for the first time in three years
these are not tears of joy but a man boy who knows hell never be able to play pro football without steroids
joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging quad paths
camille approaches from the opposite direction stops when she sees joe
what are you doin here
waitin for you
i figured youde have to come through here on your way to dinner
this softens relaxes her a bit
shouldnt you be out celebrating
you played real well
i need your help with somethin
i know im not your favorite guy right now but its all startin again
the expectations the pressure the talk about the heisman next year
i was wonderin if youde like to go somewhere maybe share a six pack with me
camilles shocked that he might be drinking again
he pulls a six pack of up out from behind his back
she laughs in spite of herself
they settle again
i miss you camille
i dont like bein without you
ill think about it
they look at each other a beat come forward into a long kiss and embrace as we pull up and back
coach winters flanked by humes and clayton walks down the tunnel to a waiting car
no effigy this time
tickets are in your coat
itinerary and player profiles in the briefcase
we got a am tomorrow in baltimore with the kid from park
then were on to
they continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season another year in the annals of the program
