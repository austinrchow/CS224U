they belong to a female chimpanzee bright eyes
she sits in a tree with alpha her mate large and muscular a prominent white birthmark across his shoulder like a around them under the tree canopy a community of
chimpanzees naps eats plays
a dozen poachers on horseback slog through the jungle
theyre working towards the grove visible in the distance
as they near it the leader points sending the men moving quietly nets and rifles ready
alpha sits up sensing something
birds take sudden flight
he stands on the branch and yells out a warning
fear ignites the community but too late
poachers burst into the clearing horses hooves kicking up dirt
bright eyes wants to stay by alphas side but he bares his teeth and sends her off
then he drops landing firmly on the clearing floor
all around him poachers pursue terrified apes nets swinging
male chimpanzees jump up and down shouting and screeching an aggressive show
a futile attempt to protect the tribe
alpha zeroes in on a poacher attempting to scoop up a young chimp
he streaks across the clearing knocks the poacher alpha pounds his chest letting out a battle cry trying to rally a counter attack
but the other chimps pay no heed
theres no organization to the defense
shots ring out
the chimps mauling the poacher drop one by one
others take off
alpha spots bright eyes across the clearing dragged off in a net
he rushes to save her leaps in the air
two faces wearing surgical masks lean in and peer down at us
franklin broken horn rimmed glasses and caroline curly red hair under a sterile cap
nanotherapy beta version tuesday march
female test subject number four
franklin reaches for us smiles
here we go bright eyes
a mist fogs our view for a moment
not too much
she needs to be calm but alert
go ahead send her through
a loud hum and we start moving sliding into a tunnel a tubular ct scan with a mirror on the top
now we see our face reflected a female ape in a gas mask
will rodman late twenties lab coat over a t shirt and jeans stands at the glass watching the terrified chimpanzee slide into the machine
the focus in his eyes belies the casual dress
start the scan
a techie sits at a computer screen beside will
another tech donnie skinny tattooed controls the machine sending the restrained animal into the scanner
caroline moves to an iv stand beside the scan
the bags full of a phosphorescent green liquid
stuff looks like kool aid
go ahead im sure you could use it
starting the therapy
will looks at a monitor showing the brain scan of the chimp
the image starts to shake
concerned he looks to the other room where he can see the chimps legs shaking in their shes convulsing
caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube listens to bright eyes heart
please keep the monkey still
he focuses back on the monitor
shes not a monkey
will looks from the monitor to caroline
his look is intense tough to read
she blushes slightly at the heat of his gaze
shes an ape
chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans theyre all apes
good to know
just keep it from moving
shes stung wonders why does he have to be such a jerk sometimes
hes oblivious to this instead intent on getting the scan right
the green liquid moves through the chimps neck
here we go
will stares at the scan his eyes willing the test to succeed
the green liquid lights up the chimps brain
will fights a contraction of extreme emotion that passes across his face
he quickly hides it offers up a smile for the others
were on our way
what is this
caroline holds up a picture of a tree for bright eyes who sits at a table in front of a lexigram a lit up board with colorful symbols
bright eyes presses a button
caroline holds up a picture of an acorn
the chimp presses another button
where does the acorn come from
bright eyes considers
then presses a button
yes but where does the acorn come from
bright eyes interrupts now pressing three buttons
the chimp looks at caroline whos stunned trying to process the advanced thinking just manifested
then she presses another button
the unnatural voice paired with bright eyes eerily human like gaze is somehow creepy
the image freezes and we
diplomas on the wall books everywhere
bright eyes looks out at will from a computer screen
hes got two ct scans sitting on the desk in front of him
we started the therapy four weeks ago
this was yesterday
wills studying the scans
they look good
theres been clear cell growth
both on the frontal lobe and the neocortex
shes purposely standing close in order to point this out
he notices but doesnt respond theres history between them and hes regretting that gets in the way
i see that
but i dont understand the primate behavioral norms
she knows an acorns a seed
wouldnt any monkey know that
no its conceptual
acorn gives us a tree which gives us an acorn
in a chimpanzee
will turns the possibilities over in his mind
caroline moves away from him
he barely notices her now
youre calling her a monkey just to piss me off arent you
start the others on the
and double this ones dose
will climbs into his truck
alone he allows his excitement to show
he pulls away from the bio lab which is tucked in a corner of an old military base
will drives over the majestic golden gate bridge
will pulls up in front of his house
set in a hillside neighborhood its neat nondescript
the home of a bachelor who hasnt given it much thought
as will pulls into the driveway we hear c sharp played over
walter rodman sits at the piano dressed in a robe stabbing at the key with his finger
will enters his posture almost visually changing with the emotional weight of this man his father
walter looks up whispers
is that you
as thou dost anthony
staring at the keys he hears no music
heavy russian accent hes been doing that all day
a home aide enters grabs her coat
this is irena
he found an old book of his
she pulls a worn paperback of julius caesar from walters pocket
he snatches it from her puts it back
shrugging on coat i had no idea you liked shakespeare so much mr
my mother was the one
she liked shakespeare
good night walter hone ee
she heads out
will gently takes his fathers arm
come on dad
will helps his father change into pajamas
remember i told you we were using basic fibroblast growth factors on the apes
well the therapy seems to be working
weve seen definite signs of adult brain neurogenesis
walter holds up his arms for will to slide on the pajama top
board of directors is coming in a couple weeks to talk about phase thats clinical trials
walter gives no hint hes even listening much less understanding what wills saying
human trials dad
i rather tell that what is to be feared than what i fear for always
i am caesar
theres no way to reach him tonight
still will tries
im going to make you better i swear it
his father looks at him
a moment of recognition
no dad its me
will helps the old man under the bedcovers
he moves to the door pausing to take in the diplomas on the walls walters name on all of them
will looks at his father lying there on his back staring up at the ceiling
the once brilliant man now slipping away
signs of a half eaten frozen dinner on the desk beside numerous papers charts and wills computer
he looks exhausted gulps from a cup of coffee as he works
franklin moves from cage to cage greeting the apes
good morning felix
hey whats the matter dont like my cooking
he pauses in front of bright eyes huddled at the back of her cage
you okay back there
something wrong with bright eyes
ill check on her when were done
franklin unlocks a cage and leads a chimp lucky into the next room where caroline waits beside the ct scanner
luckys head is shaved exposing a long curving scar on his cranium
from bright eyes vantage point she can see through the open door as luckys strapped down
will dressed in an ill fitting suit off the rack hair brushed in an attempt at neatness meets steven jacobs as he steps from a beautiful black jaguar
you could at least try to look excited
wills too nervous to look excited
he eyes the four suits disembarking from nearby town cars
im not good with this stuff
jacobs puts a hand on wills back leads him inside
youll do fine
just speak english
keep the science simple
from the back of her cage bright eyes watches through the open door as the ape on the table convulses
back it out
bright eyes rushes forward her hands gripping the bars so cmon let go she understands what he wants but she wont do it
somethings wrong with number four
franklin looks over hes still dealing with lucky on the table
be right over donnie looks closely at bright eyes
theres something different in her face today
force of will
whats the matter with you
will stands at the head of a table
a big plasma screen behind him shows a blow up of a brain scan
as will speaks he gestures at it with a laser pointer
alzheimers affects the entire neocortex the hippocampus and large subcortical regions of the brain
donnie and bright eyes are at a standoff
once more he tries to open the cage once more she yanks it shut
again he tries
and is taken by surprise when she grabs his hey
now donnies smashed up against the bars
the other apes begin to screech
donnie hasnt panicked quite yet but hes about to
someone get her off of me
hang on franklin struggles to hold onto lucky as caroline hurries over
he eyes the chimps in their cages going crazy
will continues his presentation
stevens looks around at the board members theyre lost
in the past its been impossible to target specific areas both because of the blood brain barrier jacobs stands interrupting will
rodman has done is to invent a virus that can for the first time cross the membrane that protects the brain and deliver a genetic therapeutic payload
trying to sell this payload would directly affect the areas of memory higher function and of course the motherlode intelligence
the board members stare trying to comprehend
deep breath here if phase goes as planned were looking at a cure for alzheimers
with an elbow prompting from jacobs will takes a sample vial from his jacket pocket and awkwardly holds it up for dramatic effect
shes breaking my hand
let go bright eyes
youre hurting him
she tries to help pull donnie away
in the next room franklins having troubles of his own
hit the alarm
caroline lunges to an alarm button and pounds it
loud beeping as two guards look to a black and white screen of a corridor
they see lucky dragging his leash as he scampers unattended down the hall
guard turns to another screen where donnie is visible in hey len
bright eyes is pulling donnies arm right from its socket
donnie falls to the floor at carolines feet
lucky bursts from the lab building and runs across the grounds
he leaps over a car then heads for the nearest building
the room is still thrumming with the excitement of wills pronouncement
what about the safety of the virus
were using the most stable a commotion outside
then a black blur as lucky crashes through the glass window
lucky turns on will with a growl lurching toward him and pinning him to the wall
it happens fast
the chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw exposing deadly a bam
security guard shoots lucky in the back
the chimp turns leaps for the guard who fires again
will watches as the chimp and all of wills dreams collapses on the boardroom table
rain and fog
an ambulance pulls out past police cruisers and two cdc center for disease control vans
will face cut clothing torn finishes with a detective and walks through the chaotic aftermath
he watches caroline walk alongside a stretcher carrying donnie his shoulder packed in ice
he spots jacobs who looks wrecked
he hurries over to him
are they gone
will knows the answer but has to ask anyway
did they say anything before they left
i mean about phase
look around you for christ sakes
well be lucky if we dont go to jail
wills gutted devastated
but were so close
you think youre the only one whos got something at stake here
ive got my own skin in this game
what happened had nothing to do with the
desperate to clarify take an already aggressive animal make it smarter youre going to get a potentially dangerous
what makes you so damned positive about that
pauses for emphasis what if this drug does things you dont understand
are you going to take responsibility for that
because im sure as hell not going to
here will hesitates
were not ready for human trials
hell we werent ready for monkey trials
this is what were going to do youre taking a sabbatical
ill let the board handle the lawsuit
when this blows over ill bring you back and well start over well do it right this time
tiny mice that cant hurt anybody
will finds to his dismay that hes got nothing to say
will stands at the fringes of the room watching men in hazmat suits pull down shelves of metal canisters labeled adv
his work destroyed
will climbs into his truck and pauses
he reaches into a jacket pocket and brings out a vial its the vial of he tap at the window
franklins face appears
will shoves the vial back into his pocket rolls down the window
show you something boss
i dont work here anymore franklin
i just put down fifteen animals dr
the least you could do is give me a moment of your time
wills shoulders sag with exhaustion
its been a long devastating day
the cages are empty the doors open
will notes used syringes on the table filled body bags lined up on the floor
its a creepy horrible scene
theyre all gone
im sorry franklin
whats he got to do to get the hell out of there
franklin ignores him steps inside bright eyes cage
he moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket
at first will doesnt understand what hes looking at
the lightings dim and the things so small
but then it moves and will realizes hes looking at an infant will stares at it for a long moment his brain overloaded
how could a full term gestation go unnoticed
they carry small
must have been pregnant when they brought her in
will tries to get his mind around the situation
who else knows about this
id bring him home but my brother in law works for security
hed rat me out in a second
thats when will realizes
you want me to take him
hes an orphan now
i could be thrown in jail
hes a chimpanzee whos been exposed to a possibly dangerous drug
you dont believe that
doesnt matter what i believe
just for a couple days
until i can find a sanctuary
thats not possible
i heard you outside fighting to keep them alive
i was talking about the work my she was just trying to protect him
bright eyes the mother
thats why she wouldnt let anyone into her cage
will looks down at the helpless baby
im sorry franklin im sorry but theres nothing i can do here
hes got to be put down like the others
tell you what doc
producing a syringe im done for the day
so you be my guest
franklin hands the long needle to will
will can hear the babys wheezy breath
he enters the cage kneels beside it regards his tiny body his little hands
will readies the needle brings it close to the chimps belly
but theres no way he can go through with this
angrily will tosses the needle aside
turns to franklin who watches from outside the cage
then you have to figure it out
a box of diapers pulled from the shelf and tossed into a cart
will moves down the aisle in a daze the baby chimp covered in a blanket plastered to his chest
he stops at the powdered formulas overwhelmed by the array of choices
a teen rings up the baby goods
will pulls up in his truck
wills coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his chest
he barely has the key in the lock when irena opens the door
its friday night
i had a date
im sorry there was she doesnt wait to hear his excuse just moves down the walk her footfalls pointed and angry
he pauses there
apparently no end to this bad day
will dumps the baby goods on the counter heads for the refrigerator
the infants still plastered to his chest
he opens the fridge grabs a crisper drawer empties its contents in the sink
then will reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out the will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion
a high pitched wail comes from another part of the house
will sits up remembering
will enters half asleep turns on the light
the baby chimp lies in a cardboard box on the floor and hes obviously sick making unnatural wheezing noises
will stares down at the little creature trying to decide what to do
will turns on the hot water
shuts the door
holding the limp feeble chimp in his arms he puts down the toilet seat and sits
its going to be okay
awkwardly he even rocks back and forth a little bit
will looks down at the chimp struggling for breath
the room fills with steam
a large male chimpanzee in the wild
he stands at the top of a tree an alpha male eyeing the chimps around him
in a sudden burst of movement the chimpanzee takes off flying from branch to branch with tremendous force a freight teeth bared in a terrifying display the ape easily intimidates
all the chimps around him
abruptly he closes it
looks down at the infant so peaceful in his arms
sound of a toilet flush
the chimp looking like a toddler walks out of the bathroom hiking up a pair of shorts
we follow him through the house as he zig zags up and over furniture
the house looks warmer cluttered more lived in
the chimp arrives at a hallway where he leaps into the air and grabs hold of a cord that hangs from the ceiling
as his weight pulls it down theres a squeak and a fold down ladder opens from above
we follow him up the ladder into
attic day the attic
beams of light streaming through a large vent to the outside
rings and pegs for climbing are set into the walls
toys books and puzzles scattered across the floor
sounds of kids playing and laughing outside
the chimp heads for the vent and peers through
we go over from up here the chimp has a commanding view of the entire neighborhood
a group of children rides bikes
a man mows his lawn
theres a honk below and the chimp watches as a taxi pulls up to the house next door
hunsiker a man in an airline pilot uniform kisses his wife and young daughter alice then climbs into the cab with his carry on suitcase
alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddys taxi disappear around the corner
then todd the big brother swipes the doll from her hand and rides off on his bike
his friends laugh
the chimp watches riveted as the alice bursts into outraged tears and runs after them
the chimp turns at wills call
his name is caesar
will comes away from the ladder heads for the kitchen
the living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games
one of them has been completed
will considers it looks around for the box reads the side
ages and up
caesar runs past jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes
will walks over sits across from him
please pass the ketchup
caesar slides the ketchup to will
using american sign youre welcome
note whenever caesar communicates hes signing and there will be subtitles
a mouse moves through a maze as a lab tech marks its progress
will in a lab coat watches with intensity
the mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it reaches an orange cone at a crossroads
the mouse stops studies the cone
is he going to turn left or right
the mouse turns left at the cone and finds his way to a piece of cheese
will does his best to hide the excitement blooming on his face
there it is
restored cognitive function
same success rate as the primates
visitors buy tickets at the entrance gates
will pulls around to an employee parking lot
molly stewart late s pretty tomboy finishes taking caesars blood pressure
hes right on target
she checks caesars ears
what about diet
a healthy diet
will ignores him
whats he saying
caesars angling to climb off the examining table
will sends him a look out it out
he seems extremely intelligent
how many words does caesar sign
you know the basics
ive heard of apes learning up to a hundred and fifty words
is he good with puzzles
hes pretty good
well caesars healthy obviously happy
youre doing a great job with him
doesnt want to alarm but there is an anomaly i noticed
when i was examining his eyes i noticed a strange green pigmentation
his heart starts to pound
seen it before
she hands will an otoscope
take a look
will peers through the magnification and sure enough finds its faint can you pick it up
he sits down in the nearest chair stunned
she eyes him
want a glass of water
sure that would be good
she gets him one
concerned caesar comes over
forgot to eat today
not a big deal
stewart hands him the glass
he downs it
stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck
carotid pulse is running a little fast
for a human or a chimpanzee
first time hes seen her smile
it lights up her face
gotta remember to eat
will drives caesar both of them licking soft serve ice cream cones
he pulls up outside a store smart child you have to move the whole tower to another peg one block at a time
walters parked in front of the tv not watching it
caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three wooden poles
there are four colored blocks threaded on the first pole stacked biggest to smallest making a tower
irena stands next to will watching caesar
theres also a camcorder on a tripod
heres the hard part you cant put a larger block on top of a smaller one
caesar studies the puzzle
caesars already started
he methodically begins moving blocks from one pole to another pausing backtracking getting it right never a bigger one on top of a smaller
will watches increasingly amazed as he re creates the tower on a different pole
its easy for him
finished caesar looks up at him
will fumbles in his pocket hands caesar some m ms
he did it in fifteen moves
whats the best score
will looks over at walter whos staring at the wall
i wonder where he gets such talent
eyes on walter it was passed down from his mother
will uploads the mpeg video of caesar doing the puzzle and prepares to record an audio attachment
into computer mic at age two caesar appears to exceed his mothers aptitude
he signs over three hundred words
he exhibits no visible side effects from the therapy
will flips on a light
closes the door behind him
taking a key from his pocket he approaches a small padlocked refrigerator and unlocks it
opens the door
inside we see the single vial of adv
will sits on the edge of the sofa the vial of in his hand
hes deep in agonized thought
finally he takes a syringe and fills it with the green liquid
then he stands walks to a closed door
the opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room
walters in bed
he opens his eyes squinting at the brightness
syringe in hand dad
ive got something thats going to make you better
will closes the door behind him
we hear a rhythmic squeaking noise as we
the movement of a swing
caesars strapped in it and we caesars features are more mature
he appears more like a little boy and his eyes have turned a deep green
back and forth caesar goes as high as he can manage
at the height of his forward motion he peers down into the neighbors yard where for just an instant he can see todd at the height of his backward motion
he catches another glimpse
caesar pumps his legs eager to get a better look
wills making sandwiches his eye on caesar through the window
to someone offscreen you want turkey or ham
we find walter just sitting down on the piano bench
he begins playing a competent version of clair de lune
will pauses listening to the music
he moves to the doorway to watch his father
the happiness the relief is clear on his face
squeak of the swing the piano faint from out here
caesar studies the harness thats keeping him in the swing
theres a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back
he undoes the one on his right side
then the left side
caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms
will returns to his sandwich making
it takes him a moment to notice that caesar has disappeared from the swing
the color drains from his face
caesar stands at the edge of the yard unsure what to do next
all three kids todd alice and todds buddy have stopped playing to stare at him
caesar spots a ball lying on the grass
he picks it up and tosses it to todds buddy
the boy catches it throws it back to caesar
he wants to play
thrilled at the contact caesar throws the ball to todd
but todd has an idea and the idea makes him smile
alice doesnt have a good feeling
she watches as her brother throws the ball to his buddy over caesars head
monkey in the middle
todds buddy laughs
caesar laughs too although hes not sure whats funny
will and walter walk down the street looking for caesar
he wont go far
you dont know that
i do dad
todd and his buddy throw the ball over caesars head while caesar jumps to try and catch it
monkey in the middle monkey in the middle
caesars having fun unaware that the game has become keep away from him
until he notices alices expression she theyre making fun of him
monkey monkey monkey
the chanted words ring in caesars ears
he drops his arms and walks over to todd stepping close hot rage escaping from his nostrils
todd tries to laugh it off but the fears plain on his face
alice runs inside
will and walter search down the street
then they hear it a hunsikers yell
will runs for the neighbors house
hunsiker approaches caesar with a raised bat
the terrified chimp backs toward his fence
hah will jumps into the yard and puts himself between hunsiker and caesar
caesar cowers behind him
hold on its okay hes harmless
your monkey came onto my property
threatened my kids
by now caesar has climbed into wills arms burying his head in
will backs toward the gate
it wont happen again
damn right it wont happen again
ill press charges if it does
will holds caesar close and hurries home
what does he do for fun
wills brought caesar in for a check up
hes a little thrown by the question
well weve got puzzles games a swing set
my guess is he needs more
more exercise more space
well work on that
stewart continues examining caesar
will watches her listen to his heart
closing her eyes for a moment listening
he gets up his nerve
what about you
what do you do for fun
she opens her eyes looks at him
he thinks she doesnt understand the question
how about dinner and a movie
stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears
im sorry did you say something
he starts to try again but the moments gone
caesar meets wills eyes obviously disappointed
stewart lingers a moment certain shes missed something but will doesnt say more
from high above we pass over the golden gate bridge the link between the bustling city and a huge green forest
caesar driving with walter and will looks out the window extremely excited
as caesar scrambles out of the truck will hooks a harness to his collar and helps walter from the car
the chimp looks around at the soaring trees
what is this place
the three of them head into the forest caesar tugging at the leash
take him off the leash
theres a place up ahead
theyve walked deep into the park
no people here
will kneels next to caesar
dont go far
stay where i can see you
will takes off caesars harness
the chimpanzee runs begins flying from tree to tree
will watches nervous
but its gratifying to see caesar so happy
the chimp disappears around a corner
a moment passes then another
the men follow
and discover caesar standing in a remember stay where i can see you if you got lost in these woods id never find you
the men sit down on a log watching as caesar swings from the branches
an animal in his element
caesar begins climbing a redwood
our view of him is obscured by the leaves
as his dark form ascends will and walter become smaller and smaller down below
rustling leaves whisper caesar upward
he moves with an easy grace exhilarated by the freedom
at the top of the giant redwood caesar emerges through the caesar looks across the bay to san francisco looks north at the mountains
then down to will below
wills pointing to his watch
a close on a harness
will has it waiting as caesar lands beside him on the forest floor
will attaches the harness and they walk together
caesars much taller now over five feet
sorry to rush you got to get home and check on walter
they approach a woman with a large dog on a leash a great dane
the dog barks lunging menacingly
the woman struggles to control him
is that a chimpanzee
dont worry hes harmless
the big dog keeps barking
annoyed caesar finally turns and gives him a large the great dane immediately whimpers terrified and pulls the woman away
guess he had it coming
caesar watches as the woman walks off with the dog his gaze then his eyes move to his own leash
is he a pet too
will drives up caesar in tow
the zoos being renovated machinery everywhere
will leads caesar inside the examination room and finds himself face to face with a young male veterinarian
she doesnt work here anymore
doesnt work here anymore
do you know where she went
im sorry i dont
wills deeply disappointed
disoriented because of the construction will makes a wrong turn as he leads caesar to the car
they find themselves in front of the primate enclosure
caesar goes rigid staring at a dozen chimps in the branches of the trees behind bars
they stare back at him
one chimp a grizzled old male steps forward ominous
he caesars transfixed
will looks back and forth between the chimps and caesar
neither makes a sound
as will drags caesar off the apes in the enclosure climb higher in the tree to watch
suddenly they all begin to caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood teenagers walk home from school
one boy walks with a blonde teenage girl books clutched to her chest
caesar watches the boy flirt with her
the girl smiles flirts back
one of the younger kids runs by bopping the boy on the head
the boy shoots him the finger and returns to the girl
caesars fascinated by these antics
he wants to be with these teens
he wants to be one of them
caesar stands in front of a full length mirror shirtless
he stands up straight like a human
tries to imitate their posture their gait
he runs two fingers down the length of it
caesar walter and will sit at the dinner table
theres tension here but we cant place it yet
then we see that walter is struggling to eat because hes using the wrong end of the spoon
he clutches the utensil staring at it
turn it around dad
youre using the wrong end
walter looks at will uncomprehending
with care and compassion caesar reaches over and helps the old man adjusting the spoon
a mouse runs through a maze
it reaches a fork in the path leading to two different plastic objects one green one orange
the mouse hesitates confused
he backs away from the cone
a lab tech makes a note
will and jacobs stand behind him reading the number results on a monitor
wills obviously discouraged
the drugs not staying ahead of the disease
but were still making progress right
will tries to tamp down the frustration hes sure is written all over his face
at this pace well get to trials by the time hell freezes over
jacobs embarrassed in front of the tech pulls him aside
this isnt graduate school theres a procedure we have to adhere to
itll take forever
i need to start developing a primate version now
jacobs looks at will
hes known him a long time
hows your father
havent seen him in a while
this isnt about him
hes worse isnt he
will wants to tell jacobs the truth hes tempted to tell him about caesar about walters treatment but he cant
its a familiar baleful sound that continues over the following
will sits in front of the computer looking at a file crammed with mpegs of caesar doing puzzles and games
into computer mic caesar continues to maintain a high level of cognition
but walters disease has caught up to the neurogenesis treatment
nearly all initial improvement has been erased
will stops recording
kicks his desk in frustration
walter sits at the piano hitting his one note
caesar passes him heads for wills study
caesar enters finds will at the desk head in hands
will senses his presence
what do you mean
with effort will pulls himself from his own thoughts and tries to understand what caesar wants from him
caesar is an ape
will is taken aback beginning to realize the intellectual leap caesars taken
are you asking about your identity
thats abstract thought caesar
caesar couldnt care less about abstract thought
walter will father
will caesar father
will looks at the chimp sees the intensity the pain on his face
how to begin to answer
this is where you were born
its the place where i work
will and caesar are parked across the street from the gen sys lab grounds its buildings visible through the fencing
i never knew your father but your mother came to live here
this is where you were born
she was very very smart
and she passed that onto you through her blood
caesar strains for a better view
undoes his seatbelt
will locks the car door
shes not here anymore
im sorry caesar she died
thats when i brought you home to live with me and walter
caesars getting worked up he wants out of the car
will grows concerned
this is a bad place for you caesar
were going to go now
as will pulls away caesar strains for a last glimpse twisting around to look out the back window
lets see if we can find something for you on the tv
walter has a new home aide a pale hard looking older woman
he sits on the sofa staring at the tvs moving images as she changes channels
the aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a space launch
astronauts wave to the press corps as they board a shuttle
the icarus crew is led by commander colonel george taylor
this is his fifth space mission
close on a crude drawing of an ape
caesar sits on the floor working on its details
as he draws the white birthmark like a falling star we realize its a self portrait
the home aide lights herself a cigarette sits down on a deck chair
tvs still blaring but the sofas empty
reveal walter standing in the middle of the room confused
as if hes not sure where he is
abruptly he turns and heads across the room
and out the walter pauses on the porch blinking in the sun
the street ahead of him is quiet
no one around
walter wanders down the front path
when he arrives at the sidewalk he keeps on going stepping out into the street
hes immediately startled by a sudden honk the sound of squealing brakes and a car fishtailing out of control
the car smashes into a nearby tree
hearing the crash caesar jumps to his feet rushes to the vent
he sees hunsiker emerge from the smashed car unhurt
caesar watches as hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender then turns to yell at someone
thats when walter comes into caesars view
hes in the street afraid disoriented while hunsiker rages jabbing a threatening finger towards walters chest
in a flash caesars down the attic stairs
walter backs up as hunsiker approaches still jabbing the menacing finger
look at the front of my car you stupid stupid old man
you should be locked up
your sons going to pay for that damage no time for anybody to react
the chimpanzee body slams hunsiker to the ground
straddling hunsiker teeth bared caesar pounds him with his fists
get him off caesar
walter grabs caesar by the shoulders tries to pull him back
but caesars too carried away by his rage he shrugs the old man off his back
then he grabs one of hunsikers hands and bites off the
walter struggles to his feet and grabs caesar again
a pulse caesar
blood dripping down his chin he looks over his shoulder and meets walters eyes
hunsiker uses the distraction
he scrabbles to his feet and sprints for his house
he races after hunsiker
walter falls to the ground
his head hits the pavement stunning him
just as hunsikers about to reach his front door caesar flies from behind his feet hitting the door and lands to block hunsikers entrance
white with terror hunsiker clutching his bleeding hand to his chest takes off running down the sidewalk
hunsiker runs for his life
he looks over his shoulder caesars galloping behind in hot pursuit
he tries to speed up cant go any faster
again he glances over his shoulder caesars closing in
breath coming hard hunsiker sprints scrambles desperate to escape
he looks over his shoulder but this time caesar unsure where to go half stumbling hunsiker keeps running
then out of nowhere caesar swings down from a tree
he hunsiker backs up changes direction runs across the street
enjoying the chase taking his time caesar grabs a tree branch and swings from tree to tree
with one giant jump he makes it to the top of a tree across the street tracking hunsiker like prey
hunsikers running out of steam
caesar swings down in front of him and kicks him in the chest sending him flying
calmly he stands over hunsiker who cowers
caesar pounds his chest yelling in triumph
but then he sees something across the street that abruptly pulls him out of his euphoria walter struggling bloody he looks down at hunsiker cringing
all at once caesar realizes what hes done
wills car drives down a two lane highway
chimpanzee named caesar terrorizing the quiet family enclave and mauling neighbor douglas hunsiker a pilot for global airlines
jacobs watches the evening news
the defense claimed the chimp was merely trying to protect its owner from perceived aggression
footage of will leaving a courthouse avoiding news crews
jacobs sits forward turns up the volume
the chimpanzees distraught owner wilson rodman has raised the animal since he was an infant
he pleaded to keep caesar at home citing the apes remarkable intelligence
will and a chimpanzee
jacobs stares at the tv dumbfounded
will and caesar drive
caesars dressed up khaki pants and a polo shirt
were visiting a place called the ranch
they have animals
chimpanzees gorillas orangutans
caesar grunts excited
itll be good
youll like it very much
caesar looks at will picking up on something
no im fine
as will pulls into the entrance caesars glued to the window
they pull into a clearing
ahead is a new world concrete and steel buildings set incongruously into the bucolic countryside
a house office a living quarters a horse paddock all cold efficient structures
will sees the primate cages in the distance next to a giant inside i think
as they climb from the car mr
landon s emerges from the office
dodge s hangs back
you must be mr
this is caesar
nice to meet you caesar
this is dodge helps me run the place
ive been telling caesar about the animals you have here
how much fun it is
yes we have a big play center where the chimpanzees like to climb
want to see the play center
a huge caged structure the size of a gymnasium
inside are climbing constructions ropes toys and in the middle a large tree reaching up through the top bars
a caged in bridge leads to a row of dark dens
but for now
no apes in sight
caesar approaches with will and mr
what do you think caesar
want to give it a try
trying to mask his growing dread will removes caesars harness
he watches caesar unsuspecting move through an open gate caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar
he swings from bar to bar then hits the ground and runs for the tree
will can barely watch as dodge rolls the sliding door closed he braces himself
caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he hits the top of the cage
branches continue through spaces in the bars but hes reached
caesar turns finds willbelow
what he reads in wills eyes gives him a sudden sharp sense of dread
caesar shrieks speeds down the tree
other shrieks join in
excited ape noises coming from unseen caged apes fills the atrium
the strange animal voices fuel caesars panic
he runs to the gate tries to shake it open
its okay caesar
its going to be okay
the words are for him as much as caesar
youre going to live here for a while
this is what the judge says we have to do
caesar cant believe what hes hearing
he frantically signs desperate pleading
the shrieks of the unseen apes continue feeding wills apprehension
caesar doesnt belong here
it takes every bit of restraint he has not to take caesar out to run
theyll take good care of you here
thats about it for visiting hours
will shoots him a look of daggers
what dodge means is in our experience longer you drag out the leave taking harder it is
on both of you
caesar whimpers tries to bend the bars apart
when this doesnt work he tries prying them open with his teeth
im sorry to trick you this way but you would never have agreed
i was afraid theyd hurt you if they forced you hell be fine
will gives caesar a last long look
the pain in his eyes is matched only by caesars
we stay with caesar as will forces himself to walk away
caesars shrieks build
the surrounding apes chime in
i can get you out
dodge stands at the end of the atrium beckoning
caesar follows dodge to the far end of the play area then through the caged in bridge
wills almost out of sight
caesar can see that hes nearly reached the car
he grunts with stress as he follows the bridge into
the chimpanzee house and stops in his tracks
this is the source of the ape noise
it has an open indoor area in the center bordered by cages of chimpanzees
caesars taken aback by the loud dark forms pounding around caesar over here
dodge stands at a cage door
caesar sprints for it as for salvation but as soon as he crosses the threshold he he turns but dodge shuts the door in his face and locks it
then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars jumping to the ceiling searching for a way out
to his left the faces of three huge agitated chimpanzees pound the concrete floor yelling at him
to his right caesar lets out a primal blood curdling scream
we follow the scream as it spreads out over the property
and finds the wills car driving down the winding road away from the ranch
will keeps driving tears streaming down his face
time has passed
long shadows of late afternoon
caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the cage heavy head resting on his arms
he slowly becomes conscious of a rhythmic scraping noise followed by a loud bang
he looks up
in the cage next door caesar sees a strapping muscular this is rocket
he shoves a plastic play refrigerator across the cage floor
then slams it against the wall
he repeats this movement over and over all the time with a challenging eye to caesar
a terrifying display of power and dominance
rocket slowly and deliberately with a last threatening look to caesar moves off
caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out
dodge and another animal wrangler rodney move from cage to cage shoveling primate chow into troughs
rodney tosses in an occasional rotted vegetable
the apes enthusiastically receive the food
dodge shovels food into caesars trough
caesar stares down at the wet looking dog food
grade a primate chow
bet you dont get none of that in the suburbs
caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and throws a handful in dodges face
the apes scream with laughter
rodney looks away so dodge doesnt see him laughing too
think thats funny
that funny to you you hairy prick
caesar stares at dodge
then shoots him the finger
look at that
infuriated dodge grabs a hose drags it to caesars cage
one thing you can count on long as there are humans on this earth youll always be a monkey in a cage
the burst from the hose sends caesar flying backwards
pinned into a corner he curls himself into a ball using his back as a shield
the water blast is relentless
eventually dodge turns the water off
the two men take a long look at caesar
hes left battered and soaked on the floor
what about his clothes
might cause problems with the other apes
walters frail hand runs along the cold rail of caesars swing set
useless in the back yard
the aide stands nearby sending a text message
will looks terrible
hes unshaven pale drawn
he sits on the sofa surrounded by reminders of caesar puzzles games etc
the newspapers unread beside him
walter enters looks at will
john wheres caesar
the old man looks stricken
shouldnt we look for him
isnt there something we can do
will looks up at his father
hes just had an idea
we follow will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria
hes shaved pulled himself together
will spots jacobs lunching with his blackberry in a corner
he heads for him
jacobs looks up sees will coming
will slides into the seat across from him
youve been gone a week
i was sick
too sick to return my calls
you know it was a funny thing but i was watching the news and they started talking about a seven year old chimpanzee that went nuts and all of a
sudden there you were on the tv
a seven year old chimp raised since birth
the cafeteria gets a little awkward as jacobs raises his voice
neither man cares
hes the son of chimp
and hes smart
off the charts smart
because of the
the genetic therapy was passed in utero from the mother to the son
without a single negative side effect
aside from biting off a mans finger
he was protecting my father
the same way his mother was protecting him
weve had this conversation already
we knew the was making the apes smart i tried the on my father
a conversation stopper
jacobs is stunned
thats the effect will was after
i had a sample vial
youre out of your mind
like a chess player will lets the unasked question sit there
and jacobs is undeniably voraciously curious
dont you want to know if it worked
jacobs cant resist
it was miraculous
unquestionable adult neurogenesis development of fresh nerve tissue
it brought my father back
but jacobs is confused
you told me he was failing
its just like with the mice
alzheimers is a progressive disease you need to keep it at bay a you need boosters
will can see jacobs turning this over in his mind the possibilities
why have you waited so long to tell me this
i couldnt risk losing him
jacobs looks at his old friend wondering about his sanity
weve discovered a safe treatment
its the payday youve been waiting for
ill recreate the primate version of for you
but only under one condition
it takes jacobs a moment before he gets outraged
youre giving me conditions
i could have you arrested for what youve done
but you wont you need me to build the drug
heres what i need i want you to get caesar back
how the hell can i do that
however they do things in your part of the world
get attorneys into it
slip cash into the right pockets
pausing for emphasis make it happen
early morning sun through the tiny window of caesars cage
he wakes shivering with cold
notices that the other cages are empty that his cage door is open
tentatively he makes his way into the common area
caesar looks around
the hose lies on the wet floor along with the detritus of feeding time
he can hear the apes in the distance
caesar tries the gate door to the outside
he pauses then makes his way toward the bridge
caesar walks across the bridge
to his left connecting to the bridge he sees two more ape houses connecting to the the orangutan house which is empty
and the gorilla house which houses only one lone gorilla buck who stares out at caesar
caesar registers the fact that bucks not out with the other apes
then he moves on toward the atrium
the apes are visible inside
caesar gets his first good look
over two dozen chimpanzees and three orangutans roam around the atrium
the groups dont mix chimps hang with chimps orangutans with orangutans
they havent noticed him yet
caesar enters heads for the tree
one by one the apes take notice
they stop and stare at this new arrival dressed caesar looks around finds thirty pairs of ape eyes on him
should he continue to the tree
go back to the cage
he spots a ball across the way
moves to it the eyes follow him
he picks it up
the eyes wait
caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp
it receives the ball gives caesar nothing no smile no connection then tosses it to rocket
eyes on caesar rocket discards the ball like a piece of trash
his look is insolent an unmistakable challenge
caesar tries to walk around
rocket blocks his path reaches out and pulls at caesars sleeve as if to examine the material
caesar jerks his arm away
rocket bares his teeth raises his arms
caesar considers the options should he run
before he can make a move rocket grunts grabs his shirt at the chest
caesar tries to push rocket away but the larger chimp throws caesar to the ground pinning him
caesar struggles to get away accidentally slapping rocket across the face
outraged rocket slams his hand on caesars chest and starts pounding him
caesar tries to block the blows but theyre coming hard and fast his head his stomach his chest
apes shriek jump up and down egging rocket on
caesar manages to break loose crawling away
rocket grabs at his shirt drags caesar closer
he opens his mouth wide moving sharp teeth toward caesars face
caesar struggles barely holds him off and
a shot rings out
stunned rocket spins around his mouth full of caesars blood and sees dodge outside the cage rifle in hand
he pulls a tranquilizing dart from his shoulder
caesar starts to move off
caesar rolls over to look up
as rocket topples onto him
caesar lies on a medical table neck and left arm bandaged
his shirts ripped and hes still wearing the khaki pants now filthy and torn
tight straps run across his chest its a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment
rockets across the way unconscious but breathing restrained to a medical table
caesar opens his eyes
takes a moment to get his bearings
stewart stands over him
the light shinesbehind her head
do you remember me
she hands him a cup of water with a straw
caesar doesnt want the water
she clearly doesnt understand
he signs again
i dont understand
he opens his mouth makes a long low sound
shes taken aback is he trying to speak
can you show me
show me what you need
caesar pulls at the restraints
i cant take those off
caesar sags with defeat overcome with despair
im sorry this has happened caesar
stewart stares at him
moved at the complexity of his emotion the obvious intelligence behind his pain
im here once a week
ill do my best to look after you
dodge pulls heavy bags of primate chow from a truck stacking them in a shed
he spots stewart striding towards him and ducks out of sight vainly brushing back his hair
what were you thinking
oh hey doc
that chimp needs protection
dodges face falls
you couldve gotten him killed
i told rodney not to open his cage
cant you see how sensitive he is
yeah no hes a real smart dresser
i want him moved to the orangutan house
hell be safe there until we re introduce him to the group
im sorry since when do volunteer animal doctors make the rules around here
just do it
whatever you say doc
dodge returns to stacking the chow
youre the one with the college education
a spinning machine test tubes a giant propagation tank
empty canisters labeled adenovirus
reveal will in the doorway watching it all very carefully
a virus technician approaches him
hes tentative nervous
rodman i think theres been a mistake
wills been waiting for this observation hes surprised it took so long to come up
ive double checked the replication rate of the and its enormously fast compared to the
thats why were using it
we need the drug quickly
isnt it risky
i mean at this rate of propagation we greatly increase the possibility of mutations that are out of our control
its a highly unstable i appreciate your concern but its going to be fine
we plan on taking precautions
the technician pauses not entirely satisfied
but wills look tells him the conversation is over
a large truck backs onto a loading dock
will watches as a new group of chimpanzees are unloaded from the truck and brought into the lab
wills in his sweats working
will opens the door to find stewart standing there
for a moment hes too shocked to say anything
sorry to drop in on you like this
the clinic at the zoo gave me your address but they didnt have a phone number dont worry about it
you want to come in
they stand awkwardly by the door
she looks great
can i you want a cup of coffee or something
i just wanted to let you know that ive seen caesar
i volunteer once a week at the ranch
is he alright
she hesitates wanting to be honest but not alarming
he had a rough start but things should get smoother from now on
in the other room walter and his aide become visible
will follows stewarts curious gaze
thats my dad
hes not doing too well
anyway caesars going to be okay
im looking after him
i appreciate that
if you give me your number ill let you know from time to time how things are going lets grab a drink
takes her by surprise
maybe takes him by surprise too
shes happy he asked
a repulsive bowl of primate chow
caesar bandaged beat up and miserable picks at it
in the next cage the orangutans sleep
rock and roll music
dodge and rodney drive up in a truck windows down radio blaring
dodge gets out cigarette in his mouth and moves drunkenly to the storage shed
he emerges with two beers throws one to rodney
caesar watches as dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee
want a beer
the chimp reaches but dodge pulls it away
heres a little taste of beer
he unzips his fly and pisses into the chimps feeding trough
caesar watches disgusted
caesar watches as dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages in succession
rodney moves to the orangutan house
caesar pays close move it
dodge and rodney herd the apes from their cages brandishing electric cattle prods
the primates rouse themselves move across the bridge
on his way out an orangutan maurice wise countenance orange and white beard takes a moment to check caesar out then moves off to join the others
caesar maneuvers to get a better view
rocket walks king like among the apes
caesar watches him push a smaller male aside
the male defers extending his arm forward palm up supplicating
rocket casually runs his rockets the cock of the walk the alpha male
caesar shifts his attention to the gorilla buck still alone in his cage staring through the bars miserable
why doesnt the gorilla ever get to go out
then something across the ranch catches caesars eye wills
his heart skips a beat
he moves to the bars barely able to contain his excitement
will waits at a picnic table as dodge approaches with caesar on a leash
hes immediately struck by caesars injured appearance but he plasters a smile on his face
caesars clearly thrilled to see him
there you are
i heard what happened
he tugs will away from dodge
im going to get you out of here but not today
im working on it
caesars face falls
will notices dodges electric cattle prod
still a question a flicker of hope
kills him to say it not yet
i cant yet
caesar realizes wills going to leave him here
first incredulous then outraged caesar turns away and starts walking back to his cage
wait a second caesar where are you going
a caesar doesnt respond doesnt turn just keeps walking
dodge catches up with him
loud enough for will no place like home huh monkey boy
caesar come back here
he watches caesars retreating back dodge trotting alongside him
realizes caesars nearly breaking into a run
dodge locks caesar in his cell
then moves around to the
he notices wills car still parked in front of the office
just as bam
will decks him with a fist to the face
dodge hits the ground
will stands over him too livid to realize he mightve just broken his hand
you son of a bitch
dodge scrabbles to his feet wipes the blood from his nose
that was not a smart thing to do
dodge is clearly much tougher stronger than will but wills too angry to care
if i find out caesars been hurt if hes mistreated in any way i swear ill have you brought up on charges
dodge looks towards landons house restrains himself
that wild eyed chimp isnt yours any more
hes mine now
the truth of the statement is worse than any punch
and youre on private property
now get the hell out of here
ill come back and kill you
a bag of chips ahoy cookies
caesar looking morose watches as rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the bag into the shed
the door slides open
stewart enters followed by dodge
hows your arm
mind if i take a look
stewart rummages in her medical bag
caesar watches as she pulls out a pair of scissors cuts off his bandages
caesar makes eye contact with dodge over stewarts shoulder
she pulls a harness from her bag
im taking him out
thought id cheer him up show him the horses
as she walks to dodge caesar glances into her medical bag
what are you going to do
use a cattle prod on me
if youre into that kind of thing
im safer with him than i am with you
stewart turns to caesar whos retreated onto a bed of straw
i cant take you
glancing at dodge maybe another time
the apes sleep
except for caesar
standing in the corner of his cage caesar pulls stewarts scissors and a roll of medical tape out from the straw
he kneels at his bedding gathering sticks and straw
then he begins weaving the tape through several sticks binding them and extending them end to end
caesar pauses sensing something
he looks over his shoulder discovers maurice the orangutan watching him
they hold each others gaze caesar taking his measure
then caesar puts a finger to his lips
maurice makes no movement but the agreement is clear
caesar returns to crafting the tool
dark forms in cages illuminated by green fluorescent light
the door opens
eyes open heads turn
will enters we see that his hand his bandaged
the apes watch as he walks along the cages eyes searching the dark chimpanzee faces
which one of you wants chocolate
chimpanzees stare back at him giving him nothing
noise from behind
down the row a chimpanzee will walks to the cage chimp reads the label beside it
he peers inside
koba stares back eyes murky and small he drops an m m into kobas palm
eyes on will koba secrets it to a storage spot inside the cage
then he puts out his hand again
nanotherapy beta version male test subject number eleven
koba doesnt resist as will straps him to the table
he watches as a handler evans moves into the next room opens a refrigerator with a strange biohazard symbol and pulls out canister labeled adenovirus
evans and will each slip on hazmat masks making sure theyre secure
then evans hands the to will
all of this avidly taken in by kobas dark eyes
will inserts the adenovirus nozzle into a plastic oxygen mask
kobas eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the chimps face
boy hes a calm one isnt he
will tilts the nozzle releasing a blast of aerosol mist into chop sticks digging into take out chinese
stewart and will sit in her kitchen eating
its clear from their state of dress or undress that theyve been intimate
because his hand is still bandaged hes having a hard time with the chopsticks
you actually punched him
she thinks its funny
ive been wanting to do that since the day i met him
i dont advise it
my hands killing me
let me help you out
she begins feeding him the chinese food
he puts down his chopsticks
im going to get him out of there
i know you are
and im going to get my dad back too
caesar tapes sticks together
we see that hes created a three foot long arm
he tapes the scissors firmly to its end finger holes sticking out
silently he moves to the edge of the cage
using the he tries once
caesar keeps trying
until finally the loops in place
then he begins to tug
click the latch opens
he glances over to maurice who silently watches
caesar pushes open the cage door
maurices eyes follow him caesar walks across the bridge
he passes the entrance to the chimpanzee house and keeps going
he arrives at the gorilla house
bucks visible in his cage asleep on a bed of straw
caesar unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door
he waits but buck doesnt budge
hes still fast asleep
then he slowly
enters the cage edging up to the sleeping gorilla
from this vantage point buck looks enormous his vast chest rising and falling with sleep
caesar very carefully wiggles his toe
theres a grunt and a whirl of black furry movement
caesar finds himself staring into the huge angry gorilla face
caesar nervous beckons toward the open door
buck understands but cant believe it
for a moment he doesnt move
caesar makes the gesture again come on lets go
before he can finish buck bursts past him
across the bridge
and into the atrium
the full moon shines down on buck the tree the climbing structure
the gorilla feels his feet on the grass savoring every step
then he begins to run
he runs as fast as he can all the way across the atrium then all the way back
back and forth gorilla wind sprints of freedom
caesar stands back silently watching
a morning like any other
dodge goes through his routine opening the door wheeling out a wheelbarrow
he makes his way to the ape houses
dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the gorilla house
closer and closer to the cage
until theyre right in front
the cage doors closed buck inside
dodge shovels primate chow into the gorillas trough
caesar senses something maurice is staring at him
caesar s beginning to wonder what maurice wants when the orangutan happy gorilla
maurice circus orangutan
more ape sign
they hear dodges wheelbarrow approach
stupid human no like smart ape
dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs
maurice and caesar stop signing and blend in
pieces of primate chow hit him in the head
he wakes with a start
sees that his cage door is open
rocket gets to his feet sees caesar standing in the common rocket grunts and sprints after him through the chimpanzee common area toward the door where wham
caesar whacks him in the head with rockets buck raises his arms and slams them down with a mighty roar caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside sending it skittering across
the chimpanzees awake now watch to see what will happen
rocket looks from buck to caesar
a collective gasp of awe moves through the ho use
rocket crawls back to his cage defeated
caesar walking at full height follows
he closes rockets cage door and then caesar walks upright around the cages once more making eye contact with each and every chimpanzee
he exits with his lieutenant buck in tow
will and evans the handler are wearing hazmat masks as they administer adenovirus to chimp after chimp
chimp after chimp convulses on the table
they lead koba to the table
koba knows what to do
he lies down allows himself to be strapped in
everyones guard is down
but as soon as the blast of aerosol mist is released koba a thrashes out an arm hitting evans in the side of the head
hold him steady
evans tightens the straps on kobas flailing arm
will finishes administering the drug
koba goes limp on the table
you okay evans
will demonstrates the tower of hanoi puzzle
you cant put larger blocks on top of smaller ones
pointing to right side move the stack from here to here
koba takes the puzzle and rotates it degrees clockwise will looks at koba
koba looks back
youve got to take the blocks off and stack them again like this
will turns the puzzle back around
lets see you try
koba puts out a palm asking for an m m
ill give you an m m if you can get the blocks to the other side but dont do it the way you did last time
koba thinks then rotates the puzzle again this time counterclockwise
ingenious in its own way
you know what i want
youre just not going to give it to me
koba puts out a palm
theres a look in his eye malevolent what do you think of koba
we look through cage bars at will and franklin who stand far away across the room
you wanna know if i think the s making him nuts
i know hes smart
but theres something else something worrisome
he challenges me
will looks toward us toward the bars
almost to himself i dont want to try it on
i dont want to start human trials if theres any chance of danger
what youre seeing has nothing to do with the doc
the apesre just like us theyre complex
some are loyal some are selfish some have a good sense of humor
and some are born rotten
koba moves into frame
weve been watching from his point of view from inside the cage
now we look over his shoulder where the sharp planes of his a face frame the two men across the room
this ones a bad apple thats all
a chill runs down wills spine
a car pulls up to the gate
evans is driving
he looks ill
early day today evans
actually im not feeling too good
you know what whiskey lemon honey and a cup of hot water
thanks im on it
evans drives off
stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses looking down at the chimpanzee area
she watches caesar walking across the bridge
caesar moves easily among the apes his alpha male status clear as the others make way for him
stewarts relieved and a little surprised to see caesar so at ease with the other apes
dodge and rodney watch him through the bars
still wont eat wont come out
i can fix that
dodge drags the hose to rockets cage
get that monkey ass out of there
caesar watches dodge blast rocket with water
rocket doesnt struggle doesnt fight back
the harsh jet pelts his back
the feeder bin opens and shuts waking him
tentatively rocket peers inside the bin a cookie
never seen a cookie before
rocket picks it up
takes a taste
he gobbles it down
at that moment rockets cage door opens
caesar stands holding a large bag of chips ahoy
he tosses a cookie to rocket
beckons him out of the cage
rocket exits warily on his guard for anything
but caesar simply stands with the cookie bag
he hands the cookie bag to rocket
rocket watches confused as caesar pulls the main lever chimps emerge bewildered
rocket stands with the cookie bag unsure what to do
caesar makes a motion with his hand
now rocket understands
he gives a cookie to the nearest chimp
then another one
the chimps go crazy for the cookies
they gather around now caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages
a moment of discomfort as caesar leads the other apes in
caesar pulls an orangutan over to rocket
rocket hands the orangutan a cookie
the other orangutans and buck immediately line up
discomforts gone now its one big a party
caesar watches satisfied as the apes feast together
caesar sits high in the tree looking down at the apes
rockets part of the group again but no longer the alpha
caesars got his eye on cornelia a female ape standing with a group of females
he follows her movements with his eyes
maurice climbs up next to caesar
why cookie rocket
all apes strong
caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and breaks it
he breaks another twig
he breaks another
he grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together now they cant be broken
a beautiful morning
wills getting ready for his day
hair wet from the shower buttoning up his shirt he pauses to pour himself a cup of coffee look up at the clock
he takes a sip heads down the hall to his fathers room
someones sleeping late today will opens the door and freezes in his tracks
long shot of will sitting at a gravesite service surrounded by twenty odd people
we recognize stewart jacobs one of the aides
will waits at the picnic table
hes been there a while
finally rodney appears
sorry cant get him to come out
he wont budge
he knows im here
i told him
will brushes by rodney heads for the cages
hey you are not allowed back will ignores him keeps going
caesar sees will coming
he turns his back heads to a common area away from the bars
will runs up to the cage
ive got something to tell you its about walter
we find caesar deep out of sight in the orangutan cage
he s heard wills words
caesars not coming out
nasa has temporarily lost communication with the icarus
will sits with a glass of scotch watching tv
stewarts looking at a framed photograph
captain taylor and his crew are navigating the ship around the dark side of mars
communication is expected to be reestablished i was too late
she puts the photo down cuddles against him
you worked really hard
walter knew that
wasnt good enough though was it
angle on the photograph
it shows a younger walter and his two teenage sons
franklins on the phone
just checking in
you didnt show up at work today
crummy little place
tvs on with no sound
we hear franklins voice through the phone machine
hope youre feeling better let me know if you need anything
reveal evans lying in bed dead a streak of brown dried blood across his cheek as if draining from his lifeless eye
deep night at the ranch
a moon half hidden by clouds
caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage
maurice grabs his arm
caesar slips out of the orangutan house heads toward the as he passes the chimpanzee house he hears a chimpanzee call out
finds rocket staring out at him wanting to go with him
rocket calls out louder
to quiet him caesar walks over to rockets cage but as he gets closer he sees something that gives him pause rockets caesar gets right up against the bars of
rockets cage takes rockets face in his hands and looks into his eyes they are reeling caesar tries to make sense of this
and then he remembers the bite
rocket bit him
he looks down at the wound on his arm now nearly healed
has caesars blood changed rocket
caesar opens rocketscage
the chimp emerges ready for anything
caesar and rocket barrel across the ranch past the living a quarters past the barn onto the winding road leading away
middle of the night only a few cars
caesar and rocket stick to bushes and shadows
they wait for a break in traffic cross the highway
in the distance the lights of the town give a glow to the night sky
caesar and rocket gallop toward it
rustling in the trees as if a storm is coming
a moment later rocket follows
swinging from tree to tree they make their way down the suburban street
wills wakened by the noise
what is that
its coming from outside
reveal stewart asleep next to will
he gets out of bed moves to the window looks into the back yard
will scans the grounds no movement nothing to see
satisfied he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes
its caesars silhouette noiselessly emerging from the darkness
he stands there looking down at will and stewart
his face is impossible to read
rockets fascinated by photos of caesar with will and walter along the mantle
caesar emerges from wills room and makes his way down the hallway
stripped bed a couple of packed boxes
caesar stands at the doorway taking it in
feet pounding the pavement caesar and rocket head away from wills house
gen sys research sign
the grounds are deserted
a security guard listens to radio in the guard kiosk
caesar and rocket eyes on the security guard stop at a spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence
caesar and rocket drop down to the grass
they sniff the air head toward the primate house
the security guard yawns checks his watch
over his shoulder on a monitor we see the dark forms of two chimpanzees run across the grounds
caesar and rocket arrive at the primate house
caesar tries the big double door locked
he looks upward spies a row of awning windows near the roof
rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall
then caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to the windows ledge
hanging by one arm he swings himself in through the window
franklins got the graveyard shift
hes watching a movie on the office computer doesnt hear anything
eerie darkly lit
sleeping chimps stir
caesar and rocket drop to the cement floor
now they have a clear view of the cramped cages darkened figures inside
caesar walks alongside them peering into each one studying the shadowy simian faces
caesar approaches the cage
finds himself face to face with caesar moves on
hes intent looking for someone
rocket barrels forward grabs the m m from kobas hand
koba offers up another m m
but rockets eyes are on the red angle on caesar
hes nearly reached the last of the cages and the these chimpanzees are distant strange
no familiar face
caesar reaches the last cage where a young chimp sick stares back at him
caesar turns away crestfallen
he yells for rocket and the two of them take off
the lab chimps start to scream
hearing the commotion franklin puts down his book heads
into the primate house
where he stops in his tracks
they stare at each other
then koba leaps for him
caesar and rocket head for the fence
a guard approaches on his nightly rounds
they look at each other lay low
to protect caesar rocket takes off running
the shocked but rockets too fast in a moment hes out of sight
caesars waiting when rocket runs up
they take off together
caesar and rocket enter
thats when we notice caesars caesar opens rockets cage
as soon as the door closes behind him the huge chimp collapses exhausted
caesar walks around the chimpanzee house images of the night swirling through his head
around him the chimps sleep oblivious
except for cornelia shes wide awake
staring at him
the apes have calmed down
koba slips back into his cage and a closes the door
it locks into place
dawn of a new day
sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across caesars face
he opens his eyes
looks at cornelia still asleep
caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage
caesar emerges into the common area
the chimps are still asleep
theres a clanking as the outside gate opens
dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of primate chow and the shovel
locks the door behind him
he hasnt seen caesar yet
rise and shine assholes
the chimps wake
one by one they notice caesar standing in the common area
what the hell seeing cornelias open you sly son of a bitch
howd you do that
dodge is careful slow as he picks up the shovel and holds it in front of him
he circles around the common area toward cornelias cage
were gonna go slow here alright
youre gonna go back in your cage youre not going to give me no trouble
the apes chimps orangutans the gorilla are silent riveted waiting to see what will happen
cornelia stands watching
caesar doesnt take his eyes off dodge but his expression is unreadable
dodge reaches cornelias cage
he violently bangs the shovel back
caesar reacts a snarl curling his lips
keeping his eyes on caesar sweat dripping down his temples dodge kicks cornelias cage shut
now he starts moving forward trying to back caesar toward the orangutan cage
were going to have you fixed einstein thats for damn sure
but first were going to figure out how you pulled this off
get in that cage
caesar stops refusing to go any farther
i said get
but caesar doesnt move
dodge pokes the shovel at him then slams it to the cement floor
he edges closer to caesar grip tightening around the shovel handle
then he rears it back face contorted in rage
get in that cage you damn dirty ape
a caesars eyes narrow
he stands tall stretching to his full
with his voice no
dodge is thunderstruck nearly loses his balance
caesar has spoken
actually uttered a word
maurice rocket buck and all the apes stare dumbfounded trying to comprehend what has just happened
they go nuts
thats when caesar attacks
he rushes dodge wrestling the shovel from his hands
dodge spins around to defend himself and caesar hits him in dodge staggers back
caesar slams the shovel in his stomach
dodge crumples forward
caesar drags dodge to rockets cage and opens the door
rocket helps pull him inside
they gather around caesar who holds up stewarts scissors then he walks to rocket who gets down on his knees and puts out his hand in the supplicating gesture
caesar takes the
he moves to maurice who offers up his hand
caesar slices the palm and places his hand against it
then he turns to buck who stands up tall beats his chest and yells
but then offers up his hand
and now caesar looks around as every ape lines up their will wakes climbs out of bed careful not to wake stewart
he moves down the hallway approaching walters room
he pauses puzzled at the door which is ajar
will ignores it slowly pushes the door open
and sees he stands there stunned
will pick up the goddamned phone
the animal handler franklin was killed last night
in the primate house
something very powerful broke his neck
snapped it in two
could it have been one of our chimps
all our apes are accounted for a secured in their cages
but heres the kicker one of our security guards swears he chased a chimpanzee off the grounds last night
will with growing dread looks out the window at caesars swing
where in the hell did that chimp come from
will speeds out of the driveway stewart by his side
shes dialing her cell phone
landon answers the ringing phone
hes in his pajamas
dodge fed them breakfast about half an hour ago
he holds up a pair of binoculars looks toward the atrium and ape houses
cant see anything wrong
let me call you back
he hears the back kitchen door open
rustling noises in the kitchen
opening and closing of cabinets
hey dodge stewart just called we follow him out of the living room into the
she said that
landon goes pale
rocket and two other chimpanzees are the two chimpanzees drag mr
landon toward the ape houses
rocket follows munching cereal from a box of cheerios
rodneys visible being dragged screaming
wills car speeds up to the gate and stops
no ones answering
in the distance they can hear the phone ringing at the ranch house
from where the car is nothing out of the ordinary is visible
will thinks a moment gets out of the car
you go get help
not a way in the world
im coming with you
they sneak into the back of the ranch house
all is quiet
but once inside the level of destruction is immediately visible overturned table and chairs plates smashed cupboards emptied
oh my god
will picks up landons binoculars moves to the front window
he sees debris everywhere
apes free wandering
dodge landon and rodney battered and in cages
clearly the alpha male
clearly in control
will lowers the binoculars as stewart rushes in
its going to take them at least half an hour to get here
he begins rummaging in drawers in cabinets
theres an empty cookie bag but wills able to put his hands on a couple of stray cookies
he has an idea
under the sink he finds what hes looking for rat poison
what are you doing
im going to kill him
youre wrong he cant have been the one who killed that man there is no other explanation
a black shadow passes by the window
now theres another
will barricades the back door with a table
chimpanzees at every window banging on the glass wanting in
will and stewart run to the front room just as the door
i need to talk to you
dodge rodney and landon watch as will and stewart are pushed into the cage next door
welcome to the mad house
i called animal control theyll be here soon through the bars i just want to talk to you
well thisll be interesting because your freakll talk back
dodge thinks he spoke to him
he said the word no right to my face
what do you mean
he can talk
then he must have a voicebox in his ass because i heard him
caesar walks up
will steels himself feels in his pocket the poisoned cookie is ready
caesar people are coming
people with guns
youve got to make the apes go back in their cages
apes no belong in cage
human put apes in cage
wills heart sinks as he sees that caesar is intransigent
he means what hes saying
will takes a moment digs deep to make himself do what must finally he brings the poisoned cookie from his pocket holds it out
i brought this for you
caesar eyes the cookie but doesnt take it
its killing him dont you want it
they look at each other
two creatures once so close but now with a vast chasm between them
you went to the lab last night
i know it was you
caesar doesnt deny it
emotion spilling over how could you kill that man caesar
once you kill you cant it back that mans gone forever
it gives him pause
caesar no kill
caesar no kill
caesar slaps the cookie from wills hand
rocket immediately comes over to stand by caesar but caesar doesnt want to fight
hes done disgusted with will
he turns begins to walk off
dont walk away
we need to talk
whered he get that wristband caesar
thats kobas band
did koba get out of his cage
yelling after caesar
but caesars not waiting
caesar climbs onto the open tailgate of a pick up truck
a apes gather around expectant
at the sound of caesars voice the apes rise tall
from the chimpanzee house will and stewart watch stunned
the humans jaws drop petrified
beat of jungle drums as caesar bolts from the truck bed
will and the other humans are blown away
the pack of apes led by caesar emerges from the ranch gate and moves out over the countryside
animal control ambulance police vehicles stream onto the ranch
they could be spread out all over the county by now
will and stewart released from the cages speak to officer huffs
dodge rodney and landon huddle nearby
no theyll stick together
theyre following one ape
you kill him you stop them all
theres a leader
ask him he raised him
all eyes to will
his name is caesar
if i can reason with him i know i can put an end to this
reason with him
huffs thinks hes nuts
he turns starts toward his squad car
will follows stewart on his heel
you dont understand this chimp is smart hell listen to me to nearby junior officer get on the horn with every agency you can think of
weve got to track down these monkeys before they do major damage
the junior officer granger heads for his car
you need me riding with you
ive got experience with these animals
eye on will i can point out the one you want
an ambulance pulling away
two police cars out front
jacobs stands talking with a couple of police officers
handing jacobs a card if you think of anything else this is where i can be reached a rumbling sound from behind
they turn to see a ranch ape army heading their way
shocked they leap out of the way as best they can
the apes stampede past them and swarm into the lab
caesar and his chimps burst through the door
no time is wasted
cages are opened lab chimps liberated
koba steps from his cage slowly measuring the situation as apes around him go crazy
a stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie talkie
we have a situation at gen sys laboratory
approximately two dozen apes gorillas i dont know what the hell they are audible chaos from inside the lab
yelling screaming huffs drives will in the front stewart in back
they can hear everything through the radio
you know anything about this
thats where i work
anarchy of movement blurs of black fur running amok through white rooms tearing everything up
employees scatter running for the exits
some duck behind desks
like everything else in the lab torn down stomped on thrown against the wall
caesar and buck walk through the lab eyeing the destruction
jacobs a security guard and the two officers are huddled behind a squad car
other employees are hiding and watching from the safety of the parking lot
they suddenly realize that everything has gone silent
a moment later lab doors fly open
here they come
theres more of them
those are my chimps
they duck as the apes run by some of them right up and over the car theyre crouched behind
as the chimps hit and leapfrog over the squad car and their heads
the apes stampede across the parking lot where several use jacobs black jaguar to vault over the fence
the last is buck whose weight crushes the car
and then theyre gone
every last one of them
quiet now except for car alarms
jacobs enters the lab
in front of him is utter silence and devastation
like the morning after a huge destructive party
out of the quiet theres the padding sound of footsteps on jacobs freezes
koba appears from around a doorway
he and jacobs look at each other for a long moment
then koba calmly walks past him
once outside koba gallops off
jacobs can see him through the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards kicking something four helicopters wait
hoff s will and stewart climb into one of them
any idea where theyre headed
will sees dodge joining sharpshooters in another helicopter below
he doesnt like it
they were seen heading north from the lab lets start with that
a hillside park overlooking san francisco bay
thick fog moving in
kids everywhere slides seesaws climbing structures
a little girl plays in a sandbox
her mother reads on a bench nearby
the girl looks up claps her hands
over her shoulder we see a chimpanzee heading our way
suddenly the little girls not so sure
the mother looks up from her book
the girls surrounded now by moving apes the mother cant get to her
suddenly caesar doubles back from the lead
he scoops her up and puts her down out of harms way
then he continues herding the apes forward
he knows where hes going
squad cars give chase
fog rolls in off the bay
wills strapped into his seat looking down at the city below
you see them
no i cant see oh my god
seated next to will she draws him to her window
far below it looks like a black locust moving through the urban sprawl chased by numerous squad cars directly behind them along parallel streets
she realizes something
i know where theyre going
hot dog stands and ice cream vendors
the fun is interrupted by the sound of helicopters sweeping low overhead
faces turn skyward
a moment later caesar and his apes rumble in
released balloons float lazily upward
will watches caesar moving the apes down the zoos pathways dodging people jumping over benches
hes going to release the apes
looking to his left will sees a sniper try to get shots off but hesitate
the apes are too interspersed with fleeing patrons
as the apes pass other enclosures the animals go nuts
giraffes run back and forth
what the hell am i supposed to do when they get here
an ape wrangler screams into a wall phone at the ape enclosure
the zoo apes are agitated and anxious they know somethings coming
suddenly the phone is ripped from wall
the wrangler cowers turns to see caesar and his apes
rocket rattles the door bares his teeth
the wrangler understands fumbles for his keys
all kinds of apes chimps orangutans gorillas rush from their separate enclosures
caesars apes are waiting for them
caesar makes eye contact with the grizzled old male chimpanzee
then as a unit they all run for the exit
by now all the animals are going crazy
above the sky is full of helicopters now some police some news crews
apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the street
the one with the white on his shoulder
a sniper takes aim at caesar the bullet ricochets off the jacobs watches a tow truck pull away with his ruined black jaguar in tow
he climbs into a waiting taxi
he looks like hell
the taxi driver a guy with a thick mustache turns around to face him
where to my man
want me to turn down the air
apes leap over cars run in and out of traffic
pedestrians take cover
sniper fire rings out from helicopters above an ape falls
caesars leading running alongside cornelia
caesar slows with her concerned
she looks ill
but cornelia digs deep and picks up her speed
caesar continues on
wills plastered to the window anxiously watching caesars progress
below the black locust that is the pack of apes has grown larger but they stay together moving implacably north through the san francisco streets
up ahead the golden gate bridge comes into view majestic shimmering in the afternoon light
and will realizes the moment he sees it
theyre going to muir woods
turning to huffs im sure of it
he doesnt want to hurt anyone hes just trying to get the apes out of the city
shut down the golden gate bridge
no let them through
cars speed across the bridge in both directions
highway patrolmen rush to block the entrances
the apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge a stampeding phalanx with caesar at the lead
but cornelia cant keep up any more
losing her balance she stumbles falls
caesar rushes to cornelias side
by the time he reaches her shes dead a white foam has formed at her lips
shes been poisoned
flashback of cornelia sniffing the cookie
will yelling dont
caesar devastated the rage building in his face
he looks up as one of the helicopters buzzes low he sees caesar struggles to his feet with cornelia in his arms hes going to carry her across the bridge
other helicopters buzz low shots ring out sirens close in
apes take cover around trees and structures but theyre getting picked off
maurice takes cornelia from caesars arms as buck and rocket urge him forward
koba hangs back watching fascinated as maurice lays cornelias body on the grass
wills gone pale
is he hurt
no not him
two chp patrol cars are frantically stopping new traffic from entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through
suddenly out of the fog the apes appear
traffic slams to a halt
people are stunned as chimps gorillas orangutans vault over their cars run down the middle of the traffic stampeding across the bridge
helicopters buzz around like flies sharpshooters unable to get a safe shot
blocked off by chp all traffic stopped
a few helicopters touch down sharpshooters jump out rifles ready and follow on foot behind squad cars four across caesar and his apes race forward
will and stewart watch from above as the apes stream northward over and around stopped cars
tell them to hold their fire until they get past the traffic
will sees below that soon caesar and the apes will reach a place on the bridge where there are no more cars
then theyll be open season
then he sees the four squad cars slowly approaching from the north end of the bridge sharpshooters and dodge on foot behind them
caesar looks ahead realizes that hes at the end of the bridge traffic
ahead is empty roadway
and the slowly approaching squad cars
he looks up at the helicopters rifles at the ready
he sees the fog swirling in and out of the suspension caesar signals to maurice
maurice glances over the bridge railing
the bay churns and swirls hundreds of feet below
caesar barks at maurice who then climbs over the railing taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him
caesar barks a command at buck who waits by the last car with a pack of gorillas and some chimps
then caesar starts to climb
shimmying up a cable and into the fog
rockets right behind
the remaining apes follow
from the sky will sees caesar divide up his army
chimps ascend cables disappearing in and out of patches of fog
orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck
and buck with his gorilla take refuge in the stalled traffic
maurice finds bars and support beams
he and the below deck apes begin swinging their way toward the
apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog arriving at the main cable the thick one running along the top
they start scampering and swinging north the fog moving and a sharpshooter from a helicopter takes a shot
a chimp falls to his death
its a long fall until splash the chimp hits the water
they keep moving
the four patrol cars stop creating a barricade
the sharpshooters line up their rifles ready to shoot
they fire at the apes above them but its tough going the apes are in constant motion and the fog obscures them
bullets can be heard ricocheting off cables
another chimp falls to its death
then a heavy patch of fog rolls in engulfing the middle part of the bridge surrounding the barricade
visibilitys practically zero
theyre all around us
apes swing above them scamper by them
movement whoosh dodge nervous crouches low
he edges backwards hopeful of some visibility
thats when he sees caesar clear and out of the fog theres glare from a ray of sunlight thats broken through the fog
he shoots barely missing
the bullet ricochets off the main cable
rocket climbing behind caesar looks down sees dodge aiming again
he starts swinging towards caesar
another shot from dodge
this time the bullet grazes then using all his strength rocket pulls caesar back up to
rockets hit in the back
he and caesar make eye contact as rocket falls off the caesar screams looks down at dodge who aims again
but dodge is diverted by a rumbling like an earthquake on the gorillas are in motion
lead by buck they charge toward like a freight train of menacing power
helicopters fire men at the barricade shoot as they try to back up
a gorilla falls
but they keep on coming
and now climbing up from below behind the barricade maurice and the orangutans join in
their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable
koba hangs back
hes away from the action but the battle waged above is audible
he creeps along toward the north end of the bridge
as the fog lifts for a moment we see apes swinging on vanquishing the humans
terrified but refusing to run dodge fires reloads fires again his face red with the tension of whats to come
dodges body twirls through the air will stewart and huffs watch dumbstruck as dodges body below the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the bridge and follows caesar
through the north exit
disappearing into the dense park
police reinforcements and emergency vehicles arrive
wills helicopter has set down
he and stewart stand near an assembling army an amalgamation of human special forces
huffs and a small group of officers debate nearby
we cant gas the forest
the slightest wind would take it over to tiburon
well itll take us months to find them in there
not to mention rounding them all up
will approaches the group
i know where they are
the officers look at him
who the hell is this guy
huffs embarrassed gestures toward will
this man owns one of the chimps
the so called leader
says he can reason him out
his name is caesar
i think hell listen to me
if he comes out the other apes will follow
sounds pretty far fetched
you think you know where to find this monkey
will starts to correct him lets it go
i used to bring him here
the officers look at each other
we dont have a lot of options
lets give it a try
but you have to promise me if i can get them out youll take them peacefully
tranquilize them cage them
whatever it takes
will and stewart stand at the edge of the woods
theyre at the path caesar and will used to take
shes terrified trying to mask it
you think this is a bad idea
he thought so
hes never going to agree to come out with you
got to try right
i owe him that much
will kisses her
heads off down the path
then he pauses turns to look at her
think hell forgive me
cant quite hear him what
will waves it off never mind
stewart watches him walk down the trail
and disappear into the woods
flash of black up ahead
his pulse quickens he follows it
crackling of branches
more black swinging through the trees
is it caesar
will enters the clearing
he knows this place
up ahead is the grove of trees with the canopy that caesar always loved
huffs stands looking at his watch
he looks up turns to an follow me
stewart double takes sees the army head off in wills hang on a second
to nearest officer where are they going
looks are exchanged
someone grabs stewart who struggles with all her might
will heads toward the grove of trees
he keeps walking almost there
a dark figure drops down in will takes a step back fear crawling up the back of his neck
koba stands up tall
he takes his time like hes enjoying every second of this
he walks towards will bares his teeth
suddenly caesar appears slamming into koba knocking him away
which leaves just will and caesar
will pauses theres so much he wants to say
i owe you an apology
will want caesar dead
i thought you had killed a man
but i should have known better
caesars face is unreadable
will cant tell what hes thinking
i want you to know that all of this is my fault
can you forgive me
birds take sudden flight
caesars eyes shift to the path
will realizes hes been betrayed
wait no will leave
i wont will leave now
im staying with you
caesar pushes him
will staggers backwards falls down
at that moment huffs and his army step into the clearing
huffs takes aim at caesar
huffs and his men are taken by surprise
shots are fired but not fast enough
caesar lays will out on the forest floor
theres a lot of blood
will tries to speak
he looks up at caesar
caesar takes him in his arms cradles him with love
will looks into caesars green eyes
then the life passes out of him
stewart sits in the back of a locked police car looking out at the forest in the gathering darkness
all is quiet
the forest is vast dark green
hunsiker wills neighbor exits his house with a small rolling suitcase
hes wearing his pilots uniform
hunsiker enters settles into the seat
where to my man
its the taxi driver with the mustache the same one that sfo
you got it
the driver coughs as he pulls away
light sweat on his forehead he doesnt look too good
close on wheels turning
hunsiker pulls his suitcase on wheels through the airport terminal
its teeming with travelers
holding on to the bannister hunsiker takes the escalator up
hunsiker says hello to the flight staff and moves to the front of the plane
hunsiker shakes hands with his co pilot and sits
he flicks a switch
the airplane takes off into the sky
as the ape search continues a virulent flu strain has exploded in and around san francisco sending shock waves and panic throughout the community
we move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy of trees
as we get closer we notice flashes of movement
authorities suspect the origin of the deadly virus might be gen sys laboratories the same private company from which several laboratory chimpanzees escaped earlier this week were still fifty yards
away from the trees but we can see its filled with apes chimpanzees orangutans gorillas
we keep pushing in closer and closer to the trees
as we move past the leaves we find buck
and sitting all of them have eyes in varying shades of green
as the death toll rapidly rises hospitals are desperately trying to meet the growing demand
caesar sits alone staring straight at us
although isolated in the western region of the country the numbers are catastrophic and quickly rising
push in on caesars face
efforts to quarantine appear to have failed
the strain has been spotted as far away as singapore and australia
casualties have reached apocalyptic levels
authorities urge you to stay inside your homes
for those of you who can hear me i say
gods speed and so long to you all
