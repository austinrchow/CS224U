b if window
href b b aliens by james cameron by james cameron may silent and endless
the stars shine like the love of god
cold and remote
against them drifts a tiny chip of technology
closer shot it is the narcissus lifeboat of the ill fated star freighter nostromo
without interior or running lights it seems devoid of life
the ping of a ranging radar grows louder closer
a shadow engulfs the narcissus
searchlights flash on playing over the tiny ship as a massive dark hull descends toward it
dark and dormant as a crypt
the searchlights stream in the dusty windows
outside massive metal forms can be seen descending around the shuttle
like the tolling of a bell a basso profundo clang reverberates through the hull
close on the airlock door light glares as a cutting torch bursts through the metal
sparks shower into the room
a second torch cuts through
they move with machine precision cutting a rectangular path converging
the torches meet
the door falls inward revealing a bizarre multi armed figure
a robot welder
figures enter backlit and ominous
three men in bio isolation suits carrying lights and equipment
they approach a sarcophaguslike hypersleep capsule f
filtered internal pressure positive
assume nominal hull integrity
hypersleep capsules style circa late twenties
his gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the canopy
angle inside capsule as light stabs in where the dust is wiped away illuminating a woman her face in peaceful repose
warrant officer ripley sole survivor of the nostromo
nestled next to her is jones the ships wayward cat
voice over filtered lights are green
well there goes out salvage guys
shes lying in a bed looking wan as a female med tech raises the backrest
she is surrounded by arcane white medical equipment
the med tech exudes practiced cheeriness
why dont i open the viewport
watch your eyes
harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into the ceiling revealing a breathtaking vista
beyond the sprawling complex of modular habitats collectively called gateway station is the curve of earth as seen from high orbit
blue and serene
and how are we today
thats better than yesterday at least
how long have i been on gateway station
just a couple of days
do you feel up to a visitor
ripley shrugs not caring
the door opens and a man enters although ripley sees only what he is carrying
a familiar large orange tomcat
she grabs the cat like a life preserver
cooing baby cat talk come here jonesy you ugly old moose
you ugly thing
jones patiently endures ripleys embarrassing display seeming none the worse for wear
the visitor sits beside the bed and ripley finally notices him
he is thirtyish and handsome in a suit that looks executive or legal the tie loosened with studied casualness
a smile referred to as winning
i work for the company but other than that im an okay guy
glad to see youre feeling better
im told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon
side effects of the unusually long hypersleep or something like that
how long was i out there
they wont tell me anything
soothing well maybe you shouldnt worry about that just yet
ripley grabs his arm surprising him
burke gazes at her thoughtful
my instinct says youre strong enough to handle this
fifty seven years
ripley is stunned
she seems to deflate her expression passing through amazement and shock to realization of all she has lost
youd drifted right through the core systems
its blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they
are you all right
ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression becomes one of dawning horror
burke hands her a glass of water from the nightstand
she slaps it away
it shatters with a smash
jones dives yowling
ripley grabs her chest struggling as if she is strangling
the med tech hits a console button
shouting code blue
burke and the med tech are holding ripleys shoulders as she goes into convulsions
a doctor and two techs run in
ripleys back arches in agony
they try to restrain her as she thrashes knocking over equipment
her ekg races like mad
jones under a cabinet hisses wide eyed
get me an airway stat
and fifteen ccs of
an explosion of blood beneath the sheet covering her chest
ripley stares at the shape rising under the sheet
tearing itself out of her
as the sheet rises
a glimpse of the tight on ripley screaming snapping up into frame
alone in the darkened hospital room
she gasps for breath clutching pathetically at her chest
there is no demented horror rigging itself out of her
her eyes snap about wildly slowly focusing on the reality of her safety
shuddering bathed in sweat she kneads her breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs
a video monitor beside the bed snaps on
a med techs face
bad dreams again
do you want something to help you sleep
ive slept enough
the med tech shrugs and switches off
touching a button on the nightstand she opens the viewport revealing gateway and the turquoise earth
she hugs jones to her and rocks with him like a child still shattered by the nightmare
sleep is far off
we made it jones
we made it
but at what price
sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars beyond which a verdant meadow is visible
jones stalks toward a bird hopping among fallen leaves
and smack into a wall
voice over dumbshit
wider angle as jones steps back confused from the high resolution environmental wall screen a sort of cinerama video loop
ripley sits on a bench in what we now see is an atrium off the medical center still somewhere in the bowels of gateway station
some unenthusiastic potted trees
the sterile corridors visible beyond glass doors b
burke enters in his usual mode casual haste
ive been running behind all morning
ripley seems healthier now but still a bit brittle
have they located my daughter yet
well i was going to wait until after the inquest
he opens his briefcase removing a sheet of printer hard copy including a telestat photo
scanning amanda ripley mcclaren
married name i guess
age sixty six at time of death
two years ago
looks at her im sorry
ripley studies the photograph stunned
the face of a woman in her mid sixties
it could be anybody
she tries to reconcile the face with the little girl she once knew
they still havent licked that one
interred parkside repository little chute wisconsin
ripley gazes off into the pseudo landscape into the past
i promised her id be home for her birthday
her eleventh birthday
i sure missed that one
she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt
when it came to flight schedules anyway
burke nods a simpatico presence
you always think you can make it up to somebody
later you know
but now i never can
i never can
lets get one thing straight
ripley can be one tough lady
but the terror the loss the emptiness are in this moment overwhelming
she cries silently
burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm
gently the hearing convenes at
you dont want to be late
elevator doors part and ripley emerges in mid conversation with burke
dollying ahead of them as they move rapidly down the corridor
you read my deposition
its complete and accurate
look i believe you but there are going to be some heavyweights in there
you got feds you got interstellar commerce commission you got colonial administration insurance company guys
i get the picture
just tell them what happened
the important thing is to stay cool and unemotional
shes not cool
do you people have earwax of what
we have been here three hours
how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story
she faces the eight members of the board of inquiry at a long conference table
gray suits and grim faces
they arent buying
behind ripley on a large video screen parker grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot
his file prints out next to it
bretts face and dossier replace it and then the others as the scene continues
kane lambert ash the android traitor dallas
van leuwen the icc representative steeples his fingers and frowns
look at it from our perspective
you freely admit to detonating the engines of and thereby destroying an m class star freighter
a rather expensive piece of hardware
dryly forty two million in adjusted dollars
thats minus payload of course
the shuttles flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account
that the nostromo set down on lv an unsurveyed planet at that time
that repairs were made
that it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self destruct
for reasons unknown
look i told you
it did not however contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up
ripley sense the noose tightening
then somebodys gotten to it
doctored the recorder
who had access to it
the eca extrasolar colonization administration representative eca rep just shakes his head
would you just listen to yourself for one minute
ripley glares at the eca rep a woman on the ungenerous side of fifty
van leuwen sighs with exasperation
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe
losing it thats because i blew it out the goddamn airlock
pause like i said
to eca rep are there any species like this hostile organism on lv
its a rock
no indigenous life larger than a simple virus
ripley grits her teeth in frustration
i told you it wasnt indigenous
there was an alien spacecraft there
a derelict ship
we homed on its beacon
to be perfectly frank weve surveyed over three hundred worlds and no ones ever reported a creature which using your words
read from ripleys statement gestates in a living human host and has concentrated molecular acid for blood
ripley glances at burke silent at the far end of the table
his expression is grim
her mouth hardens as a bit of the old nail eating ripley surfaces
look i can see where this is going
but im telling you those things exist
back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs
do you understand
i suggest you find it using the flight recorders data
find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise
thank you officer ripley
that will be
louder stepping on him because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew within twelve hours of hatching
van leuwen stands out of patience
thank you that will be all
ripley stares him down glowering at the board
thats not all goddamnit
if those things get back here that will be all
then you can just kiss it good bye jack
just kiss it goodbye
ripley turns sharply away trembling with frustration and anger
dallas looks back at her from the video screen his eyes burning from the photograph as we ripley kicks the wall next to burke who is getting coffee and donuts
at a vending machine
you had them eating out of your hand kiddo
they had their minds made up before i even went in there
they think im a head case
cheerfully you are a head case
have a donut
van leuwen clears his throat
it is the finding of this board of inquiry that warrent officer ellen ripley noc
has acted with questionable judgment and is unfit to hold an icc license as a commercial flight officer
burke watches ripley taking it on the chin white lipped but subdued
said license is hereby suspended indefinitely
no criminal charges will be filed at this time and you are released on own recognizance for a six month period of psychometric probation to include monthly review by an
icc psychiatric tech
dolly back as the conference room door bangs open and ripley strides through
she shrugs off burkes restraining arm and catches up to van leuwen walking down the corridor
insistent why wont you check out lv
condescendingly because i dont have to
the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and hostile organism or alien ship
and by the way they call it acheron now
what are you talking about
van leuwen steps into an elevator with some others but ripley holds the door from closing
its what we call a shake n bake colony
they set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable
theyve already been there over twenty years
the door tries to close
ripley slams it back
people are getting annoyed
how many colonists
sixty maybe seventy families
low sweet jesus
do you mind
ripleys hand slides off the door strengthless
tight on her from inside the elevator as the doors close like fate on her lost expression
a hideous storm blasted vista
tortured rock forms
bleak twilight at midday
pan slowly onto a corroded metal sign set in concrete pylons which reads some local has added below in spray can graffiti have a nice day
gale force wind screeches around the steel sign driving a freezing rain
the colony b
is a squat complex with lots of floodlights
the town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete buildings connected by conduits
neon signs throw garish colors across the vaultlike walls advertising bars and other businesses
it looks like a sodden cross between the krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in the nevada boondocks
huge wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted street and vanish down rampways to underground garages
angle on the control block the largest structure
it resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft carrier
a flying bridge
visible across a half kilometer of barren heath b
is the massive complex of the nearest atmosphere processor looking like a power plant bred with an active volcano
its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover like a steel mill
a central space laid out like a scaled down shopping mall with no styling flourishes
we see a cross section of the types of people who have come to live on godforsaken acheron
grapes of wrath faces
not too many interior decorators
some children race in the corridor on things that look suspiciously like big wheels
jammed with computer terminals technicians displays
most of the business of running the colony flows through here
its high tech but used and scrungy
papers piled up
coffee cup rings
dolly ahead of lydecker the assistant operations manager as he catches up to the harried operating manager you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau out past the
ilium range a couple days ago
theres a guy on the horn mom and pop survey team
says hes homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored
some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere we look
they dont say why and i dont ask
i dont ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answers always dont ask
so what do i tell this guy
tell him as far as im concerned he finds something its his
it roars across corrugated rock blasting through soggy drifts of volcanic ash
at the controls intent on a pinging scope is russ jorden independent prospector
beside him is his wife partner anne and in the back their two kids are playing among the heavy sampling equipment
gloating cackle look at this fat juicy magnetic profile
and its mine mine mine
half mine dear
newt their six year old daughter yells from the back
and half mine
i got too many partners
daddy when are we going back to town
when we get rich newt
you always say that
i wanna go back
i wanna play monster maze
her older brother tim sticks his jeering face close to hers
you cheat too much
im just the best
you go in places we cant fit
thats why im the best
knock it off
i catch either of you playing in the air ducts again ill tan your hides
all the kids play it
reverently holy shiiit
angle through front canopy on a bizarre shape looming ahead
an enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from the bed of ash
the tractor slows
canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping by the lava flow it is still recognizable as an extraterrestrial ship
folks we have scored big this time
jorden and anne step down wearing environment suits
carrying lights packs cameras test gear
their breath clouds in the chill air
you kids stay inside
i mean it
well be right back
they trudge toward the alien derelict
shouldnt we call in
lets wait till we know what to call it in as
nervous how about big weird thing
they pause at a twisted gash in the hull
newt has her face pressed to the glass steaming it
watching her parents enter the strange ship
tim grabs her from behind
the tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless
the wind howls around them
tim is curled up in the drivers seat
newt shakes him awake trying hard not to cry
theyve been gone a long time
tim considers the night
the vast landscape
he bites his lip
quavering itll be okay newt
dad knows what hes doing
newt screams as the door beside her is ripped open
a dark shape lunges inside
anne panting and terrified grabs the dash mike
this is alpha kilo two four niner calling hadley control
as anne shouts the mayday newt looks past her to the ground
russ jorden lies there inert dragged somehow by anne from inside the ship
there is something on his face
an appalling multilegged creature pulsing with obscene life
newt begins to scream hysterically competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a crescendo as we silence
ripley looking haggard sits at a table in the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from her cigarette
the place is modest to be charitable and there are few personal touches
though its late in the day ripley is still wearing a robe
the bed is unmade
dishes in the sink
jones prowls across the counter
the wallscreen is on blaring vapidly
i heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies
best decision i ever made bill
well be starting a new life from scratch in a clean world
the door buzzes
ripley jumps like a cat
carter burke stands in the narrow dingy corridor with lieutenant gorman colonial marine corps
young and severe in his officers dress black
the door opens slightly
this is lieutenant gorman of the
burke buzzes again
talks to the door
ripley we have to talk
pause theyve lost contact with the colony on acheron
the door opens
ripley considers the ramifications of that
she motions them inside
burke and gorman are seated nursing coffee
ripley paces very tense
theres no way
hear me out
i was reamed steamed and dry cleaned by you guys
and now you want me to go back out there
we see that shes gut scared covering it with anger
burke sees it
look we dont know whats going on out there
it may just be a down transmitter
but if its not i want you there
as an advisor
you wouldnt be going in with the troops
i can guarantee your safety
these colonial marines are some tough hombres and theyre packing state of the art firepower
nothing they cant handle
cool were trained to deal with these kinds of situations
to burke what about you
whats your interest in this
well the corporation co financed that colony with the colonial administration against mineral rights
were getting into a lot of terraforming
building better worlds
burke is revealing his early days in sales
i saw the commercial
i heard you were working in the cargo docks
defensive thats right
running loaders forklifts that sort of thing
shrugging its all i could get
anyway it keeps my mind off of
days off are worse
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer
and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract
if i go
if you go
pause its a second chance kiddo
and itll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it
you gotta get back on the horse
frosty spare me burke
ive had my psych evaluation this month
burke leans close a lets cut the crap intimacy
yes and ive read it
you wake up every night sheets soaking the same nightmare over and over
the answer is no
now please go
just go would you
burke nods to gorman who rises with him
he slips a translucent card onto the table heads for the door
think about it
as the wind howls through tormented rock building in pitch until we ripley lunges into frame with an animal outcry
she clutches her chest breathing hard
bathed in sweat she lights a cigarette with trembling hands
do we hear a faint desolate wind
tight on phone console as ripleys hand inserts burkes card into a slot
stand by prints out on the screen and is replaced by burkes face bleary with sleep
on video phone yello
burke just tell me one thing
that youre going out there to kill them
not bring back
just burn them out
thats the plan
my word on it
closeup ripley taking a deep slow breath
its time to look the demon in the eye
she punches off before burke replies before she can change her mind
she turns to jones sitting on the bed and her tone becomes admonishing
and you my dear are staying right here
jones blinks cynical cat eyes
count me right out
an empty starfield
metal spires slice across frame
a mountain of steel following
a massive military transport ship the sulaco
an empty corridor seemingly miles long
the thrumming of hyperdrive engines
an enormous chamber cavernous and dark
squatting in the shadows are two orbit to surface shuttles
heavy machinery all around them
cranes loading equipment
dark electronic womb
camera dollies slowly among murmuring instrumentation
a sudden high pitched trilling accompanies a sequence of lights
blackness until a bank of indicators lights up
hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of horizontal hypersleep cylinders
it reaches the ceiling
close on ripleys capsule as trickles of water run down the frosted canopy
lit up white and sterile
the canopies of the row of capsules are raised
ripley sits up
rubs her arms briskly
next to her gorman and burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers wearing shorts and dog tags
they are corporal dietrich female med tech pfc vasquez female smart gun operator corporal ferro female drop ship pilot the ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so there is
no crew except for executive officer eca bishop who supervises planetary maneuvering
groans echo across the chamber
im getting too old for this shit
spunkmeyer says this sincerely though he must have enlisted underage not long ago
looking surly drake sits up
hes young as well but street tough
nasty scar curling his lip into a sneer
they aint payin us enough for this
not enough to have to wake up to your face drake
you look like i feel
hicks an older lifer type who keeps his own counsel just snorts good naturedly
ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a bank of lockers
though not supermen they are lean and hardened
tough capable jaded
they combine the specialized techno combat training of the twenty first century fighting man with those qualities universal to grunts through the ages
sergeant apone moves down the row of freezers
this floors freezing
i never saw such a buncha old women
you want me to fetch your slippers hudson
would you sir
ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding cursory hellos
she feels isolated by the camaraderie of this tightknit group
vasquez eyes her coldly as she passes
like drake vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat primer was the street in a los angeles barrio
she is tough even by the standards of this group
eyes cunning and mean
you ever been mistaken for a man
she slaps drakes open palm and it clenches into a greeting which is part contest
it gets rougher
until she cuffs him hard and they break with vicious laughter
conscripted from juvenile prison the two of them were trained to operate the formidable smart guns
that is part of their bond
bishop is helping everyone like a valet
as he passes close to her ripley notices a strange tattoo across the back of his left hand
an alpha numeric code
hey hand job you take my towel
overlapping i need some slack man
how come they send us straight back out like this
we got some slack comin man
you just got three weeks
i mean breathing not this frozen shit
what about it
you know it aint up to me
lets knock off the grabass
first assemblys in fifteen
lets shag it
high pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when you step out
a drive through car wash for people
through the swirling steam hudson vasquez and ferro are watching ripley dry off
whos the fresh meat again
shes supposed to be some kinda consultant
exaggerated she was an alien once
an unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers assemble at one long table while gorman burke bishop and ripley sit at another
everybody is nursing a coffee waiting for eggs from the autochef
among the troopers dress discipline is lax
fatigues customized and emblazoned with patches
drakes tunic is cut off to a vest and has eat the apple and fuck the corps stenciled on back
peace through superior firepower pray for war and ive served my time in hell cetti epsilon nc are some others
whats the op
theres some juicy colonists daughters we gotta rescue from virginity
apone is stocky grizzled with peregrine eyes
he runs it loose and fair but only because he knows his people are the best
whats this crap supposed to be
cornbread i think
hey i wouldnt mind getting me some more a that arcturan poontang
remember that time
low looks like that new lieutenants too good to eat with us grunts
glancing over shoulder yeah
got a corn cob up his ass definitely
across the room at the other table gorman sits with his creases perfect
the consummate strack nco
bishop takes a seat beside ripley who pointedly gets up and moves to the far side of the table
he looks wounded
im sorry you feel that way about synthetics ripley
ripley spins on burke her tone accusing
you never said anything about an android being here
well it didnt occur to me
its been policy for years to have a synthetic on board
i prefer the term artificial person myself
is there a problem
a synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out
some deaths were involved
was it an older model
cyberdyne systems a
bishop turns to ripley very conciliatory
well that explains it
the a s were always a bit twitchy
that could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors
impossible for me to harm or by omission of action allow to be harmed a human being
smiling more cornbread
ripley knocks the plate out of his hand halfway across the room
just stay away from me bishop
you got that straight
burke and gorman exchange glances
wierzbowski at the next table shrugs and turns back to the other troopers
she dont like the cornbread either
wider angle as the troops snap to from their lounging among the racks of high tech weaponry
gorman enters with burke and ripley
im sorry we didnt have time to brief before we left gateway but
annoyed yes hicks
whats the question
is this going to be a stand up fight sir on another bug hunt
all we know is that theres still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved
to wierzbowski low its a bug hunt
louder so what are these things
gorman nods to ripley who stands before the troops
she sets some recording diskettes on the table
ive dictated what i know on these
tease us a bit
its important to understand this organisms life cycle
its actually two creatures
the first form hatches from a spore
a sort of large egg and attaches itself to its victim
then it injects an embryo detaches and dies
its essentially a walking sex organ
the sounds like you hicks
controlled the embryo the second form hosts in the victims body for several hours
with difficulty then it
grows rapidly i only need to know one thing
where they are
vasquez coolly points her finger cocks her thumbs and blows away an imaginary alien
somebody said alien
she thought they said illegal alien and signed up
icy am i disturbing you conversation mr
hudson settles down smirking
ripley locks eyes with vasquez
i hope youre right
i really do
to all i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you
are there any questions
how do i get out of this chicken shit outfit
gorman scowls then thanking ripley with a nod takes over the predrop briefing
i want this to go smooth and by the numbers
i want dcs and tactical database assimilation by
some groans ordnance loading weapons strip and drop ship prep details will have seven hours
they have arrived
from orbit the planet looks serene pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental torment beneath
the sulaco floats its maneuvering jets firing
a bluish glow
then twice more rapidly
bishop is installed in his command seat hemmed in by instrumentation
into mike attention
this concluded final maneuvering operations
thank you for your cooperation
you may resume work
sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing clang
pull back as the rack of tactical missiles is lifted revealing two powerful hydraulic arms
spunkmeyer seated inside a power loader swings the ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the drop ship where it locks into place
as he exerts pressure with his hands against the servo controls the hydraulic arms move correspondingly
but with a thousandfold increase in power
the forklift style claws on each arm can crush with tons of pressure
the loader has an open roll cage to protect the operator and is supported by squat hydraulic legs which also move correspondingly with the drivers movements
you have never seen anything like this before
advanced as it is to us its only an old forklift to them
battered and well used
covered with grease
repainted many times
across the back is stencilled spunkmeyers machine swings out from under the drop ship and we become aware of the intense activity throughout the cavernous loading bay
troopers on foot or driving tow mowers overhead loading arms
all in motion
hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest
wierzbowski drake and vasquez are fieldstripping light weapons with precise movements
around them in racks is an arsenal of advanced personal artillery
vasquez likes the feel of the guns the weight
her hands move without hesitation
she swings one of the smart guns out on a work stand
using a body brace and gyro stabilized support arm it is a computer aimed video targeted automatic weapon
the futuristic equivalent of a
caliber light machine gun
sort of a steadicam that kills
with pre flight activity b
still nothing from the colony
dead on all channels
ripley watches the drop ship being loaded
a cross between a huey aircobra gunship and the space shuttle might describe it
an orbit to surface troop carrier heavily armed for the close support of ground missions
she watches a six wheeled apc armored personnel carrier being raised hydraulically into the ships belly
ripley looks around as frost wheels a rack of incomprehensible equipment toward her
ripley jumps aside nodding apologetically
steps hastily back
hudson cruises by with a laden forklift
angle on apone standing with hicks as ripley approaches him i feel like a fifth wheel here
is there anything i can do
i dont know
is there anything you can do
pointing i can drive that loader
ive got a class two rating
my latest career move
a second power loader sits unused in an equipment bay
two shot apone and hicks skeptical
tight on power switch as ripleys finger punches it on
a rising whine of power
tight on the hydraulics as the massive machine stirs to life
full as the loader starts
ripley is strapped into the safety cage her arms and legs inserted in the servo sensor assemblies
she takes a step
two tons of hardened steel takes a step
ripley spins the wrist servos
the huge claws swing open
slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a cargo module nearby
she raises it deftly
where you want it
hicks looks at apone cocks an eyebrow appreciatively
the troopers are suiting up for the drop
strapping on their bulky combat armor
interlocking plates like football padding
they tape their wrists
draw on segmented boots
the sole cleats clack like hooves on the deck plates
their fingers move methodically over the fastenings
it has its own rhythm
lets move it girls
on the ready line
lets go lets go
ripley wearing a flight jacket and headset files into the ship with the hulking troopers
inside they pass directly into the apc we saw loaded earlier and take seats facing each other across a narrow aisle
they will drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for rapid deployment
a klaxon sounds signalling depressurization of the cargo lock
hudson prowls the aisle his movements predatory and exaggerated
ripley watches him working his way toward her
i am ready man
ready to get it on
check it out
i am the ultimate badass
state of the badass art
you do not want to fuck with me
hey ripley dont worry
me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you
check it out
he slaps the servo cannon controls in the gun bay above them
independently targetting particle beam phalanx
fry half a city with this puppy
we got tactical smart missles phased plasma pulse rifles rpgs
we got sonic eeelectronic ballbreakers we got nukes we got knives
sharp sticks hicks grabs hudson by his battle harness and pulls him into a seat
his voice is low but it carries
ripley nods her thanks to hicks
motors whine and the craft lurches
burke next to ripley grins eagerly like this is a sport fishing trip
here we go
she looks like shes in a gas chamber waiting for the pellet to drop
the drop ship lowers from the cargo lock on a massive launch rig
the night side of acheron yawns below
ferro and spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches
initiate release sequencer on my mark
clamps slam back
the ship drops
apone stalking the aisle snatches for a handhold
bishop burke and gorman groan at the sudden gees
ripley closes her eyes
the point of no return
it screams down through the stratosphere plunging into dark turbulence
beyond the canopy is gray limbo
the craft shudders and lurches
icy calm switching to dcs ranging
two four o
nominal to profile
picking up some hull ionization
rough air ahead
tight on hicks asleep in his harness
voice over filtered stand by for some chop
tight on gorman as the ship begins to buck his eyes closed
he rubs his hands on his knees repeatedly
how may drops is this for you lieutenant
how many combat drops
three including this one
vasquez and drake exchange do you believe this shit expressions
ripley looks accusingly at burke
turning on final
coming around to a seven zero niner
terminal guidance locked in
wheres the damn beacon
it emerges from the low cloud ceiling
from the twilight haze ahead the distant colony landing beacons become visible
stumbling as the ship pitches ripley makes her way forward to the mobile tactical operations bay mtob a control console lined with monitor screens
she joins burke watching over gormans shoulder as the lieutenant plays the board like a video director
tight on monitor console revealing screens labelled with the names of the troopers
two for each soldier
the upper screens show images from the image intensified video cameras in their helmets
the lower screens are bio monitors eeg ekg and other graphic life function readouts
other screens show exterior views
everybody on line
drake check you camera
there seems to be a
close on drake as he whacks himself on the head with an ammo case
a familiar malfunction
s thats better
pan it around a bit
fire team a
somebody wake up hicks
a clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons
vasquez and drake buckle on their smart gun body harnesses
ripley watches the ap station loom on the exterior screens
that the atmosphere processor
one of thirty or so all over the planet
theyre completely automated
we manufacture them by the way
the tiny ship circles the roaring tower
a metal volcano thundering like the engines on gods lear jet
gorman plays with the controls zooming the image of the colony
to ferro via mike hold at forty
slow circle of the complex
the structure seems intact
they have power
on the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor
to apone okay lets do it
i want a nice clean dispersal this time
ripley turns as vasquez squeezes past her
you staying in here
turning away figures
to ferro via mike set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast
immediate dust off on my clear then stay on station
ten seconds people
landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet tarmac
the ship roars down extending the loading ramp
slams down on hydraulic landing legs
the apc hits the ground a moment later pulling away from the ship as it leaps up in a cloud of spray and peels off circling
the apc pulls to the edge of the complex
the crew door opens
troopers hit the ground running
they drop behind immediate cover
apone scans with him image intensifier visor lowered
through the starlight scope visor
bright as a sunny day though contrasty and lurid we see the colony buildings
trash blows in the street
no other movement
voice over filtered first squad up on line
hicks get yours in a cordon
watch the rear
vasquez take point
sprinting in a skirmish line apones team advances on the colony main entry lock
parked tightly across the doors are two heavy duty tractors
vasquez reaches one of the tractors looks inside
the controls are ripped out as if by a crowbar or axe
she moves on
vasquez reaches the main doors drake flanking on the right
apone tries the door controls
hudson run a bypass
hudson all business now moves up and studies the door control panel
he pries off the facing and starts clipping on the bypass wires
first squad assemble on me at the main lock
the wind roars around the bleak structures
a neon sign creaks overhead
hudson makes a connection
the door shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside
it jams partway open
apone motions vasquez inside
she eases over the wrecked tractor through the doors
the others follow
voice over filtered second team move up
dollying slowly forward following vasquez and apone as they move into the broad corridor
a few emergency lights are still on
wind moans along the concourse
pools of water cover the floor
farther down rain drips through blast holes in the ceiling
evidence of a fire fight with pulse rifles
on vasquez moving forward
her smart gun cannon swinging slowly in an arc
she studies the video aiming monitor looking down rather than ahead
their footsteps echo
ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty colony building
quarter and search by twos
second team move inside
hicks take the upper level
use your motion trackers
hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level
they emerge cautiously
an empty corridor recedes into the dim distance
hicks unslings a rugged piece of equipment
aims it down the hall
he adjusts the gain
it remains silent
they pass rooms and offices
through doors they see increasing signs of struggle
floating sodden in the puddles
ripley et al watching
looks like my room in college
hicks group passes several burnt out rooms
there are no bodies
in several offices the exterior windows are blown out admitting wind and rain
hicks picks up a half eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with rainwater
apones men are searching systematically in pairs
they pass through the colonists modest apartments little more than cubicles
hudson on tracker flanks vasquez as they move forward
hudson touches a splash of color on the wall
his tracker beeps
vasquez whirls cannon aimed
the beeping grows more frequent as hudson advances toward a half open door
the door is splintered partway out of its frame
holes caused by pulse rifle rounds pepper the walls
vasquez eases up to the door
kicks it in
tenses to fire
inside dangling from a piece of flex conduit a junction box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a broken window
it clanks against the rails of a childs bunkbed as it swings
ripley watches hicks monitor
tell him to
plugs in headset jack hicks
tight on monitor as the image shifts revealing a section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular pattern
tight on ripley knowing what it is
voice over filtered you seeing this okay
burke raises an eyebrow at ripley
acid for blood
voice over filtered looks like somebody bagged them one of ripleys bad guys here
hudson is looking at something
hey if you like that youre gonna love this
wider angle showing the trooper standing beneath a gaping hole
another hole directly beneath is at his feet
the acid has melted right down through two levels into the maintenance level
revealing pipes conduit equipment
eaten away by the ferocious substance
whats your status
voice over filtered just finished our sweep
to gorman the place is dead sir
whatever happened we missed it
gorman turns to the others
all right the areas secured
lets go in and see what their computer can tell us
into mike first team head for operations
hudson see if you can get their cpu on line
hicks meet me at the south lock by the up link tower
voice over were coming in
cupping his mike hes coming in
i feel safer already
sotto voice pendejo jerkoff
lights arc across the dormant buildings as the apc turns onto the main drag
it trundles down the rutted street throwing up sheets of filthy water as the massive wheels hit pondlike potholes
windblown rain lashes across the headlights
hicks emerges from the south lock just as the apc rolls up close to the entrance
the crew door slides back
gorman emerges followed by burke bishop and wierzbowski
burke looks back to see ripley stop in the apc doorway eyeing the ominous colony structure
she meets his eyes
shakes her head no
voice over filtered sir the cpu is on line
okay stand by in operations
to those present lets go
the crew door cycles home with a clang
ripley sits in the dark interior lit by the tactical displays
the wind howls outside an incredibly desolate sound
she hugs herself
she knows shes in a tank but remembers the acid
hits the door switch
the crew door opens and ripley emerges
in time to see the lock doors rumbling closed
the wind snatches her words away
the crew door whines shut behind her
she walks to the exterior lock door controls and studies them
she punches some unfamiliar buttons
she looks really nervous alone in the howling wind
she hits another button
the door motors come to life and she relaxes a little
glances behind her
theres a face right there
right at her shoulder
she jumps back gasping for breath
hicks said to keep an eye on you
he gestures for her to precede him inside
ripley catches up with the others as they move into the bowels of the complex
to burke looks like you company can write off its share of this colony
unconcerned its insured
on ripley as they move along the corridor
reacting to the fact that she is back in alien country
she sees the ravaged administration complex
fire gutted offices
hicks notices her looking around nervously
he motions to big wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually falls in beside her on the other side rifle at ready
a two man protective cordon
she glances at hicks
he winks but so fast maybe its something in his eye
trooper frost emerges from a side corridor ahead
sir you should check this out
he leads the way into the corridor
this wing is completely without power
the troopers switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate a scene of devastation worse than they have seen
her expression reveals that ripley is about to turn and flee
right ahead here
they approach a barricade blocking the corridor a hastily welded wall of pipes steel plate outer door panels
acid holes have slashed through the floor and walls in several places
the metal is scratched and twisted by hideously powerful forces peeled back like a soup can on one side
they squeeze through the opening
they pack lights play over the devastation of the colonists last ditch battle
the equipment of the med labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier
the walls are perforated by pulse rifle fire and acid
scorched by untended fires to bare metal
a few instruments glow with emergency power
looks like it was a helluva fight
tight on ripley transfixed by something
low over there
the others turn and approach seeing what she sees
she has entered a second room part of the med lab area
in a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven transparent cylinders
they glow faintly with an eerie violet light given off by the field which preserves the specimens inside
they look like jars containing severed arthritic hands the palsied fingers curled in a death rictus
structurally they are more like spiders with sickening translucent skin a flacid scrotal body gill like organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid
something you definitely do not want on your face for example
are these the same
ripley nods unable to speak
burke leans closer in fascination
his face almost touching one cylinder is lit by its glow
watch it burke
the creature inside lunges suddenly slamming against the glass
burke jumps back
from the palm of the things handlike body emerges a pearl escent tubule
like a tapered piece of intestine which slithers tonguelike over the inside of the glass
then it retracts into a sheath between the gills
to burke it likes you
only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life
burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the hand things remain inertly clenched
these are dead
theres just the two alive
on top of each cylinder is a file folder
ripley takes a folder from above one of the live specimens
inside is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries
reading removed surgically before embryo implantation
subject marachuk john l
died during procedure
looking up they killed him getting it off
they are startled by a loud beep
hicks is intent on his motion tracker aimed back toward the shattered barricade
he gestures at the corridor they just passed through
one of us
into headset apone
where are your people
anybody in d block
voice over filtered negative
were all in operations
vasquez swings the smart gun to ready position on its support arm locking it with an authoritative click
she and hicks head toward the source of the signal the others following
hicks tracker is reading out more rapidly
they turn into the kitchens a stainless steel labyrinth
ripley hangs back
then realizes there is nothing behind her but darkness
she catches up to the group
the troopers enter their lights bouncing around the stainless steel surfaces
vasquez is scanning gaze intense
the other troops grip their weapons tightly
hicks nods toward a complicated array of food processing equipment
they move forward weapons leveled
ripley shuffles forward in the dark
wierzbowski trips over a metal cannister sending it clanging
ripley half climbs the wall
hicks tracker beeps steadily
the beeps merge
become a solid tone
something moves in the dark toppling a rack of stockpots
on vasquez pivoting smoothly to fire
in the same instant hicks rifle slashes into frame
slams vasquez barrel upward
a stream of tracer fire rips into the ceiling the rounds searing like lightning
hicks ignores her moving past and aiming his light under a row of steel cabinets
he gestures to ripley who steps forward
trusting his judgment
she crouches beside him
lit by hicks pack light
a tiny cowering figure
a very dirty very terrified newt jorden
she clutches a plastic food packet in one hand its top gnawed partway through
in the other hand she grips the head of a large doll holding it by the hair
just the head
newt is pathetically emaciated
fragile looking as dresden china her hair tangled and matted
soothingly come on out
its all right
ripley moves toward her reaching slowly under the cabinet
newt backs away trembling visibly her vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights
ripleys hand almost reaches her
the kid bolts like a shot scuttling along beneath the cabinetry
ripley scrambles to follow
to keep her in sight
crabbing frantically sideways
hicks makes a grab catching one tiny ankle
he snaps his hand out a moment later
watchit she bites
the girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the baseboard its grille kicked out
she scrambles inside her tiny body barely fitting wriggling like a fish
in his bulky armor hicks knows hell never make it into the tiny duct
she squirms into the duct without thinking
just ahead she sees newt enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch
ripley pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it and crawls in after her
newt is backed into a cul de sac in the tiny steel chamber
ripley shines her light around in amazement
it is a nest
a nest built by a child
wadded up blankets and pillows line the space mixed up with a haphazard array of toys stuffed animals dolls cheap jewelry comic books empty food packets even a battery operated
all foraged from the wrecked colony
ripley marvels at the childs incredible adaptability the ability to functions even in this nightmarish environment
newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch
ripley grabs her controlling her in a bear hug
the kid struggles wildly like a cat at the vets
eyes wide hands lashing out in a frenzy
its okay its okay
youre going to be all right now
newt goes limp almost catatonic
close on newts traumatized vacant stare her lips are white and trembling her eyes track wildly and she flinches from unseen terrors
we read a dark nightmare world in her eyes
ripleys light falls on something amidst the debris
a framed photograph of newt dressed up and smiling a ribbon in her hair
in embossed gold letters underneath it says sitting huddles in a chair arms around her knees
looking at a point in space
whats her name again
wider angle revealing gorman sitting in front of her while dietrich watches the readouts from a bio monitoring cuff wrapped around newts tiny arm
now think rebecca
just start at the beginning
ripley enters carrying a coffee mug
where are your parents
you have to try
give it a rest would you
gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal
total brain lock
shrugs physically shes okay
borderline malnutrition but i dont think any permanent damage
she unsnaps the bio monitoring cuff
come on were wasting our time
gorman and the others exit leaving only ripley with newt
through the window of the office out on the main floor of the operations room we see gorman join burke and bishop at a computer terminal
ripley kneels beside newt brushing the girls unkempt hair out of her eyes in a gentle maternal fashion
here try this
a little instant hot chocolate
she wraps the childs hands around the cup
raises it to her lips for her
the girl drinks mechanically spilling down her chin
soothing poor thing
you dont talk much do you
thats okay by me
most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much
she sets the cup down and wipes the childs chin clean
i made a clean spot here
now ive done it
guess ill just have to do the whole thing
she pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small cloth and gently washes the little girls face
newts eyes seem to focus on her for the first time
hard to believe
theres a little girl under all this
and a pretty one at that
newt gazes at her
the ground teams are gathered around a terminal in the computer center
hudson has the cpu main computer on line and reading out
tight on monitor screen as an abstract of the main colony ground plan drifts across the screen
hudson bashes at the keyboard his fingers dancing expertly
to gorman whats he scanning for
personal data transmitters
every adult colonist had one surgically implanted
if theyre within twenty klicks well read it out here but so far
ripley is washing newts tiny hands with a cloth pink skin emerging from black grime
i dont know how you managed to stay alive but youre one brave kid rebecca
newts voice is almost inaudible
ripley leans closer
feels like shes breathing on coals
the sound was incomprehensible
what did you say
my n names newt
nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother
ripley grins inanely not wanting to move or speak
or break the spell
well newt it is then
my names ripley
and people call me ripley
ripley picks up her tiny limp hand shaking it formally
pleased to meet you
and who is this
does she have a name
newt glances at the disembodied doll still clutched in one filthy hand
shes my only friend
what about me
newts reply is flat neutral
i dont want you for a friend
because youll be gone soon like the others
youll be dead and youll leave me alone
ripley gazes at her chilled both by the ominous statement and by the situation which could have produced this outlook in a child
you mom and dad went away like that didnt they
newt nods staring at her knees
soothingly theyd be here if they could honey
i know they would
with cold certainty theyre dead
look at me
i wont leave you
cross my heart
and hope to die
ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre expression
quietly and hope to die
and because shes a child the darkest terrors even the ones seen and not imagined can still be banished by a smile and a single promise
newts eyes brim as she gazes at ripley
her lower lip starts to tremble and her face slowly deforms into an abject mask
she sobs as she clamps her arms around ripleys neck
the sobs come in waves as ripley rocks her tears of suppresses terror and grief and hurt rolling down her face
it is a breakthrough
ripley closes her eyes hoping that this promise can be kept
everyone jumps as hudson cries out triumphantly
stop your grinnin and drop your linen
but it looks like all of them
over at the processing station
sublevel c under the south tower
tight on screen showing an amoebalike cluster of flashing blue dots clumped tightly in one area
looks like a goddamn town meeting
lets saddle up
awright lets go girls they aint payin us by the hour
the apc roars across the stygian landscape traversing the causeway which connects the colony to the atmosphere station a kilometer away
behind it the drop ship settles to the ground at the colony landing field
pan with the apc to reveal the massive structure
like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower flickers with spectral light
the troopers sit more subdued now swaying and bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle
wierzbowski is in the saddle
ripley and newt sit side by side just aft of the drivers cockpit
i was the best at the game
i knew the whole maze
you mean the air ducts
yeah you know
in the walls under the floor
i was the ace
i could hide better than anybody
youre really something ace
ripleys gaze shifts out the windshield as the processing station looms ahead
the vast structure towers above the parked personnel carrier
deploying in front of the apc backlit by its lights the troopers cast long shadows
they look ominous
hulking techno samurai
the base of the station is a depthless maze of conduits and pressure vessels like an oil refinery
or a dantean version of one
the thrum of functioning machine systems echoes through the labyrinth
voice over static forty meters in
ramp on axial two two
access to sublevels
the troopers start down the open rampway
light filters down through several levels of steel mesh floor catwalks and pipes
below that is darkness
voice over static b level
next one down
the thrumming of machines grows louder as they descend
huddles around the screens are ripley burke and gorman
newt squeezes in from behind
gorman is doing his video wizard bit dancing on the buttons
to team were not making that out too well
what is it
voice over static you tell me
i only work here
the group stands before a bizarre tableau
among the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits something new and not of human design had been added
it is a structure of some sort extending from and crudely imitating the complex of plumbing but made of some strange encrusted substance
it vaguely resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much larger scale and it attenuates so gradually into the original hardware that it is hard to see where one
ends and the other begins
the alien structure seems to extend far back into the complex of machinery
the plant thrums loudly its functioning seemingly not impaired
ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination
what is it
i dont know
to team proceed inside
they enter the organic labyrinth playing their lights over the walls
revealing a bio mechanical lattice like the marrow of some vast bone
the air is thick with steam
the place seems almost alive
they watch in various helmet camera p
s of the wall detail
low oh god
close on video as it pan slowly
revealing a bas relief of detritus from the colony furniture wiring human bones skulls
fused together with a translucent epoxylike substance
voice over static looks like some sort of secreted resin
they ripped apart the colony for building materials
and the colonists
when they were done with them
turning newt you better go sit up front
steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper inside
hottern hell in here
but its a dry heat
ripley leans forward suddenly studying the graphic readout of the station ground plan
theyre right under the primary heat exchangers
maybe the organisms like the heat thats why they built
thats not what i mean
gorman if your men have to use their weapons in there theyll rupture the cooling system
realizing shes right
then the fusion containment shuts down
were talking thermonuclear explosion
into mike apone collect magazines from everybody
we cant have any firing in there
the troopers look at each other in dismay
is he fucking crazy
whatre we supposed to use man
voice over static flame units only
i want rifles slung
pull em out
he walks among the troopers collecting the magazines from each ones weapon
vasquez turns hers over reluctantly
the three who are carrying them get out small incinerator units
when apone moves on vasquez slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts it in her weapon
drake does the same
hicks hangs back in the shadows
he opens a cylindrical sheath attached to his battle harness
slides out an old style pump twelve gauge with a sawed off butt stock
chambers a round
low to hudson i always keep this handy
for close encounter
hicks back us up
the air is thick
voice over very faint any movement
hudson watches his tracker scanning
apone stops his expression changing
they face a wall of living horror
the colonists have been brought here and entombed alive
cocoons protrude from the niches and interstices of the structure
the cocoon material is the same translucent epoxy
the bodies are frozen in carelessly twisted positions
macabre image of frozen agony
many are disiccated
rip cages burst outward as if exploded from within
paralyzed brought here entombed in living death as hosts for the embryos growing within then
dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures perhaps the most recent
a woman ghost white and drained
the womans eyes snap open
they seem to plead
the womans lips move feebly
ripley watches the woman white knuckled
the sound of retching comes over the general frequency
the woman begins to convulse
she screams a sawing shriek of mindless agony
frost hands it to him
suddenly the womans chest explodes in a gout of blood
a small fanged head apone pulls the trigger
then the other troopers carrying flame throwers open fire
an orgy of purging fire
the cocoons vanish in the shimmering heat
a shrill screeching begins like a siren made from fingernails on blackboards
angle on wall as something begins to emerge
dimly glimpsed a glistening bio mechanoid creature larger then a man
lying dormant it had blended perfectly with the convoluted surface of fused bone
the troopers dont see it
smoke from the burning cocoons quickly fills the confined space
visibility drops to zero
cant lock up
with an edge talk to me hudson
uh seems to be in front and behind
gorman is plating with the gain controls on the monitors
we cant see anything back here apone
whats going on
ripley senses it coming like a wave at night
dark terrifying and inevitable
low pull you team out gorman
as they come alive
bonelike tubelike shapes shift becoming emerging aliens
glints of slime
go to infrared
looks sharp people
the squad members snap down their image intersifier visors
dietrich turns to retreat her flamethrower held tightly
a nightmarish silhouette materializes out of the smoke behind her
it strikes like lightning
she fires reflexively wild
the jet of flame engulfs frost nearby
apone spins as the double scream
cant see anything in the think smoke
ripley watches frosts monitor go black
his bio readouts flatten
the other screens show glimpses of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens the images bobbing and panning confusedly
vasquez nods to drake with grim satisfaction
they open up simultaneously lighting up the smoke like welders arcs
voice over static whos firing
i ordered a hold fire dammit
vasquez rips off her headset
she is riveted to the targetting screen moving ferret quick in a pivoting dance
thunder and lightning
better than sex for her
an alien screech from the darkness
the battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens
ripley flinches as another scream comes over the open frequency
wierzbowskis monitor breaks up
his life signs plummet
voices blend and overlap
voice over lets get the fuck out of here
voice over not that tunnel the other one
voice over you sure
fucking move will you
gorman is ashen
gulping for air like a grouper
how could the situation have unravelled so fast
to gorman shut up
just shut up
crowes telemetry cuts off like the plug was pulled
apone i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc over
voice over heavy static say again
all after incinerators
ripley watches it fall apart
apone adjusts his headset
voice over static lay down garbled
by squads to
garbled gormans voice breaks up completely
apone whirls uncertain
almost blows hudsons head off
freaked were getting juked
were gonna die in here
apone hands him a magazine
hudson slaps it home looking truly terrified
fuck the heat exchanger
vasquez nearby is laying down a horrendous field of fire
strobe bright flashes sear the darkness
she pivots firing mechanically in controlled bursts
scoring points in her own private video game
she spins as hicks approached laterally
she fires at him
to see a nightmarish figure right behind him catapulted backwards by vasquez blast
apones monitor spins crazily and goes dark
distantly i told them to fall back
viciously theyre but off
but hes gone
total brain lock
tight on ripley as she struggles with a decision
of what she knows shes about to do
but more than that shes furious
shouldering past a paralyzed gorman she runs up the aisle of the in passing newt put your seatbelt on
ripley jumps into the drivers seat of the apc
takes a deep breath
starts slapping switches
ripley what the hell
she slams the tractor into gear
as the drive wheels spin on the wet ground
the massive machine leaps forward
ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway
she slams the left and right drive wheel actuators viciously spinning the machine in a roaring pivot
gorman lunges forward along the aisle abandoning his command center
shrill what are you doing
thats an order
he claws at her hysterical
burke pulls him off
the apc roars down into the smoky structure tearing away outcroppings of alien encrustation
ripley hits the floodlights
she homes on the flash of weapons fire ahead
the apc crashes inside showering debris
hicks supporting a limping hudson appears out of the smoke
the apc pulls up broadside and burke gets the crew door open
drake and vasquez back out of the dense mist firing as they fall back
drake goes empty slams the buckles cutting loose his smart gun harness and unslings a flame thrower
hicks pushes hudson inside leaps in after him and drags vasquez inside massive gear and all
she sees a dark shape lunge toward drake
she fires one burst prone
clean body hit
the flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin blowing open the things thorax
a spray of bright yellow acid slashes across drakes face and chest eating into him like a hot knife through butter
he drops in boiling smoke reflexively triggering his flame thrower
the jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls engulfing the back half of the apc
vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots through the crew door setting the interior on fire
hicks is rolling the door closed when vasquez lunges clawing out the opening
he stops her dragging her inside
hicks screams right in her face
forget it hes gone
no hes not
hes burke and hudson help him drag her from the door
to ripley lets go
ripley jams reverse
nails the throttle
the apc bellows backward up the ramp
hudson disappears under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks free
hicks gets the door almost closed
suddenly claws appear at the edge
against the combined efforts of hicks burke and vasquez the door is being slowly wrenched open from outside
hicks yells at a paralyzed gorman
get on the goddamn door
gorman backs away eyes wide
hicks jams his shoulder against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise his gauge
an alien head wedges through the opening its hideous mouth opening
and hicks jams his shotgun muzzle between its jaws and pulls the trigger
the creature is flung backward its shattered head fountaining acid blood
the spray eats into the door the deck hits hudson on the arm
they slide the door home and dog it tight
the armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp
slams into a mass of conduit
ripley works the shifters pivoting the massive machine
everybodys shouting trying to put out the fire
something lands on the roof with a metallic clang
gorman has plastered himself against a wall as far from the door as possible
a latch lever behind his head turns
the small hatch against which he was leaning is ripped away and something snatches him out the opening he disappears to the waist with a shriek legs kicking
the alien clings to the roof pulling him out
its tail whips over scorpionlike and buries a four inch stinger in gormans shoulder
hicks grabs a joy stick at the fire control console and turns it rapidly
on the roof the alien looks up as servo motors whir
a remote control turret cannon a mm chain gun swivels toward it in a curt arc
the creature is blasted off the vehicles armored back and tumbles away
gorman slumped unconscious is dragged back inside
the apc rips away a section of catwalk and heads for clear air its flank trailing fire like a comet
ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews broadsiding a control room out building
office furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in the apcs wake
suddenly an alien arm arcs down right in front of ripleys face
it smashes the windshield
glistening hideous jaws lunge inside
face to face once again with the same mind numbing horror
she reacts instinctively
slams both sets of brakes with all her strength
the huge wheels lock
the creature flips off landing in the headlights
ripley hits full throttle
the apc roars forward smashing over the abomination
its skeletal body is crushed under the massive wheels
it rolls tumbling
lost in the darkness behind as the machine thunders onto the causeway and away from the station
a sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming from the apcs rear end
hicks eases ripleys hand back on the throttle lever
her grip is white knuckled
the grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she slows the machine
sounds like a blown transaxle
youre just grinding metal
the tractor limps to a halt
a half kilometer from the atmosphere processing station
the apc is a smoking acid scarred mess
ripley still running on the adrenalin dynamo spins out of her seat into the aisle
feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down
newt is wedged into a tiny space between the drivers seat and a bulkhead
she is trembling and looks terrified but its not the basket case catatonia of before
newt gives her a thumbs up wan but stoic
ripley goes back to the others
hudson is holding his arm and staring in stunned dismay at nothing playing it all back in his mind
i dont believe it
burke tries to have a look at hudsons arm
jerking away im all right leave it
ripley joins hicks who is bent over gorman checking for a pulse
i think hes paralyzed
hes fucking dead
she grabs gorman by the collar hauling him up roughly ready to pulp him with her other fist
to gorman wake up pendejo
im gonna kill you you useless fuck
hicks pushes her back
right in her face
back off right now
vasquez releases gorman
his head smacks the deck
ripley opens gormans tunic revealing a bloodless purple puncture wound
looks like it stung him
look crowe and dietrich arent dead man
they turn to see hudson at the mtob monitors pointing at the bio function screens
they must be like gorman
their signs are real low but they aint dead
hudson is pale panicky and his voice echoes around the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them as the near hysteria they all feel fluttering just at
the edges of their minds
you cant help them
right now theyre being cocooned just like the others
sagging oh god
this aint happening
ripley and vasquez lock eyes
ripley doesnt want it to be i told you so but vasquez reads it that way
she turns away with a snap
bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a dissection of one of the dead parasites
spunkmeyer enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck and parks it near bishops work table
need anything else
bishop waves no without looking up
spunkmeyer emerges crossing the tarmac to the loading ramp of the ship
as he nears the top of the ramp his boot slips
skidding on something wet
kneeling he touches a small puddle of thick slime
he shrugs and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close the doors
on vasquez wired and intense
all right we cant blow the fuck out of them
why not roll some canisters of cn down there
nerve gas the whole nest
look man lets just bug out and call it even okay
to vasquez no good
how do we know itll effect their biochemistry
i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit
its the only way to be sure
now hold on a second
im not authorizing that action
burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals flawlessly into conciliatory mode
well i mean
i know this is an emotional moment but lets not make snap judgments
lets move cautiously
first this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it they can bill me
i got a tab running
this is clearly an important species were dealing with here
we cant just arbitrarily exterminate them bullshit
maybe you havent been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked pal
ripley faces burke squarely and shes not pleased
we had an agreement
burke moves in lowering his voice
he takes her aside from the others
i know i know but were dealing with changing scenarios here
this thing is major ripley
i mean really major
you gotta go with its energy
since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious serious money
ripley stares at his like hes a particularly disagreeable fungus
you son of a bitch
hardening dont make me pull rank ripley
i believe corporal hicks has authority here
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command
looks that way
burke starts to lose it and its not a pretty sight
look this is a multimillion dollar operation
he cant make that kind of decision
hes just a grunt
glances at hicks no offense
coolly none taken
into mike ferro you copying
voice over static standing by
prep for dust off
were gonna need an immediate evac
to burke i think well take off and nuke the site from orbit
its the only way to be sure
burke looks like a kid whose toy has been snatched
this is absurd
you dont have the authority to clack
the sound of a rifle bolt snapping home truncates his rant
vasquez has a pulse rifle cradled not exactly aimed at burke but not exactly aimed away either
her expression is masklike
end of discussion
ripley sits behind newt putting her arm around her
were going home honey
the ship rises through the spray thrown up by the downblast of the vtol jets hovering above the complex like a huge insect its searchlights blazing
the group is filing out of the personnel carrier which is clearly a write off
hicks and hudson have gorman between them and the others emerge into the wind
they watch the ship roar in on its final approach
ferro flicks the intercom switch several times
thumps her headset mike
the compartment door behind her slides slowly back
turning where the fu her eyes widen
its not spunkmeyer
am impression of leering jaws which blur forward then a whirl of motion and a truncated scream
the throttle levers are slammed forward in the melee
they watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and veers wildly
its main engines roar full on and the craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude
it skims the ground
clips a rock formation
the ship slews sideslipping
it hits a ridge
tumbles bursting into flame breaking up
it arcs into the air end over end a catherine wheel juggernaut
she grabs newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling section of the ships massive engine module slams into the apc and it explodes into twisted wreckage
the drop ship skips again like a stone engulfed in flames
and crashes into the station
a tremendous the remainder of the ground team watches their hopes of getting off the planet and most of their superior fire power reduced to flaming debris
there is a moment of stunned silence then
hysterical well thats great
thats just fucking great man
now what the fuck are we supposed to do man
were in some real pretty shit now
are you finished
to ripley you okay
she cant disguise her stricken expression when she looks at newt but the little girl seems relatively calm
she shrugs with fatalistic acceptance
i guess were not leaving right
im sorry newt
you dont have to be sorry
it wasnt your fault
kicking rocks just tell me what the fuck were supposed to do now
whatre we gonna do now
annoyed may be could build a fire and sing songs
we should get back cause itll be dark soon
they come mostly at night
ripley follows newts look to the ap station looming in the twilight the burning drop ship wreckage jammed into its basal structure
the wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings dry and cold
the weary and demoralized group is gathered to take stock of their grim options
vasquez and hudson are just setting down a scorched and dented packing case one of several culled from the apc wreckage
hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons lying on a table
this is all we could salvage
weve got four pulse rifles with about fifty rounds each
not so good
about fifteen m grenades and two flame throwers less than half full
and weve got four of these robot sentry units with scanners and display intact
he opens one of the scorched cases revealing a high tech servo actuated machine gun with optical sensing equipment packed in foam
how long after were declared overdue can we expect a rescue
about seventeen days
man were not going to make it seventeen hours
those things are going to come in here just like they did before man
theyre going to come in here and get us man long before
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training
ripley indicates newt who salutes hudson smartly
so you better just start dealing with it
just deal with it hudson
because we need you and im tired of your bullshit
now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file
construction blueprints maintenance schematics anything that shows the layout of this place
i want to see air ducts electrical access tunnels subbasements
every possible way into this wing
hudson gathers himself thankful for the direction
hicks nods approval of her handling of it
im on it
ill be in medical
id like to continue my analysis
you do that
burke ripley hudson and hicks are bent over a large horizontal videoscreen like an illuminated chart table
newt hops from one foot to the other to see
this service tunnel is how theyre moving back and forth
yeah right it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here
he traces a finger along the abstract ground plan
theres a fire door at this end
the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex
so we put up welded barricades at these intersections
pointing and seal these ducts here and here
then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units here
hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand satisfied
then all we needs a deck of cards
all right lets move like we got a purpose
imitating hudson aye firmative
a long straight service tunnel lined with conduit seems to go on forever
vasquez and hudson have finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on tripods in the tunnel
she hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel into the automatic field of fire
the sentry guns swivel smoothly the wastebasket bounces once
and is riddled by two quick bursts of exploding mm rounds into dime sized shrapnel
they retreat behind a heavy steel fire door which they roll closed on its track
vasquez using a portable welding torch begins sealing the door to its frame as hudson paces nervously
a and b sentries are in place and keyed
were sealing the tunnel
hicks pauses in his work
into mike roger
he and ripley are covering an air duct opening with a metal plate welding it in place showering sparks in the dark corridor
behind them burke and newt are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a hand truck stacking it inside the operations center
hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object out of a belt pouch
a braceletlike emergency here put this on
then i can locate you anywhere in the complex on this he indicates a tiny tracker hooked to his battle harness
he shrugs a little self consciously
ripley pauses for a moment regarding him quizzically
strapping it on thanks
uh whats next
she consults a printout of the floor plan
the wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud the complex
visibility is low in the fog
everything looks underwater
there is no movement
in the barricaded corridor sentry gun c sits waiting its armed light flashing green
through a hole torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor the fog swirls in
an expectant hush
ripley carries an exhausted newt through the inner connecting rooms of the medical wing
she reaches an operating room which is small but very high tech vaultlike metal walls strange equipment
several metal cots have been set up displacing o
equipment which is pushed into one corner
newt is resting her head on ripleys shoulder barely awake
out of steam
ripley sets her on one of the cots and newt lies down
now you just lie here and have a nap
i dont want to
i have scary dreams
this obviously strikes a chord with ripley but she feigns cheerfulness
ill bet casey doesnt have bad dreams
ripley lifts the dolls head from newts tiny fingers and looks inside
it is of course empty
nothing bad in here
maybe you could just try to be like her
ripley closes the dolls eyes and hands her back
newt rolls her eyes as if to say dont pull that five year old shit on me lady
she doesnt have bad dreams because shes just a piece of plastic
my mommy always said there were no monsters
no real ones
but there are
ripleys expression becomes sober
she brushes damp hair back from the childs pale forehead
quietly yes there are arent there
why do they tell little kids that
newts voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal
shes seen that the world can be just as terrifying as her most primal childs nightmare if not more so and thats a lot worse than finding out there is
well some kids cant handle it like you can
did one of those things grow inside her
ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in around her tiny body
i dont know newt
thats the truth
isnt that how babies come
i mean people babies
they grow inside you
no its different honey
did you ever have a baby
a little girl
where is she
you mean dead
its more statement than question
ripley nods slowly
she turns reaching for a portable space heater sitting nearby and slides it closer to the bed
she switches it on
it hums and emits a cozy orange glow
ripley i was just thinking
maybe i could do you a favor and fill in for her
just for a while
you can try it and if you dont like it its okay
no big deal
ripley gazes at her a long time before answering
a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them may see another dawn
i think its not the worst idea ive heard all day
lets talk about it later
she switches off the light and starts to rise
newt grabs her arm
a plaintive voice in the dark
ill be right in the other room newt
i can see you on that camera right up there
newt looks at the video security camera above the door
ripley unsnaps the tracker bracelet given to her by hicks and puts it on newts tiny wrist cinching it down
take is for luck
now go to sleep
and dont dream
ripley walks away and newt rolls on her side hugging casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function light on the bracelet
the space heater hums comfortingly
ecu gorman his eyelids slitted open like those of a corpse but with the eyes tracking erratically
the only sign of life
voice over how is he
ripley stands over the lieutenant who is lying motionless on an examining table
bishop looks up from his instruments nearby the light of a single gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast
ive isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis
it seems to be metabolizing
he should wake up soon
now let me get this straight
the aliens paralyzed the colonists carried them over there cocooned them to be hosts for more of those
ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the face hugger specimens
which would mean lots of those parasites right
one for each person
over a hundred at least
but these things come from eggs
so where are all the eggs coming from
that is the question of the hour
we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization
an ant of termite colony for example is ruled by a single female a queen which is the source of new eggs
youre saying one of those things lays all the eggs
well the queen is always physically larger then the others
a termite queens abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cant move at all
it is fed and tended by drone workers defended by the warriors
she is the center of their lives quite literally the mother of their society
could it be intelligent
hard to say
it may have been blind instinct
attraction to the heat of whatever
but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldnt destroy her without destroying ourselves
thats if she exists of course
ripley ponders the ramifications of bishops analysis
rising i want those specimens destroyed as soon as youre done with them
bishop glances at the creatures pulsing malevolently in their cylinders
burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs
he was very specific
ripley feels the fabric of her self restraint tearing
she slaps the intercom switch
in a small observation chamber separated from the med lab by a glass partition ripley and burke have squared off
those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division
now if youre smart we can both come out of this heroes
set up for life
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine
section of the commerce code
youve been doing your homework
look they cant impound it if they dont know about it
but they will know about it burke
just like theyll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here now wait a second stepping on him you sent them to
i just checked the colony log
directive dates six twelve seventy nine
signed burke carter j
ripleys fury is peaking now that the frustration and rage finally have a target to focus on
you sent them out there and you didnt even warn them burke
why didnt you warn them
look maybe the thing didnt even exist right
and if id made it a major security situation the administration wouldve stepped in
then no exclusive rights nothing
he shrugs his manner blase dismissive
it was a bad call thats all
she slams him against the wall surprising herself and him her hands gripping his collar
these people are fucking dead burke
well theyre going to nail your hide to the shed
and ill be there when they do
she steps back shaking and looks at him with utter loathing as if the depths of human greed are a far more horrific revelation than any alien
sadly i expected more of you ripley
i thought you would be smarter than this
sorry to disappoint you
she turns away and strides out
the door closes
burke stares after her his mind a whirl of options
ripley is walking toward operations when a strident alarm begins to sound
she breaks into a run
ripley double times it to hicks tactical console where hudson and vasquez have already gathered
hicks slaps a switch killing the alarm
theyre in the tunnel
the trilling of the motion sensor remains speeding up
two red lights on the tactical display light up simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which vibrates the floor
guns a and b
tracking and firing on multiple targets
the rss guns pound away echoing through the complex
their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm
a counter on the display counts down the number of rounds fired
they must be wall to wall in there
look at those ammo counters go
its a shooting gallery down there
blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels
their barrels are overheating glowing cherry red
one clicks empty and sits smoking still swiveling to track targets it cant fire upon
the digital counter on b gun reads zero
b guns dry
twenty on a
then a gonglike booming echoes eerily up from sublevel
theyre at the fire door
the booming increases in volume and ferocity
man listen to that
mixed with the echoing crash clang is a nerve wrecking screech of claws on steel
the intercom buzzes startling them
voice over bishop here
im afraid i have some bad news
well thats a switch
everyone including bishop is crowded at the window intently watching the ap station which is a dim silhouette in the mist
suddenly a column of flame like an acetylene torch jets upward from the complex at the base of the cone
how long until it blows
im projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours
the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers
about equal to ten megatons
we got problems
i dont fucking believe this
do you believe this
and its too late to shut it down
im afraid so
the crash did too much damage
the overload is inevitable at this point
and i was gettin short too
four more weeks and out
now im gonna buy it on this fuckin rock
it aint half fair man
hudson give us a break
they watch as another gas jet lights up the fog shrouded landscape
to hicks we need the other drop ship
the on one the sulaco
we have to bring it down on remote somehow
the transmitter was on the apc
pacing i dont care how
think of a way
think of something
think of what
what about the colony transmitter
that up link tower down at the other end
why cant we use that
the hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting
ripley is wound up like a dynamo her mind spinning out options grim solutions
well then somebodys just going to have to go out there
take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually
with those things running around
quietly ill go
im really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway
believe me id prefer not to
i may be synthetic but im not stupid
lets get on it
whatll you need
an instant later comes the high pitched trilling of a motion sensor alarm
hicks looks at the tactical board
well theyre into the complex
one of the acid holes from the colonists siege has yielded access to subfloor conduits
bishop lying in the opening reaches up to graph the portable terminal as ripley hands it down to him
he pushes it into the constricted shaft ahead of him
she then hands him a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch cables a service pistol and a small cutting torch
this duct runs almost to the up link assembly
one hundred eighty meters
say forty minutes to crawl down there
one hour to patch in and align the antenna
thirty minutes to prep the ship then about fifty minutes flight time
ripley looks at her watch
its going to be closer
you better get going
cheerfully see you soon
she squirms into the shaft pushing the equipment along ahead of him with a scraping rhythm
the diameter of the conduit is barely larger than the width of his shoulders
vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole and begins spot welding it in place
bishop looks back as the welder seals him in
he sighs fatalistically and squirms forward
ahead of him the conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity
like being in the bore of a very long howitzer
ripley jumps as an alarm suddenly blares through the complex
voice over theyre in the approach corridor
into mike on my way
ripley jumps up unslinging a flamethrower from her shoulder in one motion and sprints for operations with vasquez
the sound of sentry guns opening up in staccato bursts echoes from close by
ripley runs to the tactical console where hicks is mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras
the flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive video but impressions of figures moving in the smoky corridor are occasionally visible
the robot sentries hammer away driving streamers of tracer fire into the swirling mist
twenty meters and closing
c and d guns down about fifty percent
the digital readout whirl through descending numbers
an inhuman shrill screeching is audible between bursts of fire
d guns down to twenty
then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly
the video image is a swirling wall of smoke
small fires burn dim glows in the mist
there are black and twisted shapes and pieces of twisted shapes scattered at the edge of visibility
however nothing emerges from the wall of smoke
the motion sensor tone shuts off
the guns stopped them
the moment stretches
everyone exhales slowly
the digital counters for the two sentry guns read and respectively
less than a seconds worth of firing
newt time then can walk right up and knock
but they dont know that
theyre probably looking for other ways to get in
thatll take them awhile
maybe we got em demoralized
to vasquez and hudson i want you two walking the perimeter
i know were all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert
weve got to stop any entries before they get out of hand
the two troopers nod and head for the corridor
ripley sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee draining it in one gulp
how long since you slept
twenty four hours
she seems soul weary drained by the nerve wracking tension
when she answers her voice seems distant detached
grimly theyll get us
hicks im not going to wind up like those others
youll take care of it wont you it if comes to that
if it comes to that ill do us both
lets see that it doesnt here id like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine
he picks up his pulse rifle and with the casually precise movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt drops out the magazine and hands it to her
m a mm pulse rifle over and under with a mm pump action grenade launcher
ripley hefts the weapon
it is heavy and awkward
but there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal cold steel lines to at least the sense that she will be in some greater measure the master of
her own fate
she raises it clumsily
what do i do
bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing infinities
the pipe rings with his scraping advance
he approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny shaft of light
he puts his eyes up to the acid etched opening
as drooling jaws flash toward us slamming against the steel with a vicious scraping snap
bishop flattens himself away from the opening and inches along looking pale and strained
he glances at his watch
ripley has the stock of the m a snugged up to her cheek and is awkwardly trying to keep up with hicks instructions
the corporal is standing close behind her positioning her arms
its intimate but thats the last thing on their minds
just pull it in real right
it will kick some
when the counter here heads zero hit this
he thumbs a button and the magazine drops out clattering on the floor
just let it drop right out
get the other one in quick
just slap it in hard it likes abuse
now pull the bolt
youre ready again
ripley repeats the action not very smoothly
her hands are trembling
she indicates a stout tube underneath the slender pulse rifle barrel
well thats the grenade launcher you probably dont want to mess with that
look you started this
now show me everything
i can handle myself
dollying with ripley walking down the corridor now carrying the newfound friend the m a
gorman steps out of the door to the med lab looking weak but sound
burke is right behind him
how do you feel
all right i guess
one hell of a hangover
she shoulders by him into the med lab
gorman turns to see vasquez staring at him with cold slitted eyes
you still want to kill me
turning away it wont be necessary
ripley crosses the deserted lab passing through the annex to the small o
where she left newt
entering the darkened chamber ripley looks around
newt is nowhere to be seen
on a hunch she kneels down and peers under the bed
newt is curled up there jammed as far back as she can get fast asleep
still clutching casey
ripley stares at newts tiny face so angelic despite the demons that have chased her through her dreams and the reality between dreams
ripley lays the rifle on top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath
without waking the little girl she slips her arms around her
ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling together in the darkness under their bed
newts face contorts with the externalization of some tormented dreamscape
she cries out a vague inarticulate plea
ripley rocks her gently
its all right
up link tower view of ap station a view of the processing station from the colony landing platform
a rising wind is clearing out the low fog and the silhouette of the station grows sharper
several systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in the darkness
high voltage discharges arc around the upper latticework lighting the blighted landscape with irregular glaring flashes
pan onto bishop f
hunched against the wind at the base of the telemetry tower
he has a test bay panel open and the portable terminal patched in
his jacket is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect it from the elements and he is typing frenetically
to himself now if i did it right
he punches a key marked enable
the drop bay is empty and silent with the remaining ship brooding in the shadows
a klaxon sounds and rotating clearance lights come on
hydraulics whine to life
drop ship two moves out on its overhead track and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch prep
service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically around the hull
a recorded announcement echoes across the huge chamber
automatic fueling operations have begun
please extinguish all smoking materials
as she awakens with a start
she checks her watch
an hour has passed
she gently disengages herself from newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot when she sees something and freezes
across the room just inside the door to the med lab are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects
two stasis cylinders
their tops are hinged open and the suspension fields are switched off
they are both empty
ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror rise through her in that silent frozen moment
the inescapable certainty of a lethal presence
unable to move or breathe she looks around frantically assessing the situation
newt wake up
were in trouble
newt nods now wide awake
they listen in the darkness for the slightest betrayal of movement
the scrabble of multiple legs across the polished floor for example
there is only the droning hum of the little space heater
ripley reaches up and clutching the springs of the underside of the cot begins to inch it away from the wall
the squeal of metal as the legs scrape across the floor is jarringly loud in the stillness
when the space is wide enough she cautiously slides herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of
here yes clear the edge of the bed
the rifle is gone
she snaps her head around
a scuttling shape leaps toward her from the foot of the bed
she ducks with a startled cry
the obscene thing hits the wall above her legs moving lightning fast
reflexively she slams the bed against the wall pinning the creature inches above her face
its legs and tail writhe with incredible ferocity and it emits a demented piercing ripley heaves newt across the polished floor and in a frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the
she flips it over trapping the creature underneath
they back away gasping
ripleys eyes flash around the shadowed room where every corner of space between equipment holds lethal promise
the creature scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a back of cabinets in a blur
ripley hugs newt close and heads toward the door moving as if every object in the room had a million volts running through it
she reaches the door
hits the wall switch
disabled from outside
she tries the lights
she pounds on the door
the acoustically dampened door panel thunks dully
she moves to the observation window glancing frantically over her shoulder
the bare floor behind her is like a screaming threat
she pounds on the window
through the double thickness window we can see that the lab is dark and empty
ripley whirls hearing a loathsome scrabbling behind her
newt starts to whimper feeding off her fear
she steps in front of the video surveillance camera and waves her arms in a circle
showing ripley waving her arms
there is no sound a surreal pantomime
a hand enters frame and switches off the monitor
ripleys image vanishes
wider angle as burke straightens casually from the console
hicks is talking via headset with bishop and hasnt noticed ripleys plight or burkes action
into mike roger
check back when youve activated the ship
turning hes at the up link tower
ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against the observation window
it bounces back from the high impact material
she tries again
reverse angle from the med lab side showing her futile efforts the chair hitting with a dull thwack barely audible through the double thickness pressure port
ripley turns studying the room
she fumbles through a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and finds a small examination light
snapping it on she plays the beam over the walls
tall assemblies of surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the dark
she hears ot thinks she hears movements
the light spins across the room swiveling and bobbing frantically
like an indicator of her growing panic
newt starts a thin high wailing
ripley steadies herself realizing newts terror and the childs dependence on her
she plays the beam across the ceiling
holds on something
gets an idea
she removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks up some papers from the counter
moving cautiously she boosts newt up onto the surgical table in the center of the room and clambers up after her
i mean ripley
i know honey
ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass under the temperature sensor of a fire control system sprinkler head
it triggers spraying the room from several sources with water
an alarm sounds throughout the complex
hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm finally identifying its source among the lights flashing on his board
he bolts for the door yelling into his headset as he moves
vasquez hudson meet me in medical
we got a fire
ripley and newt are drenched as the sprinklers continue to drizzle in the darkness
the siren hoots maniacally masking all other sound
ripley scans the room with her light her hair plastered to her face wiping water out of her eyes
she is eye level with a complex surgical multilight
she looks into its tangle of arms and cables inches away
her eyes snap back
something leaps at her face
she screams and topples off the table splashing to the floor
newt shrieks and scrambles away as ripley hurls the chittering creature off of her
it slams against a wall of cabinets clings for a moment then leaps back as if driven by a steel spring
ripley scrambles desperately pulling equipment over on top of herself clawing across the floor in a frenzy of motion
in a blurr of multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body
she tears at it but it is incredibly powerful for its size
it moves like lightning toward her head avoiding her fumbling hands
newt screams abjectly backing away until she is pressed up against a desk in one corner
ripley has both hands up forcing the pulsing body back from her face
the things tail whips around her throat and begins to tighten forcing the underside of its body close to her
ripley thrashes about knocking over equipment sending instruments clattering
water streams over her into her eyes blinding her and making it impossible to get a grip on the creatures body
angle on newt as crablike legs appear from behind the desk right behind her
she sees it and thinking fast jams the desk against the wall pinning the writhing thing
the desk jumps and shudders against all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it
she wails between gritted teeth as the second creature gets one leg free then another and another
squeezing itself inexorably onto the desk top
the legs of the chittering thing claw at ripleys head getting a surer grip even as she whips her head from side to side
the obscene tubule extrudes wetly from the sheath on the creatures underside forcing itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over her face
a figure appears at the observation window a silhouette behind the misted over glass
a hand wipes a clear spot
hicks eyes appear
he steps back
a burst of pulse rifle fire shatters the tempered glass
hicks dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes into the room in a shower of fragments
he hits rolling his armor grinding through the shards and slides across to ripley
he gets his fingers around the thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls
between the two of them they force is away from her face though ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens sickeningly around her throat
hudson leaps into the room flings newt away from the desk to go skidding across the wet floor and blasts the second creature against the wall
acid and smoke
gorman appears at ripleys side and grabs the tail unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor coil from her throat
all of them grip the struggling shrieking creature
hicks hurls the thing into the corner
it scrabbles upright in an instant and leaps back toward them
hudson gets it clean
ripley collapses gagging
the alarm and sprinklers shut off automatically
hicks sees the stasis cylinders
it was burke
looking decidedly stressed out
he grips his rifle tightly aimed right at camera
intense i say we grease this rat fuck son of a bitch right now
the group is gathered around burke who sits in a chair maintaining an icy calm although beads of sweat betray intense concealed tension
only a few minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on adrenaline as if the whole group is charged with high voltage
pacing i dont get it
it doesnt make any goddamn sense
ripley stands in front of burke every fiber of her being accusing him with absolute outrage
burke tries to break ripleys stare which is like a diamond drill
he wanted an alien only he couldnt get it back through quarantine
but if we were impregnated whatever you call it
and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time
then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying
we and newt
ripley glances at the little girl a frail figure sitting nearby hugging her knees and watching the proceedings with somber eyes
she is all but lost in an adult jacket someone has found for her and her still damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks
wait a minute
wed know about it
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back
then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked
to burke youre dogmeat pal
this is total paranoid delusion
wearily you know burke i dont know which species is worse
you dont see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage
serious lets waste him
to burke no offense
ripley shakes her head the rage giving way to a sickened emptiness
just find someplace to lock him up until its time to the lights go out
everyone stops in the sudden darkness realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the struggle
hicks looks at the board
everything is out
they cut the power
what do you mean they cut the power
how could they cut the power man
ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety
to the others lets get some trackers going
come on get moving
gorman watch burke
hudson and vasquez pick up their scanners and move to the door
vasquez has to slide it open manually on its track
the two troopers separate and move rapidly to the barriers at opposite ends of the control block
dollying with vasquez as she moves forward with feral steps in the darkness
on hudson scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier
voice over anything
hudsons tracker lights up a faint signal
he pans it around
back down the corridor
it beep again louder
its inside the complex
voice over youre just reading me
it aint you
inside the perimeter
theyre in here
hudson stay cool
angle on vasquez swinging her tracker and rifle together
she aims it behind her
cool hudson may be right
ripley and hicks share a look
here we go
low its game time
get back here both of you
fall back to operations
hudson backtracks nervously peering all around
he looks stretched to the limit
this signals weird
must be some interference or something
theres movement all over the place
voice over just get back here
hudson reaches the door to operations at a run a moment before vasquez
they pull the door shut and lock it
hudson joins ripley and hicks who are laying out their armament
m a magazines
hudsons tracker beeps
the tone continues through the scene its rhythm increasing
he pans the scanner
the range display reads out counting down
range twenty meters
to vasquez seal the door
vasquez picks up a hand welder and moves to comply
lets get these things lit
he hands one flamethrower to ripley and begins priming the other himself
it lights with a muffled pop
ripleys lights a moment later
sparks shower around vasquez as she begins welding the door
hudsons tracker is beeping like mad now as fast as their hearts
they cut the power and avoided the guns
they must have found another way in something we missed
we didnt miss anything
i dont know an acid hole in a duct
something under the floors not on the plans
i dont know
she picks up vasquez scanner and aims it the same direction as hudsons
man this is a big fucking signal
theyre right on us
vasquez how you doing
vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal as she welds the door shut
working like a demon
thats inside the room
its readin right
ripley fiddles with her tracker adjusting the tuning
well youre not reading it right
what the fu he looks at ripley
it dawns on both of them at the same time
she feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles her tracker upward to the ceiling almost overhead
the tone gets louder
hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of acoustic drop ceiling
he shines his light inside
a soul wrenching nightmare image
moving in the beam of light are aliens
lots of aliens
they are crawling like bats upside down clinging to the pipes and beams of the structural ceiling not touching the flimsy acoustic panels
they glisten hideously as they claw their way forward in silence
they cover the ceiling of the operations room
the inner sanctum is utterly violated
blasted by fear
he snaps the light around
its a meter behind him
he drops reflexively the claws raking across his armor
hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach en masse from the handholds
the ceiling explodes raining debris
nightmare shapes drop into the room
hudson opens fire
vasquez grabs hicks pulls him up firing one handed with her flamethrower
ripley scoops up newt and staggers back
gorman turns to fire and burke bolts for the only remaining exit the corridor connecting to the med lab
in the strobelike glare of the pulse rifles we see flashes of aliens moving forward in the smoke from the flamethrower fires
they move like nothing human
leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with powerful balletic grace
get to medical
she dashes for the corridor
dollying behind her as she sprints the walls becoming a frenzied blur
ahead of her burke clears the door to the med lab
he slides it closed
ripley slams into the door
tries the latch
hears it lock from the far side
open the door
behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a locomotive a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and inhuman as you can imagine
strobe flashes backlight the demented silhouette
shaking ripley raises her rifle
she squeezes the trigger
the creature hisses baring its teeth as it advances
ripley checks the safety
the safety is off
the digital counter
the magazine is full
newt begins to wail
ripleys hands slick with sweat are trembling so much she almost drops the rifle
panic screams in her brain
the thing is almost on her filling the corridor when she remembers
she snaps the bolt back chambering a round
whips the stock to her shoulder
a flashbulb glimpse of shrieking jaws as the silhouette is hurled back screeching insanely
ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion
hicks looks up
fires point blank at a leaping silhouette
the fire control system has tripped with sprinklers spraying the room and a mindless siren wailing
hysterical lets go
hudson screams as floor panels lift under him and clawed arms seize him lightning fast dragging him down
another skeletal shape leaps on him from above
he disappears into the subfloor crawlway
hicks vasquez and gorman make it to the med lab access corridor
stunned ripley sees through dissipating smoke the creature rising to advance again
flinching against blast and glare she drills it point blank with a blinding burst that carries the m as muzzle right up toward the ceiling
newt covers her ears against the concussion
hold you fire
the troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke
indicating door locked
hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the lock
inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor
vasquez hands her flamethrower to gorman and unslings her rifle
she starts loading mm grenades into the launcher like oversize guage shells
you cant use those in here
fire in the hole
she pumps a round up and fires
the grenade explodes and the blast almost knocks them down
hicks kicks the door open molten droplets flying
shouting at vasquez thanks a lot
now i cant hear shit
vasquez slides the door almost closed then fires three grenades rapid fire through the gap
she slams the door home as the grenades detonate the explosion sounding gonglike through the metal
ripley sprints across the room trying the far door
burke has locked it as well
hicks switches his hand torch from cut to weld and starts sealing the door they just passed through
burke hyperventilating with terror backs across the dark chamber
gasping almost paralyzed with fear he crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main concourse
his fingers reach for the latch
it moves by itself
the door opens slowly
on burke his eyes wide transfixed by his fate
we hear the bullwhip crack of a tail stinger striking as we the door dimples with a clanging impact separating slightly from its frame
another crash the squeal of tortured steel
newt grabs ripley by the hand and tugs her across the room
she leads ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and expertly unlatches the grille swinging it open
newt starts inside but ripley pulls her back
stay behind me
ripley trades her rifle for gormans flamethrower before he can protest and enters the air shaft which is a tight fit
newt scrambles in behind followed by hicks gorman and vasquez on rearguard
glancing back fearfully newt pushes on ripleys butt as they crawl rapidly through the shaft
do you know how to get to the landing field from here
ripley turns into a larger main duct where there is enough room to crab walk in a low crouch
she runs scraping her back on the ceiling
the troopers armor clatters in the confined space
they approach an intersection
she fires the flamethrower around the corner the looks
they sprint into the narrow connecting duct the maze becoming a blur
ripley fires the flamethrower periodically as they pass side ducts covered by louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or lower levels
into headset bishop you read me
come in over
there is a long pause then bishops voice almost unintelligible with interference comes over the radio
voice over static yes i read you
not very well
bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry mast out of the wind which is now gusting viciously
yelling over enunciating the ship is on its way
eta about sixteen minutes
ive got my hands full flying
the weathers come up a bit
bishops fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and he squints watching the screen as the flight telemetry updates rapidly
in the b
the ap station has become a raging demon wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges
all right stand by there
were on out way
the beam of ripleys light wavers hypnotically in the tunnel ahead
she blinks seeing something
a glinting obscene form moving toward them filling the tunnel at the absolute limit of the lights power
they try to crawl back jamming together
behind them the way they have come a grating is battered in with a ferocious clang and the deadly silhouette of a warrior flows into the duct
they are trapped
vasquez uses her flamethrower bathing the tunnel in fire
hicks snaps out his hand welder and cuts into the wall of the duct
molten metal spatters him as sparks fill the tunnel with lurid light
vasquez flamethrower sputters
icy losing fuel
between eye searing bursts of flame ripley sees the glistening apparitions closing in
hicks torch feathers out
bracing his back he kicks hard at the cherry hot metal
it bends aside
beyond is a narrow service way lined with pipes and conduit
hicks slides through the searing hole lifting newt safely through as ripley hands her out
ripley follows and turns to help gorman
vasquez flamethrower goes dry
she draws her service pistol
suddenly she looks up as a warrior screeches down from a vertical shaft right above her
she fires with incredible rapidity
it lands on her legs and she snaps her head to one side just as its tail stinger buries into the metal wall beside her cheek
she fires again emptying the pistol kicking the thrashing shape away
acid cuts through her chickenplate armor searing into her thigh
she cries out gritting her teeth against the white hot pain
gorman sees vasquez hit unable to move
sees the creatures coming the other way
and turns away from the escape hole
he crawls back to her grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards safety
the approaching alien warriors have reached and passed the opening
vasquez sees him barely conscious
hoarse whisper you always were an asshole gorman
she seizes his hand in a deadly drip but we recognize it as the power greeting she shared with drake
something for the chosen few
gorman returns the grip
he hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the creatures are upon them
rushing with ripley newt and hicks as a full tilt run
the service way lights up with a powerful blast behind them and they stumble with the shock wave
newt breaks out ahead and its all ripley and hicks can do to keep up
come on were almost there
the kid moves like lightning diving and dodging around obstacles
if it wasnt clear before its clear now that we are on her turf and shes the ace
running on and on their breathing loud and echoing
the walls a directionless blur
newt never hesitates
they reach a junction with a narrow angled chute which runs upward at a steep degrees
ripley looks up the angles shaft seeing light at the top
an exterior vent hood
the sound of wind booms down from above
like blowing across a bottle top vastly amplified
ripley enters bracing her feet on perilously narrow side ribs in the shaft
she looks down
the chute descends far into the depths lost in shadow
she starts to climb with next behind below her and hicks just emerging from the side duct
just up there newt slips a rusted rib collapsing under her foot
catches herself with one hand
ripley reaches for her dropping her light
the hand light goes skittering and bumping down the chute around a bend and disappears
ripley strains reaching her hand groping for newts
they miss inches apart
riiiiipppleee she slips
hicks lunges grabbing her oversized jacket
and she slips out of it
with an echoing scream newt plummets sliding down the chute into darkness
moving with her the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like a bobsled ride
the shaft pitches left
newt bounces sliding halfway up the wall
the chute forks ahead
newt tumbles into the right shaft which drops at a steeper angle into the depths
just disappearing down the left shaft we see ripleys light
ripley looks hicks in the eye
and kicks free
sliding down the chute after newt
ripley slams her feet into the side ribs bracing herself in a controlled descent
ripley reaches the v
sees the glow of the light in the left fork
she goes left
she hears a plaintive reply so echoey and distorted it has no direction
where are you
ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it intersects with a horizontal service tunnel
the light is lying there but no newt
the echoing wail comes again
ripley starts down the tunnel answering
newts call comes again
she cant tell
she spins in a growing panic starts the other way
to her headset hicks get down here
i need that locator
newt is in a low grottolike chamber filled with pipes and machines
it is flooded almost up to newts waist
she looks up seeing light streaming through a grating
ripleys voice seems to come from there
star wherever you are
newt climbs some pipes straining to reach the grating
hicks joins ripley unsnapping the emergency locator from his belt
they follow the signal into a lighted area where the power apparently was not cut
following the signal they come to a grating set in the floor
ripley runs to the grating
looking down she sees newts tearstreaked face
newt reaches up
her tiny fingers wriggle up through the bars of the grate
ripley squeezes the childs precious fingertips
climb down honey
we have to cut through this grate
newt backs away climbing down the pipe as hicks cuts into the bars with his hand torch
newt standing waist deep in the water watches sparks shower blindingly as hicks cuts
she bites her lip trembling
cold and terrified
silently a glistening shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind her
it stands dripping dwarfing her tiny form
newt turns sensing the movement
she screams as the shadow engulfs her
ripley panics hearing screaming below then splashing
she and hicks kick desperately at the grating smashing it down
heedless of the cherry hot edges ripley lunges into the hole with her light
the surface of the water reflects the beam placidly
newt is gone
bobbing in the water eyes staring is casey the doll head
in sinks slowly distorting vanishing in darkness
hicks pulls ripley away from the hole
she struggles furiously trying to tear out of his grip
he drags her back
it takes all of his strength
intense shes gone
he sees something moving toward them through a lattice of pipes
ripley is irrational
we have to all right
i believe it
but we gotta get moving
he drags her toward an elevator not far away at the end of the tunnel
gets her inside slamming her against the back wall
hits the button to go to surface level
an alien warrior leaps into the tunnel starts toward them
the doors are closing
not fast enough
the creature gets one arm through the doors closing on it
they open again an automatic safety feature
the warrior hisses lunging
hicks fires point blank
it spins away screeching
acid sluices between the closing doors across hicks armored chest plate as he shields ripley with his body
the lift starts upward
hicks fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way toward his skin
galvanized out of her hysteria ripley claws at his armor helping him as much as she can
he screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm
he shucks out of the combat armor like a madman dropping the smoking pieces to the floor
acrid fumes fill the air searing eyes and lungs
the elevator stops
the doors part and they stumble out ripley supporting hicks who is doubled over in agony
come on you can make it
drop ship two descends toward the landing grid side slipping in hurricane gusts
bishop stands guiding it with the portable terminal
the ship sets down hard
bishop turns as ripley and hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building behind him
he goes to them helping to support hicks and they run toward the ship buffeted by the gale
ripley shouts her words barely audible over the wind
the loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship
an infernal engine roaring out of control
steam blasts and swirls lightning zaps around the superstructure and columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into the air
we approach hypnotically
the drop ship enters frame moving toward the station
it pivots hovering in the blasting turbulence and settles onto a narrow landing platform ten levels above the ground or about a third of the way up the enormous structure
ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and drops the roll
she has crudely fastened a m a assault rifle together side by side with a flamethrower
a massive unwieldy package of absolute firepower
her movements are curt precise
she works rapidly snatching magazines grenades belts and other gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the drop ship
bishop comes aft from the pilots compartment to help hicks dress his injuries
hicks is sprawled in a flight seat the contents of a field medical key strewn around him
hes out of the game
contorted with pain
they brought her here and you know it
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska
ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel her hands flying
hicks dont let him leave
grimacing with pain we aint going anywhere
she hefts the hybrid weapon grabs the satchel and spins to the door controls
the door opens
wind and machine thunder blast in
see you hicks
hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face
ripley grabs his hand
they share a moment albeit brief
mutual respect in the valley of death
nods with satisfaction dont be long ellen
ripley runs down the ramp crossing the platform to the open doors of a large freight elevator
the doors close
the elevator descends
bars of light move rhythmically across her as ripley stands facing the doors watching the landings go by
the heat grows more intense
pipes glowing cherry red pass by
steam hisses and billows
the lift clatters in a steady beat
ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness directly over her t shirt
her hair is matted and she glistens with sweat
her eyes burn with a determination that holds the gut panic in check
the elevator descends
she checks her weapon
attaches a bandolier of grenades to her harness
primes the flamethrower
checks the rifles magazine
racks the bolt chambering the first round
she checks the marking flares jammed in the thigh pockets of her jump pants
she drops an unprimed grenade trembling forcing herself to be strong
we see she doesnt know doodley about grenades
this is the most terrifying thing she has ever done
she begins to hyperventilate soaking with sweat
her fingers slick and slippery on the rifle
the elevator descends
the lift motors whine slowing
it hits bottom with a bump
the safety cage retracts
slowly expectantly the doors open
through the parting doors
an empty corridor
dark swirling with steam a ruddy glow visible here and there
it seems to have been a descent into dantean hell
the air itself vibrates with heat distortion
machinery whines and throbs
like the beating of a vast heart the pounding of massive pumps echoes through the station
ripley moves out of the lift knuckles white on the rifle
her eyes dart straining to penetrate the lethal gloom
behind her we see a second elevator next to hers its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor
ahead the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence and not far down the bio mechanoid catacomb begins
she enters the maze darting glances at hicks locator taped to the top of her kludge weapon
a voice echoes down the tunnels calm and mechanical
all personnel must evacuate immediately
you now have fourteen minutes to reach minimum safe distance
range and direction read out in rapid fire alpha numerics on the locator display
ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes moving through the swirling steam of the alien maze
she approaches an intersecting tunnel
flashing emergency lights illuminate the insane fresco of the walls
she spins firing the flamethrower
she whirls back
moves forward trembling and adrenalized
skeletal figures drown in the walls frozen in macabre tormented positions like human insects in amber
steam blasts blinding her
the locator signal strengthens an she turns crouches through a low passage turns again
at each intersection she quickly lights a fifteen minute marking flare and drops it
for the way back
she has to turn sideways inching through a fissure between two walls of death
cocoon niches human bas relief sealed in resin
suddenly something shoots out grabbing her
she recovers then recognizes the face sealed in the wall
i can feel it
she looks at him
no one deserves this
she hands him a grenade wrapping his fingers around the spoon and pulls the primer
she moves on
you now have eleven minutes to reach minimum safe distance
ripley moves ahead
the locator signals shows she is almost there
a concussion rocks the place like an earthquake jarring her almost off her feet
the whole station seems to shudder
a siren begins to wail a demented rhythm
following the tracker she turns a corner and stops
the range indicator reads zero
she looks down horrified to see newts tracer bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel
all hope recedes disintegrating into mindless chaos
newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the edge of a cluster of upright ovoid shapes
her eyelids flutter open and she becomes aware of her surroundings
the egg nearest her begins to move
opening like an obscene flower at its top to reveal something stirring within
newt stares transfixed by terror as the jointed legs appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one
she ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run
newt watches the face hugger emerge and turn toward her
ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap and fires blasting it with a burst from the assault rifle
the flash illuminates the figure of an adult warrior nearby
it spins moving straight for ripley
firing from the hip she drills it with two controlled bursts which catapult it back
she steps toward it firing again
her expression is murderous
it spins onto its back
she unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in a fireball
ripley runs to newt and begins tearing at the fresh resinous cocoon material freeing the child
she swings her up onto her back
weakly i knew youd come
newt i want you to hang on now
hang on tight
groggily newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts of ripleys battle harness as ripley picks up her weapon
more warriors are moving toward her among the eggs
she fires the flamethrower
the eggs are engulfed
one of the warriors lunges forward a living fireball
she blasts it in half with two bursts from the m a
ripley retreats ducking under a glistening cylindrical mass
a piercing shriek fill the chamber
and there it is
a massive silhouette in the mist the alien queen glowers over her eggs like a great glistening black insect buddha
whats bigger and meaner than the alien
her fanged head is an unimaginable horror
her six limbs the four arms and two powerful legs are folded grotesquely over her distended abdomen
the egg filled abdomen swells and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac suspended from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if some vast coil
of intestine were draped carelessly among the machinery
ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before
inside the abdominal sac can be seen the forms of countless eggs churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor where they emerge glistening to be picked up by drones
the drones are tiny scuttling albino versions of the warrior aliens we have already seen
ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher
pumps and fires again
the grenades punch deep into the egg sac and explode ripping it open from within
eggs are tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber floor
the queen goes berserk screeching like some psychotic steam whistle
ripley lays about her with the flamethrower igniting everything in sight with an insane fury
eggs shrivel in the inferno and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing
over all is the queens shrieking as she struggles in the flames
two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke closing on her
she pulls the trigger
an empty click
digital counter flashing crimson zeroes
she drops the magazine grabs another from her belt rams it home and opens up
the creatures vanish in rapid fire flashes
ripley backs away venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye searing expenditure of energy
then she dashes into the catacombs navigating by sheer primal instinct
ripley runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria
impressions crash upon her
the maze blurring by sirens howling the station rocking with explosions emergency lights flashing steam blasting red hot steel hissing
reality itself is reduced to a concussive series of strobelike instants of relentless forward motion
she sees one of the flares she dropped and turns
sees another sprinting toward it as the foundations of the world shake
lashing in a frenzy the queen detaches from the egg sac ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and tissue behind it
seen dimly through swirling smoke it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward
ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her firing bursts of pulse rifle fire down side corridors at indistinct shapes and shadows
the weapon is empty when she reaches the freight elevators
a mass of debris falling down the shaft from a higher level has demolished the life cage she descended in
she slams the control for the other cage and hears the sound of the lift motors whine as it begins its slow descent from several levels up
an enraged screech echoes in the corridor
ripley sees a silhouette moving in the smoke
a glistening black shape which fills the corridor to the ceiling
her last cartridge is reading zeroes
the flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that
the grenades are gone
ripley drops the weapon and looks up the shaft to the descending lift
then at the approaching figure
the elevator wont be in time
she runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous screech beats in her ears
she scrambles up the rungs
ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch newt clinging to her
she dives aside as a powerful black arm shoots up through the opening its razor claws slamming into the grille floor inches from her
looking down through the grille she sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her wet and leering
she scrambles up running as the grille floor lifts and buckles behind her with the titanic force of the creature below
it hurls itself with insane ferocity against the metal pacing her from below as she runs
ripley reaches an open grid emergency stairwell and sprints upward
it rocks and shudders with the stations death throes
you now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance
the lift reaches bottom the doors rolling open
the queen turns and freezes as if contemplating the open lift cage
ripley stumbles smashing her knees against the metals stairs
as she rises she hears the lift motors start up
looking down through the lattice work of the station she sees the life cage start ominously upward
she knows there is only one explanation for that
she runs on the stairwell becoming a crazy whirl around her
ripley with newt still clinging to her slams through the door opening onto the platform
through wind whipped streamers of smoke she sees
the ship is gone
her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred outrage at the final betrayal
she scans the sky
hysterical newt is sobbing
the lift rises ponderously into view
ripley turns backing away from the doors toward the railing
there is no place to run to on the platform
explosions detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs swell upward through the machinery
the platform bucks wildly
nearby a cooling tower collapses with a thunderous roar and the shriek of rending steel
more explosions one after another rocketing up from below
ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops
the safety cage parts
to newt low close your eyes baby
the lift doors begin to open
a glimpse of the apparition within
angle on ripley and newt as the drop ship rises right behind them its hovering jets roaring
you now have thirty seconds to reach
ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship
a tremendous explosion rips through the complex nearby slamming the ship sideways
its extended landing legs foul in a tangle of conduit grinding with a hideous squeal of metal on metal
ripley leaps into a seat with newt cradling her
begins strapping in
bishop wrestles with the controls
the landing legs retract ripping free
ripley slams her seat harness latches home
punch it bishop
the entire lower level of the station disappears in a fireball
the air vibrates with intense heat waves and concussion
the drop ship engines fire
ripley is slammed back in her seat
the ship vaults out and up bishop standing it on its tail pouring on the gees
ripley and newt see everything shake into a blur
the drop ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into the clear high night
below the clouds light up from beneath from horizon to horizon
a sun hot dome of energy bursts up through the cloud layer whiting out the frame
the tiny ship is slammed by the shockwave tossed forward
and climbs scorched but functioning toward the stars
ripley and newt watch the blinding glare fade away and they sit wide eyed trembling realizing they are finally and truly safe
newt starts to cry quietly and ripley strokes her hair
its okay baby
we made it
the scorched and battered ship once again sits in its drop bay steam blasting from cooling vents beside the engine
rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber hypnotically
bishop stands behind ripley as she kneels beside a comatose hicks
i gave him a shot for the pain
well need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical
ripley nods and picking up newt precedes bishop down the aisle to the loading ramp
im sorry if i gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable
bishop continues as they move down the ramp
i had to circle and hope things didnt get too rough to take you off
ripley turns to him stopping partway down the ramp
she puts her hand on his shoulder
you did okay bishop
well thanks i he notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the ramp next to his shoe
something bursts from his chest spraying ripley with milklike android blood
it is the razor sharp scorpion tail of the alien queen
driven right through him from behind
bishop thrashes seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands as is slowly lifts him off the deck
above them the queen glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic mechanisms inside one landing leg bay
it blends perfectly with the machinery until it begins to emerge
seizing bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him aside shredded like a doll
it descends slowly to the deck the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black limbs dripping acid and rage
still smoking where ripley half fried it
the queen is huge powerful
and very pissed off
it descends slowly its six limbs unfolding in inhuman geometries
ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself staring hypnotized
terrified to break and run
she lowers newt to the deck never taking her eyes off the creature
to newt go
newt runs for cover
the alien drops to the deck pivoting toward the motion
ripley waves her arms decoying
without warning it moves like lightning straight at her
ripley spins sprinting as the creature leaps for her
its feet slam echoing on the deck behind her
she clears a door
hits the switch
it whirrs closed
the alien hits a moment later
ripley moves ferret quick among dark unrecognizable machines
various angles very tight on what she is doing
her feet going into stirruplike mechanisms
velcro straps fastened over them
fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence
her hand closing on a complex grip control
the hum of powerful motors
the whine of hydraulics
the queen turns its attention from the doors to newt as the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike service channels which cross the deck
the channels are covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her to crawl through
newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the alien appears above seen through the bars
a section of grille is ripped away behind her
she scrambles desperately
another section is ripped away right at her heels
light pouring in
the next will be right above her
the queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her
the parting doors reveal an inhuman silhouette standing there
ripley steps out wearing two tons of hardened steel
the power loader
like medieval armor with the power of a bulldozer
she takes a step
the massive foot crash clangs to the deck
she takes another advancing
ripleys expression is one you hope youll never see
hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her child and that primal murderous rage surges through her now banishing all fear
get away from her you bitch
the queen screeches pure lethality and leaps
a roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall
it rebounds into a massive backhand
it goes backward into heavy loading equipment
screaming come on
the queen emerges as a blur of rage lashing with unbelievable fury
the battle is joined
claws swipe tail lashes
ripley parries with radical swipes of the steel forks
they circle in a whirling blur demolishing everything in their path
the cavernous chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds
whine crash they lock in a death embrace
ripley closes the forks crushing two of the creatures limbs
it lashes and writhes with incredible fury coming within inches of her exposed body
she lifts it off the ground
the hind legs rip at her slamming against the safety cage denting it in
the striking teeth extend almost a meter from inside its fanged maw shooting between the crash bars
she ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion behind her dead in a spray of drool
yellow acid foams down the hydraulic arms toward her
the creature rips at high pressure hoses
purple hydraulic fluid sprays machine blood mixing with alien blood
they topple off balance
the queen pins her
ripley hits a switch
the power loaders cutting torch flares on directly in the things face
they roll together over the lip of a rectangular pit a vertical loading airlock
they crash together four meters below twisted in the loaders wreckage
the alien shrieks pinned
ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons
she slaps the red inner door override and latches the hold locking key down
a klaxon begins to sound
she hits outer door open and there is a hurricane shriek of air as the doors on which they are lying separate revealing the infinite pit of stars below
all this time the alien has been lashing at her in a frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the confined space
the airlock becomes a wind tunnel blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap from the loader
the air of the vast ship howls past her into space as she claws her way up a service ladder
newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across the floor toward the airlock
bishop torn virtually in two his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for newt as she slides past him
he catches her arm and hangs on as she dangles doll like in the airblast
the alien seizes ripleys ankle
she locks her arms around a ladder rung feels them almost torn out of their shoulder sockets
the door opens farther all of space yawning below
the loader tumbles clear falling away
it drags the alien still clutching one of ripleys lucky hi tops into the depths of space
its shriek fades it gone
with all her strength ripley fights the blasting air crawling over the lip of the inner doorway
she releases the override from a second panel
the inner doors close
the turbulent air eddies and settles
she lies on her back drained of all strength
gasping for breath
weakly she turns her head seeing bishop still holding newt by the arm
encrusted with his own vanilla milkshake blood
bishop gives her a small grim smile
not bad for a human
ripley crosses to newt
right here baby
ripley hugs her desperately
ripley limps along the corridor carrying newt on her hip
the ships systems hum comfortingly
newts head rests on her shoulder
are we going to sleep now
can we dream
i think we both can
hold on them as they recede down the long straight corridor
