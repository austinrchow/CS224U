written by dean georgaris transcript by chani at tristanandisolde net britain the dark ages the roman empire has fallen
the land lies in ruins divided amoung feuding tribes
to the west ireland has flourished untouched by the romans protected by the sea
led by their powerful and ruthless king the irish have subdued the britons
knowing that if ireland is to prosper the tribes must never be allowed to unite
scene showing images of mountains
a young boy tristan hunts with his father for a rabbit a year younger than i was for my first
when can i have a stag
oh come on
the two walk home through the mountains
main title appears why would they join up against the irish
because someone has to stand up to them
me marke all the tribes
we cant resist alone
castle tantallon appears onscreen oh my little warrior
we have to be careful
tristan and his father enter the bustling village come home without something for your lady there will be hell to pay
tristan goes to a flower and herb seller can i
aragon continues on into town where he is met by one of his men the angles have arrives my lord as well as the carrods our fellow jutes and the
with marke all will be here
it is a great day
let us hope so
they continue on into town
we see tristan back at the herb sellers thanks
the boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs
going up to lady marke he hands her the finished wreath we heard the news
mother i made this for you lady marke smiles and touches tristans face lovingly in the main hall of aragon the assembled tribe lords gather in meet friends look at
a map of britain is shown the tribes of britain
just as the irish like us
but if we were one land united we would out number them two to one
we could defeat them once and for all
that is why we are here today to sign this treaty of unification
but who would be king
the strongest among us lord marke
scene of movement outside of the town look if you are happy sending all of your gold to ireland living as slaves then by all means do nothing
if we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here
my wife is with child my heart tells me it is a boy
i want him to grow old in a land where all of us all the tribes pict celt angle jute saxon are at peace
this island has not known unity since the romans left
that is why i sign this treaty
and why should we follow you
perhaps wictred because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the barons in this room has failed
a man bursts into the room my lord
the irish are here
scenes of destruction outside the keep
inside aragon grabs marke take all your men
guard the women
all the women and children try to find safety tristan
come this way
in the main keep the men await the irish how did they know
the irish break through and a furious battle begins
tristan tries to fight tristan
aragon manages to hold his son back and puts him in a hold under the floorboards
aragon is then killed by morholt
there is more destruction and fire breaks out
tristan reaches up to touch the floorboards above and finds his fathers seeping blood on his hands
tristan comes out of the hole and surveys the destruction
his father and lady marke are dead
suddenly he is attacked by an irishman but marke jumps in to save him losing his hand in the process dunluce castle
the funeral of the irish queen appears onscreen
we see a funeral procession
a maid holds the young princess comfortingly shes with the gods now isolde youll see her again someday
the king leaves the funeral what news of the treaty
morholt hands the king a scroll which the king tears up good morholt good isolde and bragnae approach a cairn where isolde lays an urn of her mothers ashes within
a niche your mother loved you so much isolde why did she die bragnae
it was an ill fever that took her
it was her heart
castle dor appears onscreen
a procession of survivors from markes retinue return home
they find dor in ruins
markes sister runs up to him and cries in his arms your husband
edyth shakes her head oh sister i am so sorry
a whole generation of men
son of aragon
were his family now
i have a son about your age
melot this is tristan
what shall we do my lord
rebuilding is taking place
the youth are practicing their swordsmanship
marke is testing his ability with his sword without his hand dont hold back marke loses the fight easily
a boy starts yelling to the other boys tristan wont fight me
look hes scared
still wont fight
tristan has the heart of a lion
he just needs some time
why did you take off your helmet
you going to cry
my father died too but you dont see me crying
find another trapdoor to hide under
tristan suddenly fights back and beats all the boys single handedly tristan
tristan starts walking towards the camera
suddenly he is grown up and the town is mostly rebuilt tristan
weve found something
come on this way
you will love it
i found a trapdoor
you found a trapdoor
alright simon will you tell us all how you found it
look at that
the three friends climb down into it where does this lead
i like that vase i think ill have that
i always knew the castle was built on roman foundations but we didnt think anything was left
must be a burial crypt or something
they re emerge from the tunnel here we are the bottom of the keep
who else knows about this
they exit the keep the savages have rebuilt the castle at cornwall only now its made of stone
of cornwalls next tribute i want slaves
if marke resists have morholt crush him
i have led your armies to victory far and near
iv made you rich and powerful
yes you have
you have been most loyal
when i return from cornwall i was hoping
what would please you
the cairn appears once again with a grown up isolde leaning on it looking out to sea its dark in an hour
what do you think is really out there
the old roman lands
full of evil and grief
i want to see it
do you know what the future looks like bragnae
i see the life you were meant for
your father will speak with you
isolde speaks with her father
she is clearly distraught am i just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure
do i have no say in my own life
you have a duty to your king
you are my father
then obey me daughter
isolde runs to her apothecary like room
morholt comes to her your father has given you the news
isolde nods and you welcome it
i accept it
you know we are more alike than you might guess
i too dabble in elixirs
poison from the livers of a puffer fish
just a taste paralyses all the senses
so if the blade doesnt kill
rendered safe by thistle and bark
morholt holds up a leaf and you know the antidote for this
makes a hard man even harder
the only cure
till out wedding day
im to cornwall to deal with rabbles
the irish arrive in cornwall and enter the town of castle dor release them
the irish men spread out and start collecting cornish men and women as hostages leave her
he is grabbed by the irish thugs take him there
get a rope
any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate
a girl rushes forward no
the man is hung and tristan rushes forward
he is held back by the irish men
the cornish hostages are put in a wagon if there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land
take the horses
tristan confronts marke about the irish when would you strike
throw everything we have at them
they are hoping youll do that
on horse they outnumber us two to one
you would lead the men straight to their deaths
so we do nothing
donnchadh would like that even more
me to lose face in front of the other tribes
no we must act
we must be decisive but we cannot act alone
tristan and marke enter the hall so
have the good men of york come to fight with us
the saxons of wessex
my men dont want to follow a pict into battle
let alone one leading a pack of angles and celts
then why are you here
i thought tristan should let me command his men
i make it my habit to follow no one
marke delivered me from that place when i was a boy
so you can understand that when i think of kings i think of him
when i think of cowards
they are one day from their boats on the old roman road
now who will ride out with tristan to fight them
what is your plan tristan
we will need our two fastest runners
the irish and their hostages make their way through a forest
suddenly two of the british jump up and shoot at the irish
half of the convoy follow the two runners go around
they continue to pursue the runners on foot
suddenly tristan and his men spring up from hidden holes under the loam and shoot the irish with their bows
the irish are attacked from all sides and defeated
back at the main part of the irish convoy morholt cleans his blade morholt theyre back
cloaked figures ride in while the camp cheers
suddenly they attack and more british spring from the ground
a battle ensues
morholt begins to kill the hostages but tristan springs to stop him
sammy is stabbed
tristan is stabbed by morholts poisoned blade but manages to kill morholt
melot and tristan run to sammys side kill the slaves
i dont want to die
simon dies and tristan collapses tristan
i cant feel my legs or my hands
build a second boat
tristan seems to die he shall have a kings service
tristan is lain on a funeral boat and floated out to sea farewell tristan of aragon
death of the irish
the boat is set alight by burning arrows
melot turns to the captured irish when the irish came to cornwall and my father surrendered
you spared a dozen out of a hundred
i am even less kind
the leader and shall take this message home
as for the rest
the surviving british and the hostages return to dor
marke meets them victory
did i love him like a son or did i misuse him for my own purposes
tristan floats in the sea the ship no longer burning
isolde is suddenly woken from sleep and makes her way to the beach with bragnae where are we going
youre afflicted child
speak to me
your father will find us and have my head
you are my charge
i am no ones charge
and you will be morholts lady
and live a loveless life like my mam
isolde runs to the beached boat isolde
its a man
bragnae help me
they drag tristan to a hut on the beachfront start a fire
isolde checks his condition while bragnae tries to light the fire his heart falters
isolde starts to undress what are you doing
he needs heat
get your clothes off
isolde curls up against tristan while bragnae starts to undress hurry
smell the poison
when he warms we will need thistle and bark
ive not been naked with a man for years
youve been sleeping a long time
youre in ireland
did you know that
youre safe here
no one knows
dont be scared
tristan fades out of consciousness tristan wakes and grabs a stone to use as a weapon when he hears a noise nooo nooo noo
isolde runs in its alright you dont need that
i forgot to tell him about you
ill wait outside with the other beasts
bragnae leaves you said no one else knew
sworn to silence
lie down please
tristan lies down its good you are remembering things
this might sting
do you remember anything else
the boat i found you in
how you got this
too many questions
here keep it dry
here i found bread you have water and fire
the ocean is outside if you wish a bath
you wont know where you are going so please dont try to leave
just trust me
why are you doing this
ill be back isolde leaves the hut and meets up with bragnae outside this is a dangerous game you are playing
hes english isolde
then weve got him prisoner
under no circumstances tell him your name you hear me
not if you wish him to escape this place
do you hear me
back in the irish town isolde and bragnae whisper together
king donnchadh enters and they fall into silence youve been away
i had noticed
yes i have a bit
bragnae and i were spying the convent of brittes
some women need it
youll find no refuge in a new religion
your place is here with morholt
any word of my betrothed
but comforted no doubt that you yearn for him
the king leaves isolde leaves the town to return to the hut on the beach
she sees tristan bathing in the sea
isolde tends to tristans wounds back in the hut whats your name
oh i think its better if we dont bother with names
how can i thank you if i dont have your name
you just did
if you insist
my name is bragnae
im a lady in waiting at the court
my parents are dead
my mother she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling
my father wouldve left you where you fell
tristan of aragon
well tristan of aragon id guess about you too but i think ive already seen everything
i hope you appreciate the risks we are taking and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able
bragnae leaves she likes me
shes right though you do risk
finishes poulticing him there
what of your parents
they also died when i was a child
a different type of irish kindness
bragnae returns and interrupts their moment of tenderness tomorrow then
tristan sits outside making a shell bracelet
isolde shortly arrives
inside the hut the scene continues there she who bore you brought you forth
set me as a seal upon your heart as a seal upon your arm for love is as strong as death ridiculous
i happen to believe what that says
dont you think there is more to life
something more than duty and death
why are we capable of feelings if not to have them
why long for things if they are not meant to be ours
well dont listen to me
youre so sure of things
youre certainty its like armour
i wish i had that
why would you need it
the joy of being a lady
wanting something i cant have
a life of my own
time for sleep now
ill follow you later
you need to rest
in case your betrothed should want to see you
bragnae and isolde leave tristan and isolde look out to sea youre promised
whats he like
nearly twice your size
an absolute gentleman
earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have
i didnt know what i was talking about
they leave the shore and go inside the hut isolde is crying outside just past that bluff there is a boat
thats how you should go when you leave
you should go soon
isolde leaves but tristan goes after her
inside the hut they make love
how do you feel
i dont know tristan
theyve found your boat
at this very moment the king himself is scouring the coast
he will find you
he finds everyone
the tide is coming lets go
they drag the boat out to see come with me
come with me
i cant why not
tristan weve both known this cant be
weve known this from the start
that doesnt mean it isnt true
it just cannot be
i want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time
i want to know that there is more to this life and i cant know that if they kill you
they kiss go
isolde leaves to shore while tristan rows away back at dunlane a cornish warrior may be ashore
we seek him as i speak
hopefully it is just his rotted corpse well find for he has slain your betrothed
morholt is dead
fallen in battle
bragnae comfort her
the two leave the irish henchman bodkin enters shes stunned
as am i by her grief
we should assulat the british straight away
crush them with maximum force
like that of markes tribe with the maximum force you speak of
i will not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed
until then well have cunning divide them
of what nature
a prize perhaps
isolde looks out to sea while tristan sails back to cornwall
meanwhile all the british lords receive a message from ireland whats this about a tournament
he has offered his daughter and the lands of lyonesse as dowry to whichever english tribe wins
it is a clever way of setting us against each other
well the other barons will see through that
there is a meeting of the lords in dor as baron of wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people
for yourself you mean
and what of the support you promised tristan
tristan is dead
my people have suffered enough
they see the wealth of lyonesse as more real than any alliance
my mind is set
and ours as well
so be it
tristan rides back into town youre weary let me rally your friends
ill lead them against d
ah melot melot melot
you are my blood and you are a noble presence but
they hear the sounds of the townspeople calling welcome to tristan outside
everyone rushes to tristan lord marke
it cannot be
i saw you dead
i am delivered
there is a celebration for tristans return that night a toast
back from the dead
the irish king offers his daughter in tournament to divide the tribes
for the power and the wealth half the tribes have sent champions to fight at the
god knows what happened to him
tristan stares out into the night
the voice of isolde haunts him my face in thine eyes thine in mine appears and true plain hearts do in the faces rest whatever dies was not mixed equally
if our two loves be one or thou and i
love so alike that none can slacken none can die
tristan confronts marke in the keep with a plan what
it is the only way to keep the alliance alive
i fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies
well they are all going to the tournament anyway
by announcing you will share the dowry with every baron that remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails the others would be compelled to follow you when
if we win
if we lose we could end up following wictred
id need an infallible champion
you are not yet healed
then this trip will be my tonic
i will be ready
i know i will
what is the source of this fervour
let me go and win you a wife
she can make peace without spilling one drop of blood and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack
the british arrive in ireland
a henchman approaches tristan truce
you have safe passage
the warriors enter the tournament arena how do i look
how do you look
where is this princess
whats her name
i want to see what she looks like
maids attend to isolde as the king enters there
no not quite
if i am to be a present i should be fully wrapped
the king takes his seat on the podium overlooking the arena see how the bees come to the honey
tristan of aragon
he is given a specially prepared tablet so he lives
for the moment
wictred of glastonbury
he is also given a prepared stone i fight with no champion in my stead
because the barons will never unite behind him
isolde takes her seat do you think shes got the pox
the combatants take their positions since the dawn of time
isolde sees tristan amoung the group to be fighting begin
the battles start make it for real
you were great
tristans enemy is given a new sword after losing his weapon allow it
tristan wins the battle it was too easy for you tristan
not much for a third draw
wictred and tristan work through their opponents until they face each other mace
one more fight tristan
take deep breaths
wictred lord of saxonberg
tristan champion of cornwall
tristan and wictred fight
wictred is booed by the crowd
tristan defeats wictred
tristan goes before the king an impressive victory
of course the man who defeats morholt might be expected to triumph here
on behalf of cornwall i offer your daughter a place on our throne
the throne of england united behind one leader
perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one
isolde comes forward im yours
tristan of aragon has won you on behalf of lord marke of cornwall
everyone disperses let them take her across the sea
after the wedding ill disavow isolde the alliance will crumble
the english sail back to britain with isolde and bragnae tristan
princess wants to speak to you
tristan goes to meet isolde inside the ship you risked your life to give me to another man
you said your name was bragnae
why did you do that
oh what have i done
stop this thing
i won you in my kings name
but i am yours
you touched me and i yielded
it doesnt matter
it is the only thing that matters tristan
leave with me i will go anywhere
your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed
my marriage to another man
you will live with this
dont do this to me
melot enters tristan weve made shore
the party enter dor marke waits for them what if shes a hag
or maybe she wont have me
she will brother
youre the prize
isolde steps out of the carriage my lord
he takes her hand and everyone claps isoldes wedding gown is prepared
marke puts on his metal hand for the ceremony
isolde fully dressed floats down the river to the wedding ceremony about a decorated ship
she and marke go forward to be wed
there is a celebration after the wedding
as isolde and marke leave the party isolde approaches tristan if things were different
if we lived in a place without duty
would you be with me
that place does not exist
ill pretend its you
isolde and marke retire to their bedroom
tristan watches their window from outside youre trembling
you are far from home and i am a stranger still
but you mustnt fear me
my wish is to make you happy as a wife
as a women and hopefully one day the fact that i am not whole will not offend you
marke kisses isolde and makes love to her marke and isolde stand outside the keep surveying the town
mark fingers her shell bracelet thats pretty
did you make it
it was a present
tristan goes to edyths home and knocks on the door tristan
might i stay here a while
there is a montage of tristan and isoldes lives while in dor
finally in the marketplace isolde is fed food by mark and they laugh together
edyth sees tristan watching tristan
tristan walks off ive never seen him like this before
perhaps someone his own age should speak with him
marke lets her go
she finds tristan they believe you are distant
they are worried about you
so am i
i can tell
laughing at the market holding hands a caress on the neck when he pours you wine
he is my husband
i remember his kingdom comes before my life
yes well i must confess i thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty
am i not permitted a single moment without mourning
living with this tristan as you said we must
i live in torture thinking of these moments
with every look he gives you i get sicker and sicker
there is a burning in me i feel on fire and guilt and i cant get rid of either
does it make you happy to know that
the roman bridge
i can get to it without being seen
and i will go there anytime to be there with you
all the leaders meet in castle dor to sign a treaty welcome bands of anglia rothgar and orick
wessex kaye and wictred
as you will be king and his daughter queen does that mean donnchadh will be coming to the coronation
on the next full moon all will attend
a lot can happen in a month bearing that in mind and given the instabilities of our new land i shall be naming a second
my sister has raised one capable of guiding you if the need should arise
he is a man of passion fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head
i give you tristan of aragon
melot is very upset for the first time since the romans this country stands united
after leaving the signing tristan chases down marke i cant be your second
melot must be
he is blood
besides i wish to journey north
you no longer sleep at dor and now you dont want to be my second
do you find no comfort in your home
these stone walls that you helped build
i find these walls a prison
everything i want seems misplaced
ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me
all for one dream
now that you reached that dream it is natural that you would feel some loss
it doesnt matter if you want to be second
i will only be king if you are my second
id put it more gently if i could
then i am your second
perhaps it is time that you took a wife
cant live alone forever
isolde passes isolde
i was trying to explain to tristan the importance of loving
it seems he might live without it
there are other things to live for
but they are not life tristan
they are the shells of life
and empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love
love is made by god
ignore it and you can suffer as you cannot imagine
then i will no longer live without it
come we will be late
the warriors ride out on the full moon
it is an old ritual
i shall miss you tonight
that night isolde sneaks out into the forest
marke and his warriors ride together
tristan leaves the party to find isolde
they make love together how many did you love before me
and after me
while hunting the boar marke falls off his horse lord marke
are you hurt
nothing but for my pride
tristan and isolde bid each other farewell
back in the keep there is much dancing tristan i need to speak with you
we havent even had a coronation yet to mark tradition
but now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you as second
i tried to convince him you would be better
yes well peace can be just as treacherous as war and i feel that marke doesnt really
listen to me
our attention must be on cornwall now more than ever
i am sorry he didnt choose you
melot approaches marke can i speak to you
marke leaves isoldes side tristan leaves and isolde follows
they hide in a room were they begin to kiss each other passionately
finishing his conversation with melot marke seeks isolde
later that night marke makes love to isolde tristan and isolde are out in a forest clearing together
it is an old ruins with paintings of a couple on the broken walls what do you think became of them
they were lives
i find myself imaging things in this place
i decorate it
books a harp there
would it be his or mine
i would have no way to tell would i
he is a kind man tristan i cannot hate him
yesterday at the market i saw a couple holding hands and i realised we would never do that
never anything like it
no picnics or unguarded smiles
just stolen moments that leave too quickly
in the marketplace isolde and marke shop
tristan steals some herbs and makes a wreath for isolde
he surreptitiously slips it onto isoldes wrist as merlot and wictred look on later marke goes to his bedroom but finds bragnae waiting where is isolde
i dont know for sure she was having a walk in the garden before and im afraid i got tired so i returned
its my fault
bragnae goes to find tristan and isolde who are meeting in secret youre going to get caught
both of you
hes looking for you right now hell see you
i told you this would happen
there is another door here forgotten
this comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep
i hate this
isolde and bragnae go down im tired of this
im tired of lying for you
im sick of it
isolde goes to bed with marke there is a servings child quite ill
doing better now
i didnt ask you were you were
your heart is beating so fast
is there anything i can do to make you happier
i want to make you happy
wictred speaks to king donnchadh in secret shes in love with tristan
if i expose them it will break markes heart and his hold on the other barons
with markes champion in chains well take castle dor
you can man your armies unopposed
there will be no one defending you in the waters
and your price
i want markes throne
as the king leaves he talks to bodkin when his throne falls apart well go over and pick up the pieces
marke approaches tristan as he looks over the town tristan
can i speak with you
is it possible
do you think a man blinded by love
is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him
takes out wreath i found this hidden amoung isoldes things
do you think she has a lover
has she said anything to you
perhaps you could follow her
i cant ask anyone else
i know what you think im acting like a child
normally i can read faces but with hers i feel like
i cant be objective
shes so delicate
you really love her
i didnt know how empty i was
she sustains me she thrills me
and when i see this ring it is a ring of thorns
the ring is nothing
shes loyal to you
i am sure of it
if you say so
tristan is tortured by markes proclamation and burns his and isoldes meeting place
isolde finds it in ruins
the irish arrive on ships for the coronation ceremony i count nine if they move they will warn us with a black flag the king of ireland arrives and shakes
hands with a waiting marke you bring an entourage
i can let myself be alone in my position lord marke
but dont worry they will stay offshore
i miss you
my nephew merlot of cornwall and tristan slayer of my best general winner of isolde defender of the alliance
you are a fortunate man
inside the castle the coronation is held in latin
marke and isolde are crowned and take their seats on their thrones
back at the lookout point the flag bearers are stabbed by the irish
dancing happens at the coronation celebrations tristan
seems i worried for nothing
may i dance with the queen or does tristan have the next one
thats right you have never danced with isolde before
tristan is pushed forward to dance with isolde a new song for tristan
why did you burn it
meet me there in an hour or ill die
the dance ends i could still teach you a thing or two dancing being one of them
accuse him now
no no no
well have more than accusations
tristan leaves is something the matter
im just feeling a little weary thats all
i might just go and have a lie down
isolde leaves friends friends hear me
weve forgotten the full moon isnt it time to ride out
tonight it cause for exception
but the coronation should uphold tradition surely it is not to be neglected already
we honour it
in half a night
everyone leaves to hunt while tristan and isolde race to be with each other i miss ireland isolde this must end
thats like asking me to stop breathing
it cannot be
elsewhere wictred leads the hunt to where tristan and isolde are please dont leave me
they kiss only to have the hunting party come upon them isolde
there is someone
i see how it is in cornwall
my money is good enough my alliance is good enough but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore
its not like that
i see no relation to me here
i will see this peace end
you have brought the allegiance to shame
who would fight for this
wictred and king donnchadh ride off seize him
behold your hero uncle i would have no heroes now
further away the irish march towards dor
bodkin speaks to king donnchadh theyre ashore
prove your worth
if a man cant rule his woman how can he govern an entire kingdom
we have suffered peace
its all been coming apart
i can feel it youre right
wictred rides up there is very little time
fortunately donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here
hes asked me to give you a message
it is compensation for the men you will lose attacking castle dor with donnchadh tomorrow
lets be honest our people need a stronger leader
and who might that be wictred
too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place
i pledge you my legiance and offer him my services as his second
i like this plan
tristan is in chains in the keep
marke comes down to see him i came to apologise
ive been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps id given enough
at least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect
you have a home
why was it not enough
you do not know what you have done
everything is destroyed everything
all because you did not have enough
shes loyal to you i am sure of it
what could it had been had i not stretched out my hand to save your life
how i curse that day how i curse it
and so be with your defence
then i will go complete your punishment donnchadh marches on us as we speak
marke strides away
bragnae catches up to him in a corridor
she bars entrance to his bedroom shes young
i will not let you harm her
marke moves bragnae out of the way and enters the room how long
since you thought he was dead
i found him wounded on the beach in ireland
i hid him from my father and i told him my name was bragnae
so when he came to the tournament at dunluce to win donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise it was me
all this time my heart has been his and i am sorry
he tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you
marke leaves the room in silence merlot and wictred walk through the forest discussing plans i will coax him out make sure donnchadh knows this
of course of course
you know as things moved along i suspected them for some time
tristan and isolde
you know what i could never work out
how it was conducted
how she got in and out of dor unseen
the roman tunnel
a henchman released tristan from the prison and takes him to the riverside where isolde and bragnae are waiting with a boat what is this
the will of the king
i told him about ireland
hes given us our freedom
why does loving you feel so wrong
tristan if i do this
for all time they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom
tristan pushes the boat away tristan dont
tristan runs back to dor at dor they bring everyone into the castle and close the gates
the armies close in on dor get the livestock and fuel undercover
put some archers on the ramparts
all the archers have deserted us as has half the household
and you stay
if you are surprised then they have won already
come on hurry
the armies gather outside the keep burn it
their will is as strong as milk
the seas will unravel us
where is wictred with his key
at the tunnel entrance it comes up to the roman foundations at the lowest level
this is a godsend
they both enter it and wictred gestures for his men to follow there is much fighting as the forces of the irish and traitorous barons besiege castle dor
in the tunnel wictred and melot move towards the keep what will you say to him
that he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba whats that
the two turn to see wictreds men following them down the tunnel
melot fights to stop them going down the tunnel but is stabbed the enemy forces break through the outer gates and are attempting to get into the keep aim for
the front of the line they are waiting
as wictred and his men enter the keep from the tunnel below tristan enters the tunnel from the forest entrance the irish are inside
bar the door make sure no one gets in
in the tunnel tristan comes upon a wounded melot you
what happened here
a reward for idiocy
a dozen irish have blazed your way
melot i came to aid marke
i didnt lead them here
no i did
i thought someone believed in me
it will be undone
tristanim for the wormsswear to me that you are true
as we were brothers
build my boat
melot dies tristan makes his way to the keep while marke and his men do battle with wictreds theyre here
keep them back
hes trying to lower the bridge traitor
give me your shield were pinned down
tristan attacks wictred and his men tristan
no hes with us
marke and his men jump into battle but not before tristan is stabbed
tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with his sword
he is again stabbed by wictred tristan
tristan stabs wictred and kills him
tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides tristan
how did you get here
secrets in the bowls of the keep
in the bowls of the keep
they have reached the palisades
then we must keep hope
tristan cuts the head off wictreds body and slowly stands
marke nods as the drawbridge of the keep is lowered king donnchadh makes his way to the front get back
ha ha ha
ha ha ha
tristan slowly steps out with the head of wictred in his hands behold
the head of a traitor
marke and his generals step out will you always be little men who cannot see what was and could be again
there is no middle ground
so slay us or slay him
he attacks people around him but is shot in the back by an arrow
suddenly the irish and the british start to fight
tristan falls to the ground and marke runs to his side take me out of here
take me to the river
isolde comes to the battle and is grabbed by general who drags her to the riverside hurry
marke you must come the battle needs you
well lose everything
i must heed their call i am the king
weve driven them back as far as we can but they are holding us at the throat
goodbye my friend
marke and his generals leave and isolde goes to tristans side know that i love you tristan
and wherever you go whatever you see i will always be with you
you were right
i do not know if life is greater than death but love was more than either
tristan dies and isolde weeps
we see tristan and isolde back in the hut in ireland as she reads to him my face in thine eyes thine in mine appears and true plain hearts do
in the faces rest where can we find two better hemispheres without sharp north without declining west
whatever dies was not mixed equally if our two loves be one or thou and i
love so alike that none can slacken none can die
they kiss their love did not bring down a kingdom
legend says that marke defeated the irish rebuilt castle dor and reigned in peace until the end of his days
isolde laid tristan beneath the ashes of the roman ruin planted his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined
