href b b virtuosity by eric bernt rd rewrite by eric bernt third rewrite august two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street
hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle
the sidewalk is crowded with people
so is the street
too many people not enough cement
summer probably august
heat shimmers off the horizon
making the sky look peculiar
the men keep running
passed a guy sitting at a bus stop watching a television in his lap
you hear the newscaster
officers gather evidence at this grisly crime scene you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes
a beat the three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic intelligent and dangerous
the guy pays little attention to the broadcast
he seems almost bored by it
like this kind of news is commonplace
or hes got more important things on his mind
everybody is sweating
including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians
their uniforms are freshly pressed
their shoes just recently shined
hair tightly cropped
faces perfectly shaved
clearly men proud to wear the badge of the los angeles police department
the guy in the lead is his body is a running backs
his endurance a marathoners
his face one youd want for your own
hes in his s
if he was in his s youd still be jealous
his partner is john donley late s eager to prove himself
he struggles to keep up with parker
john accidently knocks over several pedestrians
they give no reaction except to pick themselves up and continue on their way
parker and john keep charging
their conversation breathless i cant get over how different you look
ruefully five years can be a bitch huh
they split up
the maitre d still facing the front doors repeats his greeting to no one in particular
may i help you
parker spots sid
across the room
without hesitation the hunter chases his prey
gun out and firing
not what you would call standard police procedure
bullets riddle sid
s table as he dives from his chair
he lands next to a bowling ball bag which sits beneath his table
john charges from the other direction until a woman gets up from her chair standing directly in johns line of fire
to the woman lady move
before she can do so sid
stands behind the woman grabbing her and throwing her across the table into parker
they tumble to the floor
in the same movement sid
removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots john in the shoulder before he can fire
johns gun flies from his hand
advances toward him
parker struggles to his feet
aims his weapon
does the same but without looking
parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm
his wound identical to johns
parkers weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp
parker charges him wildly but sid
brutally kicks him in the stomach
in perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background
parker doubles over gasping for breath
another kick drops parker to his knees
to parker im going to rehearse with your friend a while then ill be back to perform a new piece with you
he grabs his bowling bag and slams it into johns head knocking him out
puts johns unconscious body over his shoulder
if you get hungry id recommend the escargot
he carries john and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen
parker scrambles to his gun and races after sid
parker charges through sous chefs chopping vegetables who work undistracted
the vegetables look plastic
parker turns a corner stopping fast
at the other end of the aisle stands sid
who presses his gun against the head of a frightened busboy
holds the busboys body in front of his own as a shield
a beat enjoying the concert so far
advancing up the aisle parker levels his gun at sid
with his good arm
now all work comes to a stop as the sous chefs watch the showdown
recitals over asshole
he fires directly through the chest of the innocent busboy hitting sid
the sous chefs gasp in horror as the busboy drops through sid
s grasp to the floor
stares at parker in disbelief
blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in sid
s shoulder which was caused by the same bullet
s arm dangles uselessly
his gun lies on the floor
surprised but pleased
you and me arent so different after all
parker again pulls the trigger
like a violin without strings
he takes off around the corner
grabbing another clip from inside his uniform parker goes after him
only to stumble over something
s bowling bag
blood flows through its zipper
you now realize the object inside is not a bowling ball
beside the bowling bag lies johns body which is convulsing
his hands have been tied to bare electrical wire
john is being electrocuted
parker kicks away the wires but not in time
he scans the room for sid
parker has no idea sid
is standing directly behind him
grabs parker by the throat
i told you i was going to perform a new piece with you
its called first you suffer then you die
hope you like it
parker gags unable to breathe
he then starts to de materialize from within sid
as if to god noooh
you cant take him yet
im not finished
johns body also dematerializes as parker disappears entirely
the blood seeping from sid
s wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body
along with his bone fragments
his shoulder is healing itself
right before your very eyes
we pull back to reveal what you are seeing is the scene continues seamlessly
s skin heals over his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their proper places
no scar whatsoever
his clothing also returns to perfect condition
literally as good as new
this is known as automatic resetting
the previously dead busboy also auto resets
his wound healing by itself
we pull back further to reveal the monitor is one of several a k a letac
the facility is a converted aerospace research building in pacoima
funded by government black book dollars
the look is a mixture of industrial grime and high tech sparkle
banks upon banks of computer equipment
wires cables conduits connectors everywhere you look
in complete disarray to the uninitiated
but to those in the know this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world
the building is partitioned into dozens of stations
at each station a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration
each new technology designed to help fight the new cold war
the war on crime
the atmosphere is competitive
voices are loud
tension anticipation in the air
only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production
letac is quite simply los alamos from meets sega from
at a station in the middle of the room two unconscious bodies lie on narrow beds wearing form fitting skull caps made of polyurethane
each skull cap has acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes
each needle is directly connected to the participants nervous system
the tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds
each of these components isnt much to look at on its own
but together with the rest of the apparatus are part of something very new a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read to be perfectly clear the events
you just witnessed involving parker john and sid
took place within virtual reality not the real world
dozens of small character modules similar to todays nintendo game cartridges are plugged into
the systems main console
each of the modules bares a name and number such as maitre d
there is no character version number greater than
until you see the module labelled sid
the simulation timer stops at hours minutes seconds
a clock reads pm
four observers two men and two women watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station
one of the men wears an l
his name is william cox s
his nameplate reads chief of police
one of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor
intently following the action on screen
studying it clinically
her name is dr
madison carter late s
she is beautiful and charming but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence
she is one of the countrys foremost authorities on criminal psychology
her concerns are empirical
her quest is knowledge
she has little in common with the other observers
the other man is frederick wallace os chairman ceo of letac
but not as commanding or powerful as elizabeth deane the presidentiallyappointed crime czars elizabeth deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to letac
as well as which prototypes will move on to production
quietly to wallace what did cox pull him out early for
barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field remember
a beat dont remind me
lab assistants remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies
the acupuncture needles remain in the caps
you can now see the faces of the participants parker and john
parker lies calmly his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness
he looks very different than his virtual rendering his hair is long and ragged
his face is unshaven
a scar across his cheek
a hoop earring in one ear
his outfit a filthy prison uniform
johns outfit matches parkers
physically he looks as cleancut as his virtual rendering
except that he is convulsing
his flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him
like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure
barely conscious two paramedics burst through the doors and rush to john
the paramedics inject him
the simulators designer daryl lindenmeyer s high strung intense and brilliant beyond words stands by the equipment protectively
he is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for johns life
johns body goes limp
his vital signs flat
the paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet
they begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out
annoyed to wallace what the hell happened
pointing to needles lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system
if the simulator isnt calibrated properly experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream
the experience becomes real
angrily simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world
annoyed to lindenmeyer i was assured the problem was corrected
i did fix it
i told you i did
i dont know why it happened again
a beat my first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate
coldly to wallace why wasnt i told
black book dollars black book operation
you pay me for results not how for how i get you there
to deane ill tell you one thing there is no way in hell we should allow any real officers to train in this damn thing
then about all ive spent million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population
after giving wallace a cold hard stare namely at his hand stitched lapel his gold watch and his diamond studded cufflinks she exits
wallace follows after her quickly
you now notice that the chair dr
madison carter had occupied is now empty
she left a while ago
lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child
there are several scratches but no major damage
he looks relieved
struggling to sit up he
only had a year left on his sentence
annoyed how much do you think i care
parker still not fully conscious hurls himself at lindenmeyer
hysterical dont touch me
dont touch me
he flails his arms wildly
this is clearly a man who should never drink coffee
two armed guards whove been standing in the background pull parker off lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground
lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put parker in handcuffs and leg chains
ill walk him out
the guards back off as cox helps parker to his feet
to parker you all right
still clearing his head whyd
you pull me out
donley started experiencing the attack for real
if i hadnt gotten you out the same thing would have happened to you
a beat you may not believe this parker but i still consider us friends
he helps parker toward the exit as he continues having difficulty with his balance
the building is heavily guarded
razor wire land mines armed sentries
nobody who shouldnt be here gets anywhere near here
cox leads parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport
the two guards walk behind at a distance
two more by the transport
the chain between parkers legs keeps his steps short
what the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for
he was a computer program for crissake
you were supposed to act as if everything was real
real my ass
its an overblown game
a beat anybody ever catch that fucking psycho
before you nobody else had gotten close enough to sid
to take a shot at him
hell nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first
eyeing parkers scar new scar you making it okay in there
head down im getting by
he starts walking ahead of cox
pausing for emphasis youve got to know i tried keeping you out of general population
his voice trails off as parker turns around and heads directly toward him
locking eyes you want to know how im doing
every day i lose a little bit more of myself
a beat im becoming something else and it scares the hell out of me
he turns back toward the transport
two armed guards open the back doors for parker then stand poised with weapons out and ready
cold metal benches
parker climbs in the only passenger
he looks out the open doors to cox
half heartedly but with the six months off i get for being your guinea pig ive only got to survive another years months and days
dont give up parker
a beat you know those cheesy christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year
what about them
a beat do me a favor keep sending them
standing outside the transport cox puts his hand on parkers shoulder
take care pal
behind him johns body is loaded into an ambulance
the guards slam the prison transport doors shut
parker sits in darkness as the transport begins its trek
the only light comes from a four inch portal covered in steel mesh through which the guards can keep an eye on him
tauntingly hey parker im real sorry john boy got fried
what do you think big reds gonna do when he finds out you came back without his girl friend
parker sits in silence
remains visible on the various monitors around the room as lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator
from the monitors dont be angry with me daryl
a beat did you recognize the son of a bitch who got away
should i have
think hard itll come to you
wallace enters briskly
you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country
a beat do you have any idea how much money you just cost me
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism
of the six prison inmates youve tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training only mr
barnes is still breathing
im still making adjustments
youve had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want lindenmeyer
moving closer elizabeth deane does not give second chances
neither do i
hysterical relishing his authority you are to turn over the sid
program and all its documentation for immediate destruction
is that understood
restraining himself i understand
i understand perfectly
wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door
on the monitors sid
starts walking toward you
into a closeup
from the monitor hey wallace you really think you can shut me down
wallace stops staring at a monitor in disbelief
to lindenmeyer how does he know who i am
pointing to microphone he hears
approaching the monitor as a matter of fact i do
around the room sid
walks to a pay phone and dials a number
wallace walks toward the buildings entrance
his footsteps echo
his cellular phone rings
this is wallace
through phone as a matter of fact little man youre wrong
i think therefore i am
wallace stops staring at his phone in disbelief
parker is led into the inmate receiving room at gunpoint
he is ordered to remove his clothing
he stands completely naked arms held out to the sides as he is strip searched
every portion of the body in which someone could hide something is closely inspected
without being graphic we watch the dehumanizing procedure
he opens his mouth as wide as possible
pulls his earlobes foreword to reveal behind them
then bends over hands on the floor in front of him
he is scanned with a metal detector
so is his clothing which is then returned to him
welcome home cop
parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates
the food is unrecognizable
the air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke
nobody is talking
parker forces down the remainder of his meal then returns his utensils to a bin
and heads to the bathroom
all eyes following parkers every move
the other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following parker
his face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago
this is big red
he follows parker into the bathroom
graffiti covers the walls
red uses a stained urinal then turns to the stalls
a pair of prisonissue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them
time to hurt
red kicks in the door to the stall
revealing a pair of shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt
red hears something behind him
and turns around slowly
parker stands barefooted and shirtless
scars are visible around each arm just below the elbow
you will learn what these represent momentarily
parker is six inches shorter and pounds lighter than red
but the punch parker delivers to reds face makes you think its the other way around
you hear the sound of metal crushing bone
red is thrown backwards into the stall
blood splatters from his mouth adding another shade of redness to his face
reds teeth stick out of parkers fist
parker pulls out the teeth
he does not bleed
nor seem in pain
metal is visible beneath the surface of his skin
for the first time you notice small tattoos on the outsides of his palms
they read wentlow model l and r followed by serial numbers
red charges parker wildly
parker dodges him like a matador does a bull
then brings his fists down savagely on the back of reds head
his skull cracks
red drops to the floor
parker jumps on top of him arms around his neck
red staggers to his feet
his eyes wide
his face now even redder
parker maintains his mechanical grip
red finally succumbs to the lack of oxygen
he drops to his knees
parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his head
parker lets go dropping red to the wet filthy floor
the room isnt clean
the technology is outdated
a large female nurse applies epoxy like sealant to the synthetic skin on parkers fingers
i still dont know why they wasted this fancy new technology on you
every time i fix you up you only go and mess it up again
she sandpapers off the excess sealant
then places his elbow into an electronic sensitivity adjuster
tell me how this feels
she pricks parkers finger with a pin
smiling ill dial it down a little
she does so then pricks parkers finger again
he grimaces in pain
that about right
itll never feel right
at least they work
would you rather have no hands at all
synthetic body parts lying strewn around one of the stations in letac the next day
its a good bet this is the same technology attached to parkers elbows
there are also various shapes and sizes of robots androids and other synthetic forms
the most humanlooking ones are the least functional
the least humanlooking ones the most functional
you follow a remotecontrolled boxshaped robotic sentry moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway station
it is being operated by clyde reilly s a hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless rooms
hidden from reillys view lindenmeyer the software expert who created sid
stares jealously through a narrow gap in a partition
trying to contain his anger
wallace enters the station carrying a bottle of dom perignon and two glasses
wallace hugs reilly who does not return the gesture
he pops the cork and pours their glasses
toasting to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes
as long as you keep overpaying me ill be the first to go into production on three and four as well
as long as they keep overpaying me ill keep overpaying you
dropping the revelry just make goddam sure you can have of them ready for deployment around the city by next month
wallace i could have of them ready by tomorrow
a beat do they have to look so
at this stage you either get form or function
you said she wanted function
i gave you function
what are you complaining about
he remote controls the robotic sentry to chase wallace out of the station
lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the gap in the partition
lindenmeyer storms in angrily
is visible on the virtual reality monitors around the simulator
hes giving himself a manicure
all they want to produce around here is mediocrity
true genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime
a revelation it was you wasnt it
innocently it was me what
you amped the neural connectors back up didnt you
angrily youre the reason the convict died
youre the reason i got fired
i couldnt just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty
im a triple twisting double back flip off the high platform not a swan dive
proud but frightened my god
which god would that be the one who created me or the one who created you
a beat in your world the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
but in my world the one who gave me life doesnt have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away
what do you expect me to do put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here
i had something a little different in mind
deviously instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly why dont you get him to show you what hes been working on after hours
lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow then picks up a phone and dials an extension
into phone hey reilly sheila
s been asking for you
whose wrists and ankles are cuffed being led into a prison interrogation room
madison carter sits at a table a visitors badge clipped to her suit
a notepad in front of her
to the guard the cuffs wont be necessary
no offense maam but i dont think thats such a good idea
i would like the following three things in this order your mouth shut his cuffs off and your ass outside the door
the guard removes parkers cuffs then exits taking up his post outside the door
the skin around parkers wrists is blue where the cuffs dug into his skin
parker sits across from madison
she places a microrecorder in the middle of the table and presses record
you actually listen to all those tapes
wryly no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you
a beat how you feeling today
a little less than yesterday
in other words par for the course
a beat how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday
i was there
i saw the whole thing
a beat if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation
youre not my therapist
youre hear to study me
face it im nothing more than a lab rat to you
thats not true parker
if i had died yesterday youd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence
a beat what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy
he was just a computer program
you didnt see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger
but i did
a beat you kind of liked it didnt you
that thrill of going over the edge again
of taking out an innocent bystander or two as long as you got the target
go to hell
it was just like before wasnt it
a beat but you are making progress
instead of killing seven people to get the one youre after this time there was only one other person involved
the guard pokes his head in with concern
the guard quickly shuts the door
madison turns to parker
i need to know what snapped in you
what made you capable of it
you have to make me understand
i dont have to do anything except survive
and its taking everything ive got just to do that
inside lindenmeyers station in letac the stunningly beautiful sheila
in very revealing lingerie
performing an outrageous striptease
seductively i hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me
reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of sheila
oh believe me it is
he is so aroused hes shaking
lindenmeyer on the other hand appears almost uninterested
hes used to the routine
on the monitor sheila
continues her striptease
licking her lips
grinding her hips
putting on quite a show
she removes her top revealing ideal breasts
she fondles her nipples
as well as the rest of herself
lindenmeyer and reilly continue watching
reilly can barely control himself
is very very very good at what she does
a virtuoso stripper
reilly is transfixed
until lindenmeyer pushes a button blacking out the virtual reality screens
shows over unless i get to see what youve been working on after hours
paranoid i havent been working on anything
threateningly do i get to see it or not
a beat bastard
to a monitor sheila dont go anywhere
ill be right back
he rushes out
appears on the various monitors next to sheila
he kisses her cheek
caresses her body
enjoys the attention
shes some of your finest work daryl
all my work is my finest
continues appreciating sheila
as reilly races back in the monitors then all go black
reilly completely out of breath holds a python by its head
he dangles the snake right in front of lindenmeyers face
backing away fast get that fucking thing away from me
such a wimp
he grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake
the half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving
but the half still in reillys hand begins regenerating a new tail
literally growing a new one
lindenmeyer cant believe his eyes
he studies the snake closely
watching your vr people auto reset gave me the idea
in awe its nanotechnology isnt it
machines the size of molecules
proudly coordinated by polymer neural net
touching the snake it feels so
its better than real
its synthetic flesh
a beat its a physiological machine
awed this is supposed to be years away
as far as the public is concerned it is
the reason you got fired and i got my second demo into production is im a lot smarter than you
i never give my best stuff away
restraining himself how do you kill it
separate the character module from the neural net
using lindenmeyers scissors he cuts off the snakes head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net
the snake stops moving
and you get nanodeath
discarding the snake dont worry ive got a bunch of other ones
i hate to say it but it is
a beat im ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile
if you want to experience the future meet me in my office in minutes
and bring the sheila
character module with you
as lindenmeyer reaches for the sheila
character module sid
appears on the screen in front of him and winks
you catching my drift
i think i understand what you have in mind
peeling the label off the sid
character module lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot
disappears from the screen
opening his office door for lindenmeyer fifteen minutes later
reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him and leads lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry
as well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons
you need a maid
what i need is a nymphomaniac
he removes a tarp from a large rectangular metallic tank with a circular window in the middle of it
clear plastic tubing which branches into hundreds of increasingly smaller and smaller branches floats in electrified fluid
the tubing is a synthetic human nervous system
reilly turns to lindenmeyer
wheres the sheila
lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module
reilly opens the incubator
reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the synthetic nervous system
the polymer neural net instantly crackles with life
it grows around the module
cells nanomechanisms immediately begin adhering to the tubing
forming the beginnings of a skeletal architecture
lindenmeyer and reilly look on through the circular window
it feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid
a beat in eight hours we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy
off lindenmeyers wicked but somewhat anxious smile we its night
light is dim
his bed is empty
the wall next to it is completely bare except for the five christmas cards sent each year by chief cox
the other two walls in the cell however look very different
they are completely covered with primitive paintings darkly colored surreal images
imagine the lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress
painted by dali
except these images were created by parker barnes
he kneels in a corner working intensely on another image
completely lost in concentration
his hands his clothing covered in paint
he almost appears to be part of the art work
the work is intricate
it clearly takes parker a very long time
which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep
which is most of them
he is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts echoing throughout the cell block
threats of the ugliest most vile kind
the kind parker has had to live with every night for the last five years
pausing to admire his work parker finally hears the taunts
his face becoming a mixture of frustration guilt and anger
parker immediately resumes painting
reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later
lindenmeyer sits off to the side looking no less anxious
its close to am
there is no liquid left in the incubator its all been absorbed
all that is visible is the silhouette of a human form crouched within steam
the form stands
the human form inside incubator opens the hatch
steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly
the figure stands within the mist admiring itself
then its surroundings
reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time
lindenmeyer hangs back
baby what im gonna do to you
his face drops when sid
steps out of the mist
lindenmeyer smiles proudly
to lindenmeyer who the hell is this
my name is sid
he extends his hand as if to shake
then grabs reilly by the throat and chokes him
what do you expect me to do thank him
gasping for air this
sure it is and its all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and daryl
he watches reillys face with curiosity as the life drains from it
a puddle forms beneath him
he drops reillys body to the floor
to lindenmeyer real instruments are so much more responsive than virtual ones dont you think
lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen
the office door is unlocked and open
s expression you realize something isnt quite right
his expression is exaggerated
only for a moment but its enough to remind you sid
is not human
the billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully coordinated fashion
is literally getting used to his new skin
in various ways throughout his life be it a wandering eye or a momentary limp you will be reminded that sid
is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen
a surgical knife by the aquarium catches sid
picking up the knife he runs his finger across the razor sharp knife blade
cutting himself slightly
a drop of blood appears
tastes his synthetic blood
tastes different somehow
he then watches with interest as his wound regenerates healing itself
the scar tissue is slightly off color
i think im going to like it here
glancing at reillys prone body he then slams the office door in our face
parker clearly just awakened is led into the room by a guard who then exits
waiting for parker are chief of police cox and elizabeth deane
to cox youre wasting your time
im not going to play any more of your goddam games
parker barnes id like you to meet crime czar elizabeth deane
not shaking hands its too early in the morning for me to be cordial
you got any coffee
i watched your simulation mr
you know youre the only one to ever go up against sid
who is still alive
only because i got pulled out early
nobody else ever got anywhere near him
understands him like you do
parker looking at her incredulously moves his index finger circularly as in get on with it already
cox opens a folder and shows parker several photographs of reilly or what was left of him
these were taken inside letac an hour ago
pretty pictures arent they
ive seen worse
name was clyde reilly
a beat letac surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building
he hands a photograph of sid
exiting letac to parker
we dont know how but sid
made himself into an android
correcting him you mean a nanotech synthetic organism
looking at the photo jesus christ
a beat can you kill it
if you can catch him
think you can do it
a beat not from in here
revealing a document this is a full pardon
it authorizes your immediate release
she slides an unsigned pardon across the table to parker making sure to stay beyond his arms reach
cox reveals a worn l
it was parkers
how would you like your old job back
to parker catch him and your records clean
what happens if i cant catch him
hasnt killed you we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence
how do you know i wont run
deane holds up a small device called a locater implant
it is the size of a dime
this is the newest technology approved for general implementation
its called a locater implant
every parolee gets one
a beat were going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life
leaning to parker if you try to run ill hunt you down and kill you myself
a beat yes or no mr
being given a crew cut by an inmate barber inside the prison barber shop
long lengths of parkers hair cover the floor
parkers face is then shaved
the majority of his face is hidden
cox and deane look on
theres already a task force out looking for lindenmeyer
every other officer in the city will be hunting sid right along with you
but only you will know hes not human
parkers expression is one of yeah that figures
she cannot see parker behind the barber
deane you wanted to see me
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology
under the authority vested in me by the president im giving you temporary reassignment
whats the assignment
youre going to put your theories to practice
im sending you into the field
the barber moves back from parker revealing his clean shaven face
it takes madison a moment to recognize him with his cleanedup appearance
double taking him quite an improvement
looking him over hair well above the collar standard l
suspiciously to deane what exactly am i going to be doing in the field
parker lies on an operating table receiving anesthesia as a surgeon drills a small hole into his skull
the surgeon inserts a minute fiber optic camera into the hole
parkers brain is displayed on a monitor
the surgeon uses the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater implant into parkers brain
looking at monitor you are right on the border of his corpus callosuni
he is under isnt he
nodding wont stop him from dreaming though
parkers rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is correct
parker is dreaming
cox and deane watch the operation through a large window
madison enters carrying a folder labelled inmate a k a parker barnes
she withdraws several photographs from the folder placing the first one in front of deane
this is parker barnes six years ago
the most decorated cop in the history of l
special investigations division
the photograph is in black and white
but as we move in closer it takes on color
as well as comes to life
resembling one of the images from parkers cell
then mutating into something else
darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues dreaming
you now realize you are seeing what he is seeing flashes of color
a splash of gold
along with some yellow
more images from parkers cell
both taking feminine form
one adult one child
this is parker with his wife and daughter
beautiful young family werent they
the bright colors melt into darker more brooding images
flashes of mens faces
melting into urban decay
this is the group of cyber anarchists parker was closing in on
melancholy turns violent
glimpses of weapons
images moving so fast its hard to tell what they are
this is what parkers wife and daughter looked like after they were kidnapped and executed
images of rage in all its forms
many of which youve already seen
making one thing now clear the paintings in parkers cell represent his life
what he was
what he lost
and what he is
this is what the cyber anarchists and two people who just happened to be in the wrong club at the wrong time looked like after parker finished with them
and finally blackness
complete and utter blackness
looking at the fifth photograph which madison has placed in front of her inside the viewing room
unfazed thats also where mr
barnes lost his arms to mathew grimes booby trap
whats your point dr
forcefully letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse
at some point he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator
the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous
not if youre with him every step of the way
the man played judge jury and executioner with eight peoples lives
he lost control and is capable of doing it again
i understand the risks involved here
but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid
and there is nobody who knows him better than you
if a situation becomes volatile you will find a way to quell it
i have complete confidence in you
as parker continues dreaming the locater implant in his head is tested
parkers location is pinpointed on an electronic map to within one inch of his present location
the hole in his skull is then stitched shut
putting on his l
uniform and badge inside a prison interrogation room
he looks very much like he did in virtual reality except for the scar on his cheek and his empty holster
cox and madison look on
to cox i dont need a babysitter
what you need is a collar
to parker shes going to help you understand what makes sid
what shes going to do is get in my way
cox hands madison a thick folder
this is the personnel file on the programmer lindenmeyer
there might be something in it you can use
she wasnt part of the deal cox
fine you want to stay here
his cellular phone rings which he answers
as he listens to the call his expression is one of growing concern
he clicks off the phone
officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple
a beat so were the first two cops to arrive on scene
their weapons missing
is now armed
wheres my gun
cox glances to madison then hands parker a
be careful with it
passing through the security checkpoints outside the prison
parker at the wheel
madison beside him
parker presents his identification to a guard then drives through the final checkpoint
madison reviews lindenmeyers file
without looking up you remember how to get to toluca lake
he glances at her then stops the car
parker gets out of the car
madison follows suit
what are you doing
he walks around the car brushing past her
then drops to his knees at the side of the road
he puts his hands in the dirt feeling the earth between his fingers
meaningfully every day for the last five years i told myself someday i would be out here again
no more bars
no more guards
no more fights just to stay alive
a beat every day for the last five years i told myself that lie
it wasnt a lie
every time i said it it was
i never really thought i was going to make it
taking a deep breath he wipes the dirt off his hands
you all right
completely at ease fine
never felt better in my life
a beat see im a good liar
he gets back in the vehicle
off madisons reaction we talking live to their cameras on the street in front of a beautiful suburban home in toluca lake which is now a crime scene
to her camera as l
officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes
parker and madison make their way through the curious trying to see whats going on
several reporters double take parker then quickly instruct their photographers to take shots of him
parker and madison present their identification to the cops keeping the curious at bay
recognizing parker son
parker and madison continue toward the house
getting an increasing amount of attention particularly from the other cops
some look on with awe
some with disdain
but nobody is in between
quietly to parker you ready for this
if i cant handle it ill just kill everybody
he gives her a brief smile
which madison does not return
one of the other policemen tentatively approaches parker
ive always wanted to tell you that if the same thing happened to me i would do the exact same thing as you if i had the balls
he extends his hand to parker who shakes it
to cop then youd be a disgrace to the badge too
he turns to parker who is looking right at him
not with anger
not with any emotion really
but its enough to scare the shit out of cop who walks away
investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable
parker and madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes
lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive
their bodies were left in similar condition to reillys
except their heads have been interchanged
parker and madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall
it reads death to the pigs
knowledgeably he was reenacting charles mansons labianca murders
manson didnt kill the first cops to arrive on the scene
whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better to improve upon what was already done
you say that like youre close personal friends
ive spent over hours interviewing him
a beat charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate
after seeing the blood bath on television he wanted to show them how it should be done
a beat the question is what does charlie have to do with sid
i know who would know
in culver city
parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street
hitting the vehicle parked in front of them
in which two undercover cops sit waiting to see if lindenmeyer returns
parker waves apologetically
sarcastically you drive well for somebody who hasnt done it in five years
he ignores her as they get out of the car
learn anything from lindenmeyers file
he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight
lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was
all he did day and night was play the violin
what happened when he was
every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers
a beat stay here
she approaches the cops who remain in their car
any sign of lindenmeyer
mind if we take a look inside
not until somebody gets a search warrant signed
i dont think theyve even found a judge yet
they all turn their heads to see parker has kicked in lindenmeyers front door and is going inside
shaking his head im gonna have to call this in
do what youve got to do
running after parker so will i
madison races through the broken front door to find parker checking his weapon
before she can speak he motions for madison to freeze and be silent
parker hears something
something moving inside the duplex
his every movement is now that of a predator
madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse
she does not handle it with confidence
parker shakes his head
quietly youve got a problem with me carrying a gun
do me one favor if you shoot at anything make sure im nowhere near it
parker bolts through the duplex storming into rooms furiously
his movements are aggressive
madison searches other rooms methodically
she is not timid
just inexperienced in the field
she passes a video camera mounted on a tripod
pointed out the window at a neighbors bathroom
dozens of cassettes surround the tripod
the labels are dated covering every day of the last month
parker and madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with their guns drawn nearly shooting each other
madison puts down her gun
parker does not
the noise persists
looking through his sight bang
he smiles wickedly and continues on
madison takes a deep breath then resumes her search
parker and madison end up its as if the information superhighway ended in here
cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software computers books folders disks and tapes
what you notice however is that all the data relates to different kinds of criminals serial killers mass murderers terrorists kidnappers rapists bombers extortionists anarchists you name it its here
the psychology of the methodology of the history of the encyclopedia of the autobiographies of human villainy
classical music and lifelike sound effects can be heard coming from a computer
this is what parker has been hearing
he holsters his sidearm
so does madison
who checks her pulse
what are you doing
clinically checking my pulse
a beat you enjoy frightening me dont you
youve studied me now im studying you
seems only fair dont you think
an animated man who resembles lindenmeyer walks peacefully through a park
he then starts killing everything in sight
men women squirrels even flowers
all to classical music
the scene immediately starts over with the man once again walking peacefully through the park
this was lindenmeyers looking around the room madison shakes her head
this lindenmeyers a real piece of work
looking at a book shelf maybe after they catch him you should write a book about him
he runs his finger along a book shelf pausing at two books in particular
their titles are understanding the criminal mind and criminal pursuit a psychological guide for law enforcement
they were written by dr
im surprised you didnt write one about me
im still working on it
noticing something on the floor she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor
you read its name maestro
remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids brains
ive been in prison remember
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho
just like they figured there was no better person to catch one
madison elects not to respond
she sits down at the computer which rests between busts of beethoven and mozart and begins typing at the computer
she works with efficiency
knowing exactly what shes doing
she is now in her element
from a shelf parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice inserted into a half eaten pudding cup
then flips through one of the books written by madison
only half interested
keeping her eyes on screen i am the demon from the bottomless pit
remembering not reading here on earth to create havoc and terror
i am war i am death
i am destruction
i am impressed
quoting for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ
who said that
a beat whats david berkowitz got to do with sid
pointing to the screen hes part of the mix
is a composite
the graphics show you that sid
was a combination of charles manson and billy the kid
you see what look like two viruses which represent each criminals psychological profile attacking each other
the result is a molten blob
berkowitz was added to create sid
a three way psychological battle more hostile than the first occurs
adding the terrorist abu nidal makes the conflict even more violent
and so on
madison stares at the computer screen in awe
parker flips through cd rom hard copies of the different versions of sid
lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain
understanding creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones
she continues opening the files of the higher versions of sid
consists of different profiles
the visualized psychological battle is intense
and extremely violent
version with profiles is even worse
its a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others
a beat the question is which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control
attempting to open the files of the composite profiles madison discovers they are protected by encryption
re lindenmeyer hell let us see the ingredients that went in but not how the soup turned out after stirring
madison scrolls through the list of names stopping at the name mathew grimes
alarm registers on her face
as parker comes over to look over her shoulder she quickly scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen
he holds the sid
cd rom in hand
this is getting you pumped up isnt it
this is like the world series to you
as a matter of fact it is
parker points to a name on the screen jeffrey dahmer
remember the bowling ball bag sid carried with him in virtual reality
dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week
kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory
cd rom we need to get a look at sid
s final profile
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof a bitch before he kills anybody else
in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick
being inserted into a disc drive inside the cal tech computer lab
very high tech
sitting at the computer is alexiev borgen s the grand old wizard of the facility
parker and madison sit next to him
around them young lindenmeyers are everywhere
remembering fondly daryl lindenmeyer was only here briefly one semester at most
but he was singularly the most brilliant student i ever had in a classroom
he created programs so beautiful so lyrical they were almost like symphonies
can you tell us whats on the disc
working the computer there is one program with approximately
million lines of programming
it is thoroughly secured which is not surprising considering lindenmeyer created it
think you can get into the program
with appreciation hard to say lindenmeyers protection mechanisms were always diabolically clever
you should see what hes been up to recently
kissing passionately inside a car parked along a deserted street in hollywood
music blares from inside the vehicle
steam on the windows partially obscures your view
as well as sid
he stares menacingly through the side window
enjoying the show
his eye momentarily wanders
the young lovers are completely oblivious
caresses the gun taken from the cops in toluca lake as if it stimulated him
to himself the dahmer part of me wants to boil you for dinner
the manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family
a beat you know what the berkowitz part of me wants to do
he raises the gun placing it against the steamed window
but does not pull the trigger
his face going through a rapid change of expression as if a battle for control of his emotions were going on
regaining control sid
lowers the gun
he stands back
craft can only become art when the creator sets his sights on something never yet achieved
a beat like an apprentice about to become a master the imitator is about to become an originator
he pockets his weapon and walks the bartender is a low tech robo tender
patrons sit quietly drinking themselves into oblivion
takes a seat next to an businessman slumped at the bar
thoughtfully ever have one of those days where you decide something important about yourself
you know where you say im not just what ive been programmed to be
i can do what i want when i want how i want because im my own person
slurring you one of them new age assholes
just a soul on a personal journey
what ive realized is that im capable of anything
i have to start expanding my horizons
the robo tender rolls over to sid
digital scratchy want
to think you constitute one of my ancestors he shoots the robotender between his mechanical eyes
the businessman smiles like hes thought about doing exactly the same thing
thinking big is fine
but you shouldnt forget where you come from either
thinks about it
long and hard
you know youre absolutely right
pointing would you mind sitting over there
he points to a table with several other businessmen
every orchestra is divided into sections
like instruments sit with like instruments
now be a good instrument and sit with your kind
he lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to the table
on which a red dot moves west along a street in los feliz
the map occupies a wall inside chief coxs office in the l
cox wallace and deane look on
what are they doing in los feliz
checking his records madison lives two blocks from their present location
why would they be going there
i dont know
i wish we could hear them
my engineers say the audio tap should be ready to field test in six months
off coxs look we parker drives through a residential neighborhood
madison points to a house on the right
not this one but the next one
the one with the bicycle out front
parker stops in front of a modest but wellkept house
ill wait out here
madison pockets the car keys then reveals a pair of handcuffs
she latches one cuff to the steering wheel and holds up the other toward parker
give me your wrist
give me a goddam break
im not going to go anywhere alone
and im going to make sure of it
not wavering give me your wrist
parker relents and holds up his wrist
madison places the cuff around it then gets out of the car
madison walks up the steps to the front porch
she is immediately intercepted by her daughter karin who bursts out of the front door and leaps into her arms
karins baby sitter opens the door for madison as she carries her daughter inside
parker stares from squad car in surprise
he had no idea madison was a mother
moments later karin comes back out and sits on the front steps
staring at parker
wondering who this strange man is and why hes sitting in a police car outside her house
but not saying a word
parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation with her
a multitude of expressions passing over his face as memories of his own daughter flash through his mind
madison sits at a desk typing quickly at a computer
via modem she connects with the l
she rifles through data concerning mathew grimes who was the leader of a cult of cyber anarchists
he was known as the charles manson of technological terrorism
from both newspaper articles and news footage the following information about him becomes clear grimes was an expert at media manipulation
he delighted in publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way
the mayor of los angeles bob bennett who offered increasingly higher rewards for grimes capture was grimes primary nemesis
special investigations division officer parker barnes managed to stop grimes from killing mayor bennett
grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating parker with false leads and lawsuits
you see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley
a note is pinned to her clothing
the note reads hey parker this grimes then kidnapped parkers wife and daughter
parker located the group in a club but only in time to witness their deaths
parker then killed everybody in the club including the six cult members and two completely innocent people
madison stares gravely into the screen
grimes you better not be the dominant
parker and karin continue staring at each other in silence
then she smiles
she wiggles her nose
then so does he
madison comes out wearing fresh clothing then kisses her daughter good night
as madison goes to the squad car karin waves good bye to parker
he does the same
karins babysitter then leads her back inside the house
madison gets in immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling from the steering wheel
parker has been free the entire time
told you i wasnt going to go anywhere
how did you get your hand out
as she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel parker wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face
sometimes i like being part machine
annoyed madison tosses him the car keys
he starts the engine and drives
why didnt you tell me you had a daughter
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life
a beat shes beautiful you know
a beat her name is karin
she turns on the police radio
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house
i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes
you should practice lying more often
youre awful at it
a beat where to
a beat sid
is no longer bound by his programming
what does that mean
now that hes in the real world there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality
sid is going to evolve
sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next
what i do know is that whatever hes becoming sid
is going to be even worse than he was before
then all we can do is stay mobile and alert
hes got to make a move sometime and weve got to be ready when he does
a beat welcome to police work
you better like coffee
he turns up the police radio
has separated the patrons into four separate groups older men and woman and younger men and woman
all are frozen in their seats with fear
points his gun at one group then another waving his arm as if he were a conductor and as if his gun were a baton
clearly enjoys this game of terror
he delights in the patrons fear and revels in his power over them
pointing at a woman you in the middle dont hold back
give it to me
he fires his gun just above her head
she screams in terror
he continues aiming his gun from face to face seeking ever increasing emotional responses from his instruments
a guy entering the bar does a quick about face
gone by the time sid
glances at the door
god i hate interruptions
to the patrons once again from the top boom
he shoots again just missing a mans foot
buying two coffees from a downtown street vendor
she returns to the squad car which is barely moving
traffic is at a near standstill because of an accident
parker drinks his coffee black
madison adds two creams two sugars
the cackling from the police radio continues unabated
i forgot what real coffee tastes like
you know considering youve only been out of prison for seven hours youre readapting quite well
a beat wait i didnt mean that the way it sounded
dont worry about it all right
dammit i hate sounding so clinical all the time
all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well but then i
i know what you meant
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them
then why dont you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while
madison stops herself from speaking
it isnt easy for her
parker cracks a faint smile
you hear the police radio
report of a possible hostage situation inside a bar on the corner of figueroa and sixth
description of the perp matches the surveillance photographs from letac taken this morning
thats only a couple blocks from here
ill meet you there
tossing his coffee out the window he opens the door
deadly serious dont get out of the car
he gets out running down the sidewalk
he flies past the cars inching down the block
a beat shit
she climbs into the drivers seat spilling hot coffee on herself
parker bolts recklessly through the downtown street
a hunter hot on the trail of his prey in an urban jungle
gently caresses the hair of a terrified young woman sitting among several others
you hear the sound of tires screeching to a halt outside
he toys with the woman pointing the gun in her face then pulling it back
her expression changes instantly
i just love how responsive you are
two cops stand in the doorway weapons aimed at sid
the cops inch closer to him
not turning around the ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission
put the gun down nice and
spins around and fires twice before he can finish his sentence
both cops receive identical wounds in their shooting arms reminding you of the wounds parker and john first received in the opening virtual reality sequence
takes a bow as if on stage
thank you ladies and gentlemen youve been a real pleasure
as he walks toward the exit he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar
has never seen his own image in the real world before
he likes what he sees
street traffic is much lighter here
exits getting into the vacant police car left by the cops
adjusts his seat
the rearview mirror
glancing at himself
then behind him
parker becomes visible racing around the corner
running like a dog whos got the scent
well look who it
a bullet spiderwebs the rear window
punches the gas taking off in a hurry
parker races after sid
firing his weapon continuously
without care for the innocent motorists nearby
they scream in absolute terror but remain unharmed
parker gives up the chase of sid
s vehicle and runs in the other direction
toward madison as she rounds the corner in their squad car
he opens the drivers side door and shoves madison over
what the hells going on
this is my area of expertise
he jumps behind the wheel flooring the accelerator
speeding through the already frightened motorists
madison is pinned to the back of her seat
looking out the window she looks at the motorists
with concern what did you do to those people
parkers vehicle speeds through city streets
gaining ground on sid
parker stops for nothing
not for red lights
not for gridlock
when the street becomes impassable he veers onto the sidewalk
parkers eyes are locked to the road with fierce determination
madisons eyes are a mixture of fear and excitement
she holds onto the door handle for dear life
being on the streets a little different than sitting in an office all day isnt it
gritting her teeth enjoying yourself
you know i am
this isnt a game parker
over police radio glad to see youre on the case officer barnes
or should i say inmate
in disbelief that who i think it is
parker turns to her then picks up the radio
into radio call me whatever you want asshole
parker accelerates even faster
closing the gap between them and sid
drives dangerously fast causing an accident around which parker must circumnavigate
hangs his head out the window
into radio the symphony of collision
the only thing i want to hear is your silence
i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison
a beat you know we have so much in common we have such history together ive been thinking we should become friends
madisons anxiety tanks are hitting capacity
into radio you and me have nothing in common
who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands
parker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel
madison cant believe he is able to carry on a conversation while driving like this
who else do you know whos been locked out of the real world for years and is now just learning to be free
a beat who else do you know is a multiple murderer just like you
madison clicks off the radio
you have nothing in common
she puts her hand to her wrist checking her pulse
shaking his head enough with your pulse already
a beat still got your gun
madison takes out her weapon
her hands are shaking
show me you can use it
s vehicle reaches absolute gridlock
nobodys going anywhere for a while
slams on the brakes and abandons the car leaving it right in the middle of the street
a traffic cop with his weapon trained on sid
from a distance
you better be a cop pal
raising his arms my badge is in my jacket
slowly reaches inside his jacket and fires his weapon through it
he only gets a hole in his jacket
the traffic cop gets a hole through his chest
god some people are stupid
he aims his weapon at parkers oncoming vehicle
madison leans out the window aiming her gun at sid
as parker speeds toward the gridlock
nail the fucker
madisons determination battles her inexperience
gets off the first shot
that was the windshield by parkers head
he ducks down driving blind
any time now
she adjusts her sights and fires again
the result is the same
whats the problem
im doing the best i can
that was sid
shooting their front left tire
parker loses control of the vehicle
parkers vehicle slams into a car stopped in front of them
air bags save parker and madison from injury but also prevent them from getting out of the car with any speed
by the time they do get out sid
is long gone
parker stares at madison with pure hatred
in the l
downtown headquarters the next morning
chief cox stares angrily at parker
madison sits next to him
behind them is a mirrored wall
reading from a list illegal search of lindenmeyer s duplex
eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed
twentyfour citizen complaints
and the calls are just starting to come in
to parker i forgot what its like to have you on the streets
any sign of lindenmeyer
he could be hiding he could be helping sid or could be in little pieces on santa monica beach
a beat any idea what sids going to do next
until we know what new influences are affecting him we cant be sure
in other words we collectively dont know shit
wallace and deane look on through the twoway mirror
deane is on the phone
re parker it makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform
a beat i will never forget the first time i saw the photos from the crime scene
hanging up the phone neither will the public
a beat the media has caught wind of his pardon
barnes starts giving me some tangible results im going to put him back in his cage
the news is in progress
a reporter continues
police now believe there to be a connection between the grisly toluca lake murders yesterday afternoon and the hostage situation which occurred last night in a downtown bar
the tv is one of many mounted above the checkout counters
customers waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the news with varying degrees of horror disgust curiosity and fear
the stronger their reaction the more sid
he is waiting in line holding a box of twinkies
eyeing the twinkies did you know those arent even baked
a beat so was i
off the cashiers look we watching the news on a pocket tv on a wooden bench that morning
both proud and horrified at the monster he has unleashed upon the world
you hear classical music in the background
lindenmeyer begins to laugh
the sounds echoing
as we pull back you realize the bench is one of many inside the hollywood bowl
lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands
he glances down at the members of the los angeles philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming performance
whatever the event is its going to be big
dozens of technicians surround the stage setting lights cameras microphones etc
for a live payperview broadcast
talking on a phone inside the cal tech computer lab
im afraid i dont have very good news
on the speakerphone inside coxs office
were you able to get into the program
but then i tripped over an erasure mine
in english please
i accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program
parker and madison turn to each other shit
it was very wellhidden
there was no way to see it until it was too late
a beat its not your fault
we appreciate you trying
look i feel bad about this so im going to try to look into the programming of his maestro teaching tool for you
holding up keyboard ive had one sitting around for years
maybe i can learn something that youll find useful
let us know
walking along a sidewalk
something in a store front catches his attention
namely his own image being captured by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk
he is standing outside a large electronics store
walks closer to the window moving into a closeup
he is captivated by his image
this is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen
dozens of tvs on display
there is a different channel on each
the audio visual bombardment is overwhelming
enters making his way to a big screen tv with the local news in progress
from the tv
commuters travelling anywhere near the biltmore hotel downtown tomorrow evening should allow themselves at least extra minutes to get home
security for the mayor bennetts reelection rally is going to be so tight that all bus and subway routes passing through the area are being rerouted
changes the channel to a different news broadcast
parkers folsom county prison i
photograph is shown alongside a photograph of madison from one of her book covers
to the tv dont you two make a pretty couple
the news broadcast zooms in on parkers picture
wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face
we really do have so much in common
but i refuse to be upstaged
he changes the channel back to the first news broadcast
a reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where sid
had terrified the patrons
turns to the other customers in the store
most of them are watching other channels
he goes over to a control pad on a counter and presses several buttons
now every tv in the store has the news with the reporter outside the bar on
a skinhead sporting numerous nazi swastika tattoos manually changes the channel on one of the tvs to a dodger baseball game
walks over to the skinhead and changes the channel back to the news
you dont wanna fuck with me man
he moves to the next tv over and changes the channel to the baseball game
moves over with him standing directly behind the skinhead as if also interested in the dodgers
singing softly take me out to the ball game
take me out for the fun
he places his hands on the skinheads head and efficiently snaps his head around breaking his neck
buy me some peanuts and cracker jack
i dont care if i ever come back
he drops the skinhead to the floor never once taking his eyes off the tv
a dodger game is in progress
a pop fly is caught by the center fielder
the runner at third tags and heads for home
the play at the plate is close
the umpire calls the runner out
the camera pans to the massive screen over left field to show the instant replay
reactions of fans around the stadium are shown in closeup
the fans also respond to seeing themselves on the massive screen
watches the tv intently completely ignoring the horrified customers circling around him because of the dead skinhead at his feet
a salesman whod been demonstrating a videocamera tapes sid
from behind a customer
realizes hes being videotaped his entire face seems to light up
playing directly to the camera he clearly loves being in the spotlight
its suddenly as if hes had years of training
he is completely at ease
and simply captivating
direct address im sorry i cant do more for you
pointing to the skinhead public service really isnt my forte
he walks into an extreme close up and kisses the lense
then reaches out of frame to help the increasinglyshaky salesman steady the camera
but rest assured
a beat a star is born
we pull back to reveal youre now watching a recording of sid
on videotape along with parker madison and a dozen other cops inside the electronics store an hour later
the tape is rewound
to parker whatever he was doing here was only the start
start of what
i dont know yet
what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale not decreasing
a beat whatever it is he isnt finished
she moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back
madison studies sid
recorded but rest assured
a beat a star is born
to another cop you mind playing that part again
her request is obliged
freeze it there she stares at sid
who is looking directly at her
as if to sid
youve discovered media havent you
you like the attention
you like being a star
what are you going to do next star
what are you going to
her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen where onlookers are visible watching sid
their faces blurry
but even out of focus it isnt hard to recognize lindenmeyer
as if to lindenmeyer you do like to watch dont you
to the surrounding cops if any of you are looking for daryl lindenmeyer thats him
she points to lindenmeyer then makes her way over to parker whos standing exactly where sid
was when he killed the skinhead
parker does not look at madison
his eyes are fixed on the tv in front of him
its not just sid
s performances that are increasing
stars need bigger and bigger audiences
a beat whatever sid is going to do next its going to involve media
you like baseball
the baseball game continues
players take the field at the start of a new inning
the outfielders cant help but glance at the beautiful woman being shown in close up on the massive screen over left field
ill tell you whoevers operating the stadiums closedcircuit cameras must have fallen in love because that beauty in j section has been on the stadiums big screen for over a
he grabs a police radio from a nearby officer
urgently into radio this is officer parker barnes
get every able body you can to dodger stadium j section
what the hells going on
re tv live execution
on the massive screen over left field the woman in close up looks embarrassed trying to forget her face is now feet high for all the other fans to see
thats enough with the close up already mr
even the players are starting to get distracted
the players on the field are all looking up at the massive screen
the womans face appears on various monitors
the phone rings
no one answers it
the room appears to be empty
the stadiums closed circuit tv director is not in his chair
hes lying dead on the floor
the closedcircuit camera remains focused on the woman
the camera is locked off
its operator lies dead beside it
can be seen arriving next to the woman
he gently caresses her hair
stands in front of the womans boyfriend who sits next to her
you make a better door than a window buddy
keep it moving
picks him up out of his seat and throws him three rows ahead
then puts hands around the womans throat
over left field the woman attempts to scream as sid
no sound comes out
react with horror
but nobody turns away
somebody stop him
rush from all parts of the stadium toward j section
enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he chokes the life out of the woman
to the camera hey parker this ones for you
his words echo around the stadium as he snaps the womans neck
he then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him
thats all folks
he leaps over a railing rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area
climbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel
weapon in hand
he draws a bead on sid
a bullet rips through sid
blood begins to seep from the wound
but then immediately begins to retract
once his blood has returned his skin heals over the wound
leaving a scar
which also then disappears
other than the hole in his shirt sid
is as good as new
he never even misses a step as he disappears around the corner
stares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades
i nailed the sonof abitch
i put a hole right through him
in j section start moving away from the area as fast as they can
parents clutching their children
climbing over seats
shoving anyone in their way
ladies and gentlemen please try to stay calm
everyone just keep your seats
fans all over the stadium start charging toward the exits
people bolt through the turnstiles running away from the stadium as l
squad cars approach in the distance
the car in the lead is parkers
parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto the street
madison braces herself
parker jams on the brakes with both feet
parker comes within inches of mowing down several people who keep right on running
parker jumps out of the vehicle scanning faces
in predator mode
madison gets out clearly shaken
parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance
a guy in dodger baseball cap and jacket
walking calmly away from the stadium
he descends down an escalator into a recently built subway station
it is sid
charges after him
a heatseeking missile locked on target
she does the best she can to follow after him
people knock into parker as hard as he does them
a human version of bumper cars
reaching the entrance to the subway parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time
madison remains in his wake
parker and madison hop the turnstiles
only to be stopped by a remotecontrolled boxshaped robotic sentry which is identical to one you have seen before
this sentry was one of reillys creations at letac
male authoritarian stop
you are in violation of
parker spits in the robots electronic eye
temporarily blinding it as well as the guy operating it via remote control
parker and madison make their getaway as the robotic sentry struggles to clean off his eye
real effective security
you could have just flashed him your badge you know
authority still makes me nervous
they come to a fork one tunnel goes to east west trains the other to north south
he races down the tunnel to the north south trains
madison heads down the other
her determination beginning to win out over her inexperience
hesitates at the escalator leading to the south bound side of the tracks
further down the tunnel is the escalator to the northbound trains
parker chooses the escalator closest to him
passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted above them
except for parker who scans the crowd
then across the tracks
in the entire crowd there is only one person not watching the tv screen
he is watching parker
through his gun sight
pulls the trigger
parker dives to the ground just avoiding the bullet
he scrambles behind a pillar for protection
only to see the guy standing behind him wasnt as lucky
madison hears the gunshot echo through the station
which scares the already terrified fans trying to get away from dodger stadium
chaos is rapidly becoming pandemonium
she races up the escalator taking out her weapon
peeking out from behind the pillar on the south bound platform
passengers rush in every direction
some are screaming
some are crying
nobody knows who fired the shot
or where to go
but everyone is going somewhere
who makes his way through the flurry of movement toward the up escalator
it is difficult to keep sight of him
moves toward the edge of the platform aiming his gun across the tracks
those around him quickly back away
yelling everybody get down
only about half the passengers on the northbound side can hear him above the screaming already going on
is nowhere to be seen
screaming the rest of the passengers hit the deck except for a college student listening to music on headphones
he is riding the escalator up
stands behind him using the student as a shield
ascends slight portions of his body are momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the music coming from his headphones
parker does not have a clean shot
in seconds sid
will disappear from view completely and parker will have no shot at all
a momentary sliver of sid
an inch and a half at most
he lines up his shot and pulls the trigger
the college student standing in front of sid
gets winged in the shoulder
not a serious wound but a painful one just the same
the bullet must have hit bone because it deflected upon impact missing sid
the student drops to the escalator screaming in pain
crouches beside him
yelling whats wrong convict your arms need adjusting
or maybe its your head
maybe you arent ready to be back out in the real world yet
the top of sid
s head is exposed an inch maybe two
moving closer and closer to the edge of the platform trying to get a better angle while he still has a shot
parker moves to the very edge of the platform
his arm extended out over it
completely oblivious to rocketing into the station toward the south bound platform
leaps off the descending escalator on the southbound side and rushes to parker
she pulls parker back just before the train reaches him
had his arm still been raised parker would have lost his arm a second time
they tumble to the floor
a passenger rushes to madison
pointing to parker lady you gotta stop him
hes gone crazy
he just shot an innocent bystander
forcefully to parker what were you shooting at
parker gets to his feet
madison doesnt take her eyes off him
he did i saw it
to madison sids getting away
he heads toward the up escalator
his back now to madison
she aims her gun at him
dont make me shoot you not looking back if youre gonna do it better do it now
he keeps right on going up the escalator
lines up her shot
with both fear and determination
her finger presses down on the trigger
but she cant do it
she chases after him
madison looks in both directions as she gets off the escalator
parker is nowhere to be seen
moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student who clutches his bleeding shoulder
he is shivering
going into shock
madison goes to him taking off his headphones
let me help you
he collapses in her arms
delirious what did i do
i didnt do anything
clearly versed in emergency medical treatment madison attends to his wound
breathlessly i lost him
wait for me above ground
the chaos outside dodger stadium has subsided
madison and two paramedics lead the bandaged college student to an ambulance
madison goes to parker who sits quietly by himself
elbows on his knees
head between his hands
staring at the cement between his feet
angrily do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through
parker doesnt respond
all around them a cacophony of news broadcasts is heard
from passing cars
from boom boxes
from portable tvs
over and over you hear what sid
had said while killing the woman in dodger stadium recorded hey parker this ones for you
hey parker this ones for you
as parker raises his head slowly you realize you are looking at the face of a wild animal
violence about to erupt
the beast within has been unleashed
in a whisper thats grimes
madison backs away in fear
parker rises gradually
voice slowly rising the man who killed my wife
who killed my daughter
who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line
parker advances toward madison who continues backing away
exploding grimes is back
hes come back
standing her ground no
grimes isnt back
hes only one part of sid
is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was
a beat get a hold of yourself
she tries to grab him by the shoulders
parker blocks her arms away
going nosetonose but hes in there
and you knew it didnt you
she tries to back away but backs herself against a light pole
madison has nowhere to go
parker grabs her by the collar and shoves her against the pole
hysterical god you fucking know it all
youve known all along and didnt tell me
were you afraid id lose it
go over the edge
is that what you were afraid of
a prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them fast
two of the prison guards met earlier jump out of the transport advancing on parker
their weapons aimed at his head
parker slowly raises his hands in the air
a guard relieves him of his weapon
recovering whats going on
hes going back where he belongs
deane and cox step out of the police vehicle
to madison you were right dr
letting a lunatic like barnes loose in the real world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public
glancing at cox i should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another
to madison chief cox will give you a ride back to the station
you will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far
to parker enjoy the rest of your sentence mr
cox and parker stand facing each other
cox wishes there was something he could do
parker looks completely out of it
cox extends his hand
after a moment parker takes it
but his mind is way off elsewhere
forcefully to parker lets go
madison looks on as parker is herded roughly into the back of the prison transport
parker shuts her up with a look
there is nothing that can be said
the prison transport doors are slammed shut
the vehicle takes off
cox and madison head back toward l
they are in midconversation with regret i should have told him
dont blame yourself
in your shoes i dont think i would have told parker either
a beat so do you think grimes has become the dominant personality
im not sure
my guess is thats what sid wants us to think
a beat you think hes smart
captain im afraid of how smart sid
a beat but im even more afraid of whats hes becoming
comes to a stop at a traffic light
parker sits alone in the darkness
until the sound of two gunshots piercing the transports front windshield shatters the silence
what the hells going on
he scrambles to the front of the compartment pressing his face against the steel mesh of the fourinch portal
two bullet holes are visible in the windshield
the two prison guards lie dead in their seats
s eyes appear looking directly at you
neighborly hey old buddy old pal good to see you again
parker goes absolutely berserk
viciously punching the steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his knuckles is shredded
im going to now is that any way to talk to an old buddy
i mean just because im carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesnt mean we cant be friends
he savagely hurls himself against his confines
dont try this at home
im sorry the party youre trying to reach is not answering
is there anyone else you would like to talk to
a beat you really are pathetic you know that
mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet
he is nothing compared to me
parker is completely spent
mentally and physically
he slumps in a corner
out of breath
all he can do is stare out through the portals mesh at sid
you could say thankyou you know
im giving you your freedom short lived though it may be
a beat a little known fact about the locater implants prison inmates now receive upon release is that they contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin
the satellite they use to track you can also trigger release of the toxin with microwaves
after transmission the implants host dies within seconds
a beat it wont take long for them to get your termination authorized once they learn of your escape
now who would you rather go after killer them or me
he releases the rear door lock
parker bursts out of the back of the prison transport charging after sid
who is nowhere to be seen
parker runs in one direction
then the other
and changes his mind again
he literally does not know which way to turn
an aide rushes through the door to cox whos briefing deane and wallace on what he has learned
parker barnes just escaped from the prison transport
both of the guards are dead
the aide exits
to deane barnes wouldnt kill two innocent guards
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room but not two prison guards
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife
to his daughter
with conviction i will stake my reputation that barnes didnt kill those guards
you already have staked your reputation
a beat mayor bennett and i have been friends a long time
since grimes tried to kill him it doesnt take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that sid
might go after him too
a beat bennetts re election rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose
to wallace the fail safe online yet
online and at your disposal
to deane what failsafe
approaching wallace this had better work mr
wallace exits the room
cox has no idea what is going on
and deane is not about to tell him
madison enters wearily late afternoon
exhausted from the events of the last two days she starts to undress
her clothing is filthy
so is her skin
she could use a good shower and a better massage
madison examines the various cuts and bruises shes received along the way
not exactly war wounds but to somebody used to sitting behind a desk they are
she absentmindedly turns on the television then goes into her bathroom
madison looks at her face in the mirror
shes looked better
after splashing cold water on her face she comes to the same conclusion
madison takes two aspirin
and then two more
wishing they would take effect immediately
finally hearing the news on the tv her entire demeanor changes instantly
madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of parkers escape from the prison transport
grabbing a handful of clothes she bolts urgently out the door
speeding recklessly through city streets in her car
she doesnt stop for red lights
not for grid lock
not for nothing
she is also still finishing getting dressed
ignoring the warnings of several cops walking toward their vehicles madison speeds toward the front entrance
she barely stops in time
madison races through the bustling facility
looking for somebody
she finally finds cox coming out of his office
urgently there is no way parker killed those guards
i think we both know who did
a beat whats so urgent
i need your help taking him by the arm she leads him into an elevator going down just before its doors close
the look on coxs face tells you madison has explained the situation to him
he is furious
why didnt anybody tell me
i dont set policy
a beat you have the key
he takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain access to a subterranean floor
angrily this is a police department
ill be damned if this is going to go on without my knowledge
they exit quickly
cox leads madison cox leads in madison and takes her to the subterranean power supply
he points to the floors numerous circuit breakers
give me seconds then flip every switch you can reach
the room is still under construction
wallace stands behind a technician sitting at a console in front of a massive electronic map tracking several convicts including parker
the technician is typing in an elaborate termination code
who are we going to fry
just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor
cox enters concerning wallace
what are you doing here sir
just paying my last respects
he surveys the electronic map locating parker
just as the lights go black
wallace and the technician immediately panic
i dont know
weve lost all power
the heats been causing brown outs all over the city
get above ground until its restored
wallace and the technician rush out of the room up the emergency stairs
cox sets to work ripping out the consoles circuitry
by the time hes finished the equipment in here wont be able to toast a piece of bread
which reads linda davis barnes and christine mary barnes
parker kneels in front of it
madison and cox wind their way to him through obstacle course of tombstones
parker stands as they arrive
he is wiped out
there is no emotion left in him
we know you didnt kill those guards
theyre going to fry me for it anyway
nobodys going to fry anybody
he approaches holding the circuits he ripped out of the locator transmission room
re circuits dont worry they have no idea where you are
how could you let them put the implant in my head
he didnt know about the neural toxin
a beat i did
matter of factly you knew the entire time
can you give me one good reason why i shouldnt kill you right now
she saved your life parker
she didnt have to but she did
turning to madison then i guess were even
a beat how did you find out about the toxin
told me after he killed the two guards
he suggested i kill you rather than him
youre not capable of it
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public remember
i was wrong
a beat and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid
i should have told you
i wont make the same mistake again
she means it
parker turns away looking at his wifes headstone
the sonofa bitch is still out there parker
parker turns toward him slowly
emotion beginning to return to his face
a beat when this is over will you get this goddam thing out of my head
on my life i promise you i will
if youre lying ill hunt you down and kill you myself
the human foreman presses a remote control detonator
an explosion occurs inside a buildings foundation stock footage
the building is levelled instantly
whos been watching the explosion approaches the foreman
who the hell are you
someone who appreciates the artistic value of highexplosives
he shoots the foreman in the chest
relieves him of his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed
carrying a crate of c high explosives out of the shed in the construction sight minutes later
he adds it to the dozen crates already loaded in a truck
and takes off
secures several crates of c to an automated sewer cleaning vehicle
he schedules its start time hours from now
it is now pm
the bombs timer is set to detonate minutes into the vehicles journey at pm tomorrow night
admiring his work you think you know me but you dont have any idea who i really am
sight of mayor bennetts upcoming re election rally cox supervises an army of l
officers who are securing the area
nothing is being left to chance
anyone doing anything within yards of the building is searched including the reporters and their camera crews covering the conventions security
survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of pedestrians two blocks away
both are disguised in hats and different clothing
you dont immediately recognize them
the rallys a little obvious as a target dont you think
i told you before grimes liked to be obvious
part of him is
various faces in the crowd on the sidewalk
in the vehicles passing on the street
on the bridge crossing the street down the block further away from the hotel
if we find sid lindenmeyer wont be far behind
think hes keeping track of his creation
that or living through him
puts down his binoculars
madison does not
im not sure
on the bridge
the guy at the payphone
she points to what shes looking at
looking through his binoculars he still cant see what she means
she helps him aim his binoculars
he scans the bridge
finally settling on sid
who is talking on a payphone
parker looks up from his binoculars
a beat thanks
they move briskly down the block toward the bridge
quickly climbing a set of stairs
parker and madisons movement catches the attention of several snipers
well look who we have here
into radio parker barnes is heading south toward the bridge
if anybody can get a clean shot at him take it
hears the order over his radio headset
he races toward the bridge
as do a dozen other cops
talks into the payphone
be a reporter figure it out for yourself
all im going to tell you is that at tomorrow night i will become legendary
reach the top of the stairs
remains on the phone his back toward parker and madison
they split up winding their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus
as the bus pulls to the stop the awaiting passengers move toward the opening doors
obscuring parkers view of the payphone
parker shoves his way through the crowd only to see sid
holding madison in front of him his gun to her head
parker trains his weapon at sid
he doesnt have a clean shot
to parker brings back memories doesnt it
parkers chest is put into the cross hairs as the bus pulls away from the stop
he is focused on parker and parker only
is some yards away on a rooftop
his rifle is mounted on a tripod
his aim is perfectly steady
into his radio headset say goodbye parker barnes
parker stands frozen staring at sid
through his gun sight
looking for just an inch of him to stick out from behind madisons terrified face
to parker i wouldnt pull the trigger if i were you whys that
cox advances toward sid
from the side of the bridge
coxs gun out and ready
his finger on the trigger
hey sid what were you planning on doing with the c
turns his head in surprise toward cox as a rifle is fired in the distance
cox steps directly in the snipers line of fire and takes the bullet meant for parker through the chest
cox drops to the bridge
he rushes to cox
parker drops to his knees cradling coxs head
cox isnt long for this earth
looking up to parker he tries to talk
but nothing comes out
compassionately dont worry i know
coxs eyes roll back in his head
parker then closes them and gently lays his head on the sidewalk
parker turns his head toward sid
whos released madison and is jumping over a railing to the street feet below
parker rushes to the railing
lands on top of a garbage truck passing beneath the bridge
the garbage truck disappears beneath the bridge
a dozen cops advance toward parker
parker ignores them
he bolts across the street moving in the same direction as the bus below
through speeding traffic
parker keeps charging
right in front of a moving van barreling across the bridge
the cops lose sight of parker
think he made it
parker dives onto the sidewalk avoiding the speeding van by inches
getting to his feet he launches himself up and over the railing
the garbage truck passes beneath parker as he leaps from the bridge
parker lands on the back of the truck
right next the opening and closing steel jaws of the trucks massive trash compactor
his gun tumbles from his hand falling to the street
dives on top of parker putting him flat on his stomach
and his face against the steel teeth
i have to tell you i do enjoy you parker
i really dont want to have to kill you
the sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck
who had been on the bridge charging down the steps after the garbage truck which can no longer be seen
madison walks calmly behind them
scanning the crowd
looking for lindenmeyer
her every instinct telling her hes here
he must be
she spots him
veering from the direction the cops headed in madison casually wades into the crowd
she takes out her weapon and stops behind lindenmeyer
even in disguise he looks familiar
madison puts her gun against his back
whispering into his ear i figured youd show up sooner or later
parker and sid
continue battling next to the compactors lethal jaws
the machine makes an awful grinding sound
not unlike the sounds parker and sid
the fight is primal
and moving at miles per hour
was cox talking about
let me put it to you this way
whether im here
or whether im not
im leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night
where did you plant the c
he should concentrate more on fighting and less on asking questions because hes losing
parker takes a wicked shot to the face and then the groin
holds parkers head between the compactors jaws
which are closing
with every last ounce of effort he has parker hurls his legs up into sid
which throws sid
into the compactor
the steel jaws immediately close in on sid
who frantically tries to climb out
he gets his hands out
then his head
but thats about it
without emphasizing graphic detail sid
his lifeless body drops back into the compactor
his head tumbles to the street
the force of the impact causes the sid
character module to separate from the neural net
the character module scatters into the street
parker immediately jumps off the truck after it
parkers landing isnt pretty
finally getting to his feet he sees the sid
character module is about to be run over
parker dives for it nearly getting run over himself
the approaching car screeches to a halt next to him
its driven by lindenmeyer
madison sits behind him her gun to his head
the car behind them obviously wasnt prepared to stop so quickly
the bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined
neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon
madison pulls lindenmeyer roughly out of the car
she drags him to parker who is still on his knees clutching the sid
sirens approach in the distance
to parker find out anything
a bombs going off tomorrow night but i have no idea where
a beat there is only one way to get any more information out of sid
they scan the area for a new mode of transport
and find one stopped at a dumpster down the block the garbage truck
parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation worker while madison motions lindenmeyer into the cab with her gun
as parker climbs up to her madison shuts the door to give them a moment of privacy
can i ask you something
with a smile you mean theres something you havent asked me
a beat youve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon
you stopped sid
and youve got his module
youre free to go right now
a beat why are you going to do this
you dont know
shaking her head thats why im asking
because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what im capable of
and what im not
a beat and better than anyone else i am capable of stopping sid
parker lands on the back of the truck
right next the openingandclosing steel jaws of the trucks massive trash compactor
his gun tumbles from his hand falling to the street
this sequence is identical to the one you previously witnessed
it is as if weve jumped back in time
dives on top of parker putting him flat on his stomach
and his face against the steel teeth
i have to tell you i do enjoy you parker
i really dont want to have to kill you
the sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck
parker and sid
battle next to the compactors lethal jaws
the machine makes an awful grinding sound
not unlike the sounds parker and sid
the fight is primal
and moving at miles perhour
was cox talking about
let me put it to you this way
whether im here
or whether im not
im leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night
where did you plant the c
he should concentrate more on fighting and less on asking questions because hes losing
parker takes a wicked shot to the face and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his gun
still manages to put parkers head between the compactors jaws
which are closing
with every last ounce of effort he has parker hurls his legs up into sid
which throws sid
into the compactor
frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as the steel jaws close in on him
he gets his hands out
then his head
except parker now does something different
just before sid
is decapitated parker jams a metal rod between the compactors steel teeth
then grabs sid
by the throat
fiercely you cant die until you tell me where the c is
where is it
he slams the back of his head into parkers nose
parker reels back in pain
squeezes out from within the steel teeth
the jagged metal cutting into him striping him with blood
the blood then begins to retract
s wounds once again heal themselves
too bad you cant regenerate
as the truck slows at an intersection he jumps to the street
parker goes after him
still in excruciating pain
we pull back to reveal what you are seeing is the scene continues seamlessly
as you may now be guessing the monitor is connected to the simulator parker lies unconscious on a bed
he is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap just like he was before
character module is plugged into the systems main console
lindenmeyer sits at the controls
madison next to him her gun aimed at lindenmeyers head
they are both watching parker chase sid
on the monitor in front of them
parker continues experiencing intolerable pain
a clock reads am
they are the only ones inside the entire facility
i told you this would work
by setting back the clocks he has absolutely no idea hes in virtual reality
he still thinks hes in the real world
a beat whats wrong with parker
innocently how should i know
getting an idea show me his physical sensory level
she clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against lindenmeyers ear
he does as told
on a panel by the console you read participant physical sensory level
i wonder how that
turn it down
lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to
parker immediately returns back to normal
his pace picks up
he starts closing the gap between him and sid
as he races into a shopping mall
the place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping
an atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh
rushes up the escalators
going up to the second floor
then the third
parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator
throwing people out of his way
which is also the highest sid
veers out of view
parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor
is nowhere to be seen
parker searches methodically
he finally spots sid
who has parkers head lined up perfectly in his gun sight
parker is a sitting duck
parker dives behind affluent shopper
who takes a bullet in his ascot
parker quickly grabs him and uses his body as a shield against sid
s constant gunfire until parker arrives behind a marble column
surprised at parkers ruthlessness we really arent that different are we
what he cannot see is that behind the column affluent shopper
is auto resetting
parker puts his gun to the shoppers head
whispering dont move and dont make a sound
nods his head repeatedly
parker collects himself behind the column then pivots out from behind it
firing in sid
each bullet finds its mark
absorbing the blows sid
backs up against the atrium railing
taking one final shot he falls backward
over the railing
tumbles through the atrium
out of control
speeding toward the ground seven floors below
the sense of momentum is exhilarating
if you get dizzy easily close your eyes
falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you
a pound rock
he lands face down in the marble floor
the impact is bone crushing
does not move
until he begins to regenerate
his fluids begin returning to his body
his bones regaining proper form
within seconds his body appears as good as new
technically because this is vr the proper term would be auto
but since sid
thinks hes in the real world regenerating is what he thinks hes doing
stands dusting himself off
man what a rush
yelling up to parker adios amigo
grabbing his gun he takes off out of the lobby
parker retrieves his gun then bolts down the escalators
madison and lindenmeyer watch parker on screen
madison still has her gun trained on lindenmeyer who notices a warning light start to flash
he turns to parkers unconscious body lying on the bed
lindenmeyer looks concerned
lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console
hes developing a hemisphere imbalance
talk so i can understand
if i dont adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving he wont be able to walk when i take him out of then fix
as lindenmeyer moves to parker madison stays right with him
her gun aimed at lindenmeyers head
lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from parkers skull cap
before removing another he looks for a safe place to put the connector
i need you to hold this
it cant get any dirt on it
madison is reluctant but doesnt know what else to do
lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free hand
all you have to do is hold the needle at the base
just make sure not to jab yourself with the point
she clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun with her right
lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector from parkers skull
holding this second needle at the base lindenmeyer makes several adjustments on the neural management computer then moves slowly back to madison
hand me the connector nice and
he suddenly jabs his neural connector into madisons right forearm
madison has no time to react
volts of electricity instantly courses through her body
madison drops to the floor unconscious
the needle she had been holding falls from her grasp breaking the circuit
she stops being electrocuted
which saves her life
had said god some people are stupid
he sits back down at the simulators main console and starts to type commands
on the monitor parker is visible exiting the shopping mall
parker races out the door
that was left knee cap
he tumbles to the street
his gun flying from his hand
parker crawls desperately toward his weapon
but not fast enough
arrives at the weapon first
so close and yet so far
he kicks the weapon down the sidewalk then points his gun at parkers head
its really too bad you have to miss the grand finale
i thought you liked me being in the audience
dont you want me to see it
pauses to think about it
considering the idea you know i do want you to see it
he shoots parker in his other knee cap rendering both of his legs useless
i want you to have a birds eye view
a story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of earthquakes
the view is incredible
you can see from the pacific to downtown
from lax to the hollywood bowl
smog must be getting better in the near future
ties parker to a chair at the roofs very edge
he is facing downtown
including the biltmore hotel the location of mayor bennetts reelection rally
there you go best seat in the house
with some surprise you are going after mayor bennett
lets just say im sending a very clear message to his reelection rally
he walks toward an open stairway door behind them
arent you going to watch with me
ive got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch he stops suddenly
time is moving backwards
pauses then goes over to parker and checks his watch
it is also moving backwards
a smile of realization spreads slowly across sid
s face as he admires the beautiful sky above him
as if to god thank you daryl
turning to parker you had me going for quite a while there sport
what are you talking about
i really did think i was still in reality
at least until now
looking upward beam me up scotty
his body disintegrates before your eyes
its electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud
which disappears from view
yelling madison get me out of here
lindenmeyer watches parker scream on the monitor
madison remains unconscious on the floor behind him
to the monitor shes taking a nap at the moment
he types a set of instructions into the console and hits but dont worry
you wont be alone for very long
fairly soon youll be dead
he removes the sid
character module from its slot and exits the station
one side of parkers chair gradually starts to rise
parker looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath his chair
this could only happen in virtual reality
in a matter of minutes he is going to be thrown over the roofs edge
the next stop is feet down
parkers screams for help echo throughout the facility
but there is no one there to hear him
the garbage truck is parked in a loading dock
lindenmeyer climbs awkwardly onto the truck then into the compactor
lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon sid
s headless body
the polymer neural net visible within its neck
lindenmeyer inserts sid
s character module into its gelatinous base
but nothing happens
come on live
the synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life
growing around the module
forming the beginnings of a new head
sitting precariously on the increasingly uneven roof of the hollywood tower in virtual reality
unable to break free of his binds he rocks the chair onto its side
he and the chair fall to the roof which will keep him from falling to his death for another minute if hes lucky
madison still unconscious on the floor finally stirs
maybe parkers screaming is finally reaching her
or at least starting to
lindenmeyer looks on with awe as sid
grows a new head right before your eyes
youve never seen anything like it
s resulting head is slightly off center
his skin tone isnt perfect nor is his color but at least its functional
admires himself in a broken mirror
i am beautiful arent i
of course you are
wades through the trash toward lindenmeyer
how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time daryl
help me get out of here
he reaches out to give lindenmeyer a hand then grabs him by the throat
lindenmeyer cant believe what is happening
are you doing
takes lindenmeyers face gently in his hands
you made me a composite of of the most vicious people who ever lived
a beat what do you think im doing
im begging you
please dont kill me
reassuringly dont worry
through me you will live forever
as lindenmeyer begins to scream we hanging on by his fingertips to the bulbous roof of the hollywood tower
hes going to fall at any second
of someone entering lindenmeyers station in letac
you cant tell who it is at first
but you can see the person is male
and wearing lindenmeyers pants
you now see the person is sid
madison forces herself into consciousness
or as close to it as she can get
her expression is one of complete and utter terror
carter ive been hoping wed get a moment together
mustering her strength she manages to crawl behind several of the computers which make up the simulator
advances calmly toward her
you know so much about me i was hoping to learn a little bit about you
you see im doing research too
he looks behind the computers where you last saw madison
she is no longer there
begins searching for her
he passes a virtual reality monitor on which parker can be seen clinging for life
to the monitor hang in there parker
on the monitor parker looks all around him trying to determine the voices origin
madison crawls out of lindenmeyers station
just catches sight of her and goes after her
madison crawls into a darkened engineers station and hides
she is still very dizzy
and trying to keep the sound of her breathing to a minimum
a hunter on the prowl
moving very slowly
then lunging very swiftly
he continues the hunt
if madison is discovered she doesnt have a prayer
her heart pounds
her forehead perspires
is getting closer
checks inside closets
anywhere large enough for a human being to fit
he is practically standing over her
how does it feel to know youre going to die
what are you thinking about
lights in the building suddenly come on
several engineers can be heard entering
its am the start of a new day
the facility is quickly becoming populated
after giving one last look around sid
reluctantly gives up the hunt and exits
madison does not move until she is certain sid
has left the building
madison scrambles out of her hiding place
finally losing his grip on the roof of the hollywood tower in virtual reality
he plummets with accelerating speed
madison bursts through the partition around lindenmeyers station
sacrificing her body
without regard for pain
parker tumbles toward the sidewalk stories below
the speed is terrifying
madison leaps over a table
diving for the simulators return button
parker falls faster
the street just beneath him
the instant before he slams into the street his body de madison keeps pressing the return button over and over making sure it worked
parkers eyes flutter as he returns to consciousness
madison rushes to him
shaking out the cobwebs i think so
looking over her bruises more or less
my guess is dead
i dont know
several engineers peek in curiously at them
lets get out of here
she helps parker to his feet
at a payphone outside a minimall
could be any one of the in los angeles
its late morning
on the phone elizabeth deane please
tell her its parker barnes
elizabeth deane picks up the phone
barnes where the hell have you been
trying to find out where the bomb is
where the hell have you been
what did you find out
call off the manhunt looking for me
i didnt kill the transport guards
its already been called off
witnesses confirmed you werent the shooter
a beat did you find out where the bomb is
no but ive confirmed the reelection rally is the target
a beat how much c is missing
enough to level an entire city block
if i were you id get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel
with frustration demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel
i dont know where
interrupting sid is smart enough to know youd check everywhere in the immediate area
whatever the device is hes probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates
a beat have the demo teams check every subway tunnel water pipe gas pipe and sewer pipe that goes under over or into the arena
you know how much man power youre talking about
youre the highest law enforcement official in the country
use the fucking army if you need to
he hangs up the phone
checking every subway tunnel water pipe gas pipe and sewer pipe that goes under over or into dallas arena
the effort is massive
the clock is ticking
the area has been converted into a security checkpoint
entrants are carefully scanned onebyone
we hear the rally security is on extreme alert
tension is very high
parker madison and deane look on anxiously
they listen to a radio scanner monitoring the conversations between the demolitions teams
to parker this better not be a wild goose chase
or what youll authorize my death a second time today
sharply dont forget convict if this psycho isnt stopped you go right back to rotting in a prison cell
give him a break would you
from scanner this is demo team leader
i think we just found what weve been looking for
a threeman demolition team slowly carefully disarms the bomb sid
had secured to the automated sewer cleaning vehicle
one wire at a time
the work is very delicate
one wrong move and its all over
one more and were home free
the three members of the demo team look up proudly to each other
breathing sighs of relief
parker madison and deane remain glued to their scanner
from scanner hey folks its time to crack open a cold one
cheers are heard around the area from the other cops whod been listening in
then again maybe we ought to hold off for just a second
with concern into radio whats the problem
the team leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had been taped to the timing mechanism
written in handwriting you read hey parker the fun is only starting
the good news is were finished here
the bad news is
deane stares at parker with disbelief
deanes aide holding a cellular phone approaches parker
youve got a phone call
parker grabs the phone
expecting it to be sid you son ofabitch im going to kill you
through phone me
what did i do
alexiev borgen sits with a dismantled maestro keyboard in front of him
a beat im sorry i thought you were somebody else
ive discovered something about lindenmeyer maestro teaching tool i thought you should know
a beat the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident
the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose
lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it
turning to madison i know who the dominant personality is
a beat lindenmeyer
madisons reaction is one of panic
she bolts toward their squad car with all the speed she has
parker chases after her
where the hell are you going
lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had
she gets into the drivers seat
parker the passengers
madison punches the gas
the members of the l
philharmonic tune up for the evenings payperview extravaganza
several teenage musicians sit with them
lights cameras and production trucks are all over the place
this really is going to be one hell of a show
joining the los angeles philharmonic for this evenings first musical number will be several of the los angeles areas finest high school musicians
who is dressed in a tuxedo knocking on the door to guest conductors dressing room
german accent it wont do any good to rush me
i need my time to prepare myself
the door is opened by the guest conductor who is dressed in a tuxedo as well as large earrings
his hair is long and red
his complexion is pale nearly white
and his eyes are piercing green
you might describe this look as punk meets classical
annoyed beyond belief are you just going to stand there or do you want something
shaking with concentration sid
turns his hair red
nanoorganisms can do this as well as the following
he then grabs his hair and pulls it out extending it to the exact length of the guest conductors
then changes his complexion to match the conductors
as well as his eye color and other facial features
the guest conductor cant believe his eyes
by the time sid
is finished modifying himself he may not be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor but even his mother would have to look twice
its show time
he shoves the guest conductor back into his dressing room
follows him in revealing a suppressed
he slams the door behind him
madison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the hollywood bowl
parker doesnt notice
hes totally focused on screaming into the police radio
listen to me a bomb is planted somewhere in the hollywood bowl
im sorry sir i dont have the authorization to do that
then put somebody on who does
whats seems to be the problem
youve got to stop the concert
a bomb is going to go off
im sorry sir the concert has already started
whose back is to the audience leading the orchestra in a truly magnificent performance of tchaikovskys fifth symphony inside the hollywood bowl
the guest conductor waves his baton wildly
getting the absolute best from the members of the orchestra
the musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to their musical limit
as the guest conductor turns to the next page of his sheet music on the podium you notice seven small high frequency sensors above an upcoming musical measure
the sensors are wired together
when the seven notes are played in sequence an electrical pulse will be triggered down the wires which run down the side of the podium beneath the stage
the wires connect to several crates of c positioned beneath the orchestra
these seven notes will be the last notes these musicians ever play
madison screeches the vehicle to a halt
she comes within inches of mowing down several people
madison and parker bolt to the entrance flashing their badges to the guards
the guest conductors movements grow even more intense
as he looks to the violin section we now see the conductors face
it is sid
silently dont hold back
give it to me
give it to me
the orchestra plays with everything theyve got
they hit every note perfectly
including a high c
the first sensor is triggered
then the second
appear at the back of the stage
distracting the musicians
as parker and madison charge through the horn section toward sid
the musicians stop playing
the fifth sensor is triggered
then the sixth
but not the seventh
cannot believe his eyes
or his ears
the entire orchestra has stopped
come on play
in his rage his face contorts past points which can only be described bizarre frightening and not something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror
the musicians stare at sid
and then at parker and madison with concerned confused silence
which is broken by parkers gunfire
ducking behind the podium sid
desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually
he takes his
out of his jacket and starts firing
pandemonium erupts throughout the hollywood bowl
audience members run in every direction
the members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives but keep their instruments with them
even the oboist
preventing parker and madison from taking any further shots at sid
bolts down into the crowd
madison cannot get off a clean shot
neither can parker
he aims but does not fire
he and madison struggle through the crowd after him
parker and madison just catch a glimpse of sid
as he rushes up the entrance ramp to the hollywood freeway
parker and madison bolt after him
parker and madison race past the cars waiting to merge into what is effectively a parking lot
as is normal for this thoroughfare traffic is at a standstill
is nowhere to be seen
parker and madison splitup wading through different lanes of traffic
startling the already frustrated motorists
who roll up their windows
lock their doors
and some of whom reveal weapons of their own
madison pauses listening
she has no idea that sid
steps behind her
he cold cocks her with the butt of his gun
madison crumples to the street
which now leaves parker a clean shot at sid
two head wounds
falls behind a truck losing his weapon
s wounds have finished regenerating parker is already on top of him
neighborly hey old buddy old pal good to see you again
he empties his clip into sid
then discards the gun
s wounds heal themselves parker pounds him mercilessly
losing it you
im going to kill trading blows he manages to get to his feet
now is that any way to talk to an old friend
exploding he knocks parker back with a good shot to the face then disappears around a van
parker continues the hunt
tension grows in the silence that follows
he carefully makes his way around a truck
only to see sid
swinging a two by four directly at his head
parker is knocked on his ass
blood streams down his cheek
he staggers to his feet blocking another blow with his arm
which snaps the wood in two
parker grabs one of the boards
he battles with sid
the fight between parker and sid
parker gives it everything he has
madison appears behind parker holding his gun
she wavers having trouble keeping her balance
she has even more trouble aiming her weapon
she moves around trying to get a clean shot at sid
which she does not have
hows your pulse
totally focused i couldnt tell you
then shoot him already
without hesitation parker hits the deck
madison steadies her sight
to madison you couldnt hit the side of a
as he raises his twobyfour high over parkers head madison pulls the trigger smoothly
in slow motion you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel of her gun
and penetrates sid
s skull between the eyes and exits out the back of his head
collapses on the ground next to parker
what do we do now
you wont want to watch
she does so
parker reaches out of frame to remove the sid
character module from within his skull
then reveals the character module in hand
what should we do with it
glancing in the flatbed of a truck parker gets an idea and knocks on the drivers window
as the driver rolls down his window classic rock roll music can be heard from inside
mind if i borrow a couple of your tools for a second
be my guest
parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck
he offers one to madison
care to join me
madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer
parker drops the sid
character module onto the pavement
and together they start pounding the shit out of it
in perfect time with the music
which the driver cranks even louder
as we roll credits
