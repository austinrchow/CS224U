written by joss whedon and there came a day a day unlike any other when earths mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a common threat
on that day the avengers were born to fight the foes no single superhero could withstand
through the years their roster has prospered changing many times but their glory has never been denied
heed the call then for now the avengers assemble
burning blue flames
a smoky cube shape emerges the tesseract
filling the screen with blackness
kneeling behind a throne a clothed armored figure known as the other bows
the tesseract has awakened
it is on a little world
a human world
they would wield its power
the other faces a horned shaped shadow
loki is handed the chitauri scepter a long golden handle fitted with a blue gem encircled with silver blades
but our ally knows its workings as they never will
he is ready to lead
and our force our chitauri will follow
high wide on tens of thousands of chitauri stand ready in a seething mass of neat rows and columns
the ground simply the world will be his
the universe yours
and the humans what can they do but burn
out in the new mexico desert a remote research facility is in a state of panic
its an evacuation
a swooping helicopter flies in
men in suits run around like in the typical we have to leave fashion
soldiers on foot jump onto humvees accelerating the hell out of there
a voice bellows from hidden loudspeakers
standing a few yards from the landing pad a fed in a suit with badass shades peers at the helicopter as it lands
this is walking out of the helicopter is shield agent maria hill sexy fierce and determined
following her shield director nick fury climbs out
hill and fury approach agent coulson
how bad is it
thats the problem sir
we dont know
agent coulson leads hill and fury through the radiation section of the facility
hundreds of technicians and other staff run around taking only the essentials
selvig read an energy surge from the tesseract four hours ago
nasa didnt authorize selvig to test phase
he wasnt testing it he wasnt even in the room
it just turned itself on
what are the energy levels now
when selvig couldnt shut it down we ordered the evac
how long to get everyone out
campus should be clear in the next half hour
sir evacuation may be futile
we should tell them to go back to sleep
if we cant control the tesseracts energy there may not be a minimum safe distance
i need you to make sure that phase prototypes are shipped out
sir is that really a priority right now
until such time as the world ends we will act as though it intends to spin on
clear out the tech below
every piece of phase on a truck and gone
to standing agents with me
fury enters the lab facility where the tesseract is being held by a compact muon solenoid coil chamber
talk to me doctor
erik selvig emerges from behind the cms machine concerned
the tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings shoot out at random
is there anything we know for certain
tesseract is misbehaving
is that supposed to be funny
no its not funny at all
the tesseract is not only active shes
how soon until you pull the plug
shes an energy source
if we turn off the power she turns it back on
if she reaches peak level
weve prepared for this doctor
harnessing energy from space
we dont have the harness
our calculations are far from complete
now shes throwing off interference radiation
nothing harmful low levels of gamma radiation
that can be harmful
up in his nest as usual
we see clint barton dressed in black tactical gear is up on the railings watching them below fury calls barton on his earpiece
agent barton report
barton rappels down from the catwalk
walks up to fury
they both walk around the facility in a discreet manner
i gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things
well i see better from a distance
are you seeing anything that might set this thing off
doctor its spiking again
no ones come or gone
its oven is clean
no contacts no i
if there was any tampering sir it wasnt at this end
at this end
yeah the cube is a doorway to the other end of space right
the doors open from both sides
selvig clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the monitoring his worst nightmares
suddenly the tesseract thunders and shakes the entire facility
big enough where both agents hill and coulson can feel and theyre at different ends of the facility
the flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and louder like a boiling pot of water
the tesseracts energy builds up into a beam much like the bifrost bridge which hits at the end of a platform that is wired to the cms device
the great maelstrom beam fires the tesseract energy
the beam then forms a vortex which then opens up a portal
a black hole is created
from the portal the blackness of space beautiful and mysterious strewn with a billion stars appears and a gust of blue energy clouds fill the room blinding everyone
the tesseracts energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the top the facilitys vacuum chamber ceiling
its abnormally quiet
heavy breathing is heard from the platform
shield guards slowly approach weapons in hands
a figure is kneeling on the platform smoke coming off it
smiling in his mischievous manner he raises his head
the smile dies down
he looks deep into the eyes of fury barton and selvig
he stands up holing the scepter
sir please put down the spear
loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where fury and barton are standing and shoots out a blue exploding light towards them
barton tackles fury and they both barely miss lokis fired shot
all hell breaks
machine gun fire is shot at loki but the bullets bounce off him like a boss
loki jumps high from the platform and attacks those firing at him
in the blink of an eye loki takes down several guards with his knives and energy blasts from the scepter
he stops and waits to see who will attack him next
honestly the whole lab has almost gone to shit
barton tries to stand up
loki quickly walks towards him
barton raises his gun but loki grabs bartons hand
you have heart
loki points the head of his spear at bartons head
bartons eyes suddenly glow black
the ability to control bartons mind is now in lokis hand
barton puts his piece away and stands straight
as loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of several s
personnel fury takes the tesseract placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab
i still need that
this doesnt have to get any messier
of course it does
ive come too far for anything else
i am loki of asgard and i am burdened with glorious purpose
brother of thor
we have no quarrel with your people
an ant has no quarrel with a boot
you planning to step on us
i come with glad tidings of a world made free
free from what
freedom is lifes great lie
once you accept that in your heart
like a gunslinger loki turns to face selvig whos standingbehind him and places his spear against selvigs heart
selvigs eyes glow black
you will know peace
yeah you say peace i kind of think you mean the other thing
from the vacuum chamber ceiling tesseracts energy cloud rapidly builds into what may be an implosion
sir director fury is stalling
this place is about to blow
drop a hundred feet of rock on us
he means to bury us
like the pharaohs of odin
the portal is collapsing in on itself
you got maybe two minutes before this goes critical
loki looking at barton who doesnt even hesitate shoots fury who falls to the ground
barton grabs the case containing the tesseract and leaves the lab with loki selvig and the other s
d personnel loki is controlling
loki barton selvig and the other s
d personnel are in the parking lot of the facility quickly gathering certain weapons
agent hill watches in confusion referring to loki
pointing to the loki team need these vehicles
he didnt tell me
agent hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck and turns to leave as shes walking away
through the walkie talkie hill do you copy
loki and barton sharply look at agent hill
fury is sitting up pulling out the bullet breathing heavily
suddenly hill turns to shoot at barton but barton is already pointing his gun at her and starts shooting he moves the drivers seat of the truck and drives off
as hill keeps shooting
fury is holding his side running
hes got the tesseract
track it down
the energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the vacuum chamber ceiling
agent hill slips into a jeep and follows after bartons truck
lokis trucks screech across the tunnel
several shield trucks pull up to them
a drive by shooting ensues
loki who stands on top of the bed of the truck uses his scepter and emits energy blasts flipping over shield trucks
they get in the cars roar out after them
agent hill puts herself at a distance
fury races out of the hallway avoiding falling pipes
the entire facility is now in a full earthquake
agent coulson and several shield agents fall down the steps dropping silver cases of information
they attempt to grab them but
they run out of there like a bat from hell
agent hills jeep roars out of a side of bartons truck and pulls up alongside them on the left
she goes way ahead and pulls her brake swerving into a facing bartons truck and driving in reverse
bartons arms reach out the open window and opens fire
agent hill figures fuck it and shoots her windshield opening fire on barton
agent coulson jumps into a shield van
on his walkie youre clear sir
you need to go
fury bolts out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter
the surface of the pad gives way plunging the helicopter through the surface
but furys chopper barely makes it out
still in a chase and drive by sequence bartons pushes the pedal harder which causes agent hills jeep to wobble out and put her back behind
the tesseracts energy cloud now shrinks into a small ball of white light
fury watches from below a rapid build up into what may be an implosion
several miles away agent coulsons van feels a jolt of the tesseracts blastwave
the entire facility the blastwave of the tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it
like an ocean wave blinding crumbles of falling rock fall onto agent hills jeep leaving her nearly trapped under this blanket of rock
on the bartons truck they escape the tunnel and drive into the desert landscape
furys helicopter roars over bartons truck
loki looks up
from the choppers door it slides open and fury stands there holding a gun shooting at bartons giving an honoring image of loki looks at fury and in a fit
of rage points his scepter shoots out the blue light
the chopper catches on fire going down in a fiery ball
fury like the boss he is jumps out and touches down onto the desert floor
the chopper barrels along the ground
fury coming back to his senses fires at loki but theyre toofar and too late
loki looks back smiling
fury stands there mind reeling
director fury do you copy
the tesseract is with the hostile force
i have men down
agent hill climbs out her jeep which is sandwiched in but luckily not her
a lot of men still under dont know how many survivors
sound the general call
i want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case
coulson get back to base
this is a level seven
as of right now we are at war
what do we do
fury stands there
he looks up
on his face is sign of hope
out in the outskirts near a railroad a still in construction building is being occupied by georgi luchkov a large russian general along with his thugs
tall thug is in the middle of a brutal beating on natasha romanoff a slewing foxy unbelievably sexy spy
he backhands natashas face
she feels the pain but does not breakdown
luchkov smiling walks up to her
dialogue is in russian
this is not how i wanted the evening to go
i know how you wanted this evening to go
believe me this is better
id like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier a stained glass and other random items
tall thug rocks her chair back balancing her off the edge of an open floor
natasha is now scared
i thought general soholob was in charge of the export business
your reputation is quite a progression
the famous black widow
nothing but a pretty face
you really think im pretty
luchkov slowly walks over to a table filled with tools
he picks up a pair of pliers
tall thug opens up her mouth wide open
we do not need the lermontov to transfer the tanks
tell him well
you may have to write it down
suddenly weaselly thugs cell rings
confused he answers
looks at luchkov its for you
luchkov takes the phone pissed
who the hell is
youre at solenski plaza rd floor
we have an f exactly miles out
put the woman on the phone or i will blow up the block before you can make the lobby
luchkov places the cell phone against natashas ear seeing how shes tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back
we need you to come in
are you kidding
this takes precedence
im in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything
i dont give everything
natasha gives him a look
look you cant pull me out of this right now
bartons been compromised
let me put you on hold
she nods to luchkov
as luchkov comes to take the phone off her natasha hits him with her leg and headbuuts him
like a spider she stands up elegantly and starts attacking tall thug by kickboxing him in the face
still tied she rolls over weaselly thug after she trips him
she then stomps on tall thug foot with peg of the chair then yeah during all this coulson is still waiting on the line
she then flips over and falls down hard on weaselly thug breaking the chair
she sees tall thug stand
giving her momentum she runs at him drop kicking him falls down and flips right back up and wraps her legs around his neck she grabs luchkov wraps his leg
around with a hanging chain and drops him down the open floor dangling
she picks up the phone and her heels like a boss
wheres barton now
we dont know
but hes alive
we think so
ill brief you on everything when you get back
but first we need you to talk to the big guy
coulson you know that stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me
no ive got stark
you get the big guy
a little girl runs through the crowd trying to force a way through
a tiny shack
the little girl runs up the steps only to be stopped by an attending woman
then the little girl spots him
bruce banner their local doctor
what are doing here
you shouldnt be here
i have to see the doctor
its my father
banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few people lying down looking very sick
is he like them
the little girl holds out all the money she has in the world
banner and the little girl hastily run nearly to the edge of town
the little girl gets ahead of herself
banner spots local government car he turns around blocking any view of him
banner quickly follows the little girl inside her house
as he walks in the little girl escapes through the window
banner is left standing there like a dumbass
should have got paid up front banner
natasha then appears from behind the curtains
banner turns around quietly
you know for a man whos supposed to be avoiding stress you picked a hell of a place to settle
avoiding stress isnt the secret
then what is it
you brought me to the edge of the city smart
assume the whole place is surrounded
just you and me
and your actress buddy is she a spy too
do they start that young
who are you
are you here to kill me miss romanoff
because thats not gonna work out for everyone
of course not
im here on behalf of shield
how did they find me
we never lost you doctor
weve kept our distance even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent
nick fury seems to trust you
but now i need you to come in
what if i said no
ill persuade you
and what if the
other guy says no
youve been more than a year without an incident
i dont think you wanna break that streak
i dont always get what i want
doctor were facing a potential global catastrophe
well those i actively try to avoid
this is the tesseract
it has the potential energy to wipe out the planet
she shows him a photo of the tesseract on her cell phone
banner takes a closer look
what does fury want me to do
well he wants you to find it
its been taken
it emits a gamma signature thats too weak for us to trace
theres no one that knows gamma radiation like you do
if there was thats where id be
so fury isnt after the monster
not that hes told me
and he tells you everything
talk to fury he needs you on this
he needs me in a cage
no ones gonna put you in a
the thunderous tone in is voice makes natasha quickly grab her gun and point it at him but something is now off in the atmosphere
banner stands straight up smiling
im sorry that was mean
i just wanted to see what youd do
why dont we do this the easy way where you dont use that and the other guy doesnt make a mess
natasha still wary doesnt lower her gun
she lowers her gun and speaks into her earpiece
were good here
amazingly dozens of shield agents are surrounding the shack outside
banner looks at natasha charming a smile at her
just you and me
natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down
fury is facing several large monitors as he as a conference with members of the world security council
this is out of line director
youre dealing with forces you cant control
you ever been in a war councilman
in a firefight
did you feel an overabundance of control
you saying that this asgard has declared war on our planet
he cant be working alone
what about the other one
our intelligence says thor is not a hostile
but hes worlds away we cant depend on him to help
its up to us
which is why you should be focusing on phase it was designed for exactly
phase isnt ready our enemy is
we need a response team
the avengers initiative was shut down
this isnt about the avengers
were running the worlds greatest covert security network and youre gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks
im not leaving anything to anyone
we need a response team
these people maybe isolated unbalanced even but i believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need
war isnt won by sentiment director
no its won by soldiers
somewhere in an old almost wwii esque boxing gym steve rogers a man out of time the first avenger fuckin captain america is pummeling a punching bag
with every swing its like a memory hes trying to fight off and repress
captain america is running through the forest dodging mortars gunfire and the tesseracts energy firearms
theres not enough time
i gotta put her in the water
steves rage keeps building as he punches the bag
it gets harder
steve places his compass with an image of peggy carter
the time is here for him to crash the plane
steve closes his eyes
goes at the bag harder
you wont be alone
the red skull picks up the tesseract
steve opens his eyes and fuckin tears the bag as the last memory kicks in
i dont think he can physically stop
oh my god
a half frozen steve roger is lying down on a medical slab
two shield scientists run over hi tech devices to see if his vitals are up
and it seems
this guy is still alive
steve fucking tears the bag open off its chain spilling out the sand
he stands breathing hard letting out years of over repressed feeling
after taking a few breathers steve picks up another punching bag which is laying next another dozen bags
he hooks the bag up and starts punching again
fury walks in
i slept for seventy years sir
i think ive had my fill
then you should be out celebrating seeing the world
steve stops punching and walks over to the bench unraveling the tape off his hands
he sits down
i went under the world was at war i wake up they say we won
they didnt say what we lost
weve made some mistakes along the way
some very recently
you here with a mission sir
trying to get me back in the world
trying to save it
fury hands steve a file on the tesseract along with other files on hydras projects
hydras secret weapon
howard stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you
he thought what we think the tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy
thats something the world sorely needs
who took it from you
hes called loki
hes not from around here
theres a lot well have to bring you up to speed on if youre in
the world has gotten even stranger than you already know
at this point i doubt anything would surprise me
ten bucks says youre wrong
theres a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment
steve turns and picks up a punching bag
starts walking out of the gym
is there anything you can tell us about the tesseract that we ought to know now
you should have left it in the ocean
out in the atlantic ocean tony stark in his iron man suit is cutting a pipeline transport with a laser cutter coming from his hand
he then places a stark energy reactor
it lights up
iron man rockets out of the water and flies towards stark tower
youre good on this end
the rest is up to you
on the other line you disconnected the transition lines
are we off the grid
stark tower is about to become a beacon of self sustaining clean energy
so maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works
light her up
as iron man flies to the stark tower building the power is switched on and the stark sign lights up
how does it look
like christmas but with more
gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign
you need to do some press
i can do some more tomorrow
im working on the zoning for the next billboards
pepper youre killing me
enjoy the moment
then get in here and i will
tony arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process of taking off his iron man suit through a hi tech gauntlet of gadgets
sir agent coulson of shield is on the line
im not in
im actually out
sir im afraid hes insisting
close the line jarvis
i got a date
pepper potts stares up at the monitors of the reactor device
levels are holding steady
of course they are i was directly involved
which brings me to my next question how does it feel to be a genius
well ha i really wouldnt know now would i
what do you mean
all this came from you
all this came from that
points to the energy in his chest plate
give yourself some credit please
stark tower is your baby
twelve percent of the credit
an argument can be made for fifteen
for my baby
well i did do all the heavy lifting
literally i lifted the heavy things
and sorry but the security snafu
that was on you
my private elevator
you mean our elevator
was teeming with sweaty workmen
im going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later arent i
pepper pours herself and tony a glass of champagne
not gonna be that subtle
ill tell you what
next buildings gonna say potts on the tower
on the lease
call your mom can you bunk over
sir the telephone
im afraid my protocols are being overwritten
stark we need to talk
tony picks up his phone and looks into it at coulson
you have reached the life model decoy of tony stark please leave a message
this is urgent
then leave it urgently
at that moment the elevator door opens and coulson appears
thats on you
uh his first name is agent
come on in were celebrating
which is why he cant stay
we need you to look this over
he holds out a file towards soon as possible
i dont like being handed things
thats alright cause i love to be handed things
so lets trade
she passes her glass of champagne to coulson and takes the file from him then takes her champagne glass back from coulson and passes the file over to stark
official consulting hours are between eight and five every other thursday
this isnt a consultation
is this about the avengers
i know nothing about
the avengers initiative was scrapped i thought
and i didnt even qualify
i didnt know that either
yeah apparently im volatile self obsessed dont play well with others
that i did know
this isnt about personality profiles anymore
miss potts got a minute
pepper walks over to tony who places the files into his own databases
you know i thought we were having a moment
i was having twelve percent of a moment
this seems serious phils pretty shaken
how did you notice
why is he phil
what is all of this
this is uh
tony expands his arms and different profiles appear in holographic form floating in the air in front of tony and pepper
screens appear of captain america in action the hulk roaring as destroyer and another is of loki and the tesseract to which stark and pepper look on in awe
im going to take the jet to d
youve got homework
youve got a lot of homework
well what if i didnt
if you didnt
you mean if you finished
stark nods his head well um
she whispers something in his ear
coulson looks away in embarrassment
its the last date
pepper kisses him
as pepper leaves with agent coulson tony grabs the tesseract in holograph form worried
inside the quinjet steve is sitting down holding a tablet watching the footage of the hulks attack on the army at culver university
were about forty minutes out from base sir
agent coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to steve
so this doctor banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me
a lot of people were
you were the worlds first superhero
banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking erskines original formula
the hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart
didnt really go his way did it
not so much
when hes not that thing though guys like a stephen hawking
steve looks confused
hes like a smart person
i gotta say its an honor to meet you officially
steve smiles at coulson
i sort of met you i mean i watched you while you were sleeping
steve looks down
he stands up closes his laptop and walks to the side with coulson following
i mean i was
i was present while you were unconscious from the ice
you know its really its just a
just a huge honor to have you on board
well i hope im the man for the job
oh you are
weve made some modifications to the uniform
i had a little design input
arent the stars and stripes a little
with everything thats happening the things that are about to come to light people might just need a little old fashioned
steve takes in coulsons sentiment
several soldiers under lokis mind control run around preparing to infiltrate whatever loki has planned
loki sits down watching selvig work with a cms device
loki meditates until
the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of the other fully armed in his horned helmet and armor
the other appears from the steps
the chitauri grow restless
let them go at themselves
i will lead them into glorious battle
against the meager might of earth
glorious not lengthy
if your force is as formidable as you claim
you question us
you question him
he who put the scepter in your hand who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out defeated
i was a king
the rightful king of asgard
your ambition is little born of childish need
we look beyond the earth to greater worlds the tesseract will unveil
you dont have the tesseract yet
the other runs over to attack him but stops as loki points his scepter
i dont threaten but until i open the doors until your force is mine to command you are but words
you will have your war asgardian
if you fail if the tesseract is kept from us there will be no realm no barren moon no crevice where he cant find you
you think you know pain
he will make you long for something as sweet as pain
the other places his hand on lokis head and transports him back to earth
loki looks around menacing
the quinjet lands down a massive battleship known as the helicarrier
it has two runways
one with direct access to a hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel
agent coulson and steve walk down the ramp meeting up with natasha
they need you on the bridge
see you there
agent coulson walks away leaving steve with natasha walking towards the railing of the ship
there was quite the buzz around here finding you in the ice
i thought coulson was gonna swoon
did he ask you to sign his captain america trading cards yet
theyre vintage hes very proud
without realizing banner doesnt notice them walking as he isnervous as hell
he moves around as people keep walking in hisway
steve walks up to banner and shakes his hands
they told me youd be coming
word is you can find the cube
is that the only word on me
only word i care about
takes in the sentiment must be strange for you all of this
well this is actually kind of familiar
gentlemen you may wanna step inside in a minute
its gonna get a little hard to breath
suddenly the helicarrier starts shaking as it prepares to fly sail
is this is a submarine
they wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container
they both move closer to the edge of the helicarrier
four huge vtol flight
steve watches in awe as banner smiles
the doors part and we enter the bridge of the ship a flurry of activity dozens of agents sit in front of their viewscreens
agent hill shouts her instructs to leave
turns to nick fury who is at the command chair
were at lock sir
the helicarrier rises high into the heavens
suddenly the entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors which then camouflages in the sky
steve and banner walk through the glorious gleaming bridge taking his position at the science console
steve gives fury bucks referring to his earlier statement about never being surprised again
fury walks over banner and extends his hand
banner reluctantly shakes it
doctor thank you for coming
thanks for asking nicely
how long am i staying
once we get our hands on the tesseract youre in the clear
where are you with that
nick fury turns to agent coulson to explain while natasha romanoff eyes an image of clint barton on a computer screen
were sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet
if its connected to a satellite its eyes and ears for us
thats still not gonna find them in time
you have to narrow the field
how many spectrometers do you have access to
how many are there
call every lab you know tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays
ill rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition
at least we could rule out a few places
do you have somewhere for me to work
agent romanoff would you show dr
banner to his laboratory please
natasha nods and walks off leading banner down the hall
youre gonna love it doc
we got all the toys
selvig and several scientists work around the cms device
bartonwalks in holding a tablet
put it over there
where did you find all these people
shield has not shortage of enemies doctor
he holds up a screen showing information on iridium
is this the stuff you need
its found in meteorites it forms anti protons
its very hard to get hold of
especially if shield knows you need it
well i didnt know
sees loki coming hey
the tesseract is showing me so much
its more than just knowledge its
what did it show you agent barton
my next target
tell me what you need
ill need a distraction
grabs his bow and an eyeball
as they are waiting to locate loki using satellite facial recognition coulson and steve stand side by side waiting
i mean if its not too much trouble
its a vintage set
it took me a couple of years to collect them all
near mint slight foxing around the edges but
we got a hit
sixty seven percent match
weight cross match seventy nine percent
hes not exactly hiding
captain youre up
loki standing in front of the museum dressed in st century attire and with the scepter disguised as a cane walks up to the entrance of the gala
inside a lavished gala with an orchestra playing is interrupted as the head doctor walks up to the mic
steve walks into his own locker room
as he approaches to the steel cabinet the doors already reveal the updated captain america uniform along with the famous shield
he stands in silence
outside the museum german guards stand in their positions
one of them is standing on top of the roof scoping
he then hears a he looks down
one of his guards is shot with an arrow
he raises his gun
he is shot dead by an arrow
barton and his crew arrive at the doors of the locked science building
barton looks at the retinal scanner
he pulls out a shield eye scanner instrument
loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the head doctor is
as he makes it down and near the stage he flips his cane the other end
the guard there notices him pulls out his gun but loki clubs his head in
guests begin to leave the museum
loki grabs the doctor and flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures bilchsteim
loki pulls out an optical torture device
he plunges down the doctors eye
the doctor twists in pain
suddenly from bartons instrument a holographic eye of the head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on screen
the doors to the facility open
barton walks in and finds in a cabinet a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium
as the crowd runs away loki slowly walks out and materializes in his gold armor and helmet
the police arrive and with no hesitation he blasts the cars flipping them over and over
kneel before me
the crowd ignores him
another loki appears blocking the crowd
loki after loki appears they all grin as they raise their spears encircling the crowd
everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him
loki embracing his arms out smiling
is not this simpler
is this not your natural state
its the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation
the bright lure of freedom diminishes your lifes joy in a mad scramble for power for identity
you were made to be ruled
in the end you will always kneel
as the words resonate to the kneeling crowd an elder german man refuses to kneel and stands heroic
not to men like you
there are no men like me
there are always men like you
look to your elder people
let him be an example
loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light glows blue
just as the energy beam shoots out fucking captain america arrives
he dives in just in time and blocks the blast with his shield knocking down loki on his ass
you know the last time i was in germany and saw a man standing above everybody else we ended up disagreeing
a man out of time
im not the one whos out of time
from above cap the quinjet arrives
a machine gun is pointed towards loki
loki drop the weapon and stand down
like greased lighting loki sends a blast of blue at the quinjet
natasha maneuvers it just in time giving cap the time to throw his shield at loki
they both begin to duke it out
loki flings cap to the ground
cap then throws his shield but loki swats it way
cap using all the moves of a boxer is knocked down by loki
standing over him he points the scepters tip on his helmet
cap flips and knocks him out with his leg
loki grabs him and flips him over
the guys all over the place
suddenly ac dcs shoot to thrill overdrives the quinjets speakers
agent romanoff did you miss me
both cap and loki look up at the sky
tony flies over in his iron man suit and blasts loki right back to the ground
iron man touches down
he stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry the suit has
make your move reindeer games
loki puts up his hands and surrenders
his armor materializes away
natasha watches the skies
coming out of nowhere
fury speaks over her headset
not a word
just get him here
were low on time
with loki tied up and cuffed to his seat tony and steve watch from a distance whispering
i dont like it
rock of ages giving up so easily
i dont remember it being ever that easy
this guy packs a wallop
still you are pretty spry for an older fellow
whats your thing
its like calisthenics
you might have missed a couple things you know doing time as a capsicle
steve looks at tony finally meeting his ego match
fury didnt tell me he was calling you in
yeah theres a lot of things fury doesnt tell you
thunder and lightning nearly hit the jet making it shake violently
wheres this coming from
thunder rumbles overhead
loki stares out the window intently
whats the matter
scared of a little lightning
im not overly fond of what follows
what the fuck
outside the jet a blinding light hits the jet
not a light
the mighty thor
thor opens the ramp and grabs loki by the throat and flies out
steve and tony are left dumbstruck
tony puts the iron man helmet on
now theres that guy
think the guys a friendly
if he frees loki or kills him the tesseracts lost
tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after thor
stark we need a plan of attack
i have a plan
iron man jumps out of the jet and chases after thor
cap grabs a parachute to follow
id sit this one out cap
i dont see how i can
these guys come from legends theyre basically gods
theres only one god maam
and im pretty sure he doesnt dress like that
cap jumps out of the jet
somewhere out in the european mountains thor throws loki into the side of the mountain
he raises the mighty hammer mjolnir
he looks down at his brother who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion
where is the tesseract
i missed you too
do i look to be in a gaming mood
oh you should thank me
with the bifrost gone how much dark energy did the allfather have to muster to conjure you here
your precious earth
thor drops mjolnir causing the mountain to quake
he picks up loki
although thor is pissed for what he has done a family is everything to a man or god
i thought you dead
did you mourn
we all did
he did tell you my true parentage did he not
thor lets go loki who walks away from thor causing an even bigger wedge between them
we were raised together we played together we fought together
do you remember none of that
i remember a shadow
living in the shade of your greatness
i remember you tossing me into an abyss
i was and should be king
so you take the world i love as recompense for your imagined slights
no the earth is under my protection loki
and youre doing a marvelous job with that
the humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly threat
i mean to rule them
and why should i not
you think yourself above them
then you miss the truth of ruling brother
throne would suit you ill
angrily loki shoves his brother to the side
he walks back up to the ledge
ive seen worlds youve never known about
i have grown odinson in my exile
i have seen the true power of the tesseract and when i wield it
who showed you this power
who controls the would be king
i am a king
you give up the tesseract
you give up this poisonous dream
you come home
i dont have it
you need the cube to bring me home but ive sent it off i know not where
mjolnir flies back to his grasp
you listen well brother
thor and iron man crash into the forest
thor rolls himself up
iron man is still standing but keeps his distance
the helmet opens up
do not touch me again
then dont take my stuff
you have no idea what youre dealing with
shakespeare in the park
doth mother know you weareth her drapes
this is beyond you metal man
loki will face asgardian justice
he gives up the cube hes all yours
until then stay out of my way
the iron man helmet clamps up and he walks away
in one quick move thor pulls mjolnir throws it and knocks iron man clear across into a tree
from the mountain side loki watches in amusement
thor raises his hand
mjolnir flies back to his hand
thor swings the hammer summoning a ray of energy
iron man stands up and from his hand boosters a blast of energy knocks the mighty avenger on his ass
iron man flies back up and knocks thor into a tree
right back at you bitch
thor kneeling on the ground pulls mjolnir to his hand raises it to the skies and pulls in lighting and thunder
thor points the hammer at iron man and the outpouring of bolts lighting increases in intensity
iron man falls back
power at capacity
how about that
iron man fires away from his hand boosters pushing thor to his knees
like two gunslingers ready to draw both thor and iron man fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up
the two battle
iron man grasps thor elbowing him and smashing him into the side of a mountain
thor leaps off the mountain and takes iron man with him
thor and iron man crash right back down smashing down every tree possible
iron man yanks thor right up
thor grabs both hands boosters and begins to crush them
tony quickly charges as much energy as he can and shoots energy in thors face
thor falls back losing his stance
iron man headbutts thor with his gold titanium alloy helmet
headbutts him with his fuckin head and actually sends iron man across the forest
iron man boosters up and flies back at thor grabbing him by the arm and cape and swings him into another tree
thor looks up ready
thor runs with all his patience out the window
iron man swings and misses giving thor the momentum to grab him lift him and smash him down hard
thor summons back mjolnir to his hand
just as hes about to put the hammer down iron man uses his hand boosters to skid across the ground and trip thor over
standing up thor looks for him but from behind him iron man crashes into his back
thor stands facing iron man
ready to pounce
captain americas shield ricochets off both thor and iron man stopping them
they look up and see captain america standing on top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand
comes down looks at thor now i dont know what you plan on doing here
ive come here to put an end to lokis schemes
then prove it
put the hammer down
um yeah no
he loves his hammer
thor losing all tolerance with this sentential of liberty raises the hammer
you want me to put the hammer down
captain america crouches down and holds up his shield
thor brings that hammer down onto the shield and a massive implosion of light reacts to the vibranium shield creating a massive iron man stands up looking around like holy
lying right next to him is cap who never takes his eye off thor
thor looks at both men
are we done here
dozens of shield police escort loki who is in handcuffs smiling
as they pass the helicarrier lab banner stops working on the chitauri scepter and looks up
loki eyes him as he walks nodding and smiling
banner rubs his head
loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a large glass cell held by hydraulic rigs
fury walks up the control panel of the cell
in case its unclear
you try to escape
you so much as scratch that glass
fury presses a button which opens up a hatch underneath lokis cell
loki peers as much as he can from the glass
without seeing the sounds of gusting wind would make man shit his pants
not a god though
thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap
you get how that works
fury closes the hatch
points at loki
then points at the button which would drop loki into the steel trap
its an impressive cage
not built i think for me
built for something a lot stronger than you
oh ive heard
loki looks into the camera
the others watch on the monitor loki getting interrogated
banner looks at the monitor intently
the mindless beast makes play hes still a man
how desperate are you that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you
how desperate am i
you threaten my world with war
you steal a force you cant hope to control
you talk about peace and you kill cause its fun
you have made me very desperate
you might not be glad that you did
it burns you to come so close
to have the tesseract to have power unlimited power
and for what
a warm light for all mankind to share and then to be reminded what real power is
well you let me know if real power wants a magazine or something
fury walks off leaving loki in his glass cell
loki looks back at the camera smirking
steve watches until the monitor goes black
thor who didnt even look just listened stands there torn apart
they all just stand there in stunned silence
finally he really grows on you doesnt he
lokis gonna drag this out
so thor whats his play
he has an army called the chitauri
theyre not of asgard or any world known
he means to lead them against your people
they will win him the earth
in return i suspect for the tesseract
from outer space
so hes building another portal
thats what he needs erik selvig for
hes an astrophysicist
hes a friend
loki has him under some kind of spell along with one of ours
i wanna know why loki let us take him
hes not leading an army from here
i dont think we should be focusing on loki
that guys brain is a bag full of cats you could smell crazy on him
have care how you speak
loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard and hes my brother
he killed eighty people in two days
iridium what did they need the iridium for
its a stabilizing agent
walks in with coulson to ill fly you there
keep the love alive
means the portal wont collapse on itself like it did at shield
no hard feelings point break
youve got a mean swing
referring to the iridium also it means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as loki wants
uh raise the mid mast ship the top sails
that man is playing galaga
thought we wouldnt notice
but we did
covering his eye looks how does fury do this
tony looks around the monitors and places a button size hacking implant under furys desk without anyone noticing
well that sounds exhausting
the rest of the raw materials agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily
only major component he still needs is a power source
a high energy density something to kick start the cube
when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics
the packet selvigs notes the extraction theory papers
am i the only one who did the reading
does loki need any particular kind of power source
hes got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier
unless selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect
well if he could do that he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet
finally someone who speaks english
is that what just happened
tony and banner shake hands
a glimmer in their eyes shines as the mutual respect for each other shows
its good to meet you dr
youre work on anti electron collisions is unparalleled
and im a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster
banner is only here to track the cube
i was hoping you might join him
lets start with that stick of his
it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon
i dont know about that but it is powered by the cube
and id like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys
i do not understand
i understood that reference
tony rolls his eyes while cap looks proud of himself
shall we play doctor
lets play some
as banner and tony walk out the galaga player turns ever so discreetly watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to playing
banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation
tony looks at his monitors shifting and solving as many algorithms and equations
the gamma readings are definitely consistent with selvigs reports on the tesseract
but its gonna take weeks to process
if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the homer cluster we can clock this around six hundred teraflops
all i packed was a tooth brush
you know you should come by stark towers sometime
top ten floors all r d
youd love it its candy land
thanks but the last time i was in new york i kind of broke
well i promise a stress free environment
suddenly tony pokes banner with a miniature electrical prod
steve walks in on them pissed at tony
tony looks at banner closely
are you nuts
you really have got a lid on it havent you
whats your secret
huge bag of weed
is everything a joke to you
funny things are
threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isnt funny
no offense doctor
no its alright
i wouldnt have come aboard if i couldnt handle pointy things
youre tiptoeing big man
you need to strut
and you need to focus on the problem mr
you think im not
why did fury call us and why now
why not before
what isnt he telling us
i cant do the equation unless i have all the variables
you think furys hiding something
hes a spy
captain hes the spy
his secrets have secrets
points to banner its bugging him too isnt it
bobbling the words uh
i just wanna finish my work here and
a warm light for all mankind lokis jab at fury about the cube
i heard it
pointing at tony well i think that was meant for you
even if barton didnt post that all over the news
the stark tower
that big ugly tony gives him a look building in new york
its powered by stark reactors self sustaining energy source
that building will run itself for what a year
thats just the prototype
im kind of the only name in clean energy right now
referring to tony so why didnt shield bring him in on the tesseract project
i mean what are they doing in the energy business in the first place
i should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of shields secure files
taken by that im sorry did you say
jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge
in a few hours well know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide
holds out a bag of blueberries blueberry
yet youre confused about why they didnt want you around
an intelligence organization that fears intelligence
historically not possible
i think lokis trying to wind us up
this is a man who means to start a war and if dont stay focused hell succeed
we have orders we should follow them
following is not really my style
and youre all about style arent you
a nerve hit of the people in this room which one is a
wearing a spangly outfit and b
not of use
steve tell me none of this smells a little funky to you
steve takes in the possibility but as an obedient soldier shakes it off
just find the cube
steve walks out of the lab
still torn apart by the possibility he walks away towards the hull of the ship
thats the guy my dad never shut up about
wondering if they shouldnt have kept him on ice
the guys not wrong about loki
he does have the jump on us
what hes got is an acme dynamite kit
its gonna blow up in his face and im gonna be there when it does
and ill read all about it
or youll be suiting up like the rest of us
i dont get a suit of armor
im exposed like a nerve
its a nightmare
you know ive got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second to crawl its way into my heart
points at the mini arc reactor in his chest this stops it
this little circle of light
its part of me now not just armor
but you can control it
because i learned how
banner tries to read the computer screen but tony slides the data aside with his finger so the two can see face to face
hey ive read all about your accident
that much gamma exposure should have killed you
so youre saying that the hulk
the other guy
saved my life
its a nice sentiment
saved it for what
i guess well find out
banner and stark get back to work at their respective computers
you might not like that
you just might
steve with all his might slides the heavy iron door and stealthily walks in
secure storage c is a large warehouse filled with metal crates stacked
steve looks up seeing another level
he leaps up high and holds onto the catwalk railing
steve continues to move forward
inside this particular van selvig and a few other soldiers are driving inside a long tunnel
with the cms device inside selvig carefully picks up the small cylinder shape iridium with metal prongs and lightly places it a slot within the cms
the cms accepts it
selvig looks at it devilishly smiling
on a shield monitor is a photo and record of jane foster
thor looks at her remembering
with him is agent coulson
as soon as loki took the doctor we moved jane foster
weve got an excellent observatory in traunsee
she was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday
handsome fee private plane very remote
shell be safe
its no accident loki taking erik selvig
i dread what he plans for him once hes done
erik is a good man
he talks about you a lot
you changed his life
you changed everything around here
they were better as they were
we pretend on asgard that were more advanced but we
we come here battling like bilchsteim
you know huge scaly big antlers
you dont have those
dont think so
they are repulsive and they trample everything in their path
thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the window lamenting about what has happened and what may come
when i first came to earth lokis rage followed me here and your people paid the price
and now again
in my youth i courted war
war hasnt started yet
you think you can make loki tell us what the tesseract is
i do not know
lokis mind is far afield its not just power he craves its vengeance upon me
theres no pain that would prize his need from him
a lot of guys think that until the pain stops
what are you asking me to do
what are you prepared to do
loki is a prisoner
then why do i feel like hes the only person on this boat that wants to be here
thor doesnt answer
loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell
suddenly he stops
theres not many people that can sneak up on me
turns to see natasha but you figured id come
after whatever tortures fury can concoct you would appear as a friend as a balm
and i would cooperate
i wanna know what youve done to agent barton
id say ive expanded his mind
and once youve won
once youre king of the mountain
what happens to his mind
is this love agent romanoff
love is for children
i owe him a debt
she pulls up a chair as before i worked for shield i uh
well i made a name for myself
i have a very specific skillset
i didnt care who i used it for or on
i got on shields radar in a bad way
agent barton was sent to kill me he made a different call
and what will you do if i vow to spare him
not let you out
but i like this
your world in the balance and you bargain for one man
regimes fall every day
i tend not to weep over that im russian
what is it you want
its really not that complicated
ive got red in my ledger id like to wipe it out
can you wipe out that much red
the hospital fire
barton told me everything
your ledger is dripping its gushing red and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything
this is the basest sentimentality
this is a child at prayer
tony and banner continuously work at their monitors
you lie and kill in the service of liars and killers
agent hill checks every viewscreen in the bridge
you pretend to be separate to have your own code something that makes up for the horrors
but they are a part of you and they will never go away
steve opens a steel crate
angry he looks behind him and looks back into the crate
the crate is filled with an array of loki slams his cell making natasha flinch
i wont touch barton
not until i make him kill you
in every way he knows you fear
and when hell wake just long enough to see his good work and when he screams ill split his skull
this is my bargain you mewling quim
natasha turns around walks away from loki disgusted
youre a monster
no you brought the monster
turns back around poised so banner
thats your play
loki means to unleash the hulk
keep banner in the lab im on my way
send thor as well
thank you for your cooperation
natasha quickly walks out leaving loki frozen
fury walks in surprised to see tony and banner stop working on the scepter
what are you doing mr
kind of been wondering the same thing about you
youre supposed to be locating the tesseract
the models locked and were sweeping for the signature now
when we get a hit well have the location within half a mile
and youll get your cube back no muss no fuss
suddenly his monitor show a collection of secret files what is phase
suddenly steve drops a hydra assault rifle on the table causing fury banner and tony to turn around
cap looks pissed
phase is shield uses the cube to make weapons
sorry the computer was moving a little slow
trying to explain rogers we gathered everything related to the tesseract
this does not mean that were
im sorry nick
tony moves the computer screen towards fury which shows plans of what were you lying
i was wrong director
the world hasnt changed a bit
at that moment thor and natasha walk into the lab
natasha keeps her eyes right on banner
banner looks at her pissed
did you know about this
you wanna think about removing yourself from this environment doctor
i was in calcutta i was pretty well removed
lokis manipulating you
and youve been doing what exactly
you didnt come here because i bat my eyelashes at you
yes and im not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy
id like to know why shield is using the tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction
because of him
pointing at thor me
last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town
we learned that not only are we not alone but we are hopelessly hilariously outgunned
my people want nothing but peace with your planet
but youre not the only people out there are you
and youre not the only threat
the worlds filling up with people who cant be matched they cant be controlled
like you controlled the cube
youre work with the tesseract is what drew loki to it and his allies
it is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war
a higher form
you forced our hand
we had to come up with something
cause that always calms everything right down
remind me again how you made your fortune stark
im sure if he still made wait
how is weapons stark would be neck this now about me
im sorry isnt thor everything
i thought humans were more evolved than this
excuse me did we come to your planet and blow stuff up
did you always give your champions such mistrust
are you all really that captain america is on naive
d monitors potential threat potential threats
to steve i swear to god stark one youre on that list
are you more crack
above or below angry bees
i feel threatened
as the team argues they dont realize the blue gem on lokis scepter is glowing brightly
outside the helicarrier a lone carrier slowly hovers over the ship
bravo please relay your pass code
what is your hull over
arms to ammunition over
inside barton and his crew suit up and arm themselves
barton pulls out his hi tech bow and arrows
back in the lab the egos of these people keeping rubbing off each other and at any moment the shit will hit the fan
you speak of control yet you court chaos
its his m
i mean what are we a team
no no no
were a chemical mixture that makes chaos
were a time bomb
you need to step away
puts his arm around steve why shouldnt the guy let off a little steam
pushes tony off you know damn well why
comes face to face with cap oh im starting to want you to make me
big man in a suit of armor
take that off what are you
genius billionaire playboy philanthropist
i know guys with none of that worth ten of you
yeah ive seen the footage
the only thing you really fight for is yourself
youre not the guy to make the sacrifice play to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you
i think i would just cut the wire
always a way out
you know you may not be a threat but you better stop pretending to be a hero
that did it a hero
youre a lab rat rogers
everything special about you came out of a bottle
the ramp of the carrier opens
the carrier maneuvers next to one of the large turbine engines
barton stands at the base holding out his bow
he pulls out a grenade tipped arrow
he points right at the engine
barton moves his aim and points the arrow about a hundred feet from the engine
the arrow flies out but then sharply heads for the engine
the arrow is punctured onto the engine
it has a visible timer which is counting down
back in the lab steve puffs up his chest at tony who just stands there unmoving
put on the suit lets go a few rounds
thor laughs at them
you people are so petty
tony rubs his head
moves away from cap
yeah this is a tee
agent romanoff would you escort dr
banner back to his
you rented my room
the cell was just in case
in case you needed to kill me but you cant
i got low
i didnt see an end so i put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out
so i moved on
i focused on helping other people
i was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk
banner slowly gets upset as he looks at romanoff who gets unnerved
you wanna know my secret agent romanoff
you wanna know how i stay calm
black widow and fury have their hands down to grab their guns
put down the scepter
the computer beeps
they all turn to it
banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer
you dont get to see my little party trick after all
located the tesseract
i can get there faster
look all of us
the tesseract belongs on asgard no human is a match for it
tony turns to leave but steve stops him
youre not going alone
you gonna stop me
put on the suit lets find out
im not afraid to hit an old man
put on the suit
at that moment banner whos looking at the monitor notices something about the tesseract
oh my god
barton pulls the trigger on his bow
the arrow then explodes the everyone is thrown in every direction
steve fury thor and tony are thrown across while natasha and banner is down in the lower equipment room
steve looks up at tony
put on the suit
steve helps tony up and out of the lab
fury sits up clutching his ribs
he puts on his earpiece
emergency alarms set off fire extinguishers activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning scramble for their positions and armaments
agent hill keeps the bridge as calm as possible
turn up that engine
number engine is down
can we get a run in
runs over to galaga player talk to me
points to monitor turbines loose
mostly intact but its impossible to get out there and make repairs while were in the air
we lose one more engine we wont be
somebodys got to get inside and patch that engine
you copy that
im on it
initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory
agent coulson runs out of the bridge
natasha looks over to banner who is breathing heavy having landed hard
he is gripping the grated floor to maintain control but his eyes are green his face intense
quietly to herself im okay
were okay right
barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship
they rappel down into a corridor
get that engine down
get him through the dark
come with me
two of his men follow him
they head towards the bridge
tony and cap run through a dim debris filled hall
find engine three
ill meet you there
cap peels off as tony approaches a tech room
inside tonys iron man suit stands waiting lit above in all its glory
on banners face in the dim light as he struggles to suppress the rage but his face is growing changing slowly
natasha is pulling herself painfully free talking to banner
bruce you gotta fight it
this is just what loki wants
were gonna be okay
listen to me
two approaching shield soldiers arrive to check on her
she furiously waves them away
they bolt out of there
were gonna be okay
i swear on my life i will get you out of this you will walk away and never
his voice has the change in it the bitter amusement is morphing to a growled threat
another explosion rocks the carrier and he turns to look at her transforming just as the lights go out
banner suddenly starts transforming into the hulk and gives natasha one last knowing look
natasha struggles free of the rubble
the hulk sensing her turns his head and puts on a face of a disturb monster
natasha jolts up the stairs with the hulk chasing after her
natasha maneuvers like a black widow should
she rolls under a turbine starts to crawl within the maze of pipes
the hulk pulls them out from above the catwalk
natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and stealthily escapes
the hulk lets out a roar of rage unlike anything
loki looks up smiling mischievously
fury runs in and sees the chaos has increased even more than before
the helmsman is in complete disarray
bring the carrier inwards and head south
take us to the water
navigations recalibrated after the engine failure
is the sun coming up
then put it on the left
get us over water
one more turbine goes down and we drop
captain america pushing with all his strength the door to portside sees shield tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire extinguishers and cover from sparks largely unable to do anything
engine is totally dead
a large chunk of the port side in torn stark im here
see what we got
tony flies in his iron man suit and gets close to the damaged engine
tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and its layouts
i gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before i can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris
iron man begins pulling on the stuck rotors
looks over atsteve
i need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position
iron man flies into giant cooling conductors
captain america jumps over to the other side of the broken railing
captain america gets himself to the control panel and opens it up
for a man who grew up as a yank what the fuck is this
whats it look like in there
it seems to run on some form of electricity
well youre not wrong
natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk
the room vibrates
natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk and spins
and then a roar
natasha fires a shot into a liquid nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face
the hulk smashes the shit out of it
natasha begins to run through the maze of corridors
the sound the monster is coming
finally she reaches and a long corridor
as she runs behind her the hulk tears up the hallway coming at her
natasha turns to see but the hulk slaps her into the wall the hulk marks his territory
natasha looks up
a fear she has never felt begins to seep out
the hulk raises his hand and is knocked off his feet by thor who tackles him into the next room
both thor and hulk roll across the floor
every person runs the hell out
thor looks up at this magnificent beast
the hulk stands up and moving like a boxer wants thor to make his move
the hulk makes his move
swing and a miss
thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks hulk off his feet
hulk keeps swinging and missing pissing him off
finally he brings down his arm but thor grabs it and wraps around it
we are not your enemies banner
try to think
hulk lifts his arm up to thors surprise and he sends him iron man continuously blasts broken debris off the turbine engine
its bad but still fixable
the relays are intact
whats our next move
even if i clear the rotors this thing wont re engage without a jump
im gonna have to get in there and push
well if that thing gets up to speed youll get shredded
then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag
see that red lever
itll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out
stand by it wait for my word
captain america looks over at the other side where he was
he sees the red lever and jumps towards it
thor crashes into another stack of crates
as he raises his head he feels something on his lips
as he swipes it off the roar of the hulk is not too far
thor extends his hand out
the roar gets louder and closer
his hand strains toward mid air
his eyes tight in concentration
the hulk runs right at him
at the last second mjolnir flies into his hand and thor uppercuts hulk who crashes into a fighter jet
hulk stands up shaking his head like what the fuck just happened
he shakes it off and angrily rips off the tail of the jet torques his body like a greek discus thrower and
hurls thor slides and ducks under the tail
jumping up he throws mjolnir with all his strength knocking the hulk head over heels
hulk falls down hammer in hand
he tries to lift it but cant
mjolnir rests atop his hand
struggle as he may hulk wraps his hand around the hammer
the hammer doesnt move
to no avail he strains with all his might screams from the effort bellowing
thor jumps up again kneeing hulk in the face
thor grabs his hammer jumps on him using the hammer as a lock for his chokehold
hulk tries to pull him off
fury and agent hill look over their monitors
we need a full evac on the lower hangar bay
agent hill nods
she leaves to exit out but a sliding grenade appears
the grenade goes off sending her down the steps
fury fires a shot at the open entrance
he moves over behind the side of the entrance
a handful of bartons men enter
watchful ready waiting
fury steps out his gun drawn
a shoot out and hand to hand ensues but fury is unable to stop one of them which is why he is shot in the head by agent hill who
looks hot and sexy holding her gun
agent coulson walks up the armory door
he places his head into a facial recognition scanner
walks into the room
we got perimeter breach
hostiles are in shield gear
hold on to every junction
hulk crashes from under the floor sending thor on his ass
hulk grabs him by the neck
a gunfight opens up
agents exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical soldiers
sir the hulk and thor are in shuttle levels and
sir the hulk will tear this place apart
get his attention
on her earpiece escort proceed to main shuttle
dont get too close
escort s jet banks to the right heading towards the shuttle
escort pilot slowly makes his way in
sees the action going between thor and the hulk
pulls the trigger fires guns at hulk a shower of bullets sprays the hulk everywhere
thor ducks for cover
the hulk turns around letting out his primal roar
he jumps up takes a running start and leaps
hulk lands on the jets nose
the jet spins wildly
as the hulk tears it apart escort pilot pulls his ejection seat but escort pilot pulls his parachute
the jet explodes
the hulk iron man laser cuts a big piece of broken metal
he then jumps on it relieving the rotors
on the other side bartons men enter the port side
captain america looks down pondering if they are help
evidently not as they begin shooting at him and throwing grenades
captain america jumps to the other railing and down with bartons men
he begins to take them down even goes as far as throwing one off
a few more enter firing
captain america grabs a noveske rifleworks diplomat big word for big fuckin gun and jumps back up to his position firing down at them
the gunfight has gone down but more of bartons men enter and are taken by fury who is confused as to why they keep coming
they are not getting through here so what the hell
suddenly barton looses an arrow down to the bridge and explodes critical spots
barton releases a multi tipped arrow towards fury but instead hits his command desk right above a usb fury fires at barton but is already gone
the arrow then self activates and inserts itself into the outlets hacking every single monitor and main frame
the hacking causes engine to shut off
suddenly the helicarrier begins to dangerously tilt to one side
sir weve lost all power in engine
he took out our systems
hes headed for the detention level
does anybody copy
still shaken by the hulk ordeal natasha sits there rocking back and forth after crying for a while
summoning back all her coolness she touches her earpiece
this is agent romanoff
natasha springs up and runs for barton
iron man begins to push the rotor using boosters from his boots
stark were losing altitude
the rotors start propelling faster and faster as iron mans boosters get more and more bright
on the other side captain america continuously shoots at bartons men
blinking at the wrong moment captain america loses the upper hand and slides off the railing but grabs onto a loose cable
thor runs into the detention section where he finds loki escaping
thor charges at his brother
loki walks up to him and crouches down to attack
thor only goes through him
the false loki dissipates into nothingness
the real loki comes out from behind the cell door which closes on thor locking him up
are you ever not going to fall for that
barton walks alone down the catwalk
in a lightning fast move barton nocks an arrow and points it at natasha
a hand to hand fight ensues
natasha crawls her way around barton making barton to drop his bow but pulls out a knife on her
thor in a fit of anger slams mjolnir onto the glass cell
to his surprise the cell door only cracks but violently shakes the ship
loki stands there in caution as does his guarding smiles walks over to the the humans think us immortal
should we test that
suddenly guarding soldier falls down like a tree
agent coulson stands there holding phase weapon prototype
move away please
loki moves away from the switch
you like this
we started working on the prototype after you sent the destroyer
even i dont know what it does
do you wanna find out
loki sends agent coulson against the wall
agent coulson slumps down breathing fast
loki makes his way to the control switch
he gives his brother one last look
thor looks at him hopeful
loki opens the hatch
thor still hopes
loki hits the button and barton and natasha continue attacking each other
natasha kickboxes bartons face
feeling that barton takes a swing at her but she grabs his arm twisting it
barton writhes in pain
using his other arm he tosses the knife over and begins to slash at natasha
she dodges every move but finds herself in a lock hold with him
as he forces the knife down she bites his wrist
barton lets go of the knife
natasha wraps her legs around his neck flips him over and arm locks him
she slams his head into a pipes rail
barton goes down hard
he looks up her almost coming to his real senses
natasha coldcocks him
barton is out
thor trapped in the glass cage bounces off the jumbling cell pod
as it draws closer to land thor tries to swing at glass but misses
land draws closer
in a final attempt before crashing thor positions himself onto the glass door and leapfrogs just as the cage is about to hit the ground
the cell crashes into the shore as thor crashes out into the meadow
loki has no remorse as he looks down
he closes the hatch and proceeds to leave
a weak voice
youre gonna lose
its in your nature
your heroes are scattered your floating fortress falls from the sky
where is my disadvantage
you lack conviction
i dont think i
so thats what it does
back in the bridge fury sees on his viewscreen that the hatch has been open
knowing agent coulson was sent there he goes to
iron man continuously spins engine giving it all he has
the rotors are propelling properly and fast
the helicarrier levels itself
cap i need the lever
i need a minute here
tony lets go of the rotors
they spin by themselves
tony is then caught in one
he is now fucked
iron man slips into the rotors getting chewed up
captain america climbs up the loose cable and reaches the railing
bartons man opens fire once more
captain america pulls himself up and finally pulls the lever
a vent opens up from engine
iron man falls out but the suit heavily damaged hardly keeping him up
iron man heads for cap
bartons man turns his aim to iron man who tackles him into the wall
iron man rolls over tired
cap lets out a sigh of relief
the carrier that brought barton and his team now leaves taking loki and his scepter
the carrier flies into the distance
fury runs in finding agent coulson still alive barely
they got rabbited
just stay awake
eyes on me
im clocked out here
not an option
its okay boss
this was never going to work
if they didnt have something
agent coulson looks away
sighs his last breath
nick fury looks on grimly at coulson
the medical team arrives
agent coulson is down
agent hill is being treated for a gash on her head listens on her headset standing up
paramedics are on their way
steve and tony listen in as well
they called it
fury gathers tony and steve back into the briefing room everyone there has a look as if in a daze
a look of numb shock is shown on their devastated faces
these were in phil coulsons jacket
guess he never did get you to sign them
fury throws coulsons captain america trading cards on the table towards steve
steve picks them up stained with blood
were dead in the air up here
our communications location of the cube banner thor
i got nothing for you
lost my one good eye
maybe i had that coming
yes we were going to build an arsenal with the tesseract
i never put all my chips on that number though because i was playing something even riskier
there was an idea stark knows this called the avengers initiative
the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people see if they could become something more
see if they could work together when we needed them to to fight the battles that we never could
phil coulson died still believing in that idea in heroes
tony gets up and walks off not wanting to hear it anymore
well its an old fashioned notion
thor walks out far into the meadow
he looks down
banner wakes up in human form
he looks around and sees he is in a pile of rubble and looks up at the open ceiling he crashed in
and is completely naked
a security guard stands there amazed
you fell out of the sky
did i hurt anybody
theres nobody around here to get hurt
you did scare the hell out of some pigeons though
or just good aim
you were awake when you fell
the whole thing right through the ceiling
big and green and buck ass nude
he throws banner a pair of big pants
banner pulls on his pants
i didnt think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella
are you an alien
from outer space an alien
well then son youve got a condition
barton is strapped down
natasha watches over him as barton tries to shake off lokis mind control
clint youre gonna be alright
you know that
is that what you know
i gotta go in though
i gotta flush him out
we dont have that long its gonna take time
i dont understand
have you ever had someone take your brain and play
pull you out and send something else in
do you know what its like to be unmade
you know that i do
why am i back
how did you get him out
i hit you really hard in the head
natasha unfastens the tasha how many agents
dont do that to yourself clint
this is loki
this is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for
loki he got away
i dont suppose you know where
i didnt need to know
i didnt ask
hes gonna make his play soon though
we gotta stop him
i dont know
well if i put an arrow in lokis eyesocket id sleep better i suppose
now you sound like you
natasha sits next to her partner and friend
but you dont
youre a spy not a soldier
now you want to wade into a war
what did loki do to you
he didnt i just
ive been compromised
i got red in my ledger
id like to wipe it out
tony look at the empty cell container
he stands not saying a word
steve walks in
was he married
there was a uh
cellist i think
he seemed like a good man
he was an idiot
for taking on loki alone
he was doing his job
he was out of his league
he should have waited
he should have
sometimes there isnt a way out tony
how did that work for him
is this the first time youve lost a soldier
turns around sharply we are not soldiers
i am not marching to furys fife
neither am i
hes got the same blood on his hands as loki does
right now weve got to put that aside and get this done
now loki needs a power source if we can put together a list
looking at the blood stained he made it personal
thats not the point
that is the point
thats lokis point
he hit us all right where we live
to tear us apart
he had to conquer his greed but he knows he has to take us out to win right
thats what he wants
he wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it
he wants an audience
right i caught his act at stuttengard
thats just a preview this is opening night
lokis a full tilt diva
he wants flowers he wants parades he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered
selvig works around the cms device that has already been set upon the rooftop of tonys tower
steve walks in full uniform
natasha looks at him unprepared
time to go
ill tell you on the way
can you fly one of those jets
barton walks out of the restroom
looks at cap
steve looks at natasha and she nods her head to confirm bartons on their side
you got a suit
then suit up
a blinding bolt of lightning strikes down from above colliding on mjolnir
the explosion is massive
the captain america pulls on his helmet and shield
tony welds his iron man helmet
light slips down over iron mans eye holes
black widow attaches a glove gauntlet with her rounds on her wrist
a blue light charges
hawkeye slips on his quiver of arrows
cap widow and hawkeye walk towards and into the quinjet
a young shield pilot looks and stands in their way
you are not authorized to be here
fury looks the window of the ship contemplating
agent hill walks up to him knowing
those cards they were in coulsons locker not in his jacket
they needed the push
holding coulsons cards a loud noise screeches
fury looks out to see iron man flying off as well as the quinjet
they found it
get our communications back up whatever you have to do
i want eyes on everything
iron man arrives at stark tower where selvig activates the cms device holding the tesseract
sir i took off the arc reactor
the device is already self sustained
shut it down dr
its too late
it cant stop now
he wants to show us something
a new universe
iron man aims his hands toward the cms and fires
the energy from his boosters shatters with a deafening crack
selvig falls backwards
down below citizens of new york look up at stark tower
iron man stares in disbelief at the cms
the barrier is pure energy
the mark vii is not ready to be deployed
skip the spinning rims
were on the clock
tony lands his suit and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits him
loki looks up at him smiling
they proceed to walk into the penthouse
loki walks in holding the scepter
tony casually walks down the steps towards the bar
please tell me youre going to appeal to my humanity
actually im planning to threaten you
you should have left your armor on for that
yeah its seen a bit of mileage
youve got the blue stick of destiny
would you like a drink
stalling me wont change anything
no no no
im having one
the chitauri are coming nothing will change that
what have i to fear
loki looks at him confused its what we call ourselves sort of like a team
earths mightiest heroes type of thing
yes ive met them
yeah takes us a while to get any traction ill give you that one
but lets do a head count here
your brother the demi god a super soldier a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend a man with breath taking anger management issues a couple of
master assassins and you big fella youve managed to piss off every single one of them
that was the plan
not a great plan
when they come and they will theyll come for you
from underneath the bar table tony pulls on colantotte bracelets a honing device
i have an army
we have a hulk
i thought the beast had wandered off
youre missing the point
theres no throne there is no version of this where you come out on top
maybe your army comes and maybe its too much for us but its all on you
because if we cant protect the earth you can be damned well sure well avenge it
slowly walks up to him raising the scepter how will your friends have time for me when theyre so busy fighting you
loki taps tony on the chest with his scepter
confused loki tires again
it should work
well performance issues
in anger loki grabs tony by the throat and flings him across the room
loki grabs tony by the throat again
you will all fall before me
loki throws tony out the window
tony freefalls down the tower
from behind loki an elevator opens and a red pod shoots out
the pod laser signals the colantotte bracelets on tony
the pod begins to transform into the mark vii suit
it latches onto tony
the suit flies up before he hits the ground or the gazing people
loki looks up angry
and theres one other person you pissed off
his name was phil
loki raises the scepter
iron man fires at loki sending him on his ass
selvig looks up at the sky
the tesseracts energy beams into the sky
the beam then forms a vortex which then opens up a hole in space rips open and from it the chitauri army spills out in flying chariots carrying energy rifles
with a bayonet on the end
iron man flies up towards the portal
from his shoulders a miniature multiple rocket launcher pops out and fires
like the jericho missile several targets are taken down unlike no missile
thousands of chitauri fly out
iron man flies towards the city
the chitauri unleash
new yorkers fill the streets staring at the fire fight in the distance
the chitauri unleashes blasts as it goes blowing up cars setting storefronts aflame
loki walks onto the balcony as the sounds of the chitauri rings out
he admires his soon to be kingdom
thor lands on the tower
loki turns to his enemy
turn off the tesseract or ill destroy it
there is no stopping it
there is only the war
so be it
loki and thor rush at each other
they and their weapons collide
the two battle loki unleashing another pent up rage and jealousy thor having no choice but to defend himself
soldiers and cops have taken positions covering the streets
they see from the sky iron man leading a trail of chitauri towards his tower
the quinjet booms into the city
stark were heading north east
what did you stop for drive thru
swing up park im gonna lay em out for you
iron man banks around his tower
sees thor and loki still going at it
iron man swoops down the street causing a chitauri to crash
flying up iron man puts the following chitauri in view of the quinjet
black widow takes out machine gun and fires at the sir we have more incoming
lets keep them occupied
iron man heads back to the portal
thor and loki battle savagely
loki fires energy from the scepter sending thor sliding across the floor
hawkeye looks out to his left window finding a target
hawkeye banks the jet towards stark tower
aims the minigun at loki
loki aims the scepter at the quinjet and fires a blast of energy
thor gets to his feet tackling loki down hard
the quinjet is soon caught on fire
hawkeye maneuvers one wing of the jet
they spin and slow
dropping out of the air as it passes over skyscrapers
they slam into the street
with everyone okay hawkeye and black widow unfasten their seatbelts and open the ramp
captain america runs down followed by hawkeye and black widow
each one has their respected weapons in hand
the trio arrives in the middle of a four way street
suddenly the city lurches to a stop
a deep primal rage bellows out
with that roar a shadow comes over them
from the portal a fucking chitauri leviathan flies out
carrying hundreds of soldiers the chitauri leviathan passes over the trio
they look up out of their element
from both sides chitauri soldiers cling off and attach themselves to the sides of the buildings sliding down
some crash into these buildings and begin firing from their energy rifles at innocent people
stark are you seeing this
im seeing still working on believing
has he shown up yet
just keep me posted
jarvis find me a soft spot
iron man quietly flies behind and parallel with the chitauri thor holds down lokis face straight ahead forcing him to watch the city falling to ash
look at this
look around you
you think this madness will end with your rule
tries to look away its too late
its too late to stopit
loki looks at his brother showing a sign of hope
loki stabs thor with a small knife
thor keels over
thor gets up kicks loki and lifts him into the air
thor then slams him down hard
loki bleeding rolls over the edge
thor looks down
loki is riding on a flying chariot
dozens of chitauri follow his lead
the trio runs behind upside taxis
they look up and see loki taking his band down the street and fires at the street in a terrified people running from loki looking over their shoulders coming straight
captain america looks down the bridge
those people need assistance down there
chitauri soldiers that have landed near them and begin firing at them
black widow pulls both pistols and fires
turns to cap
we got this
you think you can hold them off
pulls a trigger on his bow a narrow is mechanically it would be my genuine pleasure
hawkeye shoots an arrow into the creatures head gaining a few seconds for captain america as he falls down the bridge followed by an explosion
cap races over to the plaza jumping over dozens of exploding cars
the first avenger runs like a fucking cheetah
hawkeye runs over a bus full of people
from the windows small children are held by their parents for hawkeye to pull them out to safety
he runs over to the jammed door and jerkily opens it
people begin to run out
black widow empties out her clips
hawkeye fires arrows into the ranks of the chitauri hitting his mark each time he shoots
just like budapest all over again
you and i remember budapest verydifferently
the cops continuously fire at the flying chariots
its pretty pointless
a young cop runs over to his police sergeant
we need to get out
they gotta bring the national guard
does the army know whats happening here
captain america jumps in front of them
they look up at this ridiculous looking man
i need men in these buildings
there are people inside that can run into the line of fire
you take them through the basement or through the subway
you keep them off the streets
i need a perimeter as far back as th
why the hell should i take orders from you
suddenly an explosion comes up from behind cap
an energy blast is blocked by his shield
two chitauri soldiers attack
the cops watch in shock as captain america fights them off with ease
the sergeant turns to his officer
i need men in those buildings lead the people down and away from the streets
i need a perimeter as far back as th
iron man swerves around a building and faces the chitauri leviathan
he pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher and fires
the chitauri leviathan roars in annoyance
the chitauri leviathan turns to him
we got his attention
what the hell is step two
iron man flies away
hawkeye trips a chitauri soldier and rams an arrow down its throat
black widow gets her hands on an energy rifle and stickfights the hell out of them
captain america joins back in and using his shield swaps and whacks oncoming chitauri soldiers
its all too much on them until
lightning strikes down from the sky channeling the blast firing the electricity out at the chitauri soldiers around them
theyre blasted back in a massive shockwave
the chitauri soldiers convulse drop dead to the ground
thor touches down
whats the story upstairs
the powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable
thor is right
we gotta deal with these guys
how do we do this
as a team
i have unfinished business with loki
yeah get in line
lokis gonna keep this fight focused on us and thats what we need
without him these things could run wild
we got stark up top hes gonna need us
just then banner arrives on a small motorbike
getting off he looks around the city
so this all seems horrible
ive seen worse
we could use a little worse
we got him
just like you said
then tell him to suit up
im bringing the party to you
iron man comes out from behind a building
the chitauri leviathan follows impatiently
the rest of the avengers look up getting ready and standing still
i dont see how thats a party
iron man swoops down the street
the chitauri leviathan also swoops down barreling down the street like a freight train that keeps building and building its intensity
banner looks behind
cap looks at him
banner begins to walk towards the monster
now might be a really good time for you to get angry
thats my secret captain
im always angry
banners body starts to swell and stretch and harden
hulk pops the chitauri iron man in mid flight extends his arm out and a rocket ready to shoot
iron man fires the rocket hits a soft spot large chitauri leviathan are blown completely away
real pain from the chitauri leviathan
other pieces of meat catch fire and withdraw
sizzle as they hit the pavement
captain america raises his shield to block them
from above and on the buildings the chitauri army watches in horror as a group of earths mightiest heroes find themselves loki watches below motionless
send the rest
from the portal thousands more of chitauri soldiers and even the avengers look up
way out of their fucking element
call it cap
alright listen up
until we can close that portal up there were gonna use containment
barton i want you on that roof eyes on everything
call out patterns and strays
stark you got the perimeter
anything gets more than three blocks out you turn it back or your turn it to ash
wanna give me a lift
better clench up legolas
iron man lifts hawkeye up to the building
thor youve gotta try and bottleneck that portal
slow them down
youve got the lightning
light the bastards up
thor flies up to natasha you and me we stay here on the ground keep the fighting here
throwing the dead chitauri soldiers towards other soldiers
the chitauri soldiers fire at him
the hulk backhands them seizes thor grabs onto the tower
raises mjolnir and krakakaboom
a blinding bolt of lightning strikes down from above colliding on back in the bridge fury sees on his viewscreen the destruction going on in new york
agent hill walks up to him
the council is on
fury presses his screen
atop the rooftop hawkeye fires arrows into the streaming flow of the chitauri riders hitting his mark each time
hell heeven aims his bow behind him without looking and releases the arrow exploding a rider
you got a lot of strings sticking to your tail
just try and keep them off the streets
well they cant bank worth a damn
find a tight corner
i will roger that
iron man does so and leads towards tight corners and in hawkeyes view who fires arrow upon and arrow exploding the chitauri riders
iron man keeps leading chitauri riders under tunnels through open parking garages
he looks back
what else you got
well thors taking on a squadron down on th
and he didnt invite me
we are looking into a conference room where office workers sit around a table
but the noise has caught one workers eye then another and soon they are all rising stepping to the window mesmerized by what lies beyond
workers pova chitauri leviathan swims right in front of them
suddenly another noise catches the workers attention
the hulk black widow using the energy rifle is taken off her feet by a chitauri soldier
she tiresomely takes it down by cutting its throat
she grabs the energy rifle turns to attack
cap stands there holding his shield
she slumps back tired
captain none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we dont close that portal
our biggest guns couldnt touch it
well maybe its not about guns
gestures the flying you wanna get up there youre gonna need a ride
i got a ride
i could use a lift though
black widow backs up giving herself a running start
cap lifts and angles his shield
are you sure about this
its gonna be fun
note the following sequence will take us through the action in one extended shot
black widow climbs onto the chariot and cuts the turret shooters linkage to it
she then jumps on the rider and sticks her knives into his nervous system
she gets him to bank over a building
iron man arrives and shoots any other chitauri riders following her
he makes his way down to captain america who fights off more chitauri soldiers
iron man points his hand boosters at his shield
the energy comes off and cap uses it as a reflection beam and takes down nearby chitauri
from above them hawkeye sends down remaining arrows
he sends one across the street taking down a chitauri rider following finally we have thor and hulk fight on top the back of the chitauri leviathan tearing apart and
hulk spine of the chitauri leviathan
summoning all his strength he the chitauri leviathan crashes into a history museum
thor and hulk stand on the back of the chitauri leviathan after bringing it down
they stand still admiring
hulk punches thor selvig wakes up from loki mind control
he looks around confused where he is
he looks up at the sky amazed
several humvees aim their mounted
cal guns into the sky firing and hitting chitauri riders
captain america fights off a soldier who is pinning him down with its energy rifle
cap breaks its leg
he stands up pickingup his shiled
captain the bank on ndpast madison they caught a lot of civilians there
im on it
dozens of civilians are gathered in bank
tension and uncertainty surround them
three chitauri soldiers oversee them pointing their weapons at them
one of them charges a bomb
it captain america jumps through the window and throws his shield at the chitauri bomber
the two chitauri soldiers aim their rifles but cap heads for cover under a desk which he kicks at them
captain america jumps over the desk headlocks a soldier while backhanding another one over the railing
the crowd moves away
a chitauri soldier attacks him from behind and rips off his helmet
the bomb is beeping faster
captain america flips over the soldier grabs his shield and just as the bomb is about to go off chitauri bomber dives for trying to stop it but it goes
off sending captain america through the window landing very hard on a car
the civilians look up from below
cap gets off the car looks around the city
the police and firemen arrive pulling out those civilians he saved
a waitress looks back thankful
back in the bridge fury sees on his viewscreen the world director fury the council has made a decision
i recognize the council has made a decision but given that its a stupid ass decision ive elected to ignore it
director youre closer than any of oursubs you scramble that jet
that is the island of manhattan councilman
until im certain my team cant hold it i will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population
if we dont hold them in the air we lose everything
i send that bird out we already have
fury shuts off his viewscreen
black widow still driving the chariot with the rider is hit at her side
she looks about wondering whose energy fire it was she looks behind
loki follows in hot pursuit
they race downward trailing between buildings
they race madly driving and dodging
hawkeye looks at black widow astonished
nat what are you doing
a little help
hawkeye pulls the trigger twice nocks an arrow and points it at loki smiling
ive got him
black widow looks down and building her momentum she jumps of the chariot lands on top of stark tower rolling herself to the edge
as loki looks up shocked at what just happened the hulk is leaping up and kicks loki hurtling towards the glass window
he collapses as he hits the wall
the hulk jumps in ready to attack
loki rolls himself up in a flurry of broken glass black widow walks up the cms machine
selvig slumped down weakened looks at her desperately
the tesseracts energy is firing towards the portal gaining in strength at the surge of energy moving through the sky
lokis scepter the energy
the tesseract cant fight
you cant protect against yourself
its not your fault
you didnt know what you were doing
well actually i think i did
i built in a safety to cut the power source
it might be able to close the portal
selvig looks down
he sees a and im looking right at it
thor rides on top of chariot smacking several riders with the hammer
as thor takes the reins a chitauri leviathan crashes through a building knocking him down to where cap is fighting off soldiers
iron man flies right next to the chitauri leviathan and aims his laser booster at it
sir we will lose power before you cut through that shell
iron man flies up ahead facing the oncoming monster
you ever hear the tale of jonah
i wouldnt consider him a role model
arsenal on the suit
the chitauri leviathan opens its mouth
iron man flies in and bursts out the other end making the chitauri leviathan collapse
iron man rolls down the street
the wind is knocked out of him
he looks up with an overwhelming sigh as a small band of chitauri soldiers rush towards him holding out their rifles
hawkeye turns to fire his last arrow
using his bow as a staff he knocks some chitauri soldiers before yanking his last arrow off the dead body a chitauri soldiers
hawkeye nocks his arrow dives down the building and fires his grappling arrow up into the side of building
falling down hawkeye finds the momentum and swings himself into a building and cannonballs in
the hulk holds chitauri soldiers by the face and slams them down
more keep coming
hulk looks up
hundreds of riders hover over him
they begin to fire energy blasts
hulk takes a lone pilot sits in his cockpit listening
director fury is no longer in command
override order alpha
prepare to takeoff
he ignites his engine
back in the bridge agent hill sees on her screen alpha preparing to leave
sir we have a bird in motion
anyone on the deck we have a rogue bird
we need to shut it down
take off is not authorized
he takes aim and fires hitting the tail end of the jet
the jet skids off towards the edge
suddenly another alpha jet flies off
fury stands there knowing he cant do anything about it
stark you hearing me
we have a missile headed straight for the city
three minutes at best
stay low and wipe out the missile
iron man fights off as many chitauri soldiers as he sustain
jarvis put everything we got into the thrusters
i just did
iron man leaves the streets and flies up into the sky
alpha arrives outside the city
he flips the switch to press the button
he presses it
the missile is flying out to destination is in minutes seconds mark
captain america and thor battle side to side
cap and thor both throw their respected weapons
thor catches mjolnir but as cap turns an energy blast strikes him down hard
thor runs over to a broken car swings the hammer and flips the car over and over on its side crushing a few chitauri soldiers
cap tries to get up
thor helps him back to his feet
cap raises his shield back up
you ready for another bout
you gettin sleepy
selvig back in scientist mode clacks away at his laptop
black widow grabs lokis scepter slowly breaks into the force field almost touching the tesseract
i can close it
can anybody hear me
i can shut the portal down
stark these things are still coming
i got a nuke coming in its gonna blow in less than a minute
and i know just where to put it
iron man catches up now comes at the missile from behind
the missile speeds on
iron man grabs it from behind gripping it tightly
with a mighty effort he wrenches the rocket off its course
steering it from behind he accelerates quickly flying straight up into sky towards the portal
stark you know thats a one way trip
save the rest for return j
shall i call miss potts
you might as well
pepper along with her crew watches on t
in horror the destruction in new york
on the table her cell is vibrating with tonys picture on it
back in the bridge every single agent holds their breath as they too watch iron man fly up into the portal
iron man climbs higher and higher over the city gaining speed suddenly flings himself through the portal
the suit begins to freeze
tony looks in horror
every single agent cheers
he tries to communicate with tony
we then see tonys horror
the black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster
most of them hang still in the air
some move swimmingly about
iron man lets go of the missile
it whistles off into the blackness as iron man idly falls back down the portals opening
the missile reaches the main ship
the main ship implodes causing the entire armada to burst into a supernova creating a spectacular heavenly display
suddenly all of the chitauri soldiers and chitauri leviathans keel over and begin to shake then stop
they all fall over
the avengers look up at their consultant not sure if hell make it through
still holding the scepter in hand black widow shifts around waiting
come on stark
thor and cap see the supernova coming towards them
thor nods to cap
to black widow close it
without hesitating black widow pulls the scepter out the tesseract turns off its energy beam
the portal quickly closes
a small figure is hurled backwards into the open now closed portal
plummeting to the earth
son of a gun
tight on iron man he keeps falling
hes not slowing down
thor swings mjolnir around
just as thor flies up the hulk hulk throws iron man off him
thor and cap run over to him
thor rips off tonys helmet
he appears to be dead
they stand around not sure
the hulk yells in fury
the noise startles what the hell
what just happened
please tell me nobody kissed me
good job guys
lets just not come in tomorrow
lets just take a day
have you ever tried shawarma
theres a shawarma joint about two blocks from here
i dont know what it is but i wanna try it
looking up at stark tower were not finished yet
and then shawarma after
loki crawls onto the stair looking like a piece of shit rag doll
he takes a few breathers senses someone is behind him
he turns to find the avengers staring at him pissed
if its all the same to you
ill have that drink
in tv news montage about the avengers we see various reports of what happened
some people agree that the avengers did good protecting the city
others believe it was their cause
in new york
give me a break
these so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city
this was their fight
where are they now
that this was somehow their fault
captain america saved my life
wherever he is wherever any of them are i just wanna say thank you
the avengers take thor and loki who is handcuffed and muzzled to a blocked area
thor shakes hands with his team and gives selvig a hug
tony opens the tesseracts case
banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube held by thor
thor gives loki the other end who reluctantly takes it
the asgardians leap into the energy beam
then one by one the group splinters off strolling into different directions
banner climbs in with tony in his sportscar
steve rides away in his harley
natasha and clint climb back into shield cars
they all part
fury is facing once more members of the world security council
where are the avengers
im not currently tracking their whereabouts
id say theyve earned a leave of absence
and the tesseract
the tesseract is where it belongs out of our reach
thats not your call
i didnt make it
i just didnt argue with the god that did
so you let him take it and the war criminal loki who should be answering for his crimes
oh i think he will be
i dont think you understand what youve started
letting the avengers loose on this world
they surely are
and the whole world knows it
every world knows it
was that the point of all this
fury walks out towards the bridge
fury and agent hill walk together toward the window looking out into the world
sir how does it work now
theyve gone their separate ways some pretty extremely far
we get into a situation like this again what happens then
theyll come back
you really sure about that
because well need them to
agent hill turns around
fury looks out smiling
pulls out showing the letters for stark tower have been blown away and all that remains is a giant a
