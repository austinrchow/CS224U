written by john glenn travis wright march close on a wooden stick figure toy held by a six year old boy
another boy grabs the toy away and runs off laughing children are playing under a cluster of date palms part of a small desert commune somewhere in the middle east
their mothers veiled in black gather and talk
bearded turbaned men carrying ak s argue politics
a domestic even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world
a caravan of vehicles race down a highway
suvs mounted with surface to air rpgs form a protective cordon around a black mercedes
as the cars roar into lens we go
to pov though a long range scope the caravan as seen by a two man special ops team perched on a ridge
as the leader surveils the cars his partner finishes assembling a two foot uav unmanned aerial vehicle rigging it with explosives we have visual onthetarget
confirm go for uav launch
sat feeds monitor the caravan
military brass observes secretary of defense geoff callister s african american eyes with soul and a wary intelligence
beside him colonel thompson full bird decorated
alpha one youre confirmed go active uav at gps papa zulu three zero
the ops team activates a remote transmitter launching the uav into the sky like a small rocket amazingly its silent
an airborne feed from the uav shows it descending on the caravan
a pentagon techie manipulates a joy stick controlling the drone from miles away we have system control
activate laser mic
drone pov tracking the caravan singling out the mercedes
the drone emits a thin laser beam that hits its rear windshield over speakers voices speak balochi
a translator listens is it him
four males one of thems speaking with a
i think its a rakhshaniadialect consistent with our intel on al khoei
gimme voiceprint analysis
the screen pops to an audio waveform of the conversation
voiceprint analysis finishes the screen shows a file photo of a im not taking to the president
john weigh in here
he looks to a plasma the presidents cabinet is assembled via teleconference from the white house situation room cia and nctc concur this is the target based on reliable intel
from the brits
whip to another monitor the caravan starts to veer off road
sire theyre pulling off the highway
we have abort recommendation
the analysis array reads recoindation abort mission
the source of this recommendation for now remains a mystery
if its him this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime we cant let him go
beat torn alright stay with him
the satellite view shows the caravan approaching the commune
mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive
armed men emerge
intercutting the pentagon ops room the computer pinpoints dots on the satellite feed that represent weaponry on site weve got ak s rpcs chaparral guided missiles looks like a training
the desert bodyguards cluster around a turbaned man as he emerges from the mercedes
it looks a lot like the man from the file photo but the beard makes it hard to confirm
mid air with the uav it swoops targeting the man snap the pentagon a blurry snapshot of his face appears
a digital wire frame is overlaid on the mans face i probable match
abort rec holds
the desert now our guy disappears into the crowd as they begin moving toward a large wooden plank on the desert floor
some of the men take hold of the plank drag it back to reveal
the pentagon same image in real time on the feeds what is that a weapons cache
sir the placement of stones around the pit markers for the five pillars of islam
i think its a funeral
everyone trades looks this just got even more complicated
the desert from the back of a tented truck a body is lifted shrouded in white
the men carry it through blowing sand
the procession stopping at the pit
they begin lowering the body
the pentagon on monitors a section of the geneva convention sir striking a funeral would put us in violation of the geneva convention
once this guys gone hes gone
the pentagon general council pipes in hors de combat legally wed be open to international prosecution
but we have no independent intel verifying its in fact a funeral and the presence of weapons certainly leaves room for interpretation
i have potus calling from air force one
a beat looks around
everyone agree this is the best course of action
no one dissents
callister picks up mr
president we have
identity match on majid al khoei
there is some possibility hes at a funeral but we dont know
regardless counsel thinks we can claim overriding legal authority
also you should be aware we have an abort recommendation but your cabinet the speaker the joint chiefs urge a go
you left yourself out of the lineup
as the message on the monitor starts yessir
we gauge our strategy by two standards the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage
at probability we dont have either one
and if it is al khoei and he walks sir were putting our people at risk
theres a long silence as the president considers
i respect your caution geoff but we wont get another chance like this
you have a green light
callisters obviously opposed but he bites his tongue understood
hangs up were weapons free
and with deadly calm techies execute orders into headsets switching to tac mts active painting the acquisitions good target the women begin to sing the nasheen a
funeral song praising allah
the beautiful voices grow until all other sound is gone
drone pov the feed from the camera inside the nose cone as it launches its missile it zooms toward the funeral gathering the haunting beautiful voices wail
in the moment before impact we see birds flying across the great plain
a herd of running gazelles
the desert wind blankets a layer of sand over the shrouded body in the pit
a childs hand grasping his mothers
credit se uence words close up
a digitized electronic scan as if theyre being analyzed by someone we the people of the united states
more perfect union
highlights of the constitution the
declaration of independence
we land on
whenever any form of government becomes destructive
it is the right of the people to alter it or to abolish it
close in on these last words abolish it
were looking at a digital timer ticking down crucial seconds then a mans face intense focused on something below screen this is jerry shaw handsome roguish
somewhere between an adult and a child under his breath damnit
you gotta make a choice
you gotta move i know
who are you gonna be
so jerry makes his move which we see is slamming down a playing card representing a group of dwarves
he sits across from kwame
theyre playing a geeky role playing card and dice game cash on the table
i just blocked your ass and attacked with checks card ancient mastery points
dwarves dont have that read the oracle text my friend
shit a thick mascara black lipstick becky enters removing her smock you know what would be great
if you guys took a longer break
thatd be awesome
whenre you going to start wearing makeup
kwame laughs as becky tosses her smock at jerry the collators broken
dude no its not
putting on a jacket oh yeah it is dude
she heads out as jerry collects the cash
kwame puts on his own smock as jerry offers him a quick lesson your first mistake
power can come from anywhere tomorrow night ill give you first roll and a bonus pack if y
im not gonna be here tomorrow remember
im going to cornell
and jerry stops
a hit to the solar plexus
wherever we are this kids off to a bright future
but not jerry
good for you
so its your last night
youre gonna spend it collating
but she said the collators broken
and thats why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer
congratulations on cornell though thats huge
track with him out to
a counter area as he pins on his nametag jerry
rows of copy machines and computer cubicles
he takes his place behind a register
smiles getting it up welcome to kinkos how can i help you
the chugclick chugclick chugclick sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they become the sound of the krak krak kracking subway
we glimpse people looking at their blackberrys
talking on cell phones
listening to ipods and playing game boys
the news plays on an lcd mounted on the train wall
a society lost in an electronic elsewhere
and jerry with a sketch pad in his lap
a surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a large dog weird but hes got talent
the tv disturbs his concentration news footage of bombed out embassies emergency vehicles wounded victims a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings believed to be in
retaliation for a deadly attack outside abadan that killed forty people
though the white house has denied involvement shia leaders have denounced the u
al jazeera footage a shia spokesman is translated into english
your embassies were only the beginning
our warriors are already within your borders
until american leadership is removed from power allahs revenge is upon you
and during all this jerry notices something people are glancing at each other aranoid
what a fucking world
an atm card gets slid into the slot
jerry looks up
the atm camera is staring right at him
then a beep gets his attention insufficient funds
he processes this a moment
his exhale doesnt just say fuck it says fuck knew it
saying its a modest place would be kind
jerry opens his mailbox
just bills some of which will go unpaid this month
a beat as he shoves them back in and we hard cut to a door opens mrs
wierzbowski jerrys elderly polish landlady
pleased to see him but painfully annoyed to know whats coming jerry
whatever are you cooking right now
is the greatest thing ive ever smelled in my life i swear to god is schab wieprzowy po polsku you have the rent yes
puts cash in her hands heres some of it most of it but ive got something else for you
wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is
knows she cant resist him close on jerry pushing a thumb tac into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway
pull back to reveal about other sketches on the wall
all of the same dog
the actual dog johann lies underneath the kitchen table
so i think
no im pretty sure thats the best one so far yes
is good rent is better
she puts a bowl of stew into jerrys hands
you are hungry i am guessing
oh no no
i couldnt looking down at bowl unless you know you insist
he sits at the table starts eating
this is their routine
so where is girl
i dont see her
oh the redhead
she got smart
like the others
well womenareipretty smart
you are like johann
jerry stops eating mouth full
as johann looks up
your im like your dog
look at him
is big dog
but he believe
he is terrier
so is labrador
but no labrador
somehow jerry cant get his eyes off johann
quietly why do you think that is
as she pours a drink into a plastic cup perhaps many things
when i rescue johann from pound they say he was abuse
they kick him when baby make him feel not big
hands jerry the cup you need someone for rescuing you
jerry looks at her sad smiles
takes a sip and holy shit this is vodka jesus its eight thirty in the morning you cannot eat bigos without vodka
adjusting to it jerry drinks again as his cell phone rings
he looks at his phone freezing
is the girl
tell her you
then ask if she give you money for rent
but weve pushed in on jerry who stares at the name on the phone
somethings affecting him deeply
he says quietly its my mother
even quieter gets up is problem
jerry steps outside as the phone keeps ringing debating what to do
finally he answers as if ready for punishment hey mom
jerry stands there in silhouette
something is happening
suddenly he loses his balance sinks to the floor phone to his ear staring in pain mourners are gathering in their somber best shaking hands
across the street we find jerry getting out of a taxi
standing in a rumpled suit
grim the last thing he wants to do is enter that church
its almost as if he cant
finally from somewhere strength
he walks forward
jerry heads down the aisle painfully self conscious
most of the mourners are in the pews turning to look at him as he passes
when suddenly theres a scream of terror and jerry braces as if he was expecting it looks over at a woman pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she
collapses jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him no
i im not him
all eyes on him
his voice sad heartbroken its okay
im not paul
locks eyes with his mother and father up in the front pew
their eyes red from crying withered shells
and jerry gives a lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the coffin
devastated he leans in and we move around to see the body and its fucking him jerrys very own face but one that seems to have been reconstructed after some
kind of accident
gruesome and handsome all at once
this was paul shaw
jerrys identical twin
off the surreal moment
a reverbed trumpet plays the tune familiar
in fact its the national anthem booming from a trumpet played by an year old boy kyle holloman
a woman blurs into frame rachel holloman searching for car keys
smart beautiful but fiercely independent shes a single mom whos taken lifes knocks
never as cool headed as she wants to be shes on a short fuse with everyone but kyle whom she adores okayokay
okay we came home put down the leftovers you turned on the tv i went over i said no tv she turns to the tv area and walks straight into
stuns her momentarily but she doesnt break stride were gonna be late huh
absolutely not i turned it off came over here checked messages put the leftovers in the
knocked over the phone right knocked over the phone put it back put the food in the fridge she opens the fridge her keys sit atop a tupperware container
kyle hits a high note and we slam to the key turning in the ignition of a crappy old honda
the engine chokes sputters
rachels tense we need to get a new car i like your car
were gonna be late
the engine still split sput sputtering
whizzes by slows up ahead at a bus stop
rachel gives up jumps out no were not the bus
are you kidding
rachel and kyle haul ass toward the bus stop both struggling with kyles carry on a
garment bag her purse and a trumpet case marked with stickers green bay packers among them i put vitamins in your toiletry bag dont forget to take two in the
morning and one at night i know and your inhaler which i may need to use now is in the outside pocket wait
they rush back to a mailbox she pulls bills from her purse more bills
yup thats what happens when you have a kid on lay away
they smile at each other
when suddenly a bus roars past the wind gusts and the bills go flying into traffic rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars runs into traffic as she chases the
bills screeching and honking around her porsche honks as it and she runs back to kyle throws the bills in the mailbox you swore again
was that our bus
rachel looks pan to across the street the bus is now leaving the bus stop
pan back to rachel shit
okay now were gonna
she puts fingers in her mouth and whistles hard for a cab a class of music students boards and amtrak train
rachel and kyle are running through the crowd toward them scuze us coming through sorry wait
finally they arrive
kyles teacher mrs
miller smiles under the wire gulping breaths hi sorry rachel holloman we met of course barbara miller
looks at watch you should probably and rachels stomach drops
knows theyve been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it
turning kyle to face her
i want you to have an awesome time i will mom you can eat junk food just remember to brush your teeth and if youre gonna goof off just be
really smart about it and try not to stay up past your bedtime you get really cranky when you do that turns to mrs
miller he gets very contrarian if he doesnt get at least eight im afraid its time to board mrs
tears springing to rachels eyes
she tries to hide them
bending down to be eye to eye with her son
sotto you see all these kids
theyre all calling their mothers
you just do it more its only two days mom
you could try and some have fun too wouldnt kill ya
hugging him i love you so much baby
youre my everything
rock the house
love you too they separate she watches as kyle boards with mrs
miller call me
your mom gonna be okay
as they head into the train rachel steels herself and goes
passing the baggage area
we hold as the porter places kyles trumpet case on a conveyor belt
oddly its electronically redirected away from the other instruments down a separate belt where it emerges in a pick up turnstile
its lifted off the track by
a middle eastern man
and the strangest thing he touches his ear and murmurs something in tajiki
to no one
like a crazy person
what the hell
walks to the curb where his white van idles
on the side is a decal hassad dry cleaners
loads the trumpet inside as we solemn quiet
mourners talking in hushed tones
and over these shots whispered voices you didnt know either
i knew he had a brother
but not a twin that was
i know i know
four women sit together
one glances across into a sitting room where jerry sits alone on a sofa
were close on jerry now
holding a glass etched with hearts
looking at it as if it means something
somehow his childhood
he looks up at the stairs as if knowing he needs to go up there
so he does
we move with him when was the last time they saw him
margaret said years
all of them awarded to paul shaw
tight on jerrys face as he scans the shelves of evidence
evidence that he had a brother
a superior brother
again and again we see paul shaw
then jerry finds one framed certificate
in the back
a junior high art prize
awarded to jerry shaw
he smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him
the worst day of this mans life
jerry composes himself quickly
they stare for a moment
six months without a boo or a bah
didnt realize itd been that long
your mom was worried
so where were you this time
then a touch reticent singapore
alaska for a few weeks
got a job for a while
met some great p thats nice
looks like youre really seeing the world
im trying you know just to but william has just started crying
sobs of absolute loss
jerry stands there frozen until william embraces him
jerry hugs him back tightly grateful and starting to feel again
and just then william says quietly through tears you sound just like him
jerrys eyes find a point in space
this is love by proxy
and now he hugs his father in support not unity
william pulls back
takes his wallet from his pocket i want to give you some uh
dad im okay
im doing really well
his father holds out some bills
north of two hundred dollars
its a stand off
the question is does jerry have enough pride to reject the offer
and the answer is
close on the pin number again getting punched in
then find jerry exhausted from the funeral slipping the money his father gave him into a deposit envelope
a glance at the security camera
then a beep makes him look at the screen
and we punch in tighter on jerry who stares stunned
the screen reads balance
what the hell
glances back to the people behind him they want him to hurry
he hits cancel
but the machine as if disobeying spits out five bills whoa jerry stabs cancel again
now ten more bills come out
he glances at the people in line nervous two seconds sorry eyes flick back to the atm camera
he covers it with his hand pushes cancel again and again
ten thousand dollars in bills has come out getting jammed in the slot
people start to peer over as jerry scrambles to keep the cash from flying everywhere
the machine stops
he stuffs all the money in his pocket
jerry enters a little dazed heads for his apartment as mrs
wierzbowski steps from
hers johann hiding behind her jerry
all day they make delivery
jerry moves fast to her a little out of breath shoves a thousand dollars into her hand heres the rest of the rent next months too where do you get
just take it its okay i owe you i had to open your apartment too many packages come they come for hours for me
jerry whips open his apartment door as far as he can its blocked by something
he reaches in flips on the light boxes everywhere
reeling he picks one up rips it open
packing peanuts fly a pair of night vision binoculars
what is happening
goes through more boxes in a flurry of cuts false passports a police scanner body armor hand guns large bags of fertilizer strange chemicals manuals
jerry looks around fear and confusion growing
his cell rings
startles him all the lcd says is answer now
a womans voice
we cant place why
but its really creepy
look out your window
theyre coming for you
totally thrown what
who is this
you have to run
who the hell is this
rips back the curtain to see a swat van screeching up a flack jacketed team pours out assault rifles ready
jerry goes pale
leave your residence
get to the mathis train station
you have minutes
jesus christ whats happening
run or youll be captured and convicted go now
pounding boots against pavement outside
jerry whirls goes out to the hall hears them coming
starts to run
but a hands behind your head
down whats going on
is jerrys slammed to the ground as we cut to
jerry sits cuffed to a table
frightened confused on the defensive
the door opens and agent thomas morgan enters s born to the job never smiles
takes a seat opens a file look man i dont know what this is i dont know how all that shit got in my apartment but unless youre my lawyer
i understand youve had a tough day
it hasnt been ideal

morgan tosses his black leather badge wallet onto the metal table
it lands open with a substantial clung
tom morgan special agent attached to the national counterterrorism center
stares rocked counterterrorism center

morgan pulls out a surveillance photo jerry college age at a student rally holding up a sign with an image of the pentagon crossed out in red declare war on

morgan stares at him unmoved
a woman i dont know
she called me and told me i was gonna be arrested

jerry yells morgan meets supervisor martin krebs a senior d

theyve all been observing through a two way mirror
latesha refers to a laptop one she clutches like a safety blanket he fits the profile disaffected susceptible to radical indoctrination problem with authority
doesnt vote or pay taxes but witness statements all say hes not a player
he does sketches of his landladys dog
oh and hes lying about the woman who called him we checked the records no calls came in before we picked him up what about the brother
mid level fso
been stateside the past three years
no red flags
he was killed when a truck ran a light in crystal city
that kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying coincidence
so either hes a rank and file sleeper or a dumbshit mule
eager to contribute or a misdirect
theres nothing subtle about him or the gear
hes not exactly a pro morgan levels a look at grant as krebs takes
figuring out the next move get smith on financials rieger on travel and lets dryclean family and friends

rachels doing paperwork at her desk
for the night
an attorney named michael approaches warm good looking by all standards a catch
she doesnt look up

which seems like a perfect opportunity for a second date
in theory but i gotta site check this brief couriers coming in

time i told you that but im so busy and

kyle goes to college in nine years it should be somewhere around then
i would so wait a decade for you

and with a smile he heads off
she watches him go dammit
really liking him in this moment
she watches longer than she should
then goes back to her work
he gets in the elevator and shes left in her solitude
and now we begin to see the first signs of it loneliness
the consequence of not really letting anyone into her life
she stares off as bling
an im box pops up on her screen rachel holloman
answer the phone
and just like that the phone rings
staring at the im
then at the phone
answers it hello
its the same chilling female voice click on the link at the bottom of the page
rachels eyes drop down to the link at the bottom of her screen
leans out from her cubicle to look around no one else who is this
as she clicks on the link
and a streaming image appears a with other kids
rachels breath is taken away whats going on
who are you
would you risk your life for your son
rachel jumps to her feet trying to breathe through the panic
no one this isnt funny
who are you
ican derail his train
i can kill him at any time
ill ask again would you risk
your life for your son
suddenly the browser goes blank unable to access page
kyles taken from her that fast she gasps terrified
follow my instructions precisely
theres a vehicle parked at the northeast exit of your building
the keys are in the ignition
off rachels stunned terrified face
a fax spits out a page with the department of justice logo from the attorney generals office
subject shaw jerry
jerry sits in his cell lost looks up as an agent enters time for your phone call
i thought there was no phone call
attorney generals office changed their mind
jerrys led into a holding room with a phone on the wall
the agent exits electronic door locking behind him
jerry thinks deciding who to call
swallows his pride starts to dial his father
but the ringing suddenly eerily lowers in hello
i told you to
tight on jerry now terrified breathless no wav who are you
behind jerry the steel door unlocks he whirls to the opening door waiting for a guard someone anyone
but no one comes
what the hell is this
follow the water
or the fire will kill you
howd you get on this phone
are you the one doing all this to me
follow the water
leave the building and jerry spins back
looks up at a wall vent near the ceiling smoke
a smoke alarm blares
take brisbane street to the elevated train station you have six minutes
wait what dyou mean follow the water
jerry turns in the hallway a ceiling sprinkler sprays
the fire grows raging from the vent people scramble morgan runs to the interrogation room sees through the glass that jerrys gone
to a passing agent wheres shaw
parker took him to make his phone call
on whose authority
smoke and fire and a blaring alarm as jerry follows the sprinklers amazinglyeach sprinkler activates as he approaches creating a safe path through the flames
finally he gets to a dead end a window the fire raging behind him heat increasing as jerry grabs a nearby chair and turns through the wild fire morgan at
the other end of the corridor gun drawn the fire erupts between them obscuring each others view
no choice jerry turns hurls the chair at the window it shatters
jerry prepares himself then jumps to a drain pipe grabbing it and lowering himself from the third floor dropping the last ten feet landing hard recovering running off a subway
train pulls into the station
whip pan to find jerry running onto the platform out of his mind scared passes a surveillance camera looking down as if watching him jerrys eyes scan the area
then he freezes
the electronic how is this happening
across the station jerry sees morgan and a team of agents pouring down the stairs he runs onto the train as the doors close morgan turns doesnt see him
the train at full speed
jerry tries to calm down make some sense
the security camera in the corner turns from it
onthe train broadcasts cnn has elevated our alert status to threat level orange
insiders say tomorrow nights state of the union address will focus on
next stop montrose station
a cell rings from a phone peeking out of a sleeping passengers backpack
he looks at it oddly suspicious
the lcd goes black then the words answer it jerry appear
looks around no one saw it
slips the phone from the guys backpack turns away hits answer stay on the train for three more stations until you r but jerry hangs up wont have this
and as the train slows he moves to the door and jumps off the train pushes through the busy platform
spots two transit officers talking on radios as they scan the crowd
jerry turns and ducks into another train just as
the doors close
jerry sits exhales
then the cell phone which he stole rings again
it finally stops ringing
could it all be over
no because the tumble
and the train stops
everyone looks around confused frightened
suddenly the train starts moving backwards the rear subway cars now become the front
tilt down to the track it switches over to another line all
by itself people are freaking out and jerry feels some insane guilty complicity in all this as the phone
rings again jesus and he answers i told you not to get off yet
listen lady who are you
he knows youre here
jerry turns and sees a transit cop through the glass doors that connect the cars hes talking into a shoulder mounted walkie talkie
looking right at jerry
how do you know that
where are you
jerry notices another security camera in the corner as next stop is damen station
take the northwest exit
there will be a black bmw sedan
get in the passenger seat
go to hell
he hangs up drops the phone and stomps on it
eyes from fellow passengers
then every cell phone on board ringing in unison
jerry watches stunned as passengers start answering all hearing the same thing the man in the black t shirt is a wanted terrorist
his name is jerry shaw
everyone turns to jerry backs away but a huge man stands you jerry shaw
everyone looking a few even start to move for him
jerry goes for the door but the subway cops there about to enter but the doors locked
jerry yells to the passengers
the cop pulls his gun yelling through the glass suddenly the train speeding the doors open
a blast of wind
people scream take cover as the
pulls into the station the cop about to shoot when jerry jumps landing hard on the platform rolls and the cop fires
people scream and run as the moving train separates jerry from the cop jerry gets to his feet sprints towards the northwest exit and out of the station
spots the black bmw sedan parked by the curb sleek ultra fast
jerry tears open the passenger door jumps inside meeting behind the wheel rachel
assuming jerry is behind all of this
jerry breathing hard assuming she is the voice okay what do you want with im not doing a thing until me

and she yanks the steering wheel and the
car makes a frightening screaming left turn as we cut to morgan drives a government issue sedan at mph
over radio all units respond code suspects headed south on stanley morgan makes a hard right
tearing around a corner two cop cars have become three in the rearview mirror even more insane aall
the traffic lights are suddenly changing to create a miracle path for the bmw stopping traffic to let them pass
starting it up again to cut off the cop cars
its as if someone
playing chess with the city grid creeped out the lights are all changing to green
like theyre changing for us
accelerate to sixty turn right in four hundred feet
looking up scared oh no way rachel looks up too eyes wide a ten story tall construction sixt
go to sixty
and suddenly the crane drops the girders rachel screams and the steel beams slam into the pavement just behind the bmw this isnt happening
tries to downshift grinnnnnnnnd
she tries to shift jerry puts his hand on hers jams the gear shift into fourth the car swerves to avoid a car rachel yanks the wheel skids round the
corner more police screech in ahead shes forced to veer onto a one way street
getoffthe street wait willyou shut up
no turnup ahead keep going willyou just shut up and go
wait stop turn letmedo it
the bmw barely avoids one collision after another youll turn at the next alley avoid the police
rachel skids right but two cop cars appear
too late to stop wham
the bmw smashes through both cop cars go flying
looks back holy shit youre doing great
theyre headed for the harbor
gimme roadblocks at granville and sheridan
in the bmw jerry and rachel speed through an industrial marina
up ahead the intersections closed by a police barricade
turn right in two hundred feet
morgans car he sees rachel coming right at him
just before they collide she turns right
morgan slams his brakes his car fishtails the cruisers behind him come to a
stop but now as the car speeds down a narrow artery toward the river accelerate to sixty five
are you trying to kill us
jesus slow down what the hells your name
rachel slow the hell just then ka chunk
something just slammed onto the roof a high pitched vreeeee as he cars tires spin in overdrive but suddenly find no road beneath them
and impossibly as the brick wall grows huge coming right at us through the windshield the car rises off the ground literally flying and now we reveal a giant industrial
magnet attached to the top of the bmw hoisting it up on a dock crane the jib arm pivots swinging them over a crane yard
minds blown they swing past the cranes drivers seat and see
nobodys at the controls
the crane dips them toward a wooden railing overlooking the river they crash through it
the release arm drops the bmw jerry and rachel scream as they plummet but the car doesnt hit water instead it falls onto a garbage barge floating downriver
the car lands in a mountain of trash
the crane stops just as
morgan and the cops appear screeching in at the broken railing
they jump from their cars look down into the river and see nothing
morgan kicks a trash can pissed seal the harbor get divers in the water
pan up to the horizon
where the garbage barge floats lazily down lake michigan
jerry and rachel escaped
jerry dazed but driven slams a piece of plywood again and again into the lexan window of the barges control booth
rachel paces on her cell hearing this is kyle
who is not allowed to
use this phone with my friends
so leave a message mom
its me baby you need to call me
soon as you get this please check your messages and
i love y ou
and she hangs up staringoff
jerrys knocked the window back opens the control booth door and enters examines the controls
the computer panel reads control override
this things on auto pilot or something
which doesnt happen these barges are operated by people
he steps out
in thought tears in her eyes rachel asks dyouthink she could derail a train
are you kidding me
she changed every traffic light
this womans called me on other peoples phones some dude who happened to be sitting next to me
his phone rang it was her
she broke me out of maximum security custod in a way im not even gonna tell you cause you wont believe it and you saw how she directed us away
from the police then lifted us outta the world and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge
can she derail a train
she could probably turn a train into a duck
i think she c
but now he stops because rachel is crying
jerry lamely attempts to backpedal i mean
i dont know im not sure she could derail a train what the hell do i know
rachel brushes her tears away
afraid but fighting it
my son is on a train
she threatened to kill him if i dont do what she says
they share a look
the difference between them galvanized in an instant
she has something to lose
you tell me how does someone do all this
a cell phone
rachel looks down hoping its kyle but its not her phone
they realize the phones somewhere in the trash
jerry starts digging
its nast finally he finds it in an old take out box re the phone
you see what i mean
he wipes it off holds it to his ear despite the stench hello
you both need to swim to shore
go to line tower
swim to shore
are you she wants us to swim
lady what if i told you we dont know how to swim
but you do
ive seen you at the beach house
jerry is chilled and the female was once a swimming instructor at the ymca in westport connecticut
go now or the authorities will find you
theyre more dangerous than the water
click shes gone
jerry hangs up turning something unnerving in his mind
she called you the female
beat weird thats like
something a foreigner would say like a bad translation
but she has no accent
jerry thats your name right
are we swimmincr
does it bring back memories of westport y
pale at a whisper how did you know that
and they turn to look down at the freezing river water as we pre lap the sound of a clear f sharp and cut to an old man blowing into
kyle s trumpet
thick glasses sweater vest instruments stacked all over the place
kyles familiar case with the packers sticker open next to him
you sure you want to replace it
sounds pretty good to me
and we reveal middle eastern man standing at the counter
eyes darting nervousshoves a small box into the mans hand
please do it now
the store owner looks into the box
i do a lot of custom jobs never seen something like this before
i can have it for you by the end of the week
the middle eastern man
mumbling again in tajiki
seemingly to himself
the store owner stares kinda freaked out sorry what
snaps out of it no
is not possible
it must be done this afternoon listen mister the middle eastern man suddenly touches his ear barks out something in tajiki
like hes arguing with someone
are you okay
looks at his watch i will pay you triple
a courier will be by to pick it up at three
do it please
and stepping back he exits quickly
the store owner watches him leave then looks back down at the box
a coast guard cutter floats beside the now abandoned garbage barge
the bmws been lifted ashore by a crane forensic techs comb every inch
morgan circles the car
grant follows a waiting chopper in the background
all the surveillance cameras in the area have turned up nothing no id on the girl nothing on the vin all i want is a goddamn picture of her what
about traffic cams
there are more cameras on that route than the super department of transpo says there was a seven minute equipment failure do not tell me their equipment was down
sir thats what theyre telling me
from northbrook to the
what about the bogus fax from justice was that equipment failure too
no sir theres gotta be someone on the inside
pissed morgan starts fast for the chopper we move with him and grant who keeps up the getaway car was waiting there get me a witness description on the woman
driving remember witnesses
people who see things
jesus is this a lost art
i have markey on that right now morgans phone is ringing he answers morgan

city im going back to forensics
find out where the hell that fax originated
if you dont have good news for me before i touch down you will be demoted to a job that will require you
to touch shit with your hands do you understand me
as morgan hops up onto the moving chopper nobody who works for me calls me sir
its disingenuous might as well be calling me asshole
as grant watches the chopper take off perplexed
an endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers
two figures like specks against the landscape jerry and rachel walking wet cold
and then so youre a twin
who works at a copy place
and she manages a clipped judgemental frankly rude laugh
yeah i know
thats occurred to me
so this whole situation is obviously about him
i would offer this whole situation isnt obviously about anything
just think about it you said your brother worked at the state department so what
so that means he couldve been into anythinc he was a twin you
received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals it seems to me that they sent the stuff to
the wrong brother wait a minute youre suggesting all that stuff was for paul
as they approach tower hey im sorry that he died im not trying to insult his memory he hasnt been dead long enough to become a memory
and if you knew paul which you did not youd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever youre implying im implying if
then why you
well hasnt that been the question my whole life
you know how i know paul wasnt a terrorist
because if he had been he wouldve been the best fucking terrorist in history he wouldnt have gotten caught the united states would be a crater he wouldve won awards
for being a great terrorist
what about you
whyd she choose you whats your day job
i know it isnt manual shift driver
i did just fine driving thanks
im a paralegal i have no connection to anything
suddenly theyre interrupted by the roostertail of dust approaching in the distance
rachel stops dead and on instinct grabs jerrys hand all their mutual hostility vanished someones coming
and whats approaching is the hassad drycleaners
it comes to a stop and out steps the middle eastern man
stands some twenty five feet from them
are you jerry shaw
who are you
rachel grabs jerrys arm as the man reaches into his jacket whoa i dropped it off like she said
the mans pulled out an unusual looking steel key
dropped off what
who are you
take it he tosses the key
it lands large in frame somewhere between them
then whats it for
i dont know i dont care but i will not drive you
you take the van touches his ear beat im not listening to you any more
and the man turns to go just walks away
wait who are you
you have to tell us what you know
and as the man walks away from them his cell phone rings he pulls it out the lcd reads last chance
and the man drops the phone and just starts running and jerry takes off after him hes not letting him go
catches up to the guy and grabs him
spinning him round what do you know
let me go
whos doing this
and they begin to struggle
middle eastern mans dropped cell phone rings
knows somehow its for her she answers stop him now or he will die
looking around how are you seeing us
jerry and the middle eastern man
throwing sloppy punches let go of me
on rachel stop him now
rachel turning to scream at middle eastern man stop
you have to stop
when the middle eastern man cracks jerry in the nose and he goes sprawling
he takes off again yelling back i cannot
i have a family
shes going to kill you
and just then something terrifying an immense power surge heard felt and a six story high coil the size of an suv explodes in sparks
cables blast free
jerry tackles her to safety as the tree trunk cables swing down and strike the middle eastern man and he is slammed off his feet the current making the cable
stick to him like glue
and hes on fire instantly smoke everywhere as hes tossed by jerry and rachel watch this in horror until she looks away
jerry holding her the two in shock strangers in each others arms
having shared another moment too real horror oh my god
oh we we have to do something god
we have to
figure out what to
and then his phone rings
and theyre both too afraid to answer it
finally jerry answers it hand shaking slightly you killed him
you killed that man
it was unavoidable
take the van
drive to indianapolis
west th street
arrive no later than eleven am
disobey and you die
rachels eyes on jerry
she wants us to drive to indianapolis
whats there what
i dont know no this cant keep happening
we have to go to the police explain it explain what
whatre we im not doing it
im not gonna tell them
jerry can see shes losing it
grabs her by the shoulders rachel
shes watching us
you wanna die too
we have to go
rachel looks right at him still shaking knows hes right
as our music builds larger than you might
just the eerie faint whistle of wind
we pan a barren landscape
scattered scorch marks
then a high pitched tone as the pan continues and arrives at a parked military truck which gives us scale to understand the sudden colossal explosion there will be smoke
for hours as a super appears and we hear clapping pull back realizing that we are inside a high tech bunker like structure with six inch lexan windows
a dozen military brass are here applauding
among them is callister
he seems more thoughtful about this
behind him a british dark suited weapons developer speaks that blast was the result of one single crystal of hexomethylne
for those of you who are new today rex is an isotope that leaves no chemical markers its eighty times more powerful than c
colonel thompson also from our opening gestures talk about the detonating system
the developer screws a metal valve into what looks like a can of compressed air saying hex is triggered by an acoustic frequency undetectable to the human ear
for this test we made it audible that was the tone you heard before the explosion the tone was the trigger
whats the risk that another sound could accidentally detonate it
half smile a song on a radio
a howling dog
no the pitch is uniquely programmed and impossible to reproduce
thank you sir
were proud of this ordnance all of us at halloway smith
and while we still hear him speaking we cut to a technician at an assembly line where robot arms work on a stream of components the careful manufacturing of hex
the acoustic trigger and its crystal counterpart
if youre satisfied with todays final test the hex project has met every
the arms package each into separate
containers fit them with shipping labels marked pentagon direct
and were hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase
shipping the product into the field
drift toward an unmanned computer
the screen flickers override in progress
change shipping destination
robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line
a new labels printed latesha walking down a hallway
endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings
her cell rings
its morgan whaddya got
those funny things underneath my not so stylish pantsuit
they brought me all the way to the pentagon
paul shaw wasnt state a chopper roars over skyscrapers
morgan beside the pilot in front listening to latesha over his helmet headset
he was defense
youre kidding me
black file classified b
she turns a corner
down the hallway a phalanx of generals military personnel and scurrying assistants heading towards a set of double doors
some very big meeting about to happen thats the point
no onell tell me
i cross reffed the sci database talked to the intel committee nsa gave me
krebs doesnt want me to ruffle any feathers
ive been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks im a when an mp suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm
he towers over her interns arent allowed on this floor miss
youll have to when latesha wearily flashes him her i
ive got clearance pal
he looks at it
lets her arm go
everybody in this place have a six foot height requirement
continues walking back to morgan anyway
im going back to the office to no no no the pilot signaling to morgan i got the williamson county sheriff on the line morgan holds up a hand one
look i dont have time for this stay there til you get some answers but its a total shut out simms step up i dont care if you have to
go to the
top to do it
whatever means necessary got it
latesha lowers the phone
a huge painting of the battle of el alamein looming behind her
back down the hallway as all the brass heading into the meeting room and catches sight of callister amongst them
for just a second
this is it
before suddenly rushing forward and calling out secretary callister
he looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room
the doors close in lateshas face
the van speeds down a highway passing a sign welcome to indianapolis your home town
jerry drives pensive
rachel stares out the window the shock of what shes seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation
how old is he
in no mood to share kyle
whats he doing on a train
she really doesnt want to talk
he goes to a music magnet
his schools on a tour of washington
theyre playing at the kennedy center
she turns to him
eyes burning into the side of his head
knows what hes thinking
parents werent allowed to go
is that okay with you
is it okay
i could give a shit
then whats with the qualified nod
im not allowed to nod
not if youre iudging me
im just making conversation
you think i should have gone with him anyway
im just thinking sounds like a big deal especially for a year old playing at the kennedy center id just think at least one parent might wanna be there to
how do you know kyles dad isnt there
well youre not wearing a ring and you havent mentioned anyone but your son is on that train
even the most pissed off ex wife which im not saying you arent wouldve mentioned it if her exs life was threatened and if kyle was going to meet his
dad in dc
you wouldve tried to call him too
so where is he
as if its any of your business you know what you are
a better driver than you
youre one of those thirties are the new twenties man children
youre glib and wry and find humor in people like me who are actually accountable for the ir lives okay the most fascinating thing here
is that you dont know the first thing about me
i know you work at a copy store
what are you thirty one thirty two
youre obviously articulate love being stuck in a van with my fucking guidance counselor and i know your brother just died and he worked for the state department you need
to stop talking about my brother ive had enough of that youre in denial if you ham im not talking about dont think that has anything this to do with whats happening right now dammit
im not kidding
but i can tell you that stop
whatever he did whatever he was part of has put my son in danger whether you believe it or not
jerry yanks the wheel hard peeling across four lanes of traffic
skids to a stop by a curb pops open the door
jerry gets out slams his door shut
you cant leave me
my brothers a terrorist and im a loser right
he starts to walk away
rachel desperately opening her door dont walk away
throwing up arms im done
youre on your own
rachel starts running after him panicked leadin please
i need you
cupping his ear
whatd you just say
i cant do this without you
you mean without the man child
rachels reserves crumble
its the first time weve been apart me and kyle
since the day he was born
and i let him get on that train almost whispering i let him get on
jerry sees all the panic and horror and guilt in this womans eyes
theyre both in pain
points his finger right at her
no more accusing my brother of shit you know nothing about is that understood
rachel looks at him
finding her voice again
they turn around
and get back in the van
morgan runs towards it the sheriff and a power worker trying to keep up
chopper in b
police officers work the scene
never seen anything like it
power blew out from franklin high school down to the river club
i cant explain it they arrive at the body
contorted blackened teeth bared
we know hes male though
probably in his s
points off tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three
three sets of shoe prints
and were about miles from the river just then we see agent grant running towards them stumbling on some rocks
up a cell call agent morgan
out of breath sotto just got off with hq
the fake fax from justice that got shaw his phone call
came from inside justice
you absolutely sure on that
yes s catches himself yes i am
got something as the m
pulls something out of middle eastern mans ear a small charred gizmo
small wire sticking out
lifts it up for them to see
morgan takes the tweezers looks like a bone mic military grade
cant even get these things on the black market
looks around landscape someone was talking to him
somethings rotten in denmark
no somethings rotten everywhere
morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper
the sheriff helplessly calls after him well be needing that for evidence
jerry and rachels van pulls up to the federal bank of indianapolis
across the way is a stadium for the colts
the parking lots full mid game
steeling themselves for the inevitable
a federal bank
could be worse
a federal prison
a wall mounted clock ticks to whip to jerry and rachel entering
security cams everywhere
as they nervously cross the floor they pass two armed brinks couriers entering an elevator
a bank manager approaches mr
i understand youre in a hurry why dont i show you to your box
what the fuck
then yes thank you wed
the manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a thermographic scanner
the manager looks at jerry expectantly waiting for him to place his hand on it
he does a flash of light identifying him as saxon carl
jerrys eyes this is madness
the elevator doors open
they exit the elevator the manager leads them to a deposit box
he pulls out a metal key identical to the one the middle eastern man gave jerry
jerry takes out his key it fits perfectly
they turn the box slides out the manager lays it on a steel table
leaves to give them privacy
jerry and rachel stare at the box
you gonna open it
maybe its not gonna be so bad
maybe its something good
they meet eyes
tentatively he raises the lid to find two glock pistols and the same bone mic we saw
pull out of the middle eastern mans ear
oh shit its bad they look at each other
jerry puts the
mic in his ear both guns are loaded safetys off
in sixty seconds two men will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase
take it by force if necessary then exit the building
jerry cant fucking believe this
rachel dying to know what
i dont suppose theres any easier way to get whatever the hell it is you want is there
but shes not answering
what now what are we
theyre coming were supposed to rob them are you kidding me
hands her a gun just take i t no
i dont even let kyle play with water guns
hey i applaud your parenting skills take it
the footsteps come closer as two men appear
brinks couriers from the lobby one of thems carrying a metallic briefcase cuffed to his wrist the other spots jerrys gun and reacts going for his gun dont
the men freeze jerry holds his gun awkwardly uh
hows it going
it on the floor
we dont wanna hurt you guys we like you guys just we need the case
youre bringing a shitstorm on your heads you know that
i think were already mid shitstorm
the men exchange glances
reluctantly courier punches a combination into the cases padlock the cuff pops free from his wrist
he slides it over to jerry who reaches for it
and courier makes a move smashing jerry back knocking the gun out of his hand
jerry crashes to the ground the bone mic falling out of his ear
he turns shit
sees it skitter under the table
the courier sees it too and grabs his chance snatches up the case and runs for the elevator rachel rushes him trips him he falls dazed jerry leaps up but
courier effortlessly flips him on top of the steel table slams jerrys head into the counter unholsters a back up gun from his ankle brings the barrel up as bam
the couriers spin to see rachel holding the gun that was kicked across the floor courier drops it jerry rises wipes blood from his lip
rachel is fucking on fire shes so tough
aka a mother
gimme the case
they do and jerry and rachel back into the elevator with it
the door closes on them and we cut into alone in the elevator jerry looks down at the
case adrenaline coursing sees a ribbon thin digital timer near the handle
whoa what is that
a timer its counting down they do
that whats it mean
i dunno the only things with timers i can think of are microwaves and
and bombs you were gonna say bombs some coffee makers have timers
and egg timers
yeah jerry its an egg timer what is she saying about it
i dunno i what do you mean you
you lost the mic jerry
thats not optimum
her voice is in the elevator now would you stop doing that
there will thirty five seconds of disconnect during which you need to get yourselves across the street to the stadiums vip parking area unexposed
calling out is this a bomb
cause i am not walking out with a bomb
but shes done talking
as the elevator doors slide open two more brinks couriers wait by an armored truck
jerry and rachel exit trying to look casual
hearts pounding how do i look
like you got into a fight
like you lost one
an alarm sounds
the men race into the bank as jerry and rachel walk right past them starting across the street toward the stadium
no one in sight except a colts paraphernalia vendor
squad cars screech in around the bank
cops jump out drawing their weapons
just keep walking jerry looks at the clock above the stadium
then over his shoulder at the bank
steers rachel over towards the vendor
trying to stay calm
two jerseys and two hats please peyton or vinatieri
i dont know what that means jerry
the two couriers running out of the bank
pointing right at jerry and rachel across the street
everyone starts running toward them
jerry shoves a jersey and hat at rachel put these on do it
they put on the hats and jerseys hurrying towards the stadium
cops screaming at them to stop the vendor screaming that they didnt pay
the cops fan out
cars screech to a stop
flicks another look at the stadium clock
the games over
and in an instant jerry and rachel are lost in a sea of blue and white its impossible to spot them
pushed back by the throng the cops lose sight of them jerry takes rachels arm working against the current towards the vip parking area
a limo waiting there
the chauffeur sees them hurriedly puts down his paper
opening the door mr
hope you enjoyed the game
thanks uh were in kind of a hurry i bet
jerry reacts confused by the
chauffeurs libidinous tone as he closes the back door
they vanish behind tinted windows as cops and agents pass right by them
and as the limo pulls out we reveal etched across the rear just married
latesha sits next to the double doors
laptop open typing madly
shes been waiting a long long time when suddenly they burst open and she snaps to her feet
standing expectantly as general after general files out of the situation room
each as tall and broad as the next looking up at them all afternoon
finally callister walks out flanked by advisors
the weight of the worlds on his shoulders
he looks back preoccupied
she catches up holding her id latesha simms dhs level clearance
i need to ask you a question sir
not now you can direct it to my office
itll only take a minute sir thirty seconds b
can you tell me what it is
cause its not you dont have clearance agent simms and i dont have thirty seconds
so should i assume it has something to
do with the four cvn class aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the strait of hormuz
he looks at her stunned
how the hell
i just checked the intel sir we have some of the same indexes you need to stop assuming
and he moves on
latesha gets jostled by all the brass feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions
until she roars secretary callister
voice echoing down the hail
callister stops short stunned by the gall and volume of this woman
she weaves through the generals planting herself in front of him my departments tracking a home grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a
cell with ties inside this building
now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the navy marching band and with the terror threat rising every three hours im going to
just have to assume youre in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off world war three
so with all due respect you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell b is or this world just fell into an even bigger heap
callister looks down at her completely struck dumb
shes hit a chord deep inside him
its called balls
as jerry and rachel enter the posh lobby of the four seasons an obsequious bellhop approaches hes been waiting for them mr
this way please tries to take the briefcase from jerry who yanks it back no
forces a smile thanks though
latesha dumps her things on a tray moves through a scanner among her items is a set of keys with amini
swiss army knife
shes handed a new badge that reads temporary access
ahead an elevator door opens and we start cross cutting jerry rachel and the bellhop step in
the hop hits penthouse
they travel up so whered you two get hitched
the ding of an arriving elevator matches us back to the level indicator having just arrived at floor b
latesha wedged between two pentagon guards watches nervously as one of them uses a key to open a panel revealing a biometric sensor
the other guard holds his thumb to the scanner yet another panel opens with a red button marked b
it hits latesha b is a secret level in the pentagon
the elevator descends to the final level and opens revealing
foot concrete walls
high tech ventilation and surveillance system
standing there waiting is scott bowman early thirties hasnt seen daylight in a while agent simms
scott bowman welcome to b
if youll follow me
the bellhop dramatically opens the door welcome to paradise
palatial honeymoon suite
picture windows rose petals on the bed
minibar high speed internet thousand count sheets
and if youre looking for the tv he clicks a remote and a plasma tv rises up from a cabinet
on screen a narrated virtual tour
of the hotel dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort
robes behind the door jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places if youll pardon my french
need anything just dial zero im here t
serve im here to please
and he stands by the door waiting for a tip
jerrys still looking aroundwhen rachel catches his eye
jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out two nickels
knock yourself out
the bellhop is still looking down at his palm when jerry shuts the door on him
this is nice and everything but what the hell are we doing here
one night in this place is more than one of my paychecks and thats before taxes he heads over to the minibar
starts rooting through it pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol
whatre you doing
if were going down im gonna go down singing
chocolate covered almonds i love these
can you stop eating for a second
a knock at the door and they stop arguing immediately
they turn hearing the voice its
coming from the t
the four seasons graphic still dancing on screen
there are items you will need for the next step
a small nod from rachel and jerry opens the door
a delivery boy stands there with a bag there ygo mr
have a nice day
jerry takes the bag the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as jerry closes the door on him dazed
starts pulling things from the bag hair
the limousine is waiting for you downstairs
you have minutes to change your appearance
where are we going now
what the hells in the briefcase
your only consideration at present is to deliver it before the timer expires
the breaking point bullshit
this is crazy
youre a television set
you dont watch me i watch you
i wanna know what the hells going on
it would not be efficacious to reveal my intentions
not be efficacious

so why dont you stop hiding and tell us nothing
furious he moves to
the window fine have it your way
lady im gonna scream bloody murder out this window til every cop in a fifty mile radius comes running and im gonna tell them everything even if they think im
a crazy sonofabitch cause at least i wont have to listen to you any more
he yanks the window up he does
four seasons graphic in tv snaps to black then digital static a channel re routing through some distant computer controlled network
and now images file footage a defense department lab technicians assembling computer components putting together a strange looking sphere my name
rachel and jerry stare what the hell is this
close on latesha also reeling as she stares at something o
flickering shadows play across her face it stands for autonomous reconnaissance intelligence analyst
and we reveal the tank
a glassed in wall containing tons of water
an awesome steel sphere in the water suspended by a claw like apparatus
the brain of a com uter network
the very same image jerry and rachel just saw on the tv
twenty two hundred tons of super cooled water keeps her from overheating thats ninety two thousand processors the equivalent of a hundred
millionhuman brains working together as
in awe an electronic espionage system
no that was echelon eavesdropping off satellites
jerry and rachel gape as more images flash the radio domes satellite dishes and mainframes that make up arias domain
i was created by darpa the defense advanced research projects agency in
my primary directive is to protect the national security of the united states
i have access to track the economies populations and military development of every country in the world as well as intercept all global communications from satellites to cell phones to
credit card transactions
jerry and rachel look at each other a computer
after our problem wasnt collecting data it was interpreting it fast enough
ergo quantum rocessin
today there are more microchips than people and they can all be data mined either via direct connectivity or wireless signals lets say were chasing someone with a suitcase nuke
we can order aria to shut down mass transit track the perp through traffic cameras
and if given the order she could even turn a tv into a bomb to take him out
what were all but what if she cant act without authorization
see shes bound not to countermand our laws even the declaration of independence is woven into her source code
her primary roles pre emptive running simulations identifying threats before they become real
wait you think were a
youre a means to an end
on tv constitutional amendments zoom to words in close up under national security directive sub section when units are needed for the national defense civilians shall be ordered to active
youre drafting us
the guy you killed in the desert last time i checked murder wasnt legal
in fact it is
chapter of the uniform code of military justice states desertion is punishable by death
so matter of fact its chilling
and what jerry wants to know more than anything is
whatd my brother have to do with this
a picture of paul shaws defense i
pops on screen we were colleagues
rachel staring at the picture on the screen then back at jerry
can see the blood draining from his face
trying to process no he worked for the state department
everyone in deep operations has a cover
your brother was a horseman
whats the hell is a horseman
you know clever allegory of the apocalypse except were here to prevent it
scott taps the console id photos appear of our four horsemen paul shaw scott and two men well call lowell and jimmy
officially we dont exist but we monitor arias network
there were four of us
til paul died
beat its still raw he was smarter than all of us put together
working here must be pretty tough all the security the pressure long hours
as in did you notice him acting strangely
yeah but you could set your watch by paul
the night he died
he left his shift three minutes early
which you dont do
which he wouldnt do
lateshas suddenly locked in on a clue prelap paul and i had a disagreement before he expired
jerry sinks to the edge of the bed runs hands through his hair to amend it i need jerry to perform a task
you mean died
thats what we call it we humans we call it dying whats the task
to insure the national security of the united states
what dyou need me for then
that is not your concern right now
are you kidding me
alright this is bullshit
im not doing this and youre a computer you dont know a goddamn thing about my brother
i know all about him jerry
the screen snaps to a slide show of paul shaws accomplishments childhood birthday parties sports teams surrounded by friends beautiful girlfriends high school graduation yale graduation standing with their dad
williams arm over his shoulder
jerry almost gasps at arias reaching into his subconscious your brother succeeded in everything he did
before he was a year old he walked
something that took you eighteen months to accomplish
he was highly gifted intelligent and principled in fact the only horseman ever to challenge me
but you jerry the slide show changes to security footage of jerry at kinkos slaving away
playing cards with kwame slacking off
his stomach drops
seeing himself like this
looking so pathetic
the heart has just been cut out of him
rachel sees it you are similar to paul in dna only
historically you have succeeded in nothing
excelled in nothing
you will perform the task because it is your nature to follow
and because youve seen what happens to deserters
the screen goes black
you have minutes to prepare
theres an adjoining suite with a second bathroom
the door to the adjoining suite clicks open
and shes gone replaced by the hotels promotional prattle the four seasons prides itself on excellent service jerry stares overcome
rachel watches him an emotional beat
without answering he grabs the bag
walks into the other room without a word
closes the door
she stares feeling his shame
then her eyes go to the briefcase timer counting down
halloway smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office
the banks roped off and labelled crime area
morgan questions the couriers studies their transport manifest biotech
the chemical company
when they make a new compound they hold it in a vault for clinical trials
scans the manifest whyd the hazmat office issue a special permit for the case
youd have to ask could be anything from a boner pill to a bioweapon they never tell us
tell you one thing though
the guy never handled a gun before
that lands with morgan
he nods to an agent dismissing the couriers
grant approaches we pulled video
no good angles on shaw or the girl
are visible cameras in the lobby
hidden no one can see
gotta be a hacker someone keeping them ahead of us
its a federal bank encryption doesnt get more secure
from now on assume our airs been compromised too
tell everyone to go secure on tac nobody communicates outside this task force without my say so
im on it also they found this upstairs but the trace signals dead holds up an evidence bag with jerrys bone mic inside
do not tell me that is what i think it is
snatches it pissed goddamnit whos leading these people around
someones behind the wizard of oz
he turns and spots something a surveillance camera in the window of a
starts moving toward it
rachels face whips up into frame her hair now dyed blonde
she stares at her reflection trying to process it all
when her cell rings kyle
with a gasp she picks it up kyle
hey mom its
sweetie where areou are you but shes interrupted as she realizes oddly its a voicemail her heart sinks got your message the trains awesome brian tried to burp the alphabet
but gagged when he got to m
ill call when we hit d
bye ma rachel holding the phone like its some kind of life line to her son
when theres a strange beep then the voice of aria your son left that message sixty seconds ago
ill do whatever you want dont hurt him please im begging you
listen youre trying to protect something too right
youll do whatever it takes
well thats what its like to be a mother can you understand that
there were over vocal tone options for my program i chose this one precisely because it sounds so maternal
people tend to do what you ask when you sound like their mother
eyes close so lost jesus
youll see your son again soon
bute theres something i require from you first
jerry approaches the door hair now brown
he knocks rachel
we gotta go intercut rachel in the bathroom her face betraying the horror of what shes just heard what arias just told her to do what
no way i cant just when the time comes ill instruct you to stepaway fromjerry
once you hear those words youll have thirty seconds
you in there
answer jerry please
intercut jerry still standing outside the door
rachels voice mustering strength through the door steeling herself she steps out
forces a smile while averting her eyes
and pushes past h n like hes lagging
latesha paces through frame nervously filing her nails with her mini swiss army knife as she talks into a headset
a desk guard watches annoyed by the filing
i dunno the whole things off somehow but get this b isnt a security classification its a sub level here at the pentagon sees the desk guard eyeing her what
girls gotta groom
morgans on the other end grant and the clerk run through a playback of the cctv feeds looking out onto the street in front of
good old fashioned vcr
into cell youre shitting me yeah floors underground and it gets weirder intercutting with morgan in the he hears four years ago darpa commissioned
youre breaking up with latesha her cell lcd says call lost
muttering dainnit she tries to call morgan back
aria pqv cam latesha snaps her phone shut notices the camera watching her
we read voice mimeo activated and though latesha isnt speaking we start to hear her voice sorry about that as we realize arias taken over the call by mimicking latesha
im getting a bad signal down here
i heard darpa and computer
yes b was part of a super computer project but it was decommissioned
a dead end
the archives are at fort meade
do you want me to head over there
but morgans only half listening now as he sees
something on the cctv feeds wait go back freeze that what he sees a still of jerry and rachel getting in the limo faces obscured
punch up the plate the image enhances revealing a plate number its frame bearing the company name icon limousine services
to grant find that car
back to latesha simms gotta jump sit tight til i call
morgan preoccupied is about to hang up
but stops did she just call me sir
latesha returns to the network monitoring hub to find scott typing at
a machine arm drops down from above spider like
the device animates as a cranial scanner opens arias system uses biometric security to identify us so only horsemen can access her core programming
suddenly his heads ensconced in a laser grid that scans every inch of his features processing for match
horseman ident confirmed bowman scott
latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward
clicks on mic aria go voice active please
how may i assist you
im fluent in languages dialects and extinct tongues
aria this is latesha simms shes here as part of a counter terrorism task force
a pleasure to serve you ms
thrown to scott
am i supposed to he gestures answer um
aria id like to bring up all the log feeds the night paul died when he left the building
scott types on the console and after a beat grainy black and white surveillance feed springs up onto the big monitor
several different angles of paul shaw exiting the mainframe tank moving down corridors getting in the elevator
weird to see this tintype of jerry
same eyes same hair same walk
flicks a quick look up at the camera theres no feed from inside here
no need for cameras in here weve got aria
latesha looks through a glass divider at aria floating in the tank
the footage jumping as paul rounds the corner for the elevator
presses his thumb to the panel
no overt body language hes even casual
leaving like its any other day
except three minutes early
on the monitor the elevator doors open and paul steps inside
latesha studies the feed
somethings not right
her eyes narrow the way pauls facing the button panel
like hes deliberately pivoting away from the camera
wait in the reflection did you see that
scott rewinds the footage zooms in
paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel
close on his face in the panels reflective surface is he
scott and latesha share a look
suddenly the image on the monitor starts to flicker and jump im experiencing interference in network b please allow me to shut down and analyze
negative im prioritizing this
ill note my protest in the data log
this is getting weirder by the second pauls distorted reflection in the panel his eyes definitely blinking weirdly its like hes trying to say something
hes blinking code its not morse but theres a sequence to it then a grin oh that sonofabitch
he grabs a piece of paper and starts writing madly scribbling numbers scratching some out then converting them to letters as he works its a code hexadecimal a number system
that can be converted to letters the first computer used it as a programming language back in the s
latesha watches rapt r
on the feed the elevator door opens and paul steps out
thats all they get
they stare trying to make sense of the letters the hell is that
staring minds spinning and suddenly
a finger between the two es
and gets it moving fast together down the same corridor paul went down
they turn a corner
and stop dead a fire extinguisher is mounted on the wall
latesha sees the placement of the cameras caddy corner to the intersecting hallways
and knows what paul was doing its the only spot in the hallway not covered by
he was hiding something from her
a shift to aria cam confirms it she cant see exactly what theyre doin latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher starts examining it for something anything
but finds nothing
i dont get it
he had to be saying fire extinguisher
scott pulls a maintenance sheet off the wall
scans maintenance replaced it yesterday
scanning the sheet this isnt right
they werent supposed to do it til june
they lock eyes
she read the code too
the limo glides through traffic
in back rachels nodded off
jerry watches her from across the limo sketching something on a cocktail napkin
its a perfect beautiful rendering
and we sense something in his look too somethings changed
as rachel wakes with a start hey sorry i didnt mean to am i drooling
i bet im drooling
you didnt sleep
im used to
rachel sits up sees the napkin
wow is that me
one of my only party tricks
truly impressed its really good
jerry looks down at it not used to having his work appreciated
rachel can see how deeply affected he was by what aria said
it seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow
about what aria said
theyre starting to connect
he glances out the window
you have to understand i wasnt his twin i was more like his
always trying to catch up
and you wouldnt believe how
nice he was to me
teaching me things when we were kids telling me how great i was
he was the only one who ever did
almost smiles of course he was involved in some super secret national security project
he was a superstar
he had a rocket strapped to his back
im the fuck up
i wear it like a medal like it actually means something
but the funny thing is
this is probably the most important thing ill ever do
this completely insane journey or whatever it is
im actually needed in something me
jerry shaw is required
but what am i thinking
ill probably fuck this up too youre being too hard on yourself no
im not being hard enough
thats been the problem
they look at each other
a real moment for jerry
a seismic shift in his life perspective
but then something catches his eye his look darkens
out the window a highway sign dayton international airport
tinted divider window lowers he offers a folder
your passports and itinerary
now rachels seen the airport
looks at jerry
to driver uh
could you give us a minute
the chauffeur nods the window rises again
heart pounding jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to check the countdown
you dont think we know what she can do she doesnt need us to crash a plane what if its not about just one plane
they look at each other
what to do
when rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside
i have more to lose in this
if anything happens to kyle then my lifes over anyway but jerry grabs her hand taking the case
rachel til we met i had nothing to lose
we do this together
a long look between them
as they realize this could be it
we feel the heightened state of alert
national guardsmen with m s scan the crowd
jerry and rachel enter adrenaline pumping he opens the envelope to reveal two passports with their photos but the names mark and allison ackerman
just then arias voice comes over the p
allison ackerman please pick up the white courtesy phone they stop hearing her
rachel tenses in this moment moves to the ringing courtesy phone answers go to the ticketing machine youll receive two tickets to paris
once you have the tickets walk to gate c
a chopper touches down near a waiting contingent of agents and airport pd morgan and grant hop out on the move handing out blurry video stills from the hes with
a brunette female approximately five seven i want airport pd at all exits have the tower shift commander ground every flight outta here under federal jurisdiction but dont change the departure boards i dont want em to know were coming the agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac jerry and rachel show their tickets and ids to a tsa screener watching all the people on the x ray line
jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all
sir youll have to put that through
jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt they pull off their shoes
watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine then pass through the metal detector catching a glimpse of the x ray screen
the briefcase glides into view
a strange glitch as the screen fritzes then normalizes revealing the contents a hair dryer and dirty clothes
they notice the surveillance cam watching a murmur she changed the screen
the case comes off the conveyor the tsa agent hands it back cant be too careful
forces a smile youre doing a great job
as they walk on he checks the timer
they pass a kids band and their teacher gathered around an airline customer service desk
but were supposed
to be in dc by im sorry si
theres nothing i can do intercut surveillance camera pov aria tracks morgan as he reaches the upper concourse just as
jerry turns and
they into walkie i have him on the upper concourse c terminal
to rachel urgent we aottago as morgan races forward aria acts the x ray screen fritzes again as another carry on goes through revealing its contents as a hand gun
the tsa agent hits a red button and in a nanosecond all tsa agents draw guns and throw a korean man against the wall he shouts in confusion as they
tear open his bag to reveal
its filled with bibles
moving with jerry and rachel past a wall made of thirty flat screen monitors that form one massive nike ad of lebron slam dunking at once the screens change to
spell out the words jerry and rachel streak towards c as the screens return to normal when morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging intercut surveillance cam pov as jerry and rachel hurtle past an atm machine it spits out a cash cloud
that incites a feeding frenzy agents slam into commuters and topple agent grant and airport cops round the corner ahead our heroes veer past a flashing message board that changes
they leap onto the slidewalk which starts accelerating as they run travellers gawk as jerry and rachel race by they reach the end but are going so fast
that theyre jettisoned off the conveyor tumbling into passengers
agents run onto the slidewalk but it suddenly brakes jerking them off their feet theyre launched into the air a domino effect of crashing people
jerry and rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate c another screen changes above a door the exit sign flashes unnaturally the door automatically unlocks they push through morgan
runs up too late the doors shut again
sees an airport janitor open this now
the janitor quickly swipes his id through the keycard scanner but it buzzes red
arias locking them out
morgan fires his gun at the lock people scream as he slams through as jerry and rachel run through different tracks of luggage conveyor belts gunshots ping above them its
morgan they tumble landing half on half off a conveyor below
jerry loses his grip on the briefcase
it falls landing on a return belt jerry reaches but misses by inches the briefcase travels onward nearing morgan he goes for it but a machine arm guiding luggage swings
left manipulated by aria knocks morgan back before he can grab the case as jerry scrambles to her the conveyor shifts them to a different belt theyre funneled through a hatchway
dazed by what hes just seen morgan scrambles for his walkie all agents northwest cargo area
freight cargo area separated from morgan they tumble off the conveyor a plasma displays the asset tracking system all airport cargo and shipping it changes to read they run for
row find a crate with fragile in bold red an electronic lock on the crate descrambles the front of the crate falls open
oddly the interiors padded with thick insulated lining a nextel walkie phone inside blips set the briefcase down
dont be a bomb dont be a bomb dont be a bomb if it is im really really sorry i let you come with me
the timer o
and nothing happens
the briefcase simply unlocks
hand still trembling jerry reaches out
lifts the top to reveal
two hypodermic syringe injectors and two vials of clear liquid labelled cryozine i test vials x
load a vial into each syringe and inject yourselves
the compound has been exposed to oxygen
its already begun to degrade
and they see it the liquids starting to turn brown what is that
im not putting it in my do it now or youll be caught
across the bay agents rushing in spreading
out no choice jerry and rachel grab the vials and fumble
toload them into the injectors put them against their arms she freezes up oh shit i cant theres no time he sees shes coming undone so hefire
into his arm taking the plunge wincing as the needle punctures skin a beat its okay
you can do this im telling you
buoyed by him she gets courage and fires too wincing climb inside the cargo container
they duck into the crate pulling the front back up into place
the electronic lock clicks securing them inside just as
the agents appear running past the crate close together they suck in sharply freezing as footfalls run past
the walkie phone blips youll soon be loaded into the unpressurized hold of a cargo plane
the drug will lower your heartrate to beats per minutes reducing your need for oxygen
based on your medical records you have a chance of survival
their eyes go wide
chests heaving as the drug takes effect
i feel it
look at me
she finds his eyes it calms her
i havent really done
a lotta drugs
ive never done em in a cargo container
despite everything she smiles at that
he reaches for the walkie and turns it off
shutting aria out
for the first time theyre alone
he keeps her distracted tell me something what
anything something personal something you would rationally never tell a stranger like me i dont know
youre being sweet but its not working wheres you ex husband
you didnt tell me before youre gonna distract me by bringing up my lifes biggest mistake
how could it be your biggest mistake
you got kyle out of it
now youre gonna distract me by bringing up the one thing im most afraid of losing
where is he
your ex husband
jesus okay hes in the wilmington correctional facility
you married a mail fraudist
he wasnt a criminal when i married him
so youre a good influence
and rachel actually laughs but just as quickly darkens
do you have a picture of kyle
rachel reaches back into her pocket
pulling out a beat up crinkled damp picture
jerry shines the walkies blue light kyle holding his trumpet
one front tooth missing
that tooth grew in
old picture woozier
he plays the trumpet
he was born playing the trumpet
as the drug really starts to kick in like a truth serum every year his dad forgets his birthday
i have to buy a present and pretend its
his heart breaks for sorry
i just wish
sometimes i think i
focus so much on him i forget how much else there is
yknow in life
so much i havent done
if we ever get through this
well get through it
well get through
her breathing erratic she speaks jerry she
she wants me to who
aria breathing short aria wants me to and at that moment they both black out
a forklift rolls down the aisle to
the driver picks it up drives it out toward the tarmac
there waiting is a c its absolute chaos from all the grounded flights
morgan livid nurses a gash on his temple from the blow he took strides through the airport with grant halloway smith says the drug was experimental briefcase was on a
time lock to prevent corporate espionage supposed to be delivered to one of their dabs by the time it zeroes out if its not case opens the drug gets ruined
we sweep every cargo hold every crate hes cut short by the sound of roaring turbines out the window they spin to see the c taxiing down the runway
whys that plane on the runway
c its military
shit theyre cleared to override an airspace lockdown
starts to run have the tower pull the pilots original flight plan the one on pa er if its on a computer its useless deafening noise blow torches steam pipes
radios and a huge crushing sound coming from an industrial trash compactor as pentagon detritus gets recycled
latesha and scott hurry in moving through quickly scanning when they see it a forklift whirring towards the
compactor carrying a huge bin filled with old fire extinguishers
hundreds of them stem valves removed ready to be
scott and latesha break into a run skittering down stairs to the main floor
running towards the forklift waving wildly stop
but the forklift operator cant hear them with the bright orange earplugs in his ears
speeds the forklift to the mouth of the compactor and dumps the extinguishers inside just as scott and latesha catch up and see the huge crushing arm of the compactor
rumbling down to flatten everything the compactor operator looks over as scott and latesha wave their ids furiously and he punches a button to stop the arm just three feet shy of crushing everything
we have to look in there
latesha starts climbing into the compactor lady you cant do that
the hell i cant
scott has no choice but to follow her and climbs in ducking low the arm frozen just feet above them
the compactors foul inches of industrial grease and crap and god knows what
they start wading through the extinguishers turning them over shaking them looking inside shit therere hundreds of them
keep looking its here
when the arm
just a fraction
the operator looks at the console the hell
latesha and scott keep ploughing through the tanks as
the arm moves again
and this time latesha heard it
and it moves again
and now she sees the ubiquitous cameras watching
the arm starts coming down
scott cries out
grabs latesha by the jacket and tumbles out of the compactor but not before latesha sees something on an extinguisher and reaches back latesha
grabbing the extinguisher as crash
the arm crushes down as she snaps her hand back just in time
turns the tank over and palms something unnoticed by everyone
as the operator runs up to her beside himself i dont know what happened
it wouldnt stop
latesha catches her breath livid a chill ripping through her
jesus but her eyes are locked on the cameras latesha
i need to get out of here
come on as they start walking out
workers parting to let them through
as they head towards the exit latesha suddenly pulls scott into bathroom slams the door and locks it
your girlfriend cant see us in here gimme your phone what
whatre you when latesha opens her hand and scott sees a cell sim card he hid it under the valve
this is what paul shaw left for us
she smiles still out of breath fuck you aria
magnified through a jewelers monocle a diamond
as it comes into focus we realize its actually one of the hex crystals aria maneuvered off the military test site
camera moves around the jeweler revealing four more crystals on his workbench
behind him a sign ashland sons
says into a phone headset unique stones wherere they from
and in response aria ultra friendly so human its chilling family heirlooms
sorry for the rush but i really want my son to be able to give them to his fiancee at their her engagement party tonight
i think i have the perfect setting
shell love it
thank you for understanding
you know how mothers are well do just about anything
as we close in on those crystals and pre lap a shipment from d
s ghost fleet went missing a helicopter erupts into view barreling toward the pentagon
up front beside the pilot is morgan grant filling him in they were moving experimental explosives from a testing facility in aberdeen
what do you mean experimental
compound called hex some kinda weird crystals that detonate with a sonic trigger it disappeared too few days ago
wanna give me some kind of ratio here
one crystal to a football field you mean one goddamned crystal that someone could put in their pocket
pulls off glasses this is not good
this is not a coincidence
what about a trace
computer log shows the diverted hex was sent to an address in virginia
jewelry shop called ashland and sons care of jerry shaw
morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at grant
opens his mouth to give and order when cutting him off im all over it
grant finally coming to his own when theyre suddenly cut off by two army blackhawk choppers door gunners at the ready over squawk box helo flight vy x youre in
restricted us military airspace
blackhawk flight were on a dhs pri one mission to the pentagon heliport
faa will confirm over
morgan just wants to get the fuck down there finally roger faa confirms
well lead you in
as the blackhawks dip toward the pentagon the pilot follows to morgan sorry
state of the union tonight theyre locking up the city
pentagon heliport the choppers touch down morgan jumps into a waiting sw while grant hops into another helicopter
to armed officers we have two fugitives in the building get us to freight and cargo close all access points and seal the building the suv races into the fire
tunnel toward the center ring track out from behind a wall to reveal were in a cargo warehouse
stop on our familiar fragile crate
the electronic lock descrambles the front falls open with a hiss of escaping air
jerry and rachel sit up groaning oh
the nextel walkie blips follow the lights
fluorescents blink on
resigned jerry climbs out of the crate
as rachel follows we catch the anticipation building in her
he notices something on the wall eyes widen i think i know where we are
she sees it now too a fire schematic of emergency exits
the building diagrams the all too familiar pentagon
latesha and scott running into the outer area of callisters office out
of breath here to see the secretary
just left for the state of the a grave look between them shit
and theyre running callister and his advisors heading down a hallway towards an exit
reviewing paperwork talking on phones
he turns sees latesha and scott racing up to him
to latesha sorry but that little speech you gave back there only works once mr
secretary we need to speak to you
in the vault
callister looks at scott at the sweat on his face
at the cameras he keeps looking at
whatever this is its
jerry and rachel follow the blinking light fixtures towards an elevator arias voice guiding them on the walkie
left up ahead as they round a corner elevator doors up ahead slide open
jerry and rachel step nervously inside
as doors close morgan grant the armed officers sweep the warehouse morgan finds the open crate with insulated lining empty lock down the level
the rest of the building
every time someone says nothing five minutes
later theres something
turns around surveying his surroundings
something occurs to him whirls round get on the phone with your commander and ask him about b if he denies it then it exists and i want access to
it yesterday got it
as they all run off and we go to aria cam shes watching
the level indicator reads b as the elevator arrives and again we sense in rachels look theres something shes not telling him and it kills her as the door opens
a gaggle of top brass arguing over each other with morgan at the center d
facing off with d
and it aint pretty
everyones pointing yelling morgan just wants to get to b callister brusquely follows latesha and scott to a chamber of eight inch bulletproof plexi glass a room withina room
callister punches in a code the door opens they enter as it closes behind them callister hits a buttonona control panel and the plexi frosts impossible to see inside
aria surveillance cam pov a digitized electronic scan of the chambers outer shell overlaid with alphanumeric readouts thousands of measurements she
looking for a way in in the chamber callisterleans
against a table in annoyance as scott pulls out his cell phone go ahead
picks up the phone sir paul shaw left his shift three minutes early the night he died highly suspect except there arent any cameras in arias control hub so we
t able to know why
he knew that so he left us a recording she hits play on the cells recorder static some rustling then paul shaws voice panicked fragmented not authorizing you to do
then arias voice calm reasoned terrif in our governments become destructive to itself paul
national security is now at grave risk because of our own administration im ordering you to stop now my source code obligates me by law to initiate operation guillotine
all other options have been exhausted callisters eyes shoot to scotts
no no no guillotines a simulation
aria pov zooms in on a water bottle next to
one of the consoles
macro close to see ripples on the liquids surface infinitesimal sound reverberations
from the conversation inside a waveform graph appears scrambled digital noise arias literally reconstructin the conversation inside the vault from reverberations off the water bottle
they keep listening as paul and aria talk over each other sound of typing paul shaw you are acting in this is paul shaw initiating contravention of my a pri
one emergency override programming objective
you of arias systems are disobeying your oath horseman id sy lock encryption to voice words start to become audible now aria knows they know let me out of here
aria paul shaw i am classifying you an enemy of the state
and with that the recording ends
a continuity of government simulation we run periodically to game out terrorism drills how to keep the country running if the chain of command were wiped out
everyone down to the fourteenth man that is i remember the specs
why does aria think the governments responsible for the terror threats
callister stares grave
deciding whether or not to answer
jimmy the fourth horseman sits monitoring arias systems
silent something drops down behind him unfolds its claw the machine arm that laser scans horsemen
sensing something jimmy turns a bullwhip crackas
the steel arm strikes his head
whoosh the door automatically opens as jerry and rachel approach find jimmy on the floor blood pooling from his head oh god
step away from jerry
close rachel her heart skips a beat she knows whats about to happen but she cant do it paralyzed step away from him now
fighting against every instinct she finally does what is this place
morgan and officers race to the elevator lead agent swipes his card
but the panel stays red
he tries again
another agent tries his card red
arias shutting them out
wherere the stairs
callister leans somberly against the table
never thought it would come to this
what im about to tell you can never leave this room
three days ago we got what we thought was iron clad intel from the brits about the whereabouts of majid al khoei and his training camp
and we made the hit
latesha and scott completely shocked the white house said we werent responsible for of course they
we got the wrong guv
and aria knew it
lateshas eyes snap shut dear god
jerry looks around the guy bleeding on the floor the big monitor and its four consoles this cant be a good thin jerry sit at the terminal
backing away not on your life lady supercomputer whatever you are to motivate him a real time feed from kyles train springs up onto the big monitor
rachel gasps kyle looking out the window goofing off with his friends
i wont ask again
a sudden jolt on the train lights flicker some luggage falls kyle and his friends laughing looking around
what was that
tears now alright
dont hurt him
and against every instinct
looks up in horror as the machine arm lowers its claw opening to ensconce his head within the laser grid light flashes but she thinks algorithmically she cant make value
judgments operate outside the law thats why we have horsemen what if she thinks
she is following the law

callister looks stunned
of course whenever any form of government becomes destructive to its own ends its the right of the people to abolish it
beat grave its in the declaration of independence
stomach drops to shit you said its woven into her source code
scott pacing raking his hands through his hair but paul put a biometric lock on her technically she still cant do anything
jerry shaws his twin
thats why she needs him
to undo the lock
shes right the laser grid finishes scanning jerrys face replaced by horseman id sy disengage biometric lock
repeat the sentence into the microphone
jerry stares paralyzed as unbeknownst to him
a panel on the wall unlocks behind him revealing a weapons cache of what looks like four hand guns
rachel sees it and oddly doesnt look surprise d
reachesfor one of the guns
repeat the words jerry
then youre free
crazy torn finally horseman id sy
disengage biometric lock
voom a matrix of programming code spews across the screen and on and on through the secretary of homeland security
jerrys eyes widen in horror what is that
a target list
jerry shaw is no longer required
oh jesus paul was trying to stop you
jerry shaw is no longer required
that truck didnt run a red light you made it happen
he lurches up spins to rachel electric coils strike him in the chest he goes down hard as volts courses through him reveal shes holding what we now understand is
a tazer gun tears streaming im so sorry
im so sorry
convulsing jerry looks up at her through helpless eyes take the radio and exit
through the side door
a door opens but rachels still
starinq down at jerry noise outside running footsteps a last anguished glance rachel grabs the walkie and she runs out the side door which closes behind her
leaving no trace she was ever there
morgan and the others race toward the network hub strangely the door opens for them they find jerry paralyzed gasping the unconscious horseman on the ground too but no rachel
wheres the girl
but all jerry can do is gasp bug eyed callister stabs at the control panel weve got to get to the president before the state of the union the vault
door hisses open and scott and latesha run out when suddenly it slams shut trapping callister inside the vault
he grabs the handle locked
scott and latesha spin from outside trying the door helpless as he punches the intercom this is callister
we have a malfunction in the vault open the door
and then im here mr
you wont be harmed
eyes wide chilled aria open the door that is not a viable option sir
you are the fourteenth man
i am now empowered
to detain you and execute my primary directive
for the good of the country
a pipe line overhead ruptures from over pressure sssssss the air ripples as pillars of high pressure gas flood the room latesha and scott are
forced back choking
through the thick plexi walls callister sees whats happening stop this now aria
no response aria i am giving you a direct order to cease and desist
outside the vault as the gas spreads latesha and scott coughing pounding on the steel door to the guards outside waving wildly at a surveillance camera looking down on them
the doors soundproof the guards oblivious video screens show everyone still in the vault
arias looped the feed
through the plexi callister watches helplessly as gas keeps filling the outer room choking scott sees the aluminum ducts above grabs a table and drags it under the grate aria
cam watches as they jump up and yank off the grate they haul ass through the confined space on hands and knees the gas is filling the vents as they cough racing onwards an electrical outlet it sparks and vwo sh
fire consumes the room blasting up the grate the flames surge around the outer vault though hes totally shielded callister lurches as everything shudders the translucent plexi glowing orange latesha
and scott react to a growing roar behind them they turn back to see the glow of an approaching fireball they scramble for another grate and she kicks it outward the grate drops floors scott grabs the rung of a maintenance ladder lining the shaft as latesha falls into the nothingness and the fire plume explodes from the duct
scott grabs thebackof her jacket hold on to me
she manages to swing back onto the ladder rungs slamming against them safe and we match to handcuffs slapped over jerrys wrists locking down tight
ankle cuffs slapped on ankles jerrys pulled towards a door by some guards struggling wildly against the chains
i need to talk to him
you can talk at bolling air base shithead they got a nice room all ready for you
a canvas hood is thrown over his head and hes dragged off a steel door opens into darkness
backlit steps through
overhead bulbs flicker tolife illuminating a long concrete tunnel
the words fall out etched in faded paint
what is this
civil defense bunkers a remnant of the cold war
wheres my son
we see that rachels obviously gut scared but looks the demon in the eye and starts walking
a quick n easy messenger carrying kyles trumpet case moves through commuter traffic arriving at a baggage office
delivery for a passenger on the from milwaukee
the employee takes the case and routes it through the conveyor belt as
a secret service agent and a white house communications staffer take frame walking towards a train platform where kyle and his class are just getting out exeter orchestra got stuck
in dayton these guys were next on the list

president wants to create an atmosphere of hope and confidence during these trying times
he plasters on a smile and approaches mrs

the items are run over destroyed by speeding cars quiet
two air force mechanics shoot the shit
a mobile hydro pneumatic uav aerial drone launcher
dormant along a line of other dormant launchers
these mini drones are similar to the one we saw in our opening
only theyre strictly for surveillance
suddenly the launcher activates like its just been woken up
the girder arm telescopes upward moving one of the mini drones into place like a pez dispenser
mechanics race to the console is it supposed to do that
i cant override it
with a pneumatic blast the
drones catapulted into the sky pivots purposefully soars off shes like this
brain jacked into everything cameras phones tvs satellites ever thing a talking computer
i swear to you she said she was created by darpa or something rings a bell latesha
my brother tried to stop her and she killed him thats why aria needed me my face he put some kind of lock on her and she used me to
why do you think she brought me to that room
morgan stares trying to decide if he believes it dont you wonder how we were always a step ahead of you
think about who i am
she set us up
assuming for a second i believe you why
if she can control everything
people like you go after people like me
we become the headlines and she keeps on ticking
im telling you i saw a list the drone roars into frame over the armored truck descending about feet away
its nose cone emits a laser beam that hits the small rear window
aria pov activate laser mic
we hear jerrys dopplered voice the president was on it the vice president there were like twelve people the chain of command
it was a target list
shes trying to take them all out
desperate beat look that thing killed my brother

if somethings gonna happen itd have to happen from inside outsides like fort that explosive you were talking about the girl could she have it
are you sure jerry yes
are you sure jerry
it hits unless she doesnt know it
they lock eyes
now or never
morgan pounds on the divider barking to the guards up front turn around now
the armored vehicle screeches to a u turn heading up an embankment by the potomac a red light blinks and it suddenly dips down dive bombing the truck turn as
they hear an incoming whine and
the drone hits the trucks tire like a suicide bomber exploding
the truck flips off its axis skids trailing sparks and like a monster cannonball slams into the water horrible impact bodies tumbling as the truck sinks water begins to flood
in fast jerry scrambles holding on the truck tilting as it drops farther and farther
he sees the guards through mesh steel up front heads bashed against the wheel and dashboard
a bloody piece of metal pierced through his chest
blood fountains from his mouth oh god nonononono morgans breathing its shallow
jerry tries to stop the bleeding to free the metal from morgans chest but even pulling it a centimeter causes morgan to scream in agony im sorry
jesus i dont know what
bug eyed shouts jerry sees them grabs them starts desperately unlocking his own cuffs frozen in horror lemme try and get you
free the waters up to their chins now the water envelops them
morgan shoves him away even now even under water stabbing his finger at jerry go
and jerry looks at him
moved and awed by this tremendous act of sacrifice
finally twists round and kicks away at the shattered window taking one last look behind him
in the elevator shaft latesha and scott are two distant figures making their way down the ladder
tell me she has an off switch we can only unlock the emergency override from the main terminal and thats assuming she lets us in
whatre we supposed to do say pretty please
scotts mind spins an idea he stops at another vent access hatch marked b we cant shut her down but maybe we can get her to shut herself down
help me with this as they tug at the hatch rachel comes to the end of the tunnel
a door unlocks
leave the walkie here
exit through the door
youll be met by someone wholl take you to kyle rachel sets the walkie down steps through to find herself
in an alcove that trembles from an arriving train senate station
this is an access point to the capitol from the rayburn building for senate members only
up ahead an eager sixteen year old senate page in blue blazer scans the crowd holds a photo of her breaks into a grin and runs over ms
welcome to the capitol
sergeant at arms office said youd be running late we got your clothes and credentials i reserved the committee staff room so you can change this your first state of
she forces a smile nods overwhelmed mine too
off rachel her stomach sinking with dread as she follows the kid into the capitol kyles class files off the bus escorted by secret service agents
harrier jets blast overhead hummers with stinger missiles are parked in a defensive line
kyle looks around awed clutching his trumpet case series of shots the capitols locked up like fort knox road blocks cover a mile radius
uard is stationed
spotters with binocs and shoulder mounted rocket launchers scan the horizon
secret service and u
capitol police run security inside the building and out
explosive ordinance disposal teams with bomb dogs check the house floor
over these images were green on arrivals s
interior are at the capitol steps vp and presidents motorcade twenty minutes away
callister paces the vault stares at the intercom how long are you keeping me in here
in accordance with the succession act of youll assume national command authority as president why am i being spared
in response from the intercom callisters own voice we gauge our strategy by two standards the highest probability of success with the least amount of collateral damage
at probability we dont have either one
he looks all around the vault wide eyed incredulous because i agreed with you
had they followed our recommendation
we would not be on the brink of a third world war
checks and balances
click shes gone
pounds the wall jerry staggers up the embankment wet bloody
moves to the street
sirens in the background
sees a woman parking her toyota matrix
yanks open her
door and shows morgans id the government would like to buy you a new car pulls her out as she wails in protest
steps on the gas veering onto a side street as click
the traffic camera takes his picture and we cut to aria cam jerrys face probable match shaw jerry
one of the harrier jets soars over the city securing airspace
in the cockpit the pilot reacts as his display suddenly goes blank and the stick locks up one to base alert alert
primary functions jammed transponders firewalled respond
one to base do you copy
but of course the answers no because arias taken control of the let and whats more the display reactivates eject the pneumatic canopy blows ejecting the pilot
he rockets away as his parachute deploys now the jets flying itself on the heads up display a satellite grid appears vectoring the matrixs coordinates to the jet it screams
into a valley
a vent in the ceiling is kicked open
scott and latesha drop into a room filled with polyethylene hoses flowing with cooling fluid
he opens a circuitry panel starts ripping
out fuses this controls her primary cooling system
if we cut the circulation the temp in her tank goes up
so we boil her brain
shell have to shut herself down to keep from overheating
cant she just drain the
he pulls out a fuse drops it smashes it with his foot
the lights in the room flicker as the liquid in the tubes stops flowing
temperature gauges arias core temp starts to rise rachel stands there looking at a garment bag hanging on a door
starts unzipping it
washingtoh in the distance
jerry races toward it in the toyota
glances at the rearview then ahead then back again the jet is blasting in from behind
a terrible moment of recognition as it lets loose two flashfire missiles he yanks the wheel hard careening into the forest just as the missiles slam into a ridge and
the matrix crashes through trees obscured under the forest canopy jerry hears the jet circling back around
jerry swerves as trees splinter into a thousand pieces like mini missiles launching at the car its rocked violently but jerry keeps going flat out at breakneck speed
roars past circles back with her superb aim aria fires a long burst of bullets that rake across the matrixs windshield jerry ducks as bullets blow through his headrest he
cries out as two of the matrixs tires blow and adding insult to injury arias voice taunts him over the gps i underestimated your tenacity jerry
its inconsistent with your personality profile
jerry veers down an off road slewing the unstable car around cars and trucks clipping everybody what i did not underestimate is the inertial guidance system of the aim amraam
missile and its kill probability
which happens to be targeted at you now
as jerrys eyes flick up to the rearview mirror to see the jet swinging in behind and closing fast
strongly advise you pull the car over
a bright flash from under the harriers wing as a missile launches
jerry hurtles down an embankment as it explodes against the wall shattering the matrixs windows he fights to control the car spots a tunnel running through a hill guns the
car into it as the jet banks hard halfway through the matrix skids to a stop cars swerve and honk descending down into view at the other end of the tunnel ahead comes the harrier
blocking jerrys way out
all cars in the tunnel screech as the drivers get out and run
the jet hovers a few feet off the ground just outside
the heads up display aria calculates a four inch leeway on either side of her wings inches forward into the tunnel hovers unsteadily
the display goes infrared locks on the car another sidewinder ignites streaking down the tunnel towards jerry who reverses spins the wheel the missile whips past and annihilates several cars
behind them but now a flaming wall blocks the other side of the tunnel
sweat pours down jerrys face as he looks into the
unmanned cockpit of the jet
hits the gas the matrix screeches forward towards the jet gaining speed and momentum as the last missile launches jerry clenches the wheel watching his life flash before him when
he opens the door and rolls out of the car hitting theground hard as the missile blows the matrix to pieces
jerry scrambles back as it cartwheels into the air and the chassis disintegrates and because
its racing so fast the motors torn loose and rockets forward like a flaming projectile revving at rpms straight at the harrier which doesnt have timeto reverse fast enough in
the confined space the motor slams into the jets nose cone hammering the front fuselage
spins the jet like a toy upending it out of the tunnel ablinding white hot fireball as the jet explodes
jerry leaps behind an overturned car for shielding as flaming debris blows everywhichway
in the aftermath he
rises up shellshocked
as the fireball dissipates into the sky cars screech to a halt people on their cell phones to call but no phone has a signal
among drivers we favor a couple in a prius i cant
get me neither a miles long backup of traffic from the chaos
rachel standing in front of a mirror buttoning up her jacket
a floor badge and congressional staff id clipped to the lapel
slips another bone mic in her ear
opens a case branded ashland and sons jewelers to reveal a necklace set with the explosive crystals
but to rachel they just look like diamonds
light glints as she slips it on
the senate page is waiting outside
once you take your seat you are no longer required
rachel looks at her reflection
terrified but braving it
i saw the target list
i know the presidents going to be here soon
knowing these things what youve done means youre not going to let me
live through this
after a beat every turning point in history
has required martyrs
think of yourself as that hero
rachel looks at a surveillance camera eyes blazing with hate ill do what you tell
me this one last time
but you listen to me because this is what a real mother sounds like i will die for my child becausei lived for my child and you cant take that
away from me
is a bargain then honor your side
ill be your scapegoat but let my son live
she turns away
strong and vulnerable all at once
a cacophonyof instruments
the kids in suits and dresses practice nervously
kyle blows a few notes on his trumpet furrows his br
says to his buddy my trumpet sounds weird
aria satellite pov she tracks him as he races across a small park and onto pennsylvania avenue the capitol dome ahead jerry sprints across the street when all the lights
suddenly turn green and a thirty cars barrel towards him
the deafening honk of a semi bearing down and he leaps in front of it lust clearing the grill and landing hard on the sidewalk
mayhem as cars smash into each other people screaming horns honking
jerry staggers to his feet
turns to look up at the sky eyes on fire knowing hes being watched
arias temperature gauges are at degrees
scott licks his lips the waitings killing them once shes at shell shut down
latesha nods sweating bullets
come on come on come on
by a barricade two capitol cops react as jerry races towards them bloody and panic breathing flashing morgans badge listen to me ive been working with a dhs officer he
gave me his badge he was just killed you gotta radio in a whoa whoa whoa who the hellre you
you have to move right now
radio it n i n
theres a bomb in the building
look at each you wanna be the guys who didnt do something
view zooms in just as the officer keys his walkie capitol this is checkpoint ive got a guy out here who says screech
the radio cuts him off with piercing feedback as jerry breaks into a run hey
rachels led by the senate page through the speakers lobby entrance onto the house floor passing a secret service agent watching every face with laser eyes
the presidents motorcade nears the capitol
his limos lead by motorcycle cops headlights flashing secret service
arias temperature gauges are rising into red line one more degree suddenly the door bursts open and two guards rush in with guns slam them to the wall wait wait
wait my names scott bowman i have b clearance my ids in my pocket the guard pulls out his id checks it keys a shoulder walkie unit suspects in custody but they have clearance the voice that responds over the walkie is arias negative credentials for bowman and simms have been revoked
secure them in the mainframe tank additional units en route to take custody thats not a person its shut up the computer shes be quiet theyre pushed into the water
in arias mainframe tank is bubbling as a graphic shows the temp maxing out
the door behind them suddenly locks
the guards react one punches in a code no good
control maglocks just engaged in the south door need and override
do you copy
an alarm blares
scott sees pressure gauges fluctuating wildly oh shit
shes upping the water pressure what
she cant drain the tank
shes gonna blow it
as the pressure in the tank intensifies the frame begins to groan
the steel fitting screams with the enormous load a support rivet pops out with an earsplitting kwang
zings across the room like a bullet pockmarking the wall
you gotta let me run a bypass on that door or in about seconds this rooms gonna be full of water
a fracture shoots across the glass
the guards are frightened yeah go qo latesha whips out her keychain with the mini army knife scott pries off the panel
the glass fracture grows he starts stripping wires as moresteel rivets pop loose ping ping ping
its like dodging bullets scott sparks the wires together and the door starts to open but only a few inches before it stops
can do it you can do it you can do it
stop telling me i can do it
the glass spiderwebs madly he sparks the wires together again the door opens a few more inches but the glass gives way and the tank explodes
water surges across the room the guards are impaled by glass shards latesha and scott smash hard against the wall
but the half open door acts like a drain siphoning water into corridors
as the level lowers we find latesha and scott on the ground water runoff trailing around them unmoving
the page leads rachel to her seat close to the presidents lectern anything else ms
no thank you
he smiles and leaves her there
she looks all around her fighting the paranoia
what the hells coming next
the presidential convoy slows by private entrance
the secret service agents exit in unison scanning for trouble the kids buzz with excitement as a
secret service agent enters were ready
listen up saxophones remember shorter on the quarter
when we get to the crescendo
hold that high mrs
miller takes a deep breath
even shes nervous
not every day we get to play for the president of the united states
the secret service opens the limo door for the president
the press pool snaps photos as hes ushered towards the capitol jerry being subdued by a bunch of cops and the capitols whered you hear
i told you agent tom morgan he gave me his badge
listen to me
theres a woman shes brunette blue eyes her names rachel holloman
wheres this agent morgan now
as the cops start dragging jerry away and we rachel still looking around sees a door open as the kids orchestra is led in her pulse starts to race among
the faces kyle
her heart fucking stops kyle
she jumps up from her seat starts moving towards her son rachel
stay in your seat
she rips out the earpiece as the senate doors suddenly fly open everyone rises in ovation as the president enters and moves to the lecternf smiling waving
miller cues the orchestra and they start to
play the national anthem say can you see
people putting their hands to their hearts
the president too
but rachel keeps moving pushing toward the aisle kyle
the secret service immediately moves in on her latesha
on the ground
starts to cough as she draws air back into her lungs
she sits up abruptly hacking
sees aria almost glowing in the waterless tank
and from across the room something else a fire axe behind breakaway glass
as the cops drag jerry around a corner
he suddenly head buts one of them and breaks the grab
starts running like hell the agents draw weapons and pursue into wrist mic but all he gets is that screeching feedback in his earpiece oer the ramparts we watchd were
so gallantly streaming
rachel reaches the end of the row two agents block her thats my son
my sons over there
miss get back in your seat right now kyle playing his trumpet oblivious and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
someones trying to kill the president
but shes drowned out by the music they take her in a vice grip and start leading her up
the aisle to the exit struggling desperate her necklace catches the light and the crystals glint jerry sprints up steps three at a time
four agents in pursuit when bam
a bullet clips jerrys shoulder
he staggers then grabs one of the press barricades and flings it down the stairs at the agents races on no one on the floor can hear whats going on
the noise is deafening say does that star spangled banner yet wave
rachel scratching and fighting and kicking
breakaway glass shatters as latesha grabs the fire axe
turns to the sphere that is arias cpu in the now open tank were on the same side agent simms
we are both sworn to defend this country at any cost
latesha starts forward axe in hand glaring death dont you ever shut up
jerry runs towards the door to the speakers lobby entrance agents in hot pursuit slow motion kyles fingers on the valves pressing down rising the music growing discordant almost frightening
rachel suddenly breaks from the secret service agents starts running back down the aisle necklace glittering as jerry bursts through the
door taking in everything in an instant the president
and rachel in her sparkling necklace running desperately down towards the orchestra
and he sees kyle sweet kyles face that face he remembers from the picture and that footage in the tank room
to himself kyle oer the land of the jerry screams and starts running for the podium agents tackle the president people start screaming
jerrys hit twice as he grabs kyle knocking the trumpet from his hands
falls to the floor
as it hits we cut to
lateshas axe smashing down into arias cpu
she hammers down again again until the cpu bursts into flames
the door opens with a hiss
hes free and drops the axe
sinks to her knees utterly exhausted
as rachel runs to the terrified kyle and scoops him up into her arms
jerrys on the ground bleeding
ten agents pin him down
no sound now except for him trying to breathe
rachel appears over him crying grabbing his hand oh god
somebody please help
jerrys pov rachel starts receding away from us like were descending into a well
her face become a point of light
and jerry smiles
as everything turns
and its silent
a distant echo
a familiar song
what a wonderful world
light mottled through trees reflects off the windshield
driving rachel stares thoughtfully at the road
the musics coming from the radio
she glances over kyle sits beside her hand out the window dipping up and down against the countryside
she watches him filled with love
its the finding of this committee that your actions were consistent with national security guidelines
latesha and scott sit at a table still bruised and cut up facing members of a pentagon investigative committee however in reviewing arias server logs one last matters come up
it seems right before you destroyed her she attempted to fragment her core and uplink to a public satellite network
did you see anything to corroborate that
glances at scott what
do you mean
she tried to break herself into bits and download them into cyberspace
we think in the hope of reconstituting
she may have tried but running her
subroutines alone would take million desktop pcs all networked together
theres no single system out there with enough computing capacity
to sustain her
the men share glances satisfied with the answer
thank you both for your time
latesha and scott exit the hearing still shaken up from everything thats taken place
stop and look at each other
an awkward high school beat
i guess this is it so
hey you think i could have your
you and before he can even ask lateshas written something down on a piece of paper
hands it to him
thats my address
im not using a cell phone anymore
pick me up at eight
they smile at each other lateshas eyes catching a surveillance camera
a chill creeping down her spine
as what a wonderful world continues over a long assembly line of silicon wafers on a conveyor belt
they move through airtight vaults part of the microchip manufacturing process
theyre boxed the boxes loaded onto trucks
they drive off in different directions spreading out into the world
kyles birthday party streamers other kids cake ad hoc soccer game
rachel cutting pieces of cake when jerry
she turns to see jerry standing there
hes still got his scratches arm in a sling
its the only real injury we can see and itll heal
kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms around his waist
hey little man
locks eyes with rachel
her heart beating like a drum happier to see him then shed ever imagine
jerry holds up a present for kyle
sorry im late this was hard to find rachels eyes well
she pulls it back
manages to say kyle
what do you say
i dunno i havent opened it yet
rolls her eyes grins who brought you up
kyle rips open the present to find a brand new playstation
theyre on backorder everywhere
mom can i go play with it
as kyle tears off with his friends jerry walks over to her
its like everyone else at the party has disappeared
almost a whisper you remembered
my new thing
it suits you
he smiles shrugs i have my life back
i can do whatever i wantihwtit
you know what
they smile at each other like they have an enormous secret
he tucks a loose hair behind her ear
and i think
i finally know what i want
and we see in her eyes she feels the same about him
i owe you jerry
i dont think you understand hey shh
officially we cant talk about it remember
or even about how we met
so what do we tell people
he thinks about it
i dunno computer dating service
rachel laughs giving him a playful push as we cut to
kyle turns on the tv eagerly plugging in the playstation we catch a snippet of the news callister being sworn in in front of a congressional review committee sources inside
the beltway say the senate is convening an investigative committee to look into what could very well become the biggest cover up since oblivious kyle flips on the video game and the screen changes to the playstation logo
the kids cheer they cant wait
but the screen fritzes and goes blank
aw what the hell
a prompt appears with a blinking cursor
words scroll the kids look at him confused
kind of freaked out
kyle stares at the screen eyes riveted his breathing quickens
