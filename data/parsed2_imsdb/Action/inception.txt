written by christopher nolan the waves toss a bearded man onto wet sand
he lies there
a childs shout makes him lift his head to see a little blonde boy crouching back towards us watching the tide eat a sandcastle
a little blonde girl joins the boy
the bearded man tries to call them but they run off faces unseen
he the barrel of a rifle rolls the bearded man onto his back
a japanese security guard looks down at him then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a jeep
behind them is a cliff and on top of that a japanese castle
the security guard waits as an attendant speaks to an elderly japanese man sitting at the dining table back to us
in japanese he was delirious
but he asked for you by name
to the security guard show him
in japanese he was carrying nothing but this
he puts a handgun on the table
the elderly man keeps eating
the security guard places a small pewter cone alongside the gun
the elderly man stops eating
picks up the cone
in japanese bring him here
and some food
the elderly man watches the bearded man wolf down his food
he slides the handgun down the table towards him
in english are you here to kill me
the bearded man glances up at him then back to his food
the elderly japanese man picks up the cone between thumb and forefinger
i know what this is
he spins it onto a table it circles gracefully across the polished ebony
a spinning top
ive seen one before
many many years ago
the elderly japanese man stares at the top mesmerized
it belonged to a man i met in a half remembered dream
move in on the gracefully spinning top
a man possessed of some radical notions
the elderly japanese man stares remembering
whats the most resilient parasite
the speaker cobb is handsome tailored
a young japanese man saito eats as he listens
cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass an intestinal worm
saitos fork pauses mid air
a third man is at the table arthur
he jumps in to save the pitch what mr
cobb is trying to say an idea
saito looks at cobb curious
resilient highly contagious
once an ideas taken hold in the brain its almost impossible to eradicate
a person can cover it up ignore it but it stays there
but surely to forget
but an idea
fully formed understood
taps forehead in there somewhere
for someone like you to steal
in the dream state conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft
its called extraction
saito we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor
how can you do that
because i am the most skilled extractor
i know how to search your mind and find your secrets
i know the tricks and i can teach them to your subconscious so that even when youre asleep your guard is never down
cobb leans forwards
holding saitos gaze
but if im going to help you you have to be completely open to me
ill need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife your analyst anyone
gestures around if this is a dream and youve got a safe full of secrets i need to know whats in that safe
for this to work you have to let me in
saito gives this a flicker of a smile
a bodyguard opens double doors which give onto a lavish party
enjoy your evening as i consider your proposal
they watch saito leave
arthur turns to cobb worried he knows
cobb motions silence
a tremor starts they steady their glasses cobb glances at his watch the second hand is whats going on up there
and we cobb asleep sitting in a chair at the end of a steaming bath
the chair is up on a cabinet the bottom of the legs level with the rim of the tub
a sweating man s watches over cobb
this is nash
a distant explosion rumbles through the room
nash moves to the window parts the curtains
outside a chaotic developing world city the street filled with rioters smashing burning
nash checks cobbs left wrist above his watch tape holds two thin yellow tubes in place
nash looks at cobbs watch nash follows the tubes to a silver briefcase at arthurs feet arthur is asleep in an armchair
tubes connect the briefcase to arthurs wrist
nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where they pass under the door to the bedroom
through the crack of the door nash sees saito asleep on the bed tubes running to his wrist
boom a closer explosion and we nash asleep
head rocking against the window as the train
a japanese man todashi watches nash nervously
he checks nashs wrist two yellow tubes connect nash with three todashi checks his watch the second hand ticks in real time
another train passes in the opposite direction with a mighty whump todashis eyes fly to nashs sleeping face nash jerks with the movement of the train and we another explosion
nash checks the sleeping cobb and we a low tremor rumbles through the castle
cobb and arthur steady themselves against the wooden rail
several tiles and pieces of masonry fall
below them a black sea churns
other guests wander the massive terraces
hes playing with us
i can get it here
the informations in the safe he looked right at it when i mentioned secrets
then spots someone over cobbs shoulder
whats she doing here cobb
cobb turns to see a beautiful woman elegantly dressed staring out at the sea
this is mal
cobb watches her
you just get to your room
ill take care of the rest
see that you do
were here to work
arthur brushes past mal shaking his head
she nears cobb
looks out at the drop
the wind whips her hair if i jumped would i survive
with a clean dive perhaps
mal why are you here
she turns to look at him
i thought you might be missing me
he leans in mesmerized
but i cant trust you anymore
she stares up at him inviting
mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by francis bacon
looks like arthurs taste
cobb is looking down through the window at the guards patrolling the castle at ground level
saito is partial to postwar british painters
he turns to mal donning a pair of black leather gloves
would you sit down
mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair
cobb approaches pulls out a length of black rope and kneels at mals feet
she looks down at him
cobb ties the rope around the chair legs
do the children miss me
he lets his gloved fingers lightly touch mals ankle
he looks up at her
you cant imagine
mal looks away uncomfortable
cobb gets to his feet letting out the rope as he moves back to the window
whatre you doing
cobb tosses the rope out getting some air
he tugs on the rope testing
the weight of the chair with mal on it holds
and with that he jumps
mal considers the open window
cobb rappels down the wall darting past windows
he stops at a particular one
gets out a glass cutter suddenly he starts dropping the empty chair slides across the floor wedges under the window cobb jolts to a stop ft
he looks up at the bedroom window
shakes his head
starts climbing back
cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened kitchen
he pulls a pistol from his belt screwing a silencer onto the barrel as he glides across the room
cobb slips through the shadows towards a guard stationed at the head of a grand staircase
the guard hears something turns peers into the shadows
cobb flashes out of the shadows silenced pistol up aiming
phht head shot the guard starts to drop
but cobb is already there to catch him sliding on his knees and lowering the guard silently to the floor
cobb moves to a painting
with practiced hands he removes it from the wall revealing a safe
cobb spins the dial pulls it open grabs an envelope from within stuffs it into his waistband where there is already an identical envelope
lights come on
at the far end of the room saito
next to him is mal gun in hand
she smiles at cobb
the gun dom
cobb doesnt move
mal motions outside two guards drag arthur into the room
mal puts the gun to his head
cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table then slides it along the polished ebony
it comes to rest halfway down the length or the table
now the envelope mr
cobb reaches into his waistband removes one of the envelopes slides it along the table
steps back hands raised
did she tell you or have you known all along
that youre here to steal from me
beat or that were actually asleep
arthur gives cobb an i told you so look
i want to know who your employer is
mal cocks the gun at arthurs temple
no point threatening him in a dream
that depends on what youre threatening
killing him would just wake him up
pain is in the mind
mal lowers the gun and shoots arthur in the leg arthur drops screaming mal looks at cobb cold
and judging by the decor were in your mind arent we arthur
cobb watches arthurs pain
mal aims at arthurs other leg
cobb springs for the table skidding along its polished surface he grabs his gun shoots arthur between the eyes arthur drops the room starts to shudder in a massive earthquake
cobb springs for the door arthurs eyes stare at the ceiling dead and we arthurs eyes open as he wakes in the armchair he grabs at the tubes at his wrist yanking them free whatre you doing
its too soon fluid spurts from the tubes as arthur struggles with the silver case on the bathroom floor
we have to reconnect the loop before they wake up
arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the bedroom following the tubes to where they meet saitos wrist saito lies on the bed asleep
saito stirs and we cobb lurches towards the stairs as all around him the building bucks and heaves
saito and the guards panic
mal walks calmly through the destruction picks up the envelope and turns to saito
he was close
cobb runs up the stairs pulling out the second envelope saito rips open the envelope pulls out sheets of paper
he looks at mal panicked
he turns to the guards stop him
mal confused looks at the sheets of paper they are blank
mal smiles amused
as cobb runs up the stairs he reads the typewritten sheets from his envelope and we arthur opens the silver case a complex mechanism of tubes syringes dosage controllers
arthurs hands fly across the machines controls as he glances at saitos stirring face im not going to make it
nash turns to cobb
raises his hand and smacks him across the face and we cobb is smashed sideways off his feet
the ceiling cracks above saito he looks up as a ton of stone floods down crushing him and we saitos eyes flicker open
nash smacks cobb again he wont wake
arthur crouched by saito connects the second tube
a click arthur looks up to find saito with a gun to his head and a finger to his lips gesturing silence
nash puts his hand on cobbs forehead and pushes him backwards as cobb starts to fall backwards in the chair we are in slow motion and we cobb full speed
picks himself up scrambling to read the last sheet of paper
he stares at it puzzled bullets hit around him as the guards race up the stairs and we cobb in slow motion hits the water head thrashing as he goes
under and we cobb glances up from the paper as water explodes in through
cobbs awake gulping air getting his bearings
saito smashes into the room knocking nash down cobb launches himself out of the tub flying dripping wet across the room to slam saito against the door the gun drops
cobbs fist connects with saitos jaw and the struggle is over
cobb wet but composed sits turning saitos gun in his hand
nash holds saitos arms behind him
outside the sounds of rioting grow louder
you came prepared
i bring the gun because not even my head of security knows this apartment
how did you find it
arthur at the window looks out at the worsening violence
hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret
particularly when theres a married woman involved
she would never
and yet here we are
saito is silent
with a dilemma
you got what you came for
the key piece of information wasnt there was it mr
arthur looks over at cobb worried
theyre getting closer cobb
todashi slips a pair of headphones over nashs ears then pulls out an mp player and we saitos eyes are on the floor
you held something back because you knew what we were up to
cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise saitos chin
so why let us in at all
saito smiles defiant
violent noises echo up the stairway
audition for what
it doesnt matter
i extracted all the information you had in there
but your deception was readily apparent
and we todashi opens the silver briefcase revealing the complex mechanism of syringes and controllers four controllers
todashi waits for the first countdown to hit then hits play on the mp player he watches nashs sleeping face as he raises the volume
through nashs headphones the opening bars of edith piafs non je ne regrette rien and we in the distant background strange massive low end musical start sounding like distant horns
so leave me and go
you know the corporation who hired us wont accept failure
we wont last two days
the distant slowed down music is becoming louder as are the shouts coming up the stairs
arthur looks at his watch its come on cobb
so now i have to do this the old fashioned way cobb grabs saito and puts his head to the floor gun pressed into his cheek
saito looks into cobbs eyes sees he will pull the trigger
saito blinks looks away in shame when he notices something
and starts laughing
ive always hated this carpet
cobbs eyes flick to the carpet and back
its stained and frayed in such distinctive ways
cobb looks up at nash who shrugs at a loss
but very definitely made of wool
right now im lying on polyester
cobb glares at nash and we todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit zero he looks up at arthur stirring and we saito turns from the carpet to look
up at cobb
which means im not lying on my carpet in my apartment
smiles youve lived up to your reputation mr
im still dreaming
cobb looks over to arthur but arthur has vanished and we arthurs eyes flicker open awake
he rips at his tubes
howd it go
arthur checks the remaining three countdowns and we saito gets to his feet looking admiringly at cobb
a dream within a dream im impressed
cobb lowers the gun
glances at his watch
the music reverberates the rioters bang on the door and we
arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the next countdown hit zero and we another bang on the door saito confident now approaches cobb
nash is behind saito
but in my dream we really ought to be playing by my rules
ah yes but you see mr
saito saito turns to nash were not in your dream saito turns back to cobb but cobb has vanished were in mine
saito spins back to nash the door smashes off its hinges as gone
the music dies
saito and the rioters stand there in the silence the light dwindling
and we nash eyes open awake
arthur is in his face furious
how could you get the carpet wrong
it wasnt my fault
youre the architect
i didnt know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it
cobb pulls arthur away from nash
and you what the hell was all that
i had it under control
id hate to see out of control theres no time for this im getting off at kyoto
hes not gonna search every compartment
i cant stand trains
arthur moves to the briefcase
turns a dial
i can keep him under for one minute arthur hits a button a plunger depresses
cobb rips the tape off saitos wrist rolls up his tubes
arthur slams the silver case shut
todashi pulls open the door every man for himself
arthur and nash exit heading in different directions down the corridor
cobb hands todashi a thick roll of cash looks at saito who stirs
cobb moves off
the bullet train speeds through the lush landscape
saito wakes gently
looks around the compartment empty but for todashi reading a comic
saito looks down at his wrist
sees a small mark
moving over the vast city towards a high rise
a helicopter thumps into frame heading for a pad on the roof
cobb sits waiting
checks his watch restless
he pulls a handgun
checks it is loaded
places it on the table in front of him
pulls out a pewter spinning top spins it on the table
he intent studies the tops spin
as he stares the sound of a freight train builds and builds the top wobbles tips onto its side the sound of the train stops
the phone rings cobb grabs it childrens voices over phone hi daddy
how are you
childrens voices over phone good
okay i guess
cobb closes his eyes trying to picture his children insert cut cobbs memory a little blonde boy back towards us crouches in a garden looks at something in the grass
whos just okay
was that james
james over phone yeah
when are you coming home
not for a while
insert cut a little blonde girl also face unseen joins james over phone why
well james like ive told you im away because im working
little girl over phone grandma says youre never coming back
takes a breath
insert cut james and philippa faces unseen lift their heads from the grass responding to someones call they run away from us across the garden
philippa can you ask grandma to pick up the phone philippa over phone shes shaking her head
cobb tenses as if about to smash the phone
well well just have to hope grandmas wrong about that wont we
over phone daddy
james over phone is mommy with you
cobb looks like he just got punched insert cut cobbs no
no we talked about this james
james over phone where
grandmas voice over phone time to go kids
say bye bye ill give some presents to grandpa okay
just be good for cobb stares at the dead phone
then downs his drink a knock at the door
cobb grabs the top the gun moves to the door cracks it arthur
our rides on the roof
moves to pick up his bag
are you okay
cobb looks up
down in the dream
mal showing up like that
im sorry about your leg
its getting worse isnt it
one apologys all youre getting arthur
now wheres nash
shakes head we were supposed to deliver saitos expansion plans to cobol engineering two hours ago
by now they know we failed
time to disappear
cobb and arthur head towards the elevator
where will you go
i can lie low there
maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down
send my regards
arthur looks at cobb
the helicopter sits rotors spinning
as cobb and arthur reach the door it slides open
cobb steps up into the leather padded interior
nash beaten bloody sits on the far side slumped against the wine
beside him saito
he nods politely at cobb
he sold you out
thought to come to me and bargain for his life
saitos bodyguard offers cobb a gun
so i offer you the satisfaction
thats not how i deal with things
would you work with him again
cobb shakes his head
saitos bodyguards pull nash from the chopper
saito motions cobb and arthur to sit
the chopper rises
cobb watches nash dragged across the pad
what will you do to him
but i cant speak for your friends from cobol engineering
saito looks out at the city slipping by
what do you want from us
arthur raises his eyebrows
cobb is poker faced
is it possible
of course not
if you can steal an idea from someones mind why cant you plant one there instead
okay heres planting an idea i say to you dont think about elephants
saito nods what are you thinking about
but its not your idea because you know i gave it to you
you could plant it subconsciously the subjects mind can always trace the genesis of the idea
true inspiration is impossible to fake
no it isnt
can you do it
i wont do it
in exchange ill give you the information you were paid to steal
are you giving me a choice
because i can find my own way to square things with cobol
then you do have a choice
and i choose to leave
the helicopter sets down next to a private jet
saito indicates the plane
tell the crew where you want to go theyll file the plan en route
cobb and arthur look at each other
then move for the door
there is one other thing i could offer you
cobb stops how would you like to go home
to your children
cobb turns back to saito
you cant fix that
just like inception
cobb considers this
arthur touches his arm
cobb come on how complex is the idea
no ideas simple when you have to plant it in someone elses mind
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son will soon inherit control of the corporation
i need him to decide to break up his fathers empire
against his own self interest
cobb we should walk away from this
if i were to do it
if i could do it
how do i know you can deliver
but i can
so do you want to take a leap of faith or become an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone
cobb looks at saito
assemble your team mr
and choose your people more wisely
cobb reclines his seat
arthur picks at a salad angry
i know how much you want to go home sharp no you dont
but this cant be done
you just have to go deep enough
you dont know that
ive done it before
arthur is taken aback
cobb turns to the window
did it work
who did you do it to
cobb looks at arthur
so why are we headed to paris
were going to need a new architect
cobb carrying a shopping bag looks into a lecture hall no students just a rumpled professor hunched over paperwork
you never did like your office
professor miles looks up squinting
no space to think in that broom cupboard
cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows
is it safe for you to be here
extradition between france and the u
is a bureaucratic nightmare
i think theyd find a way to make it work in your case
cobb hand miles the shopping bag
can you take these back for the kids
itll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father
i thought you could talk to marie about bringing them on vacation
somewhere i could meet why would she listen to me
you were married for twenty years
she blames me as much as you
doesnt she understand that my kids need me
yes she does
we all do
go back and face the music dom
explain what mal did
be realistic stephen
theyd never understand theyd lock me up and throwaway the key
you think what youre doing now is helping your case
lawyers dont pay for themselves
this is what i have
this is what you taught me
i never taught you to be a thief
no you taught me to navigate other peoples minds
but after what happened with mal there werent a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill
miles looks at cobb
why did you come here dom
cobb shifts slightly
i found a way home
for powerful people
if i pull it off i can get back to my family
but i need help
miles realizes something
youre here to corrupt one of my brightest and best
if you have someone good enough you have to let them decide for themselves
you know what im offering money
no not just money the chance to build cathedrals entire cities things that have never existed things that couldnt exist in the real world
everybody dreams cobb
architects are supposed to make those dreams real
thats not what you used to say
you told me that in the real world id be building attic conversions and gas stations
you said that if i mastered the dream share id have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations
you told me it would free me
miles looks at cobb sad
and im sorry
i was wrong
no you werent
your vision was a vision of pure creativity
its where we took it that was wrong
and now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy
they wont actually come on the job theyll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers
design them yourself
mal wont let me
miles looks at cobb
come back to reality dom
you want to know whats real stephen
your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back
this job this last job is how i get there
miles looks down fiddles with his papers
i wouldnt be standing here if there were any other way
i can get home
but i need an architect whos as good as i was
miles looks cobb in the eye
ive got someone better
miles and cobb stand by as students file out of a lecture
a young woman carrying books turns
this is ariadne
id like you to meet mr
she sizes him up with quick eyes
offers her hand
pleased to meet you
if you have a few moments mr
cobb has a job offer to discuss with you
a work placement
smiles not exactly
ariadne leans against the parapet overlooking paris
she unwraps a sandwich watching cobb pull out a pad of graph paper and a pen
he offers them
she bites her sandwich
mouth full arent you going to tell me anything
before i describe the job i have to know you could do it
its not strictly speaking legal
ariadne raises her eyebrows
you have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve
ariadne takes the pad and pen
cobb looks at his watch
she starts drawing lines on the grid constructing a maze
ariadne hands the pad and pen to cobb
he glances at the pad then looking her in the eye traces the solution
she is taken aback
cobb rips off the sheet hands the pad back
she traces straight lines concentrating
she hands cobb the pad a touch pleased
cobb solves the puzzle instantly as before
her smile falls
youll have to she grabs the pad frustrated
but this time she flips it over and starts drawing on the blank cardboard of the back
cobb watches surprised
he smiles as he sees that shes drawing circles creating a maze based on concentric rings
ariadne hands back the pad defiant
cobb takes the pen starts the maze
this time he gets stuck
working the maze more like it
arthur stops at a warehouse door
consults a piece of paper
a large dusty warehouse
the sliding door cracks open
looks around approvingly
arthur drags lawn chairs into the middle of the room
he erects a table
lays out several silver cases unpacking them laying out lines of tubing mechanisms
cobb and ariadne sit at an outdoor table
they say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains
but theyre talking about when were awake
while we dream the mind performs wonders
how do you imagine a building
you consciously create each aspect puzzling over it in stages
but sometimes when your imagination flies im discovering it
cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth
in a dream your mind continuously does that
cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows
it creates and perceives a world simultaneously
so well that you dont feel your brain doing the creating
thats why we can short circuit the process
by taking over the creating part
cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows
this is where you come in
you build the world of the dream
we take the subject into that dream and let him it with his subconscious but are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life
nods while were in there we dont want him to realize hes dreaming
how could i ever get enough detail to convince him that its real
our dreams reel real while were in them
its only when we wake up we realize things were strange ariadne gestures around them but all the textures of real life the stone the fabric
your mind cant create all this
every time you dream
let me ask you a question you never remember the beginning of your dreams do you
you just turn up in the middle of whats going on
how did we end up at this restaurant
we came here from
ariadne trails off confused
how did we get here
where are we
ariadne thinks unable to remember
a faint rumble begins
oh my god
the rumble is building
were actually asleep in the workshop
this is your first lesson in shared dreaming remember
ariadne looks around mind reeling
cobb braces the restaurant violently fragments exploding and imploding particles of furniture walls people flying around ariadne wonders at the mayhem whirling around them cobb shields his head against the
she sees him shouting over noise if its just a dream why are you covering your ariadne is wiped from her seat by a massive blast and we ariadne jolts
because its never just a dream
ariadne turns to cobbs voice
they are both sitting in the lawn chairs
arthur watches over them
and a face full of glass hurts like hell doesnt it
while were in it its real
thats why the military developed dream sharing a training program where soldiers could strangle stab and shoot each other then wake up
how did architects get involved
someone had to design the dreams
to arthur lets go another five minutes we were only asleep for five minutes
we talked for an hour at least
when you dream your mind functions more quickly so time seems to pass more slowly
five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream
lets see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes
and we ariadne walks down the crowded street with cobb
cobb looks around at the street the cafe approving
youve got the cafe the layout
you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here
ariadne looks at the passers by
who are the people
theyre projections of my subconscious
sure you are the dreamer i am the subject
my subconscious populates your world
thats one way we get at a subjects thoughts his mind creates the people so we can literally talk to his subconscious
how else do you do it
build a bank vault or a jail something secure and the subjects mind will fill it with information hes trying to protect
then you break in and steal it
ariadne wonders at the detail of the street
i love the concrete sense of things stamps foot real weight you know
i thought a dream space would be all about the visual but its the feel of things
question is what happens as you start to mess with physics
she concentrates on the street
the street starts to bend in half the buildings on either side folding in until they form the inside of a cube of city gravity functioning independently on each plane
ariadne looks up or down at the people on the opposite city surface
cobb watches her excitement
its something isnt it
as they walk ariadne notices more and more of the projections staring at her
why are they looking at me
because youre changing things
my subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world
the more you change things the quicker the projections converge on you
they feel the foreign nature of the dreamer and attack like white blood cells fighting an infection
theyre going to attack us
just you actually
they walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane
they step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river
as ariadne approaches steps emerge from the flagstone and she leads cobb up onto a small jetty
as she concentrates pillars emerge and a bridge starts to telescope out from the jetty
they step onto it as it grows
cobb is impressed
but if you keep on changing things
people crossing the bridge stare at ariadne
several of them bump her shoulder as they pass
mind telling your subconscious to take it easy
thats why its called subconscious
i dont control it
the bridge now spans the seine
cobb marvels at it
arched stone iron pillars
cobb pauses thinking
insert cut mal hair blowing turns to cobb smiling laughing
he smiles back
they are on the same bridge
i know this bridge
this place is real serious you didnt imagine it you remembered it
nods i cross it every day on my way to the college
never recreate places from your memory
always imagine new places
you have to draw from what you know tense use pieces a streetlamp phonebooths a type of brick not whole areas
several people around them echo cobbs attitude
because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on whats real and whats a dream
did that happen to you
cobb says nothing
he stands there starinq at ariadne
people around her stop and look at her hostile
look this isnt about me cobb reaches for ariadnes arm turns her to him is that why you need me to build your dreams
a passerby grabs ariadnes shoulder leave her alone more of the crowd join in pulling at ariadne holding her arms open cobb pulls people off the crowd pushes him away
cobb sees someone walking purposefully through the crowd towards the helpless ariadne it is mal
she approaches with even strides ariadne stares at her uneasy
wake me up cobb
as mal walks she pulls out a large knife mal no
wake me up
ariadne screams as mal lunges at her with the knife and we ariadne wakes breathing hard
arthur moves to her its okay
why couldnt i wake
the only way to wake from inside the dream is to die
cobb in the lawn chair opposite pulls his tubes out
shell need a totem
some kind of personal icon
a small object that you can always have with you and that no one else knows cobb gets to his feet ariadne stares at him furious
he heads to the bathroom
thats some subconscious youve got cobb
calls after him shes a real charmer
sounds like youve met mrs
surprised shes his wife
arthur nods pulling off ariadnes tubes
you need something small potentially heavy
cobb takes out his pewter spinning top spins it on the marble counter
ariadne looks at arthur puzzled
like a coin
you need something that has a weight or movement that only you know
cobb studies the spin of the top as it decays becoming more and more eccentric
arthur holds out a die
a loaded die
ariadne reaches for it arthur snatches sit away
i cant let you handle it
thats the point
no one else can know the weight or balance of it
so when you examine your totem
cobbs spinning top wobbles over
you know beyond a doubt that youre not in someone elses dream
cobb grabs it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline
ariadne thinks this over
thats not an issue for me
arthur maybe you cant see whats going on maybe you dont want to
but cobbs got problems hes tried to bury down there
im not going to open my mind to someone like that
ariadne gets to her feet
shell be back
cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway
ive never seen anyone pick it up so fast
and one reality wont be enough for her now
when she comes back get her building mazes
where will you be
ive got to talk to eames
but hes in mombasa
there are plenty of other thieves
we dont just need a thief
we need a forger
crowded bustling smoke filled
a westerner s shabby suit is squeezed in at a dice game
this is eames
he fiddles with his last two chips
rub them against each other all you like theyre not going to breed
eames looks up to see cobb
you never know
eames tosses down his last chips
the dice are rolled
cobb follows eames
eames mysteriously produces two stacks of chips and puts them down in front of the cashier
cobb pulls one off the top squints at the embossed name
youre spelling hasnt improved
eames grabs the chip
hands it to the cashier
hows your handwriting
eames takes his money
smiles at cobb
eames leads cobb down the quiet street
word is youre not welcome in these parts
theres a price on your head from cobol engineering
pretty big one actually
you wouldnt sell me out
eames looks at cobb offended
course i would
smiles not when you hear what im selling
a ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street
eamess glass stops halfway to his mouth
dont bother telling me its impossible
its perfectly possible
just bloody difficult
thats what i keep saying to arthur
youre still working with that stick in the mud
hes a good point man
but he has no imagination
if youre going to perform inception you need imagination
youve done it before
yeas and no
we tried it
got the idea in place but it didnt take
you didnt plant it deep enough
its not just about depth
you need the simplest version of the idea the one that will grow naturally in the subjects mind
thats why im here
whats the idea you need to plant
we want the heir to a major corporation to break up his fathers empire
see right there youve got various political motivations anti monopolistic sentiment and so forth
but all that stuffs at the mercy of the subjects prejudice you have to go to the basic
the relationship with the father
downs drink do you have a chemist
cobb shakes his head
theres a man here
he formulates his own versions of the compounds
lets go see him
once youve lost your tail
cobb reacts back by the bar blue tie
came in about two minutes after we did
they pretty much own mombasa
cobb glances over the balcony
well meet downstairs in half an hour
last place theyd expect
eames downs his drink
walks over to the businessman
the businessman looks up awkward
freddy simmonds it is you
cobb nonchalantly slips over the balcony dropping hard into the midst of the crowd on the street below
looks harder oh
no it isnt
cobb stands up pushes into the crowd faces peer at him he moves trying to blend turns a second business man is there
disarming smile yes
we need to cobb head butts the second businessman pushes past him the first businessman races out of the bar sees cobbs wake dives after him cobb races headlong through
tight passageways weaving through or knocking into the locals
he steps into a dark crowded cafe scanning the tables
the first businessman enters spots him
an african man gets in cobbs face jabbering at him in swahili cobb considers his options
the first businessman draws a gun cobb bolts steps up on a table and out an open window scrambling into the alley outside
cobb looks left right
cuts left into a narrow crowded alley the alley narrows to a dead end
faces in the crowd start to watch cobb people start to surround him cobb looks back the way he came the two businessmen are there guns cobb sees a small
gap between the buildings at the narrow end he throws himself into it gets stuck halfway
the crowd bears down grabbing for him as cobb struggles to squeeze himself through the gap
cobbs moving inches as his pursuers gain yards
the crowd is upon him
he bursts free
tumbling onto the next street rolling out of sight
cobb jumps to his feet in a market square
two more businessmen move towards him
cobb bolts but a car skids up blocks his path the door opens saito is in the back
care for a lift mr
jumping in what brings you to mombasa mr
i have to protect my investment
eames stands on the pavement
the car pulls up
cobb beckons from the rear window
eames looks at saito
back to cobb
this is your idea of losing a tail
shrugs different tail
arthur sits at the table working on a mechanism
a small cough prompts him to look up ariadne is there
he said youd be back
i tried not to come
but theres nothing else quite like it
no paper no pens
nothing between you and raw direct creation
arthur picks up his mechanism
shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture
ariadne nods takes off her coat and we arthur leads ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel atrium in an office complex
youre going to have to master a few tricks if youre going to build three complete dream levels
a secretary drops some papers as they pass
what sort of tricks
they take a tight turn and continue down the next flight
in a dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes
that lets you create closed loops like the penrose steps
the infinite staircase
ariadne freezes they are in the exact spot they started descending from next to the secretary gathering her papers
ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs
arthur stops her gently they are on the highest step with a large drop to the next step
arthur gestures at the drop
a closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream youve created
how big do the levels have to be
anything from the floor of a building to an entire city
but it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections
and the better the maze the longer we have before the projections catch us
ariadne looks around
sees people looking at arthur
my subconscious seems polite enough
you wait theyll turn ugly
no one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind
cobb cant build anymore can he
i dont know if he cant but he wont
he thinks its safer if he doesnt know the layouts
he wont tell me
i think its mal
i think shes getting stronger
his ex wife
shes not his ex
theyre still together
arthur turns to ariadne
no shes dead ariadne
what you see in there is just his projection of her
what was she like in real life
quiet she was lovely
saito deposits a file in front of cobb photos documents
as cobb runs through them he passes them to eames
heir to the fischer morrow energy conglomerate
hes spent his whole life being groomed as successor breaking up his fathers empire will take a radical shift in his thinking
whats your problem with fischer
thats not your concern
this isnt the usual corporate espionage mr
this is inception
the seed of the idea we plant will grow in this mans mind
itll change him
it might even come to define him
saito looks at cobb
my sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious
then you need new sources mr
saito considers cobb
fischer morrow has the regulators in their pockets
were the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete
soon theyll control the energy supply of half the world
theyll be able to blackmail governments dictate policy
in effect they become a new superpower
the world needs robert fischer to change his mind
thats where we come in
hows robert fischers relationship to his father
rumor is the relationship is complicated
well need more than rumor mr
eames picks up a photo a distinguished executive
can you get me access to him
fischer seniors right hand man
fischer juniors godfather
it should be possible
if you can get the right references
references are something of a specialty for me mr
eames leads cobb and saito down uneven steps to a doorway
peeling paint buzzing flies
they ascend to a dusty wire reinforced glass door which eames pushes open row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty glass bottles of all shapes and colors
at the far end a portly year old man rises from behind his desk beckoning
this is yusuf
eames shakes yusufs hand
yusuf stops at cobb
ive heard so very much about you
indicates chairs please
yusuf chases a cat off saitos chair
yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass bottles
none of them has a label
you work using somnacin i think mr
youre well informed mr
yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of cobb
proudly yusufs somnacin
yusuf pulls the stopper holds it towards cobbs nose
as good as the real thing
yusuf whips the bottle away from cobb offended
yusuf holds the bottle to the light marveling
binds the dreamers tight
lets them dream as one
makes it real
of course if youd prefer you could use somnacin brand
if you could explain to the international control council what you wanted it for
yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf
you are seeking a chemist
cobb nods to formulate compounds for a job
and to come into the held with us
i rarely go into the held mr
we need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements
a dream within a dream
that many dreams within dreams would be too unstable
ive done it before
you just have to add a sedative
a powerful sedative
how many team members
to cobb the only way to know youve done the job is if i go in with you
theres no room for tourists on these jobs mr
this time it would seem there is
cobb looks at him uneasy
yusuf pulls out another bottle
i use it every day
yusuf hands it to cobb who considers the white liquid inside
yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy to a metal door
he stops second thoughts
you will not want to see
cobb motions to continue
yusuf pulls out a large key
a dark room with rows of low cots
each with a sleeping occupant
tubes connect their wrists
an elderly bald man watches over them
counting eighteen twenty all connected bloody hell
they come every day
to share the dream
yusuf nods at the elderly bald man who moves to the nearest bed
reaches out to the occupant
gives his face a firm slap
the sleeper does not even stir
how long do they dream
three four hours
how long in dream time
with this compound
about forty hours
each and every day
saito surveys the room appalled
why do they do it
tell him mr
after a while
looks at saito it becomes the only way you can dream
do you still dream mr
cobb stares at the sleepers
they come here every day to sleep
cobb turns to the elderly bald man who looks fondly at his dreamers
they come to be woken up
the dream has become their reality
the elderly bald man pokes a crooked finger at cobbs chest
and who are you to say otherwise
cobb stares at the elderly bald man
cobb turns to yusuf
tosses him the bottle
lets see what you can do
cobb is lying on an empty cot asleep
yusuf stands over him
as we move in on cobbs sleeping face we hear the sound of a freight train building and we close on cobbs face as he lies eyes closed cheek pressed
to a metal rail the sound of the train is deafening cobb is breathing breathing breathing and we cobbs eyes open
yusuf is watching him
gets to his feet looking around cobb splashes water on his face breathing hard insert cut cobb fumbles in his pockets pulls out his spinning top
he tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink but it falls to the floor and rolls towards the door saito is there
he looks down at the spinning top
everything alright mr
cobb dries his face with a paper towel
picks up his top
close on a small brass chess piece
ariadne tips it over
frowning she picks up a micro drill peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base
tests the tipping point again
a noise makes her look up
ariadne comes into the main space
someone is there unpacking one of the mechanisms
cobb looks up with a start
are you going under on your own
i just i need to test some things
i didnt realize anyone was here
just working on my totem
ariadne holds up the chess piece
cobb reaches for it
let me see ariadne snaps it out of his reach
its an elegant solution to keeping track of reality
cobb pulls out his spinning top
looks at it
this one was hers
shed spin it in a dream and it would never topple
just spin and spin
arthur told me she died
how are the mazes coming
ariadne indicates three large architectural models
each level relates to the part of the subjects subconscious were trying to access
im making the bottom level a hospital so that fischer will bring his father there dont tell me
remember you only want the dreamer to know the layout
whys that so important
in case one of us brings in part of our subconscious
you wouldnt want any projections knowing the layout
in case you bring mal in
cobb says nothing
you wont build yourself because if you know the maze then she knows it
and shed sabotage the operation
you cant keep her out can you
cobb says nothing
do the others know
you have to warn them if its getting worse gentle i didnt say its getting worse
look ariadne i need them for this job
i need you for this job
without your help ill never get back to my children
and thats all i can care about right now
why cant you go home cobb
cobb looks at her deciding what to say
they think i killed her
how did she die
insert cut mal wind blowing her hair smiles at cobb
now we see cobb shaking his head tears streaming begging thank you
not asking whether i did
ariadne arthur yusuf eames and saito sit around the room looking at files
the mark is robert fischer heir to the australian energy conglomerate fischer morrow
cobb opens a large presentation pad
cobb reads aloud cobb turns to the team
an idea robert fischers conscious mind would never accept
we have to plant it deep in his subconscious
three levels down
a dream within a dream within a dream
is that even possible
now the subconscious motivates through emotion not reason so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept
how do you translate a business strategy into an emotion
thats what we have to figure out
robert and his father have a tense relationship
worse even than the gossip columns have suggested
do you play on that
suggest breaking up his fathers company as a screw you to the old man
positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time
we yearn for people to be reconciled for catharsis
we need positive emotional logic
looking back at the board
my father accepts that that might work
well have to do better than that
thanks for the contribution arthur
forgive me for wanting a little specificity eames
inceptions not about specificity
when we get inside his head were going to have to work with what we find
arthur shrugs frustrated
and we the team are in the middle of a deserted intersection
ariadne is showing yusuf aspects of the geography
we could split the idea into emotional triggers and use one on each level
how do you mean
on the top level we open up his relationship with his father
say i will not follow in my fathers footsteps
next level down weve accessed his ambition and self esteem
we feed him i then the bottom level we bring out the emotional big guns
that could do it
how do you produce these emotional triggers
i forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of peter browning a key figure in fischers emotional life
two african pedestrians wander into view
are those yours
eames shakes his head
cobb turns to yusuf
we dont bring our own projections into the dream we let fischers subconscious supply the people
saito when do i get to see browning
you fly out to sydney on tuesday
weve arranged for you to spend several days
eames sits in the crowded room
boxes and files are piled high
browning stands by a pair of double doors
as part of a consulting litigation team working for browning
im not smelling settlement here we take them down
browning maurice fischers policy is always one of avoiding litigation browning turns to the lawyer
calm but powerful
shall we relay your concerns directly to maurice
browning opens the doors to maurice fischers inner office
eames leans in to watch as browning beckons the lawyer into the office is a makeshift hospital room a bed where the desk should be
browning addresses a figure at the window
robert fischer s abstracted
how is he
fischer turns to browning
motions silence as he glances at his father in the bed
i dont want to bother him unnecessarily but i know he robert
ive told you to keep out the damn
maurice lashes out knocking things from his bedside table
a nurse calms maurice as fischer crouches to retrieve a framed photograph
he looks at the photo through the broken glass a young boy holds a pinwheel clearly made by a child each of the points is numbered in pen his father
blows on it
must be a cherished memory of his i put it by his bed
he hasnt even noticed
robert we have to talk about a power of attorney
i know this is hard for you but its important that we start to think about the future not now uncle peter
browning looks at fischer considering
biding his time
the vultures are circling
the sicker maurice fischer becomes the stronger peter browning becomes
eames watches browning studying his every move
eames gestures at a mirror as if offering to shake hands
ive had time to learn brownings physical presence and mannerisms
in the mirror browning gestures back
now in the dream i can impersonate browning and suggest the concepts to fischers conscious mind
draws a diagram then we take fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him
impressed so he gives himself the idea
thats the only way to make it stick
it has to seem self generated
eames im impressed
your condescension as always is much appreciated arthur
the team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby debating
ariadne is showing arthur the lobby
hes not scheduled for surgery no dental nothing
i thought he had some knee thing
nothing theyd put him under for
besides we need a good ten hours
sydney to los angeles
they turn to saito
twelve hours and forty five minutes one of the longest flights in the world
he makes it every two weeks
fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the tarmac towards a gulf stream jet accompanied by two aides
surely he flies private
not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane
fischer is met at the steps by a distraught flight officer
cobb chews this over
arthur comes over
itd have to be a
on a the pilots are up above first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin
wed have to buyout the whole cabin and the first class flight attendant we bought the airline
everyone turns to saito
gets to his feet well now we have ten uninterrupted hours
to ariadne nice lobby by the way
and we the group is back in the workshop deep in discussion
my question is how we go down three layers with enough stability
three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake
the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance
yusuf clears his throat
for sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming
yusuf depresses a plunger
arthur is sleeping in a chair
we will have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative
eames slaps arthur hard
arthur does not stir
arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek
the compound well be using to share the dream is an advanced somnacin derivative
it creates a very clear connection between dreamers whilst actually accelerating brain function
buying us more time in each level
brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal
and when you go into a dream within that dream the effect is compounded
how much time
thats ten hours times twenty times twenty times twenty
math was never my strong suit
its basically a week one layer down six months two layers down and ten years in the third level
who wants to spend ten years in a dream
depends on the dream
its not going to take us long to crack fischer open once we get going
well be out in a couple days max
how do we get out once weve made the plant
to cobb i hope youve got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time
arthur tilts back in his chair
yusuf turns to cobb
whats a kick
eames slips his foot under arthurs chair leg
tips it arthurs legs shoot up instinctively for balance that ariadne would be a kick
that feeling of falling which snaps you awake
we use that to jolt ourselves awake once were done
but how are we going to feel that through the sedation
thats the clever part
i customize the sedative
cobb eames and yusuf watch arthur asleep in a chair
to leave inner ear function unimpaired
yusuf with a wicked grin slowly tips arthurs chair backwards
as he falls arthurs body jerks eyes opening just before he hits the floor
arthur thinks nodding slowly
that way however deep the sleep the sleeper will still feel falling
yusuf gleefully leans a sleeping arthur to one side
arthur goes down with a crash jerking awake arthur thinks this through
even that wont cut through three layers of deep sleep
the trick is to devise a kick for each level then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers
arthur looks at cobb getting it
we can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks
ariadne comes into the darkened main space
cobb is lying on one of the chairs asleep
plugged into the mechanism
ariadne stands over him
she opens the case pulls one of the tubes sits checking the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm and we ariadne ascends
she looks at the buttons
spots the b
the elevator stops
she looks through the grill at ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room considering the dusty furnishings
at the window is a dolls house front slightly ajar
ariadne opens it
inside is a safe
she tries it
a noise startles her she turns looking through a doorway into another room
ariadne looks into the room to see cobb and mal talking arguing
a private moment
mal brushes at cobbs hair trying to convince him
we hear snatches of conversation you remember when you asked me to marry you
you said you had a dream
that wed grow old together
and we can
you know how to find me
you know what you have to do
cobb is shaking his head gently
mal looks into cobbs eyes gentle loving
mal spots ariadne spying on them
freezes staring hostile
cobb turns sees ariadne moves towards her leaving mal
you shouldnt be in here
cobb guides her back into the elevator
i wanted to know what tests you need to do on your own every night
cobb shuts the cage door
ariadne hits a button
the elevator rises
through the grill ariadne can see a beach stretching off into the distance
the elevator stops
mal sits on the sand
beside her the two children are crouched away from us building a sandcastle
why do you do this to yourself
this is the only way i can still dream
is it so important to dream
cobb stares at his family
in my dreams
were still together
the kids without turning around jump up and run away
the elevator descends
but these arent just dreams are they
you said never to use memories
and i shouldnt
youre keeping her alive
you cant let her go
these are moments i regret
moments i turned into dreams so i could change them
ariadnes fingers move across the buttons stop at the b
whatve you got buried down there that you regret
cobb pushes her hand away
hits the third floor button
theres only one thing i need you to understand about me
ariadne follows cobb into the kitchen
a thin man is there standing by the table
he holds a folded piece of paper
this is your house
mine and mals
where is she
shed already died
the thin man offers cobb the piece of paper
a childs shout cobb turns
ariadne follows his gaze to the garden
a small blonde boy faces away from them crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground
hes found something
maybe a worm
a slightly older girl runs into view
and theres philippa
she crouches beside the boy
their faces are away from us
they point and discuss whatever is on the ground
i thought about calling out so theyd turn and smile those incredible smiles
but im out of time the thin man thrusts the paper into cobbs hand
or never cobb
cobb nods turns from the window then i panic that ill always wish id seen them turn that i cant waste this chance
cobb turns back to call out but the children race off
but the moments passed
and whatever i do the dreams always the same
when im about to call
cobb watches them run off calling for grandma faces unseen
if im going to see their faces again ive got to get back here in the real world
behind him ariadne slams the grill shut
ariadne hits the basement button
the elevator starts to descend
ariadne stares fascinated as glimpses of floors slip past mals childhood bedroom a thundering wall of freight train
the elevator stops
through the grill ariadne sees a hotel suite
she pulls open the grill steps cautiously out into disheveled bedclothes upended room service table strawberries across the floor
ariadne steps forwards smash she looks down to see that she has kicked over a champagne flute
ariadne feels a draught
the curtain what are you doing here
mal is there
my name is i know who you are
what are you doing here
i dont know
trying to understand
how could you understand
do you know what it is to be a lover
to be half of a whole
mal moves slowly towards ariadne
ill tell you a riddle
youre waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you but you dont know for sure
mal glides around ariadne looking her over
it doesnt matter
how can it not matter to you where that train will take you
because youll be together
cobb is standing in the elevator
looks at him
how could you bring her here dom
what is this place
we spent our anniversaries in this suite
what happened here
mal picks up the broken stem of a champagne flute
cobb pulls ariadne into the elevator mal throws herself towards ariadne cobb slams the grill mal smashes against it again and again like a wild animal ariadne flinches you promised
you said wed be we can
but i need you to stay here for now cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise
ill come back
i need you to stay here on your own for now
just while i do this job
then we can be together mal throws herself against the grill and
we ariadne watches cobb sleeping
his eyes gradually flicker open
he sees her watching him
you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in
you think thats going to contain her
the lights come on saito and arthur stand in the doorway
maurice fischer just died in sydney
whens the funeral
in los angeles
robertll accompany the body tuesday at the outside
we have to move
cobb gets up
ariadne comes over to him
low im coming with you
i promised miles
the team needs someone in there who understands what youre struggling with
if you dont want it to be me then you need to show arthur what i just saw
cobb looks at ariadne
turns to saito
we need one more seat on the plane
saito stands looking out the window at a
cobb arrives beside him
they watch a coffin being loaded
if i get on this plane and you havent taken care of things
when we land i go to jail for the rest of my life
complete the job en route i make one phone call from the plane
you will have no trouble clearing immigration
the luxurious cabin has only ten seats
cobb finds his sees ariadne in the seat behind his
they do not acknowledge each other
behind her is arthur looking out the window
eames enters stuffs his bag into the overhead bin blocking the passenger behind robert fischer standing there patient bag in hand wearing black
eames squeezes up against his seat to let fischer brush past
fischer moves to his seat directly in front of cobb
eames tosses cobb a passport
cobb flips it open fischers
yusuf and saito enter take their seats
the hurtles down the runway
cobb looks down at his hand a tiny vial taped to the center of his palm
he removes the cap
the seatbelt sign goes dark
cobb unbuckles stands
fischer looks up
i think this is yours
cobb holds up the open passport comparing the picture to fischer
fischers hand goes to his pocket
cobb hands fischer the passport
would you gentlemen care for a drink
fischer gives cobb a thin smile
holds up his passport
well thank you
look i couldnt help noticing your name
youre not related to maurice fischer
fischer takes a beat
but cobb seems harmless
actually he was my father
im very sorry for your loss
he was an inspiring figure
the flight attendant brings their drinks cobb takes them
as he turns to fischer he lowers his right hand
a clear liquid drops into fischers water as cobb hands it to him
to maurice fischer
they drink ill leave you in peace
fischer grants him a smile
the great plane soars through a burning cloudscape
cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket lets it fall onto fischers head fischer doesnt flinch
cobb signals the others
the first flight attendant unlocks a cupboard in the galley then leaves closing the curtain
arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a mechanism case
cobb and arthur open the mechanism uncoil the tubes feed them around the window side of each of the seats
arthur rolls up fischers cuff pushes the needle cap into fischers wrist
arthur pulls fischers cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of fischers seat
arthur runs the next tube to ariadne
cobb puts the case on yusufs lap
yusuf checks the timers tapping the syringes
the others recline their seats
yusuf hits a button closes the case places it at his feet
he settles back and we cobb drives
saito and arthur are in the back
rain beats down
cobb pulls over yusuf stands on the corner silver briefcase in hand collar turned up against the rain
he reaches for the door
yusuf clambers into the back brushing rain from his face
indicates rain couldnt you have peed before you went under
the front door opens and eames climbs in soaked
bit too much free champagne before takeoff yusuf
ha bloody ha
at least we know hell be looking for a cab in this
cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic
he weaves around several cars before lining up behind a yellow cab
cobb hits the gas rear ends the cab with a crunch
the cabdriver gets out fuming
heads to cobbs window hey asshole
why dont you try driving without your thumb up he sees the silenced pistol cobb is holding at his belly
the cabdriver backs off
arthur climbs into the cab
both cars pull away
arthur slows in front of the train station peering at the pedes pedestrians
he spots fischer lights the cabs sign
fischer flags him down
fischer jumps into the back brushing rain from his shoulders
third and market
eames jumps in from the other side
whatre you doing
sorry i thought it was free
maybe we could share
saito gets into the front passenger seat
pointing a gun
arthur pulls away
fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at eames
contemptuous theres dollars in there
and the wallets worth more than that
for that you ought to at least drop me at my stop
eames smiles at this
im afraid a shot shatters the window by eamess head another shot impacts by saito get us out of here
arthur hits the gas but a black s
skids sideways in front blocking the path a block behind cobb is at a light
ariadne is getting in the front
cobb has heard the gunfire come on
cobb looks ahead to the ambush hits the gas the sedan rockets forwards
but bam a freight train clips the front
a second s
is behind the cab plain clothes security men advance through the traffic weapons trained on the cab
bullets rip into the cab as eames throws himself on top of fischer pulling a sack over his head inside the sedan ariadne watches the train passing this wasnt in
the design cobb backs up spins around heading for the tail of the train a security man emerges from the front s
carrying an automatic rifle he steps towards the cab through the rain raises his weapon and blasts the cabs windscreen cobb clears the end of the train and skids across
the tracks arthur crouches down pushes the accelerator with his hand yanks the wheel flying blind
the cab nails the security man crunching into the front s
cobb smashes his car into the rear s
creating a gap arthur yanks the transmission and reverses scraping through the gap security men dive out of the way arthur throws a ragged j turn to head down a
side street cobb follows in the other car
rain whips across arthurs face as he breathes everybody okay
arthur looks at saito
saitos hand is at his belly
covered in blood
the sedan and cab pull into the side entrance eames jumps out pulls the shutter down behind them yusuf and eames pull fischer from the cab hustling him through a
cobb jumps out of the sedan furious
arthur what the arthur pulls the bloody saito from the front seat
is he dying
i dont know
what happened back there
where were you
we were blocked by a freight train
to ariadne why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection
snaps why were we all ambushed arthur
those werent regular projections theyd been trained
how could they be trained
fischers had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself
his subconscious is militarized
it shouldve shown on the research so why the hell didnt it
dont tell me to calm down you were meant to check fischers background thoroughly
you cant make this kind of mistake were not prepared for this kind of violence cobb weve dealt with sub security before
we just have to be more this wasnt part of the plan arthur
points at saito hes dying
so we put him out of his misery
eames steps into the room pulls his gun and moves over saito
hes in agony
lets wake him up cobb grabs eamess arm
they lock eyes it wont wake him up
what do you mean it wont wake him
when you die in a dream you wake up
not from this
were too heavily sedated to wake up that way
eames looks at yusuf then to cobb
so what happens if one of us dies
that person doesnt wake up
their mind drops into limbo
unconstructed dream space
whats down there
raw infinite subconscious
nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team whos been trapped there before
on this team
how long would we be stuck there
you couldnt even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases how long
decades it could be infinite i dont know
ask him hes the one whos been there before
eames moves to cobb
looks him in the eye
so now were stuck in fischers mind battling it out with his private army and if we get hit were stuck in limbo til our brains dissolve into scrambled egg
cobb says nothing
saito groans more loudly
lets just get him upstairs
saito is laid out on an old desk
arthur examines him
he motions to ariadne
eames watches cobb
arthur turns to cobb
you knew the risks and you didnt tell us
there wasnt meant to be any risk
we werent supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre
you had no right
its the only way you can go three layers deep arthur
arthur turns to yusuf hostile
you went along with this
i trusted him
you trusted him
when he promised you half his share
his whole share
plus he told me hed done it before
arthur turns to cobb
that worked out great didnt it cobb
cobb grabs arthur
you dont know anything about that
this was the only way to do this job arthur
i did what i had to do to get back to my children
so you led us into a war zone with no way out
we have a way out
we just have to push on do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick
we go any deeper we just raise the stakes
im sitting it out on this level
youll never make it eames
fischers security is surrounding this place as we speak
the ten hours of the flight is a week at this level youll never make it without getting killed
downwards is the only way forwards
we have to carry on
cobb looks at him
and we have to do it fast
eames and arthur weigh this
eames go get ready
arthur lets get in there and soften him up
cobb and arthur wearing balaclavas pull the sack from fischers head
he is chained to the radiator
im insured against kidnapping up to ten million thisll be simple no it wont
fischer looks at cobb unnerved
your lathers office below the bookshelves is his personal safe
we need the combination
i never noticed a safe doesnt mean you dont know the combination
well i dont
we have it on good authority that you do
yusuf looks through fischers wallet
eames is opening a five hundred dollars this cost
cash cards id
and this yusuf holds up a snapshot the photo from maurice fischers office young robert holds his homemade pinwheel his father blows on it
eames takes it from yusuf
eames hands him the snapshot
cobb studies the snapshot
eames examines himself in the hinged mirror from multiple angles one by one the myriad eames reflections become brownings
cobb pockets the photo
youve got an hour
i was supposed to have all night to crack him
and saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside
youve got an hour get something we can use
eames turns from the mirror as browning
he glances at his watch then screams as if begging for mercy brownings cry reverberates fischer looks up concerned whats that
another cry rings out
fischer recognizes the voice
make them stop the combination
i dont know it
why would browning tell us you did
let me talk to him ill find out
cobb pushes browning eames bloody and bruised into the room and forces him down next to fischer
cobb handcuffs brownings wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink
youve got an hour
theyve had me for two days
theyve got someone with access to your fathers office and theyre trying to open his safe they thought id know the combination but i dont neither do i uncle peter
confused maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it
he never gave me the combination
browning thinks for a minute
he did he just didnt tell you that it was a combination
something only you would know
some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with maurice we didnt have a lot of meaningful experiences together
perhaps after your mother died
after my mother died i went to him in my grief
you know what he told me
theres really nothing to be said robert
he always had a hard time with emotional i was eleven uncle peter
browning eames takes this in
he loved you robert
in his way
in his way
at the end he called me to his deathbed
he could barely speak but he took the trouble to say one last thing to me
he pulled me close
i could make out only one word
browning can say nothing
cobb pulls off his balaclava
looks down at saito who is breathing fast shallow
hows he doing
hes in a lot of pain
cobb takes saitos hand
looks him in the eye
when we get you down to the next level the pain will be less intense
saito nods breathing hard
low and if he dies
his conscious mind will drop out of the dream
hell be trapped in limbo for a lifetime
what will that do to him
cobb looks at her
when he wakes
his mind could be completely gone
when we wake i will still honor our arrangement
cobb looks down at saito sadly
saito san when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement
youll have forgotten this world
limbo will be your reality
lost there so long youll have become an old man
filled with regret
waiting to die alone
then ill take the chance and come back
and well be young men together again
saito smiles weakly
cobb nods at him turns to ariadne
when were you trapped in limbo
cobb says nothing
ariadne pulls him away from saito
cobb you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job
but they dont know the truth
the truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall
the truth that mal is bursting up through your subconscious
the truth that as we go deeper into fischer were also going deeper into you and im not sure were going to like what we find there
cobb stares back at ariadne
this is not just about fischer its about you
tell me what happened to you and mal
trapped in limbo
cobb looks at her
thinking it through
we were on a job
exploring dreams within dreams
but we didnt understand how your mind can turn hours into years
how you can get trapped
trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious
you can lose track of whats real
how long were you stuck
cobb pauses before he answers
looks at ariadne
ariadne stares at him incredulous
how did you stand it
we created a whole world for ourselves
its not so bad at first being gods
the problem is knowing that its not real
it became impossible for me to live like that
but not for her
she accepted it
at some point
mal opens a dolls house
inside is a safe
she opens it it is empty
she pulls out her spinning top
shed decided to forget that our world wasnt real
mal places the top inside the safe
locks it away
and when you finally woke up
to wake from that
from decades lived
to be old souls thrown back into youth
it was hard
at first mal seemed okay
but i started to realize something was wrong
finally she admitted it
this idea she was possessed by
this simple little idea that changed everything
what was it
that our world was not real
no matter what i did no matter what i said she was convinced that we were still in a dream
that we needed to wake up again
cobb is trying to calm mal who is hysterical
that to get home wed have to kill ourselves
ariadne looks at cobb appalled
what about your children
cobb has to look away
she believed they werent real
that our real children were waiting
mal shakes her head at cobb as he ushers the children out of the room faces unseen calm down mal theyre projections dom
im their mother dont you think i can tell the difference
cobb closes the door turns to her eyes full of bitter tears
if its my dream then why cant i control it
why cant i stop this
its obvious you dont know youre dreaming
you keep telling me i am and you dont believe me
she was certain
but she loved me too much to go without me
so she made a plan
cobb walks along checking door numbers against a key
for our anniversary
cobb enters the lavish suite
he notices the disheveled
he steps forwards smash he has tipped over a champagne glass with his foot
dinner for two is spread across the floor
he looks at the debris confused
next to the broken glass is a spinning top
he picks it up studying it thinking
he feels a draught looks to the window
the cobb looks out the window mal sits on the ledge of the opposite window
feet dangling over the dizzyingly high atrium
mal come back inside
im going to jump
and youre coming with me
no im not
this is real if you jump youre not going to wake up youre going to die
lets go back inside and talk about this please
weve talked enough
she kicks off a shoe and watches it drop
come out onto the ledge or ill jump right now
she means it
cobb swings his legs out sitting on the ledge opposite is wife
he looks down at the drop
im asking you to take a leap of faith
i cant do that mal
i cant leave our children
if i go without you theyll take them away anyway
what do you mean
i filed a letter with our attorney
explaining how im fearful for my safety how youve threatened to kill me
cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite panicking
i love you dom
ive freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them
were going home to our real children
out children are here mal
mal closes her eyes
cobb looks for some way to reach her
youre waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you you cant know for sure
but it doesnt matter
because youll be together
mal slips forward into space
cobb screams after her
then tries to bury his face in the wall
cobb stares as he remembers
he letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew id make
cobb stands with the thin man who has a piece of paper
shed had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists
cobb hears a shout turns to the garden
james crouches philippa joins him examining the ground faces unseen
it was impossible for me to explain the nature of her madness
the thin man thrusts the paper into cobbs hand
or never cobb
cobb turns back to the window about to call out james and philippa run off
cobb turns from the window
looks at the paper in his hand
it is an airplane ticket
so i ran
and ive been running ever since trying to buy my way back to my family
cobb looks across at ariadne
psychiatrists judged her sane
she was sane
she was just lost in the labyrinth
then why should you blame yourself
because we were a family
and we had a life i would do anything to get back to now
but that reality wasnt enough for me then
it might have been your idea to push the limits cobb
but youre not responsible for the idea that destroyed her
the idea that her world wasnt real
that was her own idea from her own mind
cobb says nothing
your guilt defines her
if were going to succeed in this youre going to have to forgive yourself and youre going to have to confront her
but you dont have to do it alone
you dont have to do this for me im doing it for the others
they dont know the risk theyve taken coming in here with you
cobb looks at the rooftop opposite sees a sniper take up a position
cobb shakes his head frustrated
we cant stay here
browning puts his hand on fischers shoulder
these people are going to kill us if we dont give them the combination
they wont theyll try to ransom us i heard them theyre going to lock us in and run the can into the river
what is in the safe
something for you
maurice always said it was his most previous gift
maurices will is with port and dunn
its an alternate
it supersedes the other only if you want it to
what does it say
it splits all the component businesses of fischer morrow into individual companies transferring ownership to the boards of those companies
leaving me nothing
a basic living
the entire empire would cease to exist
destroy my own inheritance
why would he suggest such a thing
i dont know robert
cobb opens the door
arthur is behind him
come to your senses
let us go
i dont know the combination
cobb considers this
opens his phone
pulls out his gun
lets try instinctively
i have someone standing in your fathers office ready to tap in a combination
he holds the phone to fischers mouth
first six numbers that come into your head
i have no idea cobb swings the gun onto browning five two eight
four nine one
cobb lowers his weapon
listens to the phone
shakes his head
shuts the phone
youll have to do better
arthur puts sacks over their heads
cobb and arthur drag fischer and browning to the van were worth much more to you alive
arthur places fischer on the back seat uses a dropper to drop liquid onto fischers mask his head slumps forwards
browning yanks the sack from his head it is now eames
excited his relationship with his fathers much worse that we thought
that helps us
arthur pulls a sniper rifle from a case by the van
the stronger the issues the more powerful the catharsis
cobb motions for yusuf to follow his upstairs
but how do you reconcile them if theyre that estranged
im working on that
arthur lines up a shot through the window well work fast fischers projections are closing in quick we need to break out of here before were totally boxed in
arthur shoots two snipers
cobb and yusuf gently load saito into the van
ariadne straps him in checks his bandages
arthur cant get the last sniper hes too hidden behind a wall shouldnt be afraid to dream a little bigger arthur eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher
fires the sniper explodes into the air arthur looks at eames
they climb into the van the van pulls out into the rain drenched streets
arthur opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes shifting fischers antipathy from his father onto browning should work
we need the imagery the words
so you destroy his one positive relationship
we repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfathers true nature
hell we should be charging fischer as much as saito
what about his security
its going to get worse as we go deeper
we bring in mr
a bad idea
arthur the second we approach fischer in that hotel theyre gonna mow us down we run with mr
charles like on the stein job
so youve done it before
but it didnt work
the subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces
eames takes this in
you learned a lot though
to eames ill need a decoy
how about a pretty young lady ive used before
fine cobb looks back a second s
pulls out tailing them
to yusuf i know youve got to stay ahead of them but drive with kid gloves okay
the world down there is going to be very unstable
and dont make the jump too soon that kick is our only way back we have to be ready to catch it ill use the music to let you know
when its coming but the rest is up to you
arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat
nods all round
sweet dreams yusuf hits a button and we fischer nurses a drink
staring at the ice cracking
am i boring you
fischer looks up
a beautiful blonde is next to him
i was telling you my story
i guess it wasnt to your liking
i have a lot on my mind
fischer looks around the bar
there are several stern looking characters paying him too much attention
arthur and ariadne sit at a table across the lobby
they spot cobb moving across the lobby towards fischer
and there goes mr
who or what exactly is mr
its a gambit designed to turn fischer against his own subconscious
cobb approaches the bar watched closely by fischers sub security
good to see you again
rod green marketing
to blonde and you must be
she presses against fischer as she slides off her stool and deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him
in case you get bored
cobb watches her walk away
the sub security follows her
i think you just got blown off
unless her phone number really does have only six digits
fischer glances at the napkin
arthur watches the sub security follow the blonde
and why dont you approve
because it involves telling the mark that hes dreaming
which involves attracting a lot of attention to us
didnt cobb say never to do that
you mustve noticed by now how much time cobb spends doing things he says never to do
cobb turns to fischer
strange way to make friends
off look lifting your wallet i mean
fischer pats his pocket
he looks to the lobby where he sees the sub security trailing the blonde
the wallet alones worth five hundred bucks
dont worry my guys are on it
who did you say you were
fischer looks at him curious
cobb plows on confident i said i was rod green from marketing but im not
my name is mr
i might seem familiar to you
im in charge of your security here
the blonde hurries up to saito emerging from the elevator mr
saito can i have a minute
she pushes him back into the elevator closing the door as the sub security approaches
the blonde fondles saitos lapels getting close
im sorry but
saito glances over her shoulder to see in the tunnel of infinite reflections created by the elevators opposing mirrors three reflections in the blonde is eames
pushing him away very amusing mr
you look a bit perkier
a shudder ripples through the elevator
turbulence on the plane
thats yusufs driving
and we yusuf fights the wheel as the van cuts down an alley bumping over potholes and smashing trash cans aside three s
s in furious pursuit
yusuf looks in the rear view mirror frustrated
he checks his watch then checks the back the sleepers shake with the impact and we as a tremor echoes through the bar fischer looks at cobb trying to place
you work for the hotel
my specialty is subconscious security
youre talking about dreams
youre talking about extraction
my job is to protect you
behind fischer a waiter puts down a tray tipping a champagne glass over smash cobb notices
pauses looks across the bar cobb looks around the bar the patrons start to stare at cobb suspicious cobb shifts back to fischer
my job is to protect you from any attempt to access your mind through your dreams
cobb regains his patter the patrons lose interest
eames pulls out fischers wallet moves to hand it to saito then pauses opens it leafs past the cast to find
the snapshot young robert holding his homemade pinwheel his father blowing on it
the elevator doors open and eames steps off
hands saito the wallet
get off at a different floor and keep moving
dump the wallet then meet me in the lobby
the security will try to track it down
we need to buy cobb a little more time
the doors close
saito puts the wallet in his pocket
he coughs a deep nasty cough
cobb looks over fischers shoulder to see a suited man watching him
another man is walking in from the lobby
youre not safe here
cobb steps away from the bar
fischer does not move
theyre coming for you
fischer sizes him up a clap of thunder echoes and we gunshots blast out the rear and side windows of the van a security man is leaning out of the
with a shotgun wind and rain rip through the van in the back arthurs fischer looks out the windows at sudden hurricane like rain
strange weather huh
a tremor runs through the bar cobb looks around you feel that
ariadne and arthur watch the gusts of wind rattle the windows
arthur sees hotel guests staring out at the weather puzzled
several of them turn to look directly at arthur
cobbs drawing fischers attention to the strangeness of the dream
thats making his subconscious look for the dreamer
and we at the end of the alley yusuf throws the van into a hard right turn we move into extreme slow motion
the sleepers centrifugal force
and we the liquid in fischers drink rises up against one side of the glass fischer notices confused
very odd the weather the gravity
fischer looks around the bar its as if the entire room is set at a degree angle glasses sliding off tables
but i can explain all this
youve actually been trained for this
fischer nods think of the strangeness of the weather the shifts in gravity
none of this is real
beat were in a dream
fischer looks at the room around them
back to cobb
all through the bar patrons turn to look at cobb in unison
the simplest test of what im saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel
fischer stares at cobb trying to process this
all around them people stare at cobb
several get up as if to approach
remember the training
accept the fact that were in a dream
thats why im here protecting you
as fischer considers this we yusuf straightens up the van racing down the street swerving through traffic and we the building gradually eases back into alignment so you
youre not real
the bar patrons start to ignore cobb again
im a projection of your subconscious
i was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream
i believe thats what has happened
fischer takes this in
then looks at the security men approaching across the crooked floor he nods at cobb
cobb escorts fischer across the lobby
as he does so he walks past the two children backs to us cobb ignores them the two sub security fall in behind
cobb hurries fischer up the stairs then pushes him into fischer stumbles in turns to cobb angry hey cobb reaches into his jacket the first man bursts in cobb kicks
him to the ground draws his gun as the second man comes through the door moving towards fischer blam
cobb blasts the second man in the back turns and shoots the first man
what are you doing
cobb turns to fischer calm
look at the gun in his hand
fischer looks the second man was holding a pistol
cobb opens the first mans jacket to show fischer his holster and sidearm
these men were sent to abduct you
cobb pulls out the gun and hands it to fischer
if im going to help you i need you to be calm
fischer remembers something
if this is a dream i have to kill myself and wake up fischer raises the gun towards his head i wouldnt do that theyve probably got you sedated
if you pull that trigger you might not wake up you might drop into a lower dream state
fischer you know all this you just have to remember it
fischer lowers his gun
saito walks down the corridor followed by a security man
saito ducks around the corner moves to a garbage chute and drops fischers wallet into it
he slips into the stairwell as the security man comes abreast of the chute and pauses
arthur leads ariadne to a particular room
arthur leads ariadne in
he opens the closet opens the room safe pulls our four bricks of plastic explosive
so if everythings correct this room should be directly below
cobb looks reassuringly at fischer
what do you remember from before this dream
looks up christ weve been kidnapped
where were they holding you
they had us
in the back of a van
your bodys bouncing around in the back of a van right now that explains the gravity shifts
to do with a safe
christ whys it so hard to remember
its like trying to remember a dream after youve woken up
it takes years of practice to do it easily
so you and browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind
they wanted a combination to a safe
they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head
thats them extracting a locator
a number from your own subconscious
it can be used any number of ways
thinking this is a hotel
what was the number you gave them
it was a long number
opens phone well we know where to start
into phone fifth floor
arthur hangs up the phone
he is standing on a chair attaching the explosives to the ceiling
do you use a timer
no i have to judge it myself
once youre all asleep up in room i wait til yusuf starts his kick
how will you know
his music warns me its coming then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable thats when i blow the floor out from underneath us and we
get a nice synchronized kick
too soon and we wont get pulled out too late and i wont be able to drop us
the van will be in free fall
i cant drop us with no gravity
arthur finishes setting the charges
saito moves through the lobby
browning is coming in the other direction
saito assumes him to be eames
i see youve changed
eames comes up behind browning catching saitos eye
i mistook you for a friend
good looking fellow im sure
browning moves off
saito approaches eames
thats fischers projection of browning
well keep an eye on how he behaves why
how he acts will tell us if fischers starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to
cobb leads fischer around a corner
arthur and ariadne are waiting in the corridor
they work for me
fischer starts looking at room numbers
cobb draws his gun steps back from the door and kicks it open
cobb jumps into the room gun up
the room is empty
arthur and ariadne search the room
saito and eames arrive
eames shuts the door
arthur finds something mr
arthur holds up a mechanism case
cobb shows it to fischer
you know what this is
fischers eyes roam over the dials and plungers
i think so
but i dont understand
they were going to put you under
im already under
a dream within a dream
arthur is at the door
someone is there
a key goes into the lock the door starts to open arthur reaches over and grabs the person entering throws them to the floor puts his gun in their face
it is browning
fischer stares disbelieving at his own godfather
whats going on
cobb pulls the key from brownings hand room
you said you were kidnapped together
not exactly they already had him
theyd been torturing him
you saw them torture him
fischer shakes his head
looks at browning
the kidnappers are working for you
no robert youre trying to get that safe open
to get the alternate will
browning looks up at fischer
fischer morrows been my entire life
i cant let you destroy it
im not going to throw away my inheritance
why would i
i couldnt take the chance of you rising to your fathers final taunt
im sorry robert but its his final insult
a challenge to build something for yourself
hes telling you that you arent worthy of his achievements
fischer takes this in
that he was disappointed
im so sorry
but he was wrong
youll make his company even greater than he ever could
your godfathers lying robert
fischer turns to cobb
how do you know
its what i do
hes hiding something
cobb looks at browning
lets find out what
cobb nods at arthur who starts unpacking the mechanism
lets do to him what he was going to do to you
cobb rolls up his sleeve
nods at fischer to do the same
well penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesnt want you to know
fischer looks cobb in the eye
decides rolls up his sleeve offering his bare arm
the team run tubes to each other arthur injects fischer whose head slumps
wait cobb im lost
whose subconscious are we going into
i told him it was brownings so hed come with us as part of our team
impressed hes going to help us break into his own subconscious
thats the idea
hell think that his security is brownings and fight them to learn the truth about his father
arthur hits buttons on the mechanism
the team goes out one by one
cobb is last
fischers subconscious is going to run you down hard
ill lead them on a merry chase
be back in time for the kick
im on it
cobb is no longer listening he stares at the net curtains billowing like those in mals suite a glimpse of someone mal
as the screen goes white and we are close on cobbs face staring
ariadne is beside him
they stand on a cliff dressed in white snowsuits carrying white painted weapons like wwii commandos
cobb checks his sniper rifle examines their objective a massive fortified medical facility a mile below
whats down there
hopefully the truth we want fischer to learn
i meant whats down there for you
cobb turns to her
eames saito and fischer arrive skiing down from the hill above
cobb pulls eames out of fischers earshot
youre the dreamer
i need you to draw the security away from the complex
then who guides fischer in
if i know the route
we could be compromised
eames looks as cobb uneasy
ariadne comes over
i designed the place
youre with me
i could do it
they turn to saito
saito shrugs at eames
eames brief saito on the route into the complex
what were looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section
that north tower
cobb moves to fischer
eames sees blood on the snow
looks at saito
fischer youre going in with mr
youre not coming in
you have to do this on your own
you have to get in there break into your godfathers mind and find out the truth about your father
cobb taps fischers radio mike
keep this live at all times
ill be listening in covering you
holds up the sniper rifle the windows on the upper floors are big enough that i can cover you from that south tower
cobb slips into his skis shoulders his rifle
arthur checks the mechanism
he hears low booms like thunder
he checks his watch the second hand crawls forwards
with a last look at the sleepers he heads out into the corridor
a gunshot slams into the van as yusuf drives he glances back to see a motorcycle pulling up behind him the rear passenger firing a shotgun the bike pulls alongside
yusufs window as the passenger reloads yusuf yanks the wheel towards the bike bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can grab it spin the wheel back pulling the passenger from the back of the bike
yusuf turns a corner heading into a disused arthur walks towards the elevator
it opens a security man emerges heading right for him
arthur takes a turn speeding up
the booms are louder and we the bike crosses behind the van catching up again as the driver pulls a handgun and starts blasting
up ahead an s
sits in a side road lining up to head off the van the security man driving the s
guns it as the bike creeps up on the other side of the van yusuf hits the brakes forcing the bike out into the path of the s
tossing the rider like a rag doll heading out of the market the van races onto a freeway on ramp approaching the bridge
smashes into the vans side forcing it up against a crash barrier
the van starts to slowly tilt over the barrier as the s
pushes as arthur hurries down the corridor the corridor starts to tilt and arthur is forced to run up onto the wall he rounds a corner straight into another security
man arthur head butts him and they struggle as they struggle the corridor spins around throwing them up onto the walls the ceiling as wall becomes floor they drop through a door into
the fight continues all over the spinning room and we sleeping arthur bounces around as the van tilts scraping along the barrier the van clears the end of the barrier
and rolls down the embankment and we arthur and the security man drop to the floor arthur on top
arthur gets up heads to the stairwell
the van settles with a thump
yusuf breathes hard
then smiles as he realizes he is in one piece
a ringing bell up ahead makes him look up to the bridge where the barriers are starting to come down
yusuf checks his watch bugger
yusuf hits the gas heading for the bridge
lines up behind him trying to catch up before the van crosses the barrier onto the bridge the van just makes it the s
behind rips its read axle off scraping to a halt on the rising section
the security man inside starts firing on the van
arthur races down the steps opens the door to the fourth floor spots security men outside room
they turn he darts back into the stairwell races down the stairs the security men follow they start shooting and we eames skis down within sight of the hospital complex
he reaches into his pack and lets off a flare
security men on the ramparts spot the flare and send patrols out on skis and snowmobiles to investigate
eames watches them close in then launches himself down the mountain streaking across the icy slope and we yusuf pulls forward looking over his shoulder to line up a backwards
run at the edge
he ducks as vicious fire from the s
hammers the vehicle
he looks at his watch
the second sod it
i hope your ready
he grabs an mp player and reaches into the back to place headphones on sleeping arthurs head
as he does so he notices saitos bandage bleeding through
yusuf hits play edith piafs non je ne regrette rien starts up and we arthur stops hearing something massive low end musical tones he looks up panicked no yusuf
shots slam into the stairs around him and we cobb and ariadne make their way down towards the complex
are you hearing that
the wind sounds unusually low
eames is hidden at the base of some trees whispering as a patrol passes beneath his position
i noticed it twenty minutes ago at first i thought it was just wind
cobb is listening intently
the wind changes pitch
no its music
what do we do
we move fast
saito did you copy
saito and fischer climb down a cliff face above the complex were going as fast as we can
ariadne looks at cobb concerned
how long do we have
yusufs about ten seconds from the jump which gives arthur about three minutes which gives us about sixty minutes
the route you gave them can they do it in under an hour
i dont think so
theyve still got to climb down to the middle terrace
they need a new route a direct route
the buildings designed as a labyrinth
there must be access routes that cut through the maze
into radio eames
eames cannot answer he slaloms through the forest sub security in hot pursuit bullets smashing into the trunks
cobb turns to ariadne
did eames add any features
what did he add
ariadne looks at cobb
i shouldnt tell you
if mal theres no time what did he add
utility closets trap doors
what about service features
did he add any large pipes or ducts
he added an air duct system it doesnt follow the maze
they can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower
explain it to them
into radio saito
saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay
and we yusuf looks at the security man in the s
gives him the finger and hits the gas racing backwards at the barrier
and we arthur runs up the stairs gun in hand rounds a corner and impossibly arrives behind the security man who looks at him confused then looks down to realize
he is now at the edge of a dangerous drop arthur shrugs
arthur pushes him over the edge he falls arthur races up to the fourth floor throws open the door and we in slow motion the van smashes through the concrete
barrier and we arthur is sprinting down the corridor when a tremendous crash sends him flying into the air and we a massive rumble prompts cobb to look across the valley eames shoots out of the trees then falls to the snow as he sees a great cracking up ahead the slope is falling away in
saito hears the rumble above them
he looks down fischer is below near the bottom of the sheer face look out
saito cuts the rope they fall hit the icy face and slide down the slope clearing the path of the avalanche and we in extreme slow motion the van emerges
from the concrete balustrade and starts falling and we arthur is still flying through the corridor not landing gravity has disappeared
he scrambles for a handhold grabbing a sconce and we cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex
what was that
did we miss it
yeah we missed it
eames is lying on the snow
what the hell do we do now
finish the job before the next kick
what next kick
cobb looks at ariadne as he talks into the radio
when the van hits the water
i figure arthurs got a couple minutes and weve got about twenty
cobb and ariadne move towards the base of the complex
saito and fischer run around the base of the building
they find a large exhaust port
lay a charge on the grill
they blow the charge
climb into the open vent
in extreme slow motion the van seems suspended in mid air ten stories above the river
and we in zero gravity arthur pulls himself to the door of opens it
he looks at the charges planted on the ceiling
how the hell do i drop you
he pulls the charges from the ceiling
and we saito and fischer hurry through the duct system
saito is falling behind coughing up blood
cobb grabs a security guard from behind strangling him unconscious
he beckons to ariadne covering her as she runs towards him
they enter the base of the south tower
a guard is manning the tower
cobb and ariadne enter cobb shoots the guard and moves to the window
she points thats the antechamber outside the strongroom
cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber
what about the strongroom
doesnt it have any windows
wouldnt be very strong if it did
off look look if you wanted to design it yourself its fine
better hope that we like what fischer finds in there
cobb sets up his sniper rifle
through the scope he can see three guards on the balcony outside the chamber
three more inside
cobb casually picks them off with his rifle
ariadne watches through binoculars appalled
these projections theyre part of his subconscious
are you destroying those parts of his mind
no of course not
theyre just projections
eames is watching the patrols head back towards the complex
theyre heading your way
like they know something
cobb hears this
buy us some time
on my way
eames takes off towards the base of the complex
and we arthur floats into the room
the sleepers are floating loosely connected by their tubes
arthur looks at them mind racing
he pulls cobb towards eames and we saito and fischer approach the grate covering the exit to the anteroom
saito slumps to the floor of the duct pulls out his radio
fischer looks at him he is pale shivering
fischer takes the radio whispers into it
into radio were here
are we clear to proceed
cobb scans the anteroom through the scope it looks clear
youre clear but hurry theres an army headed your way
ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex
the squelch from the radio is too loud fischer grabs it and turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate
eames is setting mines along the lowest wall of the structure
he moves carefully there is a sheer drop below the wall
cobb spots something through his scope
something above the main windows glimpsed through the side of the skylight
theres someone else in there
cobb prepares to fire
ariadne grabs the radio fischer stop
its a trap
fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he carefully lifts the grate
he motions for saito to stay
cobb tenses to fire
a little lower
a little cobb freezes it is mal in his sights
ariadne puts up her binoculars
fischer is climbing out of the vent
cobb thats not really her cobb turns to her how can you know that
fischer moves into the antechamber cautious im in
fischer turns up the volume fischer look out
mal drops gracefully to the floor behind him hello
cobb looks at ariadne cobb shes just a projection
nods turns back to the scope too late mal shoots fischer cobb reflexively pulls the trigger mal goes down cobb steps back from the scope stunned
get to the anteroom now
they run for the door
saito starts as he hears the shot
he starts edging forwards clutching his belly
and we the sleepers are floating in a rough stack top and tailed
arthur pulls the bedding from the bed and uses the sheet to bind the sleepers together
and we in extreme slow motion the van creeps downwards still high above the river
and we arthur pushes the floating stack of sleepers to the elevator
he hits the button the doors open he pushes them in grabs the charges climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we eames steps over saito who looks up
at him with dying eyes eames jumps out of the vent to find cobb and ariadne standing over the bodies of fischer and mal
mal killed fischer i wouldnt shoot her
eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls fischers jacket open it wont do any good eames shocks fischers chest
even if you could revive his body his minds trapped down there
eames listens for a pulse
looks up at cobb
so that it then
its you who doesnt get back to your family
eames looks down at fischer
then over to the double doors
i wanted to know what was going to happen in there
i think we had this one
theres still a way we follow fischer down they look at her
were almost out of time down there theyll be enough time
well find him soon as you hear arthurs music start you use the defibrillator to revive him we give him his own early kick from below
get him in there points to doors then as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers
eames looks at her then to cobb
okay saito can hold them off while i plant the rest of the charges
saitos not going to last eames
we have to try
go for it but im taking the kick whether youre back or not
eames pulls the mechanism from his pack
offers it to ariadne
ariadne pulls out the tubes can i trust you to do whats needed
mals down there and i can find her
shell have fischer
how do you know
she wants me to come after him
she wants me back down there with her
cobb rolls up his sleeve
ariadne rolls up her own sleeve
cobb and ariadne lie down
eames hits the button water
and we are ariadne lies in the surf staring up at a cloudless sky
a tremendous boom prompts her to look around her urban buildings piled right down to the water
the buildings are decaying falling into the ocean like a glacier calving
cobb wades towards her through the shallow water
ariadne looks up at the crumbling city around them
this is your world
and this is where shell be
and we arthur floats on top of the elevator planting small charges on the emergency brakes and cable
he sets them grabs the other explosives then pushes away shooting up the shaft
as he hits the detonator blasting the braking and safety systems of the elevator we move into slow motion the fireballs flaming out in graceful licks and we eames races
around full speed getting the defibrillator paddles laying them by fischers body he runs into the duct pulls saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun
come on saito
i need you to cover fischer while i plant the charges
saito nods weakly tries to hold the gun
eames moves to the window pulls his machine gun off checks its load
he watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls
eames lays down a hail of covering fire then heads outside eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire bullets shatter a window behind him and we move into slow
motion the glass cascading gently and we cobb and ariadne climb out of the waves full speed
they move into the shadow of the tall crumbling buildings
the streets are eerily deserted
as they move further in the buildings become newer different
ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings every architectural style imaginable in waves of failed utopias
you built all this
we both did
we built for years
then when that got stale we started in on the memories
a childs shout echoes through the deserted canyons prompting cobb to look down a side street a little blonde boy crouched his back to us
a little blonde girl joins the boy and as cobb turns down the street they run off
cobb and ariadne emerge into a peculiar square lined with an eclectic mix of buildings from apartment blocks to houses
this is our neighborhood
confused from what city
pointing that was our first apartment
then we moved to that building
we got that small house when mal became pregnant
you reconstructed them all from memory
we had time
cobb pauses in front of a french country house
the house mal grew up in
will she be in there
come on cobb leads ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper
cobb leads ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the elevators
we both wanted a house but we both loved skyscrapers
in the real world we had to choose
cobb pulls out his handgun and a ziplock bag full of bullets
how do we send fischer back
we need some kind of kick
cobb cocks his weapon and the elevator stops
the doors open
ariadne moves to exit cobb stops her
theres something you have to understand about me
you see an idea is like a virus
cobb leads her out of the lift
cobb and ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous interior of a craftsman house
they cautiously move down the corridor towards the back of the house
turns to ariadne highly contagious and an idea can grow
the smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world
cobb is staring into the kitchen
mal is sitting at the table back to them staring out at the porch the towers of limbo stretching off behind it
the smallest idea such as
your world is not real
cobb hands ariadne his gun and moves towards mal
a simple little thought that changes everything
ariadne watches as cobb sits down beside mal
and we arthur flies back down the shaft to the top of the elevator squeezes past the car to the bottom and starts to set the main charges across the
bottom of the car and we cobb touches mals arm she turns angry
it is only now that we see that she holds a carving knife
mal looks at ariadne
so certain of your world
of whats real
do you think he is points at cobb or do you think hes as lost as i was
i know whats real
what are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream
mutable laws of physics
tell that to the quantum physicists
reappearance of the dead
what about heaven and hell
persecution of the dreamer the creator the messiah
they crucified christ didnt they
i know whats real
no creeping doubts
not feeling persecuted dom
chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces
the way the projections persecute the dreamer
mal puts her hand on his face
admit it dom
you dont believe in one reality anymore
choose your reality like i did
choose to be here
rising anger i have chosen mal
i have to get back to them
because you left them
you left us
youre wrong dom
our children are here a childs shout draws cobb james crouches on the porch back to us
philippa joins him also turned away
cobb watches moved
mal leans in close
whispers and youd like to see their faces again wouldnt you dom
our real children are waiting for me up above
and we arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the car as his hand comes away from saito he sees blood on it
he looks at saitos belly the blood is coming through his shirt
arthur sticks headphones on sleeping eames and we eames throws a grenade blowing up the security forces trying to ascend the terraces
he ducks to the ground to avoid heavy fire starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the base of the terraces
saito looks up as he hears a security guard climbing through the duct
he raises his gun trembling with weakness
and we mal laughs at cobb
laughs up above
listen to yourself
you judged me for believing the very same thing
mal points at the children these are our children
turns to the kids hey james
the children start to turn to us but cobb closes his eyes
theyre not real mal
our real children are waiting for us the children run off
cobb opens his eyes
you keep telling yourself that but you dont believe it i know it and what if youre wrong
what if im whats real
cobb is silent
you keep telling yourself what you know
but what do you believe
what do you feel
cobb looks at mal
i feel guilt
and however confused i might get
however lost i might seem
its always there
telling me something
reminding me of the truth
that you were wrong to doubt our world
that the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie
how could you know it was a lie
because it was my lie
realizing because you planted the idea in my mind
because i performed inception on my own wife then reaped the bitter rewards
wed become lost in here
living in a world of infinite possibilities
a world where we were gods
i realized we needed to escape but shed locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world
insert cut mal opens the dolls house
takes the spinning top lies it down in the safe
locks it away
i couldnt make mal understand that we needed to break free
so i started to search our world
cobb turns to mal but keeps talking to ariadne
insert cut cobb wanders the streets of limbo
searching for the right place in her mind
insert cut cobb stops outside the victorian house mals childhood home looking up at it
he heads inside
and when i found that place that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before i broke it open
insert cut cobb looks around mals childhood bedroom
comes to the dolls house
i broke into the deepest recess of her mind to give her the simplest little idea
insert cut cobb throws open the safe doors
sitting on the shelf of the safe is a spinning top
on its side
a truth that she had once known but had chosen to forget
insert cut cobb picks up the totem
he spins it in the safe
it spins and spins without end
cobb closes the door of the safe
that her world was not real
that death was a necessary escape
they lie on the tracks looking into each others eyes
mal is crying
cobb takes her hand reassuring
he starts to speak youre waiting for a train
a train that will take you far away
you know where you hope this train will take you but you cant know for sure
yet it doesnt matter
mal looks at him across the railroad tracks
replies because youll be together
the train comes obliterating the lovers
back in the present cobb looks into mals eyes
she is crying
i never thought that the idea id planted would grow in her mind like a cancer
that even after we woke
insert cut cobb looks around the hotel suite confused
he moves to the curtains
mal is on the ledge opposite
youd continue to believe that your world was not real
crying mal nods that death was the only escape
insert cut mal plunges to her death
you killed me
cobb looks at mal
whispers i was trying to save you im sorry
mal comes in close to cobb
looks him over
you infected my mind
you betrayed me
but you can make amends
you can still keep your promise
we can still be together
in our world
the world we built together
arthur hits play on his music player edith piaf starts to ring out arthur checks his detonator and we eames races back in in the relative quiet he notices massive
low e musical tones
he drops his gun and goes to fischers side
saito musters all his remaining strength as the guard emerges saito fires dropping the guard then collapses the gun clattering to the duct floor
saito is dead
eames powers up the defibrillator puts the paddles on fischers chest then pow
he shocks him and we lightning crackles across the sky ariadne sees it
we need fischer
you cant have him
cobb stares at mal
if i stay can she take him back
cobb what are you saying
fischers on the porch
cobb you cant do this
go check hes alive ariadne
ariadne moves onto the porch high above the metropolis and we arthur nods his head in time with the music counting down holding the detonator
he starts bracing himself and we
eames recharges the defibrillator
shocks fischer again and we ariadne looks up as a large bolt of lightning rips across the sky
she looks down to see fischer bound and bloody lying below the rail
and its time
but you have to come with us
another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky cobb im not going to let you lose yourself in here
you have to get back to your children
send fischer i have to stay you cant stay here to be with her cobb turns from mal
looks at ariadne
saito is dead by now
that means hes here
i have to stay here and find him
ariadne removes fischers gag pulls him up onto the rail
cobb looks back at mal
i cant stay here to be with her because shes not real
mal looks at cobb furious
im the only thing you do believe in anymore
here doesnt this feel real dom
she stabs him in the chest cobb wheezes gasping looking at mal
i wish you were
but i couldnt make you real
im not capable of imagining you in all your complexity and
as you really were
youre the best i can do
and youre not real
mal pulls the knife and moves to strike again no
a shot rings out mal grabs her shoulder cobb turns to ariadne who is pointing cobbs gun
whatre you doing
she kicks fischer off the roof aims again at mal fischer drops as the sky lights up with electricity fischer screams then gasps no longer falling and we are eames
pulls the defibrillator from fischers chest as he get in there quick
fischer looks up at the double doors
staggers to his feet
fischer pushes open the doors to the strongroom
fischer walks into the silent white room
at one end of the room is a bed
a figure lies in the bed
breathing with tremendous difficulty
and we ariadne takes aim at mal no
cobb holds ariadnes gaze
she lowers the gun
eames grabs the detonator then moves to the door of the strongroom
arthur hits the detonator the charges on the bottom of the elevator explode and we move into extreme slow motion as the flames balloon a rumble builds as fischer approaches
the bed overcome with emotion
his father sees him
starts trying to speak
fischer leans in
hoarse whisper i
i know dad
you were disappointed that i couldnt be you
the dying man shakes his head with surprising energy
whisper i was disappointed
that you tried
fischer hears this
and we the elevator car is rocketed along its track by the explosion arthur is smashed against the floor of the car next to the sleepers who shudder with the
force of acceleration and we eames watches fischer
to himself come on come on
the father collapses back onto the pillow
fischer starts to weep
his father reaches out a trembling hand but when fischer tries to hold it he shakes his sons hand away
he is reaching for the safe next to his bed
his fingers fumble at the keypad he cant open it
his son pushes into the keypad
inside the safe is the will
and beside it is a homemade pinwheel clearly made by a child
he takes it out marveling at it
he turns to his father but his father is dead
eames watching from the door hits the detonator a line of explosions rips along the lower wall
the entire a fierce wind starts howling through the house as the sky outside darkens
cobb shields mal against the blast looks up at ariadne who holds the railing fighting the wind thats the kick you have to go
no im not
im staying here to find saito
turns to mal and to say goodbye
ariadne loosens her grip on the railing
dont lose yourself
and bring him back
ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge falling and we ariadne drops as the floor collapses her eyes snap open
cobb holds mal in his arms
the wind dies
wed be together forever
you promised me
but we cant
and im sorry
you remember when you asked me to marry you
you said you dreamt that wed grow old together
and we did
mal looks at cobb
i miss you more than i can bear
but we had our time together
and now i have to let go
she nods weakly
cobb holds mal as her eyes close
and we fischer and his fathers body drop away ariadne drops inside the rocketing elevator and as it smashes into the top of the shaft ariadne smashes into fischers eyes
open panicking he unbuckles himself pushes out of the broken window stops goes back to unbuckle browning and drag him out
fischer breaks the surface with browning who coughs and gasps
he starts pulling for the near bank struggling through the rain impacted water ariadne arthur and yusuf wait calmly underwater
they are sharing two regulators pulled from beneath the front seat
arthur turns to saito
there is blood in the water around saitos belly his eyes are lifeless arthur feels for a pulse
turns to cobb whose eyes are lifeless
ariadne grabs arthurs elbow pulling him away
fischer turns browning eames over
they lie there exhausted
im sorry robert
fischer stares at the rain on the water
the will means that dad wanted me to be my own man not live for him
turns to browning and im going to uncle peter
wipes the rain from his face
in the puddle beside them the reflection is not browning but eames
arthur sits on the riverbank breathing heavily
to find saito
arthur looks out at the water below the bridge
hell be lost
hell be alright
and we the waves toss a bearded man onto wet sand
as the japanese security guard turns him onto his back we realize that this is cobb older
cobb wolfs his food
the elderly japanese man saito years old watches him
have you come to kill me
cobb does not look up
ive been waiting for someone to come for me
someone from your half remembered dream
saito peers at cobb
not possible he and i were young men together
and i am an old man
filled with regret
saito remembers nods
waiting to die alone yes
cobb is staring at something on the table
i came back for you
i came to remind you of what you once knew
cobb gestures at the table
saito follows his gaze down to the polished surface of the table
that this world is not real
the top is still spinning perfectly as if it will never topple
saito looks at the top
then back to cobb
you came to convince me to honor our arrangement
and to take a leap of faith
as saito san listens to cobb he looks at the gun on the table between them
come back and well be young men together again
the elderly saito looks at cobb
and we ariadne watches cobb
his eyes are closed
hot towel sir
his eyes flicker open
he takes the towel with a nod
well be landing in los angeles in about twenty minutes
do you need immigration forms
takes a landing card
looks around the cabin
saito is watching him
holding cobbs gaze saito picks up the phone and dials
cobb nods thanks
cobb steps forwards to the immigration official
hands him his passport
the official takes a beat looks cobb up and down then whump
the passport is stamped
as cobb takes it back he spots ariadne at the next counter
she nods at him
he nods back
then moves off
as cobb passes through baggage claim he exchanges subtle greetings with eames and yusuf
arthur smiles broadly at cobb
cobb brushes past fischer who glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him then moves on
as cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall he spots professor miles waving at him
cobb enters with miles
drops his bags
moves to the table looking out at the overgrown garden
he reaches into his pocket takes out his pewter spinning top lowers it to the table and spins it a childs shout makes him look up through the window james
and philippa have run into view playing their faces turned away
cobb stares at the back of his childrens heads
miles moves to the window and knocks on the glass james and philippa turn see their dad
he steps to the window watching their bright faces shining as they run towards him
behind him on the table the spinning top is still spinning
