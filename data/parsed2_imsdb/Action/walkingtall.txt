we home in on a boat coming in to shore
off walks a man he is carrying a backpack and wearing shades
he walks through a town passing various stores and the general bustle of the people there
he notices a baby in a pram left out on the sidewalk then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing what looks like a drug deal
chris reads a closure notice on the door
a police car rolls up

a group of guys are there waiting one of them holding a ball
they salute as chris walks up
they all laugh
lets play ball
ray go deep go deep
as ray runs off he throws the ball into rays back
spotting a sign that reads hamilton field when did that happen
his parents hadnt left him the mill more than minutes before he shut it down
a voice shouts heads up chris catches a fast ball thrown from behind
jay steps out of his vehicle
cause i opened my casino
still got a gut huh jay

what you get tired of being all that you can be
im still all i can be
ill just have to see about that
what brings you home
i just wanna relax catch my breath
another truck with a few guys on it pulls up not today
a football game ensues there are two teams
jays guys vs chris guys
on the sidelines pete pulls up on a small motorcycle
chris notices pete hanging around with kids smoking
it comes down to the last play the teams are huddled into two groups talking
if we score here we win right
alright boys last play
we need to put this to rest
just give me the ball

on the first hut
ok vaughn last chance
chris gets the ball and throws it
an opponent comes in hard and tackles him low
ray runs for the ball but gets clotheslined by jay

the security guy grabs chris around the neck
chris elbows him and throws him onto the table
the croupier takes a fighting stance
jimmy taps chris on the shoulder

more security men appear one of them knocks jimmy out
a whole fight breaks out ray gets knocked out
chris beats off several security men before taking an electric shock to the neck and a baton to the face
chris wakes up on a table under a light
sees the tag around chris neck special forces
ill take that
chris grabs him by the neck but they beat him down again
what are you doin
has a scalpel in his hand special forces
he rips open chris shirt
this guy knows hamilton
a struggle ensues and chris chest is cut up
we see chris is crawling badly hurt
a truck stops directly in front of him
chris passes out again
to chris family folks hes pretty banged up inside and out
whoever did this left him for dead
a lesser man wouldnt have survived

chris has returned home
hes still in bad shape and his parents help him out of the car
he insists on taking the steps by himself
theres some old crutches in the garage
a montage ensues with chris on the couch sometimes with ray other times with pete
chris is recovering and is exercising by the end of it
chris pulls the cover off an old truck
he smiles and gets in
he starts the engine
changed the plugs a while back
appreciate that dad
i mightve had serious issues with your career choice but just didnt seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck
where you headin
i was goin into town to get some supplies
ya whole life all you wanted to do was get outta here
what made you come back
you gonna think im crazy
i been thinking about the mill
when i was a kid goin to visit you at work the smell of that fresh cut cedar
you remember that smell
mmm i remember a lotta nice things before the mill closed
when did they go outta business
nods to a closed supply store
closed about six months ago
theres a home depot about fifteen minutes up the road
nods to an adult xxx shop dont ask
jay pulls up in his car
first of all i wanna say thanks
hes been fired and his gaming permits been pulled
i dont know how my security cameras didnt catch that
jay starts to help chris taking wood off the truck but chris throws it back on
they miss a lot at your place dont they jay
look chris i hate seein ya like this
your boys did it
so they got a little rough they were a bit edgy
you dont know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis
look theyve been reprimanded
they say you went nuts man
i know the proper term vets use is post traumatic stress
what the fuck are you talking about
whatever it was you tore my place apart and it wasnt easy for me to get my guys agree not to press charges
look chris if you had a problem
shouldnt you have come to me
look i wanna bring you inside
chris i wanna make you head of security
i guess you probably need time to think about it
this is for you
its a little something to help you get
he puts down an envelope with money in it
chris gives it back to him
come on man dont be like that
i came all the way out here to your house just to see you get back on your feet
im goin to the sheriff
im sorry you feel that way
ill see ya round chris
an officer is on the phone ignoring him
the sheriff comes out
well hey chris
good to see you up and about youre lookin spiffy
im here to press charges
well this isnt about that incident at the casino a while back is it
yea it is
cause that matters closed
did you look into it
they did an internal investigation
thats good enough for me
an internal investigation
chris i know youre familiar with the term no fly zone
cause thats what the casino is
since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town
so case closed basically
ill see ya
im not gonna let this stand
what did you say to me
i said im not gonna let this stand
youre lucky to be alive right now thats all you need to be concentrating on
this is my town ok im the sheriff here
ill tell you what will stand not the other way around
now please get out of my building
deni is at the door
this belongs to you
she hands him a leather jacket
i appreciate that i thought this was history
coulda left it in the trash but i
nice to see you dear
hi mrs vaughn
can i talk to you outside for a second
mom ill be right back
how you been
talked to the sheriff yet
well i went down to the police station and i talked to somebody with a badge
sure as hell didnt seem like much of a sheriff
hes up for re election you know
maybe you could take his job
somebody ought to
how about you
sunshine and pine trees
been readin these books teach you how to cultivate happiness
books on the future go with the flow that sorta thing
is it workin
i have my moments
so the casino huh
been there almost a year
treatin you good
lot better than it treated you
i like that
jay hamiltons done well for himself hasnt he
yea hes a real go getter that one
i heard he got you
lasted about minutes a long long time ago
you still work for him though
rents gotta be paid chris
hope to see you around
she begins to drive off
thanks for the jacket
she toots the horn as she goes
connie is on the phone
and where is he
the vaughns truck pulls up at speed
they enter a garage pete is on a stretcher
its ok mom hes stabilised
to chris it was close
i never did it before
we mighta kinda pushed him into it
chris approaches the kid
whered you get the drugs
im not really sure
from the security guys workin at the casino
chris gets into his truck
call the police
no that wont do any good
chris speeds off
he pulls up at their home and enters the garage
is pete ok
hell be fine
chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard
what are you doin
chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it
aw chris not like this
chris listen to me
if you go outta here with that gun theyre gonna
chris drives to the casino he cocks the shotgun but decides to leave it in the truck
instead he takes a piece of wood from the back of his truck
he enters the casino with it
he smashes a fruit machine
a guard comes up and chris beats him
a fight scene breaks out with chris beating the guards and generally trashing the place
he takes back his special forces dogtag from the guard who stole it
chris hurls his piece of wood at the vip lounge window smashing it to pieces
jay emerges from behind it
guess that changes our relationship a bit huh
as he drives off in his truck police cars appear with sirens going
he pulls over
you should not have come looking for trouble
keep your hands up get out of the vehicle now chris
i advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought
if you go to trial you stand to do years
this is a sweet plea normally they wouldnt even put it on the table but your military record cant be ignored
three months home arrest some community service
pretty generous offer chris
but id have to plead guilty
look at it from the other side
theres over a dozen witnesses none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture
we see a montage of casino workers badmouthing chris
he started bustin up the machines
there was a gunshot
theyre only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet
well i still say you should take it
i wasnt wrong
and i wont say i was
our job is to keep order
but there was no chance of that
me and my men we were just tryin to control him
he was highly trained violent very dangerous person
so dangerous so violent so highly trained that he despatched six of the casino staff single handedly
his weapon of choice a simple piece of cedar
which in his hand became a devastating force with one aim to hurt people destroy property
he went directly for everything
he just came in and took over the place
you said he broke your arm
yea thats correct my right forearm
both bones with a single shot
it was crazy
you know toss out a coupla drunks now and then
guys try to grope the girls but ah nothing with this sort of violence
did he give you any kind of advanced warning
a chance to defend yourself
we tussled but hes a big guy
he was on a mission
besides he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what i could see
so from what you saw it seemed like he had some kinda purpose
i think he had a point to prove yeah
i was emptyin machines when mr vaugh came in and started swingin
i was tryin to get outta there
mr crow you may present your clients case
to his lawyer youre fired
your honor id like to plead my own case
mr vaughn if you choose to represent yourself and not be represented by legal counsel you realise that you cant then claim a mistrial on that basis
yes i do
very well mr vaughn
i dont deny anything that was said here today
does that mean youre changing your plea to guilty
im not guilty of anything
except standing up for myself when the law wouldnt
hes trying to introduce prior events your honor
mr vaughn stay on point
i grew up in this town
people used to walk tall in this town they wouldnt have traded the mill for a crooked casino
mr vaughn were not here to listen to civic speeches
and they wouldnt have stood around while drugs were being sold to kids
mr vaughn youre close to being held in contempt
i was justified in what i did and if you acquit me of these charges im gonna run for sheriff
and if elected im gonna fix this town
mr vaughn you are now charged with contempt
and i will make sure that this he opens his shirt revealing huge scarring never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it
i order the jury to ignore what they have just seen
mr vaughn take your seat
mr forman has the jury reached a verdict
we have your honor
will the defendant please rise
we find the defendant chris vaughn not guilty
the crowd breaks into cheer
chris takes a tag from his piece of cedar wood which is laying on the evidence table
this is mine
the crowds fade away with chants of sheriff vaughn
chris pulls up to the station in his police truck its clear hes now the sheriff
well you won the election congratulations
we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here and i can personally vouch for each and every one of these men
theyre good deputies
youre all fired
chris takes a look around
jay is speeding along in a sportscar
he is pulled over by a police truck
license and registration please
youre joking right
license and registration
jay hands it over
whats the problem sheriff
and the drugs youre pedalling out of your casino
only thing thats going on in my casino right now is reconstruction
you took care of that
yea thats right and i plan on taking care of everything else too
if you can try to think this through
a casino is a license to print money
why would i jeopardise that by selling drugs
cause you owned the town jay
its changed now
see the only thing that i think has changed around here is that every morning you get to wake up and put on that nifty lil badge
but underneath that badge is the same guy that couldnt make it playing college football apparently couldnt make it in the army and not gonna make it as a cop
is that right
yea and if you push too hard youre gonna be a man who doesnt live to see
chris hands it over
sir get your tail lights fixed its your last warning
whats wrong with my tail lights
chris smashes up the back end of jays car with his trusty piece of cedar wood
chris tosses ray a badge
no nope no
come on man you know i hate cops
you been sheriff minutes and im already startin to hate you
im a convicted felon
i got a lil pull around here
oh now youre a crooked cop doing favours for friends
thats how it starts
see next thing you know youll be taking bribes setting up roadblocks frisking dudes crotches
are you done
ray i need your help
oh dont do that
i need you to take me to drugs school
i get to wear a uniform
a montage ensues with chris and ray busting various drug dealers
youre sure youre not carrying anything
i dont have shit
spread your legs arms down
been workin out
ohhhh somebody needs a bath
now you read me my rights and take me in
and i call my lawyer
i have a hunch there may be somethin else in here pats the dealers truck
music plays while the two chop up the dealers car into pieces while laughing
guess we gotta move to plan screw you i do have a bit of information for you
its not just me actually theres a whole lotta people in on this one
spit it out
youre gonna get hurt
chris is in the room with a shotgun
why does it always have to be your fight
you might need this
i put my guns down a long time ago
youre just being stubborn

jay calls a number on his celphone

a loud explosion happens its chris police truck outside

chris steps towards the front of the building but men outside open fire chris ducks for cover
to deni get down
pete somethins burnin
men with machine guns are still firing at the police station
denis screaming booth is cheering
take that and get in there
chris gives deni a pistol
ray steps into the kitchen but gunmen have infiltrated the home
a fight breaks out and pete flees
ray jumps onto the back of a gunman
chris shoots up the floor with a shotgun and breaks a hole in it
ray stabs the gunman with a potato peeler and knocks him out with a frying pan
to deni come here
they get down into the hole in the floor
when i say now start shooting over there
booth is now under fire and is scared
vaughn you gotta get me outta here
two other gunmen in stocking masks are holding the family hostage upstairs
i know who you are
the gunman takes off his mask and hits him with a pistol
calling downstairs burke
check it out
he goes downstairs to find burke dead on the kitchen floor
he follows traces of blood across the floor
chris is making his way towards booth under fire
get me outta here man

gunshots hit near booth
hamiltons operation is at the mill ok
its at the mill now get me outta here
the gunman enters a room ray is there pointing a shotgun at him
booth is standing and gets shot dead
ray shoots the gunman who falls to the floor
booth is dead so chris leaves him there
to gunmans body on the floor hey
gunman looks away for a second and michelle kicks him down the stairs
as he tumbles down ray reloads his shotgun
the two begin firing at each other taking cover behind the furniture
tried to warn ya chris
didnt want this to happen
one of the men outside has a canister
watkins gives him the nod and he begins walking towards the station
chris is beneath the floor and shoots him in the legs
the two remaining men outside open fire again
another gunman tries to approach but hes shot in the legs as well
watkins enters the station and fires repeatedly at the floor
come get some
deni fires off some shots
watkins is distracted by the shots chris appears in the floor hole and blasts watkins at close range with a shotgun
chris climbs out of the hole and they hug
shots are still being fired in the lounge
ray and the gunman begin to wrestle
ray wins and punches the man repeatedly
chris has come back to the house and tries to pull ray off the man ray mistakenly hits chris in the face
chris helps ray over to a chair ray has taken a shot to the leg
the injured gunman from the kitchen appears brandishing a pistol
you stabbed me
with a potato peeler
chris and ray hold up their hands
he aims at ray but hes shot in the back of the head by dad who is approaching down the stairs
you gonna be ok
chris is in a police car driving at speed
he approaches the mill and busts through the locked gates
the mill is dark chris is finding his way around using a torch
he finds jay sitting
get up jay
just a sec
remember we used to play hide n seek up here
jay hits a metal saw which resonates making a metallic sound
that was my favourite sound
jay stands up and holds up his hands
jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch
chris falls into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over it
jay hits more switches powering up the machinery
you wanna know what my new favourite sounds gonna be
the sound of you screaming like a little bitch
jay hits chris in the stomach with a pole a few times
chris grabs the pole and they both fall
chris has hurt his leg
chris stumbles off into the woods
jay grabs an axe and goes after him he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large earthy embankment
at the bottom they come to their senses and begin fighting again jay with his axe and chris with a log hes ripped off a tree
chris knocks jay out by hitting him hard in the legs
youre right jay this does change our relationship
