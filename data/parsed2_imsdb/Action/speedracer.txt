written by larry andy wachowski st draft january th a battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars and checkered flags and the words start your engines
beats up and down a sewing machine needle of anxious restless adolescent energy
a pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form then hesitates twitching with the speed of a humming bird wing caught between two fingers then is quickly erased
as a different answer is chosen
the form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty
a ten year old boy stares at the next question
grace buys a bag of jellybeans
there are yellow ones red ones green ones white ones blue ones and black ones
if grace wants to eat one of each while keeping her eyes closed what is the minimum number she will have to eat
his mouth tries to makes sense of the question but its not working
he looks around at the other students quietly diligently filling in their ovals while he fidgets his leg beating his pencil fluttering a pot jiggling its lid about to boil
he reads the question again
he looks up at the clock
the second hand sweeps towards the
then back at the test
something suddenly clicks
he stares at the clock pencil poised waiting until the second hand hits the and hes off filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could possibly be reading
racer sits across the desk from speeds teacher
no thats not exactly right
your son seems to be interested in only one thing
mom knows whats coming
all he talks about all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing
well you know his father designs racing cars
and where is your husband
he couldnt make it
perhaps the apple hasnt fallen very far from the tree
mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the teacher glances back to her records
is your husbands name rex
no rex is his older brother
this is the test he turned in last week
she holds up the scantron test that speed was working on
the bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing pictures in the corner of the test
he is drawing little race cars
he flips a few of the pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two cars collide
he continues to draw as the background of the classroom fades to white behind him becoming the black corner that he is drawing on
we watch the race going on in his head as hand drawn cars battle each other heading for a photo finish
speed makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound as two cars try to block the mach smashing into one another as the mach jumps over and through the
fiery crash crossing the finish line still in the air
speed is lost in slow motion revelry making the sound of the roaring crowd
the teacher hears him and looks up frowning as she sees him lost in his fantasy world
a little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning to watch him a smile creeping across her face there is no one in the entire school like him
the teacher is about to say something when the bell rings
speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up in motion before anyone else
alright pencils down bring your thwack
speed slaps his down and is already heading for the door
to my desk
the door slams open and speed shoots out
speed racer slow down
speed slides down the railing on his butt a perpetual motion machine as he scans the street smiling as he sees across the street leaning against his hot rod his
big brother rex racer
he pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool cars pass by
here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature of the automobile in the world of speed racer
in this world the grocery store parking lot looks like a car collector show vintage and concept cars are as ubiquitous as the camry is in our world
speed dashes across the street a tight parabolic arc around the car his little head sticking up like a shark fin circling until the car door pops open and snaps
the seat belt clicks into place before rex even has a chance to move
he leans over and looks in the window
i take it youre ready to go
rex climbs in beside him
so who was school
are you going to the track
mom said you were
you dont have to drop me off i could just go with you
he starts the car and roadster growls to life
oh come on take me with you
come on please
i cant speed
pops would kill me
he doesnt have to know
i wont say anything
nobody will know
come on please rex pleaseplease pleasepleasepleeeease
rex sighs knowing theres no way he can with this
are you wearing the socks
lickety split speed sticks his sneaker up against the dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing a bright red sock
you roll us again and thisll be the last time
a ten year olds grin spreads ear to ear
a lone figure sits on a bench away from us his racing suit is unzipped to the waist and he sits with his head down as though he was praying
he is wearing a pair of bright red socks
after a moment he pulls his boots on zips up his suit and stands looking into the locker
propped against this gloves is a photo of rex
this is speed ten years later
he takes the photo and slides it into one of the zippered pockets of his suit
he grabs his gloves and slams the locker shut
the first gen t screams along the metal raceway
speed sits in rexs lap wearing a too big helmet giggling with a childs mad glee as he steers
banks up a wall and roars down swooping past
speed screeches as though riding a roller coaster
feel that shimmy
thats your hind legs trying to outrun youre front
what do i do
stop steering and start driving
speed gets serious his lips tightening the way a hand knots into a fist
this aint no dead piece a metal
a cars a living breathing thing
you can feel her talking to you telling you what she wants what she needs
you just gotta listen
speed tries to listen
close your eyes and listen
they say that ben burns drove the last lap of the vanderbilt cup with his eye closed
well maybe you cant hear it then
you ought to start hitting those books no
i hear it
burns you tell me when to gas it for the jump
the jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper to speed
rex smiles hitting the gas launching the car into the air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing down at us as we cut the modern t s
come flying overhead slamming down against the metal track scattering bright bursts of shooting sparks in their wake
a long stretch of identical glass cubicles that look down at the raceway where announcers from all over the globe provide color commentary for race fans
thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media row should reflect that while its big enough to be covered in several different languages it is not nearly as important
as the majors
local fan favorite speed racer is just gobbling up this track slipping car after car no one seems able to lay a glove on this kid clearly a rising star
with several big wins since turning pro though he remains without a major sponsor
a win tonight could put him within range of qualifying for the grand prix let us hope he does not make the same mistakes that his older brother made inside
the cockpit of a racing car that feels more like a fighter jet speed does the thing he was born to do
though the vibrations are enough to rattle molars loose there is a calmness a preternatural ease in speeds manner that suggests this maelstrom of velocity is where he belongs
he hears a voice in his headset
i got snake drafting
speed looks into his mirror and sees a car with orange and black markings stacked up tight behind another car
i got him
it is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars dont really pit
there is a panel like a sound mixing board filled with needled gauges and green barred light meters
sparky is watching through binoculars
i figure hell slingshot after you in the next turn
the cars explode into the next turn when snake uses the draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him hurling like a bullet straight at speed as speed thumbs
a button on his steering wheel causing jacks to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up into the air just as snake flies under it careening into the bottom of the turn too tightly bouncing of the rail out of control ricochetting back at speed as he turns his wheels catching a part of snakes car with the grace of a bull fighter sending it spinning away towards the other cars while speed rockets free eliciting a huge roar from the crowd
great move speed
careful on the butterfly coming up
you may wanna ease up not this time sparky
speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a slot guide in the track causing another crowd roar
they can feel that something special might be happening
sparky checks his stop watch
holy canoli speed you know who youre racing
he can see him
just ahead the ghost of his brothers car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the past
rex drives the older model t a man on a mission dominating the race exactly like speed
pops stands watching the race through binoculars young spped is beside him
rexs gonna win aint he pops
pops checks his watch but almost cant believe it
he goes back to his binoculars
hes gonna win it
hes gonna set the course record
nobodys gonna catch him
theres a lotta race to run
my brothers the best racer in the world
everybody else is running for second
the cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel
blackjack benelli grabs one of the crew chief knotting his fists in the fabric of the path covered cover alts
i told you to take him out
were trying sir
hes just too fast
rex blazes by the track rattling like a metal roller coaster opening an even bigger lead
as we move around rexs car we see suddenly there is someone right behind him a ghost car speed
as speed makes his move he pulls us back into the present
the buzz is palpable
its unbelievable folks no ones seen moves like this since that remarkable night eight years theres no doubt in my mind hes gunning for it driving like a man possessed
a man haunted by his past a record that has stood for eight years set by
his older he is not alone out there he is chasing someone he is chasing the ghost of rex racer in the glass of pops binos we can see the
dim reflection of the two brothers racing
pops stands beside mom
he is still watching the race with his trusty binos though he is now a little older plumper and balder
he clicks his stopwatch checking it at the same time that sprittle checks his
sprittle stands on the chair next to him
jeepers he could do it pops
he could really do it couldnt he
pops goes back to his binos
what if he does
what if he does it pops
i dont know if i can watch this
he holds the binos as though afraid to look when a hairy hand comes in and takes them away
chim chim sitting on the chair next to sprittle puts the binos to his eyes
speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing another cheer
sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young woman standing on the other side of pops lowers her
trixie chews at her lip feeling a knot twist into her gut
the little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with a pack of girls their little mouths as sharp as razors
in the distance we hear a high pitched motorized whine
my daddy told me he used to work for the mishida motorwerks but he quit
my daddy said that was a completely crazy thing to do
he says the whole family is crazy
speeds not crazy
no hes just dumb
probably the dumbest kid in class
waterstraat had me alphabetize the irb tests and you wouldnt believe what that retard did sock
trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack just as the whine grows very loud and speed comes rounding the bend on a little go cart
wearing his too big helmet making his big head seem ridiculously enormous
zipping past he suddenly notices the girl in the pink barrette standing over another girl there is something about her maybe its way shes got her fists up like a
boy or maybe its the
way her jaw is set ready to take on whatever it is when their eyes suddenly meet he finds he is unable to look away staring at her as he
drives off the road crashing through a hedge and tumbling down a hill
she runs to help him
he is laying sprawled out his car on its side wheels still spinning
are you alright
hes a bit groggy
who are you
im in your class
he stares at her for a minute powder puffs of clouds floating about her head
he would you like to see my car she smiles
id love to
pops and rex are working on the t
rex is in a wife beater up to his elbows in axel grease
the sound of an angry bee hive fills the room as speed drives up through the big open door
whos your friend
her names trixie
shes in my class
pleasure to meet you young lady
hey pops a guy wanted me to give this to you
he said he was a big fan
he hands him the package and pops smiles
a fan is it
not often we get someone with such good taste around here
where is he
he was in a hurry
driving a fendersin
the car description rings a bell for rex
let me see that
he grabs the box then holds it to his ear
he jams it into the go cart against the pedal and slaps it in reverse
cart shoots out of the garage and down the driveway until it explodes an enormous fireball ballooning up past the tree tops
trixies eyes flash with excitement
feeling the storm of emotions that she knows speed must be feeling she takes a deep breath and raises the binos back up
through the magnifying lenses we see speed flying around the track
they are riding the story like speed is driving the track
no one from these parts will forget the tragic story of rex he nearly ruined racing single handedly tried to save
one of the greatest scandals in the history of the sport it is always the brightest star that burn out the fastest speed blister through the high banked slalom and
it seems at first that he is all alone but then we see the trace effect as we realize that the two cars are making perfectly identical moves until they bank into a straightaway splitting apart like a shadow suddenly cut free as both cars accelerate neck and neck the past a mirror of the present
can i go with you re young speed watches as rex packs his bags
not this time speedy
when are you coming back
i dont know
i dont know
he snaps the bag shut
one day people might say things about me
no matter what they say i hop
i just hope you never believe them
he hugs his little brother knowing it might be for the last time
rex heads for the door but pops is waiting for him
so youre quitting
i have to
no you dont
this is a choice
youre selling out walking away from everything weve built here
im done arguing with you pops
he turns back towards the door
dont you walk away from me
you cant tell me what to do
its my life to live
he takes hold of the doorknob
if you walk out that door you better not ever come back
the door slams in response
speed and the ghost of his brother cross switching positions as the memories come faster and faster
speed sits on the floor glued to the television watching a big race that rex is in
mom and pops are the couch behind him
all of them sit in
a suspended state a fist of tension squeezing the breath out of them
one the screen is a cloud of smoke billowing from a tangle of metal
rex racer riving the black and red uniron car got in a tangle with richenhbach who had been favored to win that was no tangle he took richenbach out we
dont know that but i imagine the wrl will be reviewing this crash
thats the third dnf crash racers been involved in
heck the oughta just suspend him
turn it off speed
i dont want you watching this anymore
speed tightens his grip on the wheel
speed is hidden beneath the blankets the sound of a small portable television barely audible
rex racer almost took yokimas head off wit that jump
theres absolutely no doubt in my mind that rex racer is the dirtiest driver in the world
lit by the soft glow of the small tv speed blinks and the first tears slip silently down his cheeks
his jaw locks as he remains trapped between two different forces
young speed is clobbering a kid who is twice his size
a teacher finally pulls them apart
i just told him the truth
his crum bum brother doesnt belong on a racetrack he belongs in jail
speed tears free and torpedoes big mouth again
the two cars continue to dance around each other
the trial of rex racer shook the world racing league to tis very once a rat always a rat and in my book rex racers nuthin but a the indictment
brought down perennial racing powerhouse uniroyal was linked to the notorious fixer blackjack benelli still in prison to this day benelli was rumored to be behind the casa cristo tragedy the two cars swerve heading for a collision as we cut mom pops sparky trixie and speed are all watching the race on the television
something happens and mom drops her glass
it shatters but no one seems to notice
young speed is transfixed by the horror of what is playing out the images of fire and flashing lights reflecting in his eyes
this has to be one of the worst crashes i have ever seen terrible just terrible there is still no sign of the driver rex racer
speed presses down on the accelerator and starts to gain fighting the emotion welling behind his eyes
held by his mother speed sobs and sobs while pops stands helplessly at the door
speed again pulls even with rex as the finish line comes into view
hes cominhard its gonna be forget the past hes sayin this is my night theres a new racer in town poised to wipe the slate clean
escaping the dark shadow of his older brother the checkered flag goes up ready as the two cars come screaming towards the finish line the large digital clock seemingly synchronized
with the past as
speed looks over at the ghost car the faintest smile on his lips as he sees his older brother and then takes his foot off the accelerator letting rexs car
surge ahead crossing just before speed
the time is just over the record causing disappointment to ripple through the crowd except for the racer family who seem both relived and happy
come on lets go
they seem exhausted
what a race
by a cats whisker the record still stands looked like he pulled up to me folks i knew rex racer and if hes up there somewhere watching this race you
can bet your ass hes damn proud of his little brother
walls of glass overlooking a galaxy of
twinkling cityscape a penthouse created as a diamond is created every face a perfect stroke of precision
a beautiful woman wearing nerdy glasses sits watching the television from the leather banquette
she has a body made of the same kind of lines that a sports car or a high heel has lines that make your head turn
this is minx
beside her is a brooding muscled man his attention we dont riveted as speed pulls into victory lane
though see his face this is racer x
he going to be very good
hes going to be the best
the crowd swarms around speeds car
if they dont destroy him first
the phone is ringing
to the mom is
before she can get phone sprittle grabs it
good morning i was hoping to speak with speed racer
hes not interested
he hangs up
thats not for you to say
speeds gotta drive for pops
thats for speeed to decide
the phone rings again
sprittle grabs it quickly
is this the racer residence
he glances at mom
he hangs up
pops is doing his exercises in his gray sweats
speed now sleeps in rexs old room
the poster of burns is still tacked to the wall above the bed
mom opens the door
come on champ
rise and shine
to the speeds hair
seems to remain asleep still molded pillow as he tries to push himself up
im up im up
mom spatulas another short stack of pancakes from griddle and shovels them like coal into the blazing maw of a locomotive dumping them onto the plates of sprittle and chim
they eat ravenously trying to secretly steal food from each others plates while pops reads from the racing news
it was a virtuoso display of talent the likes of which has not been seen at thunderhead since racer the elder dropped jaws eight
now as we once again pull our collective jaws up from the floor we have to ask will it be different this time or will thats enough of that hon
pops puts down the paper and sparky picks it up
i just cant believe there wasnt one mention of racer motors in there
thats because the sponsors run the media sparky
trixie enters through the back door
is speed up yet
speed stumbles in the door
in spirit anyway
hey superstar did you see the papers
theyre all in love with you
he sits grabbing the paper
yeah but there sure is a lot of speculation about which teams going to pick him up
speed starts to read and suddenly the room begins to rumble glasses shaking plates rattling
he and chim chim begin wailing in panic
quick under the table
into the door frame
sprittle calm down
pops the kitchens the most dangerous room in a house during an earthquake
the whole table shivers and it seems the hanging ceiling light might shake free when the tremor begins to subside
sprittle and chim chim wearing a pot and a metal colander for protection look around expecting something bad to happen
the house becomes pin prick quiet when the doorbell rings
pops opens the door to a face full of turbine exhaust from the private k harrier jet parked on their front lawn
on their doorstep is an extremely well dressed older man carrying a bouquet of flowers and box of cigars
his smile is as bright and shiny as a surgeons scalpel
he says good morning mr
racer but no once can hear him over the howl of the turbines
he gestures asking permission to come in
pops lets him by and closes the door immediately reducing the noise
racer i hope you will forgive this imposition
he hands her the beautiful bouquet of flowers
these are blue belles from eden inc
im told the will bloom at least three times each time a different color
mom ohhhs her appreciation while he hands over the box of cigars
racer these are for you straight form the isle of kamut
they glance at each other a bit takenaback
uh thanks but
who are you
he seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces himself
i am e
arnold remmingtonton esquire president and chairman of remmington industries and it is my honor to meet you both
he reaches for pops free hand
racer i have been an ardent admirer of your work for years
i remember the first time i saw the prototype for the mach i told everyone that it didnt belong on a race track it belonged in an art museum
yeah she was a beaut
she was a revelation
he suddenly smells the pancakes
i interrupted your breakfast
is that pancakes i smell
are you hungry mr
a figure like mine requires constant attention mrs
do you like pancakes
when i was a child we used to say pankuken zin liesben
neither of them speak german
pancakes are love
remmington stuff another forkful into his mouth and moans his appreciation
sprittle and chim chim sit on either side of him their gunsel eyes train on his every move
hints of vanilla
im glad you like them
i want to buy your recipe
he takes out his hand held computer and beings making notes
i can give you the recipe mr
cenestro foods a sub division of remmington industries is planning a new range of home cooked meals for travelers and this is just the kind of magic were looking for
ill have my attorney draw up the paperwork
mom looks at pops feeling flattered but again a distinct discomfort
we all know the reason im here is because of you speed
i was watching last night and i have to tell you young man you gave me goosebumps
i know at once this was no mere driver i was watching
this was an artist
speeds ears go a bit red
drivers only as good as the car
i appreciate modesty speed but i do not exaggerate when is ay that you are a genius
watching you reminded me of why i love racing and i am grateful for that
youre welcome i guess
i imagine the phone has been ringing off the hook
speeds not interest in driving for you or any other sponsor
is this your manager then
hes our youngest
nice to meet you youngster
remmington offers his hand but sprittle doesnt take it
we got out eye on you mister
the first thing i want to make perfectly clear is that i have no intention whatsoever of trying to get speed away from racer motors
what you have here is what teams spend years and millions of dollars trying to achieve chemistry
car designer mechanic and driver all coming together in perfect harmony
i wouldnt dare touch a thing
well excuse me for asking but what do you want
i want to make sure you have access to whatever resources you need to continue doing exactly what you are doing
i assume mr
remmington that you are not talking about philanthropy
i like when my partners have a sense of humor
and thats what im talking about
an alliance between your amazing family and mine
thats exactly what remmington industries is to me a family
just a little bigger
pops isnt exactly buying it
no offense remmington but racer motors runs as an independent
i completely understand
strike that i sympathize
you may think of r
as a huge corporate conglomerate but i will have you know sire that i still remember working all night on a commodore in the basement of my foster parents home
i build r
from below the ground up
so while remmington industries may look like a major sponsor to you it remains in my heart as independent to me as the first day i quit my job at
globocom to work for myself
theyre re stunned into silence while remmington presses on
now ive had this wonderful opportunity to meet your family
all i am asking is for you to please give me the chance to introduce you to
the k harrier drifts through the polygonal mountain range where glittering minarets of steel and glass crown towering cathedrals of commerce
helicopters swarm like pollinating bees in summer field
the vista is filled with the icons of every conceivable business in very conceivable language
it is a landscape that merges the pop art sensibility of warhol with the urban sprawl of blade runner
wood paneled elegance surround the family who sit in overstuffed seats as soft and padded as clouds
they cant help but gawk out the windows as they float through the city
ive never flown so low through the city
only six of them are granted a year
sprittle and chim chim are gawking at something else the vertical pull out drawer lined with every kind candy in the world
take whatever you like
he looks at her for a moment like is in love then turns back to the drawer where he and chim chim lunge for it pushing each other back
she said we could
pop growls at him his eyes telling them theyd better not take more than one piece
hang dogged heads they each grab one piece of candy
what do you say
she closes the drawer their eyes seen through the racks watching paradise disappear as though a mirage
hey theres the grand prix coliseum
sprittle and chim chim rush to sparkys window
they can see the entire track and even from this height it seems enormous
sprittle turns to remmington
my brothers going to win the grand prix one day
remmingtons eyes glint
no doubt in my mind young man
given the right circumstances i have no doubt whatsoever
power gleams off every surface and line of the strata scape
the k harrier glides gracefully down to the private landing pad
an entourage of assistants wait like puppies at the door
among them is a gorgeous woman with the kind of smile that puts people immediately at ease
this is gennie
shes our talent manager
ask for anything her jobs to make it come true
welcome to remmington
he shakes her hand while she signals to another man who immediately begins scanning speed with an electronic measuring device
to make an informed decision youll need to understand how we take care of our drivers
the tailor finishes quickly as an electric cart the kind designed for a group tour pulls up
they climb on and the driver pulls into the tramway
these well lit hallways are extra wide with lots of colored guide lines on the floor like
in a hospital
there are a lot of signs directional and advertisements hawking the widely varied remmington products
the red lines lead to doors emblazoned with restricted access
there is a fair bit of hustle and bustle like a busy street as golf carts seg ways and motorized scooter zip to and fro
no one walks
remmington tower is the crown jewel among the properties that i control
it functions as the corporate headquarters for he top twelve divisions of our parent corp
one big industries family
the turn a corner heading for a large set of doors with the double r logo of remmington racecars
of all the companies that i control none of them is as dear to my heart as the t division
the door opens as they enter cars from the golden age through to the present surround the pathway dangling in midair or mounted in situ dioramas each carefully lit with
spotlights like works of art or precious gems
ive always felt that it is impossible to peer into the window of tomorrow without a clear view of the past
thats the crystal horse with the apache super charger
winner of the grand prix in and
was the vundervopper with the k twin turbine and was the kenobe motorstar re built with a vc triple chamber
remmington considers arguing
hes never wrong
they pass out of the museum
the hall widens allowing a special lane that leads out onto an observation deck that over looks the main t factory
the bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility
it is a state of the art assembly line that rises vertically instead of horizontally
the chassis arrives at the bottom and is born up by a mechanical arm rotating as each platform assembles the next piece
the far wall is nothing but glass providing a sun drappled vista of cosmopolis
our vertically integrated plant is the fastest in the world
from initial carbon bond to finished car in hours
how long does it take at racer motors
several weeks at least
remmington turns to pops
this kind of production facility could be at your disposal mr
the cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway
the next viewing stage is a window into the vacuumed sealed laboratory where they construct the engine that powers the t s turbine
it looks like an operating theatre with several robotic arms and a cluster of auto surgeons operating inside sealed perspec chambers
this is our operating theater where our patented refusion energy distributor network is installed in the turbine drive
sparkys eye light up
is that an inner positive transponder
it is indeed
sparky shoots a look at pops
we control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of mushi motors in taiobi
the window suddenly turns into a mirror
the cart arrives at an elevator station and the driver presses a signal control the doors opening immediately
the driver punches in a floor and door direction code north south east west and the elevator begins to rise while the dais in the floor begins to spin aligning
them with a different door
now ill take you up to the team remmington training facility
the west door opens and the cart glides out into a new tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first one decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly
up graded lights
the higher you go in the remmington tower the nicer the halls are decorated
the cart glides by a series of windows that reveal the rigorous training systems invented to test the drivers
the first is a multi level state of the art fitness facility in which the far wall again looks out into cosmopolis
beyond the standard health club fare there is a martial arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid
there is also a range of strange devices ranging from the retro steamer boxes medicine balls and vibrating belts to the hyper modern triple axis gyro harness
as you know a t drivers got to be in peak physical condition
across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver
she is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to her while several doctors not their approval at the read outs
no expense is spared to make sure that when our drivers suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling
the next window is a massive centrifuge a huge mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that blasts past the window
the best driver must be able to withstand over gs of force in a typical race
on the opposite wall is the vibration chamber
a man is strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you expect his eyeballs to rattle out
the next window is an underwater tank where a man is driving in a mock up cockpit executing peddle maneuvers and gear shifts
the will to win is nothing without the will to prepare and at team remmington we prepare our drivers for any eventuality and every possible condition
the final window is the weather chamber where a driver is again in a mock cockpit blue lipped and shivering while snow and wind buffet him
the doors open and the craft glides in
i hope i didnt care you speed with how hard we push our team
i just wanted you to see how serious we are committed to winning
i get that
but also understand that r
isnt all work and no play
the door opens revealing the drivers club
a swanky playboy style casino club where stylishly dressed male and female drivers are catered to by beautiful male and female hostesses
sprittles eyes almost pop out
thats cannonball taylor
speed urns and sees the captain of the remmington team
stop the cart
jack come here
theres someone i want you to meet
cannonball saunters over wearing his two goiter sized diamond encrusted champion rings
speed racer allow me to introduce two time grand prix winner five time wrl champion and future hall of famer jack cannonball taylor
honor to meet you
caught that thunderhead replay
nice piece of work
there was a rumor you might be visiting
its pretty impressive
only thing i cared about was that wall over there
he gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies and medals won by team remmington through the years
that what sold me
you want to win in this league youre talking to the right guy
jack nods and the cart pulls away but not before jack shoots a backward glance at speed that feels like a shank in a prison yard
the doors open and remmington leads the family into the penthouse suite leaving the cart behind
standard jaw dropping view decorated in an upscale masculine aesthetic
sparky whistles and whispers to speed
long way from nob hill eh
we treat our thoroughbreds the way they deserve to be treated
he guides them into the room gesturing or demonstrating all of the amenities
theres full maid service of course with a personal chef and a masseuse available
the staff arrives wheeling in several racks of clothes daywear sportswear racing uniforms and stylish evening wear
gennie holds up one of the suit to speed
should be perfect
try it on
he heads to the bathroom
taking mom by the elbow remmington gestures to the sitting area over looking cosmopolis
racer what do you think about my family
you could say that
i want you to understand the possibilities that exist for your son right now
pops furrows his brow
whats wrong mr
to be honest remmington im feeling more intimidated than impressed
this kind of company scares me
people like you have way too much money and when someone has this kind of money they start thinking that the rules everyone else is playing by dont mean squat
remmington remains skillfully unfazed
however my sons are the most important thing ive ever done in my life besides marrying my best friend and if speed wants us to figure out some kind of
alliance then you can bet your ass well be in business
speed steps out of the bathroom
his boyishness has faded away as he suddenly seems very much a man
gennie smile approvingly
he walks over to the sitting area
oh honey you looks so handsome
very sharp speed
suits you perfectly
regardless of what happens i want you to have all of it
so how are you feeling speed
speed isnt sure
he looks at trixie and sparky and then at his parents
you think that maybe theres something that could work out here
everyone waits staring at him
i guess id like to think about it if i
has really remmingtons a fisherman not sure if the hook been set
this isnt the kind of offer i go around making ever day son
i understand that sir
he looks to pops then takes a deep breath as though trying to find his resolve
so if i had to give an answer now then to be honest stop
you should think about it
im sure youre feeling a bit overwhelmed
you should take a little time
think about what you saw and heard here and well get together early next week
he reaches his hand out and speed takes it with some obvious relief
a thug soundly slaps the face ofa handsome japanese man
when the beating is over the japanese man slumps forward his arms behind his back
ithought we had a deal
when he hears the voice he lifts his head and we see a huge man with a body like a cement lined safe sitting behind a desk lighting a cigar
this well dressed fixer is cruncher block
i thought we were friends
he blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the chandelier which is jiggling steadily
maybe where you come from this is how you treat your friends but round here we dont take to kindly to this kind of thing do we fellas
thug steps in and wails away on him again
you hurt our feelings
problem is i like you katsu
cruncher grins his teeth like stacked dice
and i got a real soft spot in my heart for that sister of yours
he begins opening a large package wrapped with butcher paper
inside is a bloody rack of ribs
normally in a situation such as this we would be pouring you a nice comfy pair of cement shoes but
he stands and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is behind the desk
i think i got another solution
he dips the bloody meat into the tank filled with piranha
the water foams as the carnivorous fish shred flesh from bone
howre my babies doing
ready for seconds
they grab katsu and haul him to the fishtank
hope dem fishes like japanese
gonna be hard to drive with skellie hands
cruncher takes hold of katsus jaw
you even think about turning rat and next time its your sister going in there
they begin forcing his hand into the tank when suddenly red light begins flashing
cruncher grabs the phone on his desk
we realize that crunchers office is in the trailer of a semi truck which is cruising down an empty rural highway
someones tailing us
cruncher signals to the man at the far end of the room who is guarding the door
the guard slides open a peek a boo slot and sees a pair of headlights
is it him
it could be
cruncher goes to the phone
can you see him yet
here he comes the car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels his gut clench as he recognizes the infamous car of racer oh god
everyone leaps into action shoving katsu back into a chair
filling their fists with guns sliding open murder holes slots at a variety of heights
cruncher barks into the phone
the driver screws his jaw tight and throws the wheel to smash into the smaller car
but the little black tinted bug flits away with effortless ease dancing out in front of the truck
cruncher flips over the top of his desk revealing the controls for a mini machine gun located on the bottom of the truck
he grabs the controls which are linked to an infrared sighting camera
where is he
the driver watches the red tail lights glowing like demon eyes
hes out front
cruncher hits another button and he front grill of the truck opens dropping the lower half like the double hinged jaw of a snake
an apache helicopter style rocket launcher thrusts out of the darkness
cruncher sights the car
he fires a mini rocket straight at the manta finned car but with a quick feint left the rocket skims by exploding further down the highway
something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris open and the barrels of several weapons extend out
here he comes
cruncher fires again the red rocket just missing rending open the tree line with a fireball
the little car drops back alongside the truck and fires bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls of the truck
the truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly at the black car
cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he opens fire the black car slows drawing the chasing gun fire until cruncher shoots his own tires
aww i thought you fixed that
the black car fires again bullets ricocheting inside puncturing a hole in the fish tank
he runs to the fish tank and tries to stop the water pouring out of the hole
he sticks his finger in and the fish immediately attack
he shrieks withdrawing his finger
vinny put your finger in there
vinny doesnt want to
the truck swerves as the driver struggles to control the behemoth wobbling on its blown tires
we cant take another hit boss
cruncher thinks fast over vinnys screams
he looks at katsu and immediately knows what he has to do
pull over but dont stop
the truck slows easing onto the shoulder as the black car follows
the back of the truck slides up and the gangsters toss katsu out leaving him behind with a spray of gravel
katsu looks up into the glaring lights of the black car
a car door opens
boots crunch gravel as someone walks toward us silhouetted by car lights
it is the masked racer himself racer x
katsu is in the passenger seat as the car hums quietly down the empty highway
you saved my life
i didnt save anything worth saving unless you get smart
racer talks without looking at him
you thought you could take on the cartel
not without help
i dont know whatyoure talking about
you won the cortex invitational and you werent supposed to
you did it to save okamoto engineering
it has belonged to my family for five generations
and now someone else wants it
the only way you can stop it from happening is to talk to the authorities
there is nothing to talk about
you have been on cruncher blocks leash for
so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man
the only way youll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice
justice thats a commodity i dont waste money on
racer x immediately pulls his car over
wearing his smirk like a cheap suit katsu gets out
ill see you at fuji
you wont finish
when you lose if you can still dial a phone call this number
he hands him a card
the card reads chief inspector sprittle is working hard on a test when he hears the behind him whisper
hey monkey lover show me your test or ill kick your ass after school
cheaters never prosper
the kid to the left chimes in
spriiiitle when chim chims bad do you spank the monkey
no your mother does it for me
malcom almost swallows his tongue as several other kids snicker
to the principals office
there is a chorus of i didnt do it awwww not fair
the same school that speed attended but now where rex used to wait speed is leaning against the mach
chim chim is sitting next to him
the bell rings and the students begin piling out
when the last few tumble down the stairs chim chim emits a small sad whine
looks like someones in trouble again
its later and theyre driving home
sprittle stares out the window mumbling identifying make model and engines of passing cars
want to talk about it
sprittle shakes his head
k w integral door with twin cam turbine
c foster k modified split rail and supershocks
was it that stanton kid again
did he say something
if you want to kick his butt
he shakes his head again
it doesnt seem fair that i get in trouble when they always start it
its not fair
but thats what bullies do
they make the world unfair
yes it does
what can i do about it
you ignore em when you can fight em when you cant
those choices suck too
yeah but just try to keep one thing in mind
bullies come and go but a family can torture you forever
chim chim gives sprittle a wet willy
speed laughs as chim chim howls and then puts his arm around sprittle
but no joke you just say the word little brother and we got your back right chim chim
chim chim grunts
remmington watches a grx rolling off the assembly line
with him is mr
mushi a businessman with eyes as sharp as broken glass
the new grx has a super charged inner positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off kilometers an hour
if such a car were to win the grand prix this year one would expect the demand for transponders to increase dramatically
one would expect
and if a single company gained control of all the transponder foundries in the world one might expect that company to do very well for itself
you know what i want and i know that for the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival tetsua okamoto
the question is can we make a deal
the car rotates rising up on its mechanical arm a cybernetic giant exercising its might
deliver okamoto at that price and the taiobi transponder foundry is yours
remington smiles as they shake hands
speed and trixie lie with seats all the way back watching the sinking sun tye dye the sky behind the scape of freeways
youre really considering signing with remmington
i just said it was tempting
well they got a really good team
cannonball taylor markie manifold
they win a lot of majors
since when did winning become so important
it is important
you gotta win if you want to keep driving and thats what i want to do
its the only thing i really know how to do
when im driving i feel like thats the only time my life makes sense
she moves closer to him
you mean this doesnt make sense to you
okay besides being with you
so you like being with me
you know i do
sometimes i do sometimes im not so sure
sometimes around your family you seem distant not like this and i wonder why
come on you know how ive felt about you since i was ten years old
i guess so i just wish you werent so shy about it
what do you want me to do
kiss you in front of everyone at the end of a big race
would that be so terrible
i dont know
maybe we should practice first
maybe we should
they start to kiss when they hear a muted voice
im gonna hurl
speed jumps out of the car
he did not
he throws open the trunk revealing sprittle and chim chim who shrieks
it wasnt my idea
it was his
he points at chim chim who shakes his head wildly pointing back at sprittle
wait till we tell pops
dont do that
we couldnt sleep
we just wanted to hang out
we didnt know you were going to in spew ration point
by the way cootie shots
sprittle and chim chim immediately cover one shoulder giving themselves a cootie shot
im taking you home
wait wait wait speed slamsathe trunk shut so we hear sprittle voice muffled can we stop for ice cream first
close on a curving piece of bodywork that pops is sanding
when he looks up speed is in the room
he is carrying a brown paper sack
so todays the big day
pops puts down his tools
i know this is a tremendous opportunity for you
it could be for you too
could be could be
but regardless this is really all about you
it your decision and i want you to know no matter what you decide im behind you
the room begins to shake
i think your rides here
speed stares out the window chewing on his decision a dog worrying a bone
gennie greets speed as he debarks from the plane
he carrying his brown sack
speed so nice to see you again
her eyes and the softness of her touch elevate flirting to something that is equal parts art and science
remmington is so excited about this meeting
he hasnt talked about anything else all week
the cabin is dark and still
slowly almost supernaturally a drawer begins to slide open
two heads pop up
sprittle and chim chim are wearing cat burglar clothes with matching ski masks
the coast is clear so they sneak over to the galley
they stare at the drawer like a safe cracker eyeing the dial of a combination lock
sprittle carefully pulls back the latch springing the drawer
it slides open lit internally candy gleaming like jewels
the breath rushes out of them
the office sits atop the strata scraper surrounded by commanding views of cosmopolis
speed arrives via the elevator and remmington breaks into a beaming
gennie leaves speed returning to the elevator as remmington crosses to him
he hugs him welcome back
in the center of the room is a small cluster of extremely comfortable chairs in which they sit
above them a multifaceted skylight glitters like a cut gem under the streaming rays of sunlight
in the center of the sky light is the r
logo casting a great shadow on the floor
can i get you something to drink
a shot of rye
speed smiles sheepishly
so i can see you have given some serious thought to this thing
i have yes sir
that means that you understand that we are talking about not just your future but your familys future
my family means a lot to me
i can tell
thats why this is so important
because you can help them
all you have to say is yes
that is all i need to hear and i can make so many things happen for you and your family
are you ready for that
are you ready to say yes speed
candy wrappers are scattered everywhere as they lay motionless in an overdose coma
when they hear someone coming sprittle manages to lift his head and crawl to the window
a cleaning man is rising up on a cherry picker with a cart full of cleaning supplies
he looks back at their mess
a moment later the door opens and the cleaning man enters
holy cooly he grabs for his radio
hey this is marvin down at the landing pad
i think we got mice again
as he talks two shadows slip quietly out the door behind him
speed realizes that this is the threshold
this isnt an easy decision for me mr
for my family racing is everything
we eat drink think and breathe racing
there is nothing more perfect than a picnic at thunderhead
i mean i was taught to drive before i could walk
but when my brother died all that went away
i cant tell you how painful that was
it nearly killed all of us
he didnt set foot in his shop for over a year
as the memory comes to life we see the images in flashback
but one night when i was still pretty young
i couldnt sleep and i went into the living room and there was pops in his beat up robe watching some old race recordings
the blue tv light of speeds memory fills his eyes
so i sat with him watching of ben burns coming round the last turn of he prix and all of a sudden pops started screaming and then i started screaming
and as burns and dugazi duked it out heading for the finish we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth racing is in our blood
but for pops it isnt just a sport
its way more important than that
its like a religion and in our house the major sponsors are kinda like the devil
the coldness in remmingtons eyes belies his smile
i dont mean to offend you sir and i do appreciate your offer its just i guess i understand his point of view and after all weve been through i
dont think this kind of deal is for me
you poor naive chump
he chuckles again
im going to pretend i didnt hear that load of sickening schmaltz and i am going to give you a bit of an education
at the end of it if youre smart youll thank me and hen youll sign that contract
sprittle and chim chim are joy riding in the maintenance cart weaving back an forth wiping people out
chim chim screams with glee
they stand before an enlarged black and white photograph of five tycoons smoking cigars dressed in turn of the century tycoon finery their well fed faces bright with fatuous self
there is the true spirit of the golden age of racing
benjamin braddack diamond dave tweksbury reginald white oliver potter and george wheeler
the five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century
as he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and photographs of the golden era
for all intensive purposes they created the modern automotive industry
but the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the wrl the worlds first racing league
remmington leads speed past several personal mementos including the first motor of his first car the first milk bottle from victory lane
a black and white from an important race
in front of an enlarged picture of ben burns from the infamous prix is a twisted and scorched piece of metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of
interesting that you and your father were so moved by the prix
one of the great finishes in the history of racing right
everyone remembers burns and dugazi slugging it out but who remembers carl potts
driving a rebuilt wittigan for iodyne
industries potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a dnf
a forgettable and pathetic finish
so bad that afterwards iodyne stock dropped six points
again we see the history told in flashback
meanwhile ben burns sat guzzling cold fresh milk in victory lane a thousand cameras taking his picture sirrus aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately block penninsula power
cell from being able to afford the price of a complete take over
this put joel goldman the ceo of iodyne inc
in the exact position he wanted to be in
by first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price he then brokered a merger with sirrus that immediately sent iodyne into the gains record book the
only record book that matters
look out that window there isnt a single plane or helicopter or k harrier that isnt powered by iodyne fuel cells
thats what racing is about
it has nothing to do with cars or drivers
all that matters is power and the unassailable might of money
his greed is as tangible as any drug
a security guard glides out of one of the red secured area doors on a segway
his radio buzzes perps last seen tramway four driving a maintenance cart
the doors start to close when sprittle and chim chim jump out and sneak inside
speed doesnt want to hear any more of this but remmington is far from done
do you understand
burns knew he was going to win
it was already decided
a week before the prix goldman and sirrus met with several other major players at the carlyle hotel
they met there as they had for years just as their fathers had met and as their sons and heirs will still meet
they met to negotiate the finish order of the grand prix
no race is more important and no race is more controlled
that year goldman was supposed to win but he knew if he sold his win to sirrus whatever that win might be worth was nothing compared to what could be
he turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal
thats why i paid three million dollars for this burnt and twisted piece of metal
because it reminds me of what really matters
this is the true heart of racing boy
this is my religion
speed is aghast
you dont know how many times i have seen that same cow eyed say it isnt so look of disbelief
every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now
i wont bother proving it to you
if you walk away from me if you walk out of
this deal youll know how true it is soon enough
so last chance
whats it going to be speed
your fathers little fantasy bubble
or are you going to join the rest of us adults here in reality
several technician carts and trollies carrying auto parts pass by a single lab technician who staggers drunkenly up to a red restricted area window
sprittle peaks out of the lower half of the lab coat chim chim wearing the helmet balances on his shoulder
in the window they see a lab where they are testing a spear hook a secret attacking device that shoots out from one car and grabs hold of the undercarriage
of another car
as they realize what they are looking at a security goon comes gliding up behind them on his seg way
speed hands him the brown paper bag
he looks and sees the shoes and suit
if thats your idea of racing you can keep it
listen to me and listen good kid because im going to give you one more history lesson
youre going to go to fuji in quick collage cuts we see
a gorgeous blimp shot of the race track which takes up an entire island of hawaii like archipelago
the track weaves in and out of the lush tropical landscape set against the ocean shimmering with sequins of sunlight
speed grips the steering wheel revving the engine which rattles the car like thunder shaking the sky as the countdown finishes and as the cars explode forward we cut back
but you wont win
you wont place
more collage cuts speed racers making his move gunning for the lead the ghost sees speed rushing up behind him
we got ourselves a real race here
the two cars start dancing around each other like two boxers sizing each other up
here we go here we go
ghost throws the first punch which speed tries to slip but the ghost anticipates his move and slams speed hard
show me something
show me what you got
speed ducks down the bank working each wheel into a hyper drift reversing their position locking the ghost up and sending both cars spinning
the gray ghost unloads a round house speed counters smashing banging bumping weaving back and fourth behind speed the gray ghost attacks with phantom punches that come out of nowhere
here i come kid
here i am
nope im over here
speed tries to counter punch and the ghost slips under
speed is thrown back into the pack of cars that quickly swallow him up where he is crunched into the wall by the zokeo communications car pinned until racer x
slams into the zokeo car freeing speed but causing several cars tp swerve wildly at which point the three roses car torpedoes katsus car bursting into a blizzard of metal snowflakes while
horuko jumps up terrified for her brother as racer x roars past the debris and the bouncing rubber cocoons
cruncher accepts the congratulations of the goon beside him
i guarantee you right now you wont even finish the race
another molar cracking hit as speed avoids the concrete pylon but is then slammed by the zokeo car underneath both cars a spear hook shoots out from a hidden sleeve
harpooning the under carriage of the mach speed get out of there
i cant move
the two cars head toward the final jump locked in some strange embrace they lunge awkwardly crashing on top of one another as inside speeds car his face plate seals
and the kwiksave foam explodes swallowing him as the car tumbles disintegrating into a cloud of smoke and glittering debris
the racer family is frozen
their faces awash with fear and disappointment while remmington eases back a fatuous self satisfied smile spreading with a crocodiles grace
soon after that there will be litigation against some of your fathers designs
it is pouring rain as a large cab pulls up to drop off the entire racer family still wearing their island clothes
a dour faced man beneath an umbrella is waiting for them
are you pops racer of racer motors yeah but im still on vacation you are hereby served a summons
you are being sued for ip infringement by janus automakers
thats for a jury to decide
the legitimacy of the lawsuits wont matter
they will be enough to discredit his company
whatever contracts he has hell lose
within a year he will be filing for bankruptcy
after that you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history
the threat hangs in the air like a loaded gun between them
pops was right
you are the devil
the elevator suddenly opens with the security goon carrying sprittle and chim chim by the scruff of their necks
remmington i caught these two snooping in a restricted area
get this racer trash out of my building
ill see you at fuji
speed turns and heads for the elevator
yes and then youll realize that you just made the biggest mistake of your life
close up on the racing news that sparky is reading from
the main headline another dirty racer
controversy surrounds racer motors now embroiled in ip litigation and while evidence remains inconclusive whether or not speed used an illegal device the fuji helexicon seems destined to become another
mark of shame added to the notorious racer family legacy a legacy that has forever tainted the integrity of this beloved sport
im going to send that guy some chim chim cookies
chim chim guffaws
youll do no such thing
we gotta do something pops
speed steps into the doorway
this is exactly what he said would happen if i didnt drive for him
you mean remmington
he said itd get worse and worse and by the end of the year youd be filing for bankruptcy pops
okay hes definitely gettin some monkey cookies
he was just trying to scare you son
they tried the same thing with rex
if its a fight they want its a fight theyll get
what can we do
how can we fight this
he tosses the newspaper
the truth will come out
dont be naive pops
the ben burns poster is ripped from the wall
speed wads its up and throws it into the garbage
he sinks down to his bed a sense of powerlessness crushing the life out of him
mom taps and then cracks the door
are you okay
i dont know
she comes in and sits beside him putting her arm around him
itll be okay
well get through it
i dont know mom
i might have really messed things up
by not joining remmington
dont be silly
youd have never been happy driving for that terrible man
but maybe racing isnt about being happy
maybe remmingtons right and its all about business and anyone who doesnt understand that is just a chump
now you listen to me young man
what you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business
before you could even talk you were making noises that sounded like a car engine
we used to tell people you were speaking car ese
we used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car
i loved that old wagon
and do you remember the time rex took you out to thunderhead and let you drive speed smiles
and i turned it over
my heart still pounds just thinking about it
rex told me the only reason we survived was because i was wearing red socks
i thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile
ten year old speed comes in the door leading rex wearing a small bandage on his forehead smiling a big black gap where his two front teeth should be
i dont think i ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash
speed when i watch you do some of the things you do i feel like im watching someone paint or play music
when i go to the races i go to watch you make art and its beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be even though there are times when
i have to close my eyes
but then there are other times when you just take my breath away and its at those moments when i feel your fathers chest swell and i know hes smiling
trying to pretend he doesnt have tears in his eyes i just go to pieces
because i am so impossibly proud to be your mother
and even though your father doesnt say it he is too
she puts her arms around him
well figure this out
we just have to stick together
something good will happen
the front doorbell chimes
sprittle opens the door revealing inspector detector of the corporate investigation bureau who looks older and harder than when we saw him in the flashbacks behind him is racer x
sprittle sees the masked racer and screams
chim chim screams
they look at each other screaming and then slam the door
they begin running around flailing like chicken little waving their arms in panic
popsstorms into the room
what are you two squawking about
they dive behind the couch but peek out as pops heads for the door
pops whatever you do dont open the door
racer x doesnt like it
this is a bad idea
if it was any other driver youd be here
popsopens the door and racer x sets his jaw
good morning mr
i know its been a long time
he extends his hand and pop shakes it
im sorry for this intrusion but i was hoping to have a word with you and speed
pops eyes the masked racer
mom serves coffee and cookies
weve been after remmington for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including wrl fixing but we havent had the evidence we need to convict him
sprittle and chim chim peek up from behind the couch as mom offers the masked racer a cup of coffee
here you are mr
sprittle points at racer x
whats he doing here
racer x works closely with our wrl corporate crimes division helping us recruit drivers like you speed
most of the media which you are now seeing is controlled by the major sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to the sport
the truth is hes our most valuable weapon against these villains
why does he always wear that mask
if any of you actually knew his identity you would become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious fixers in the world
they both sink back down behind the couch
what do you want with me
youre familiar with the driver katsu okamoto
for years he has been contracted by a fixer named cruncher block who we know works for remmington
recently katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop in the stock price of okamoto engineering
we believe this is a part of a corporate strategy to allow mushi motors to buy control of okamoto
katsu doesnt want this to happen and he began resisting thinking
that he could do it on his own
after fuji he realized he needed help
why help him
because he has a file with enough information to connect block to remmington which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives
the problem is he wont give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his familys company
there is an up coming race that katsu believes if he can win it will catapult okamoto engineering back into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out
which should kill it
but there arent any more races left except for the grand prix and we both failed to qualify
inspector takes a big breath
there arent any track races
this is a cross country rally
you mean the crucible
i know it seems cruel of me to ask but katsu made it clear that he had to have speed an x on his team or there would be no
absolutely out of the question
youll have the support of the entire c
rally racing is a back alley sport full of jackals head hunters and thugs
im sorry inspector but i lost one son to that death trap
i wont lose another
if you change your he starts to take out his card
keep your card chief inspector
speed looks at pops then realizes that racer x is staring straight at him
it is raining the cockpit bubble smeared with the distant traffic lights
and the way he was looking at me i dont know
i just gotta do something
but pops will never let you go
he wont if i ask him
speed racer what are you thinking
you werent in remmingtons office trix
you dont know what it was like
it felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me
i hate him
im picturing his heart clogging with cholesterol right now
no joke trix
if you could have been in that room youd want to do anything you could to take this guy down
she looks straight into his eyes and he doesnt have to say anything else
lets do it
youre going to need an alibi
well say were going skiing
youre going to need my help
casa cristo is a rally
i can spot from a copter
trixie this isnt a game
these people play rough
thats why im coming with you
and if you even try to argue with me ill tell pops right now and he wont let you out of his sight
you would wouldnt you
he looks into her eyes and knows the answer
i guess were going skiing
remmington sits surrounded by the legal equivalent of knights bishops and rooks while mr
mushi sits across from him supported by his own retinue
behind them cannonball taylor blasts through the test course fast enough to coax a low rumble from the sound barrier
as im sure youre aware the okamoto stock fell another four points yesterday
in the next few days it will hit bottom and they will have to sell
the car roars through its elliptical path like a circling electron binding the two tycoons together
this could be a most profitable year for remmington
remmington cant hide the glow
mushi wont do too badly either
cannonball circles everything in apparent harmony until gennie leans in and whispers
i know this is terrible timing sir but ive just received confirmation of several last minute entries to the casa cristo
youre not going to like it
the two announcers beam into the camera
were just minutes away from the start of the nd annual casa cristo classic the grand dame of cross country the second oldest rally race in the world spanning two
continents three climate changes and five thousand kilometers of the most winding and treacherous roads ever raced
heturns to his colleague
with me again is five time casa cristo champion johnny goodboy jones
always great to be here
such a beautiful city
one of the most romantic cities in the world
a bell man carefully unloads a cart
on top of the stack of suitcases is a gold fish bowl with a single ugly piranha
cruncher stands at the window balcony looking out over the white washed city
is there anything else i can do for you sir
i wanna send someone a present
safety has been the primary concern for casa cristo officials especially the last few years
thats right bob
there were a number of fatalities several years ago
it really had a bad reputation for a while
fans started calling it the crucible
most of the t drivers wouldnt come near it
but you look today weve got some major names like millie the mouse manno snake oiler and katsu okamoto as well as the young rising star speed racer
not to mention the shadow that seems to hang over every major race these days the masked racer that some fans call the harbinger of boom
whats your take on racer x
obviously he is an extremely talented and disciplined driver
but is he a head hunter
i think he drives like heis not always interested in winning
but remember colton these are standard road cars not t s
i know a lot of t drivers who i raced against who expected to win but found out racing a few laps on a track is a totally different animal
than a cross country rally
the marathon as opposed to the sprint
this isnt just about going fast
its about endurance
more than anything winning casa cristo is a test of will
speed grips his steering wheel like it was the handle of a weapon
inspector extends his hand which speed grips tightly
speed i want you to understand how much the c
appreciates your help on this
im not doing this to help c
i dont know anything about corporate crimes and honestly if i did it wouldnt really matter
im doing this because someone is trying to hurt my family and im going to do everything i can to hurt him back
the masked racer is unable to mask his smile
t drivers have always come to casa cristo is because the winner is automatically offered an invitation to the grand prix next week
a hold over from the days when rally racing was far more popular then track racing
gosh how things have changed
the leather of his gloves creak as he wrings his steering wheel
the doorbell rings and katsu goes to it
a hotel bellman surrounded by katsus bodyguards is smiling
he says its for horuko from an admirer
katsu looks at the ribboned box as the guard runs his metal detector over it
you see how we have to live
he ignores her turning away as she starts to open it
inside the goldfish bowl the piranha shreds a piece of meat that could be a finger staining the water red
to compete in this race you really have to have a killer instinct
any sign of weakness or timidness is like blood in the water and youll see how fast this race turns into a feeding frenzy
racer x calmly checks his cars vitals as he revs his engine
racer x leads speed and inspector detector through the lab to where minx is working
were going to need some insurance for this race
minx clicks away at a keyboard while a digital mach rotates on a screen
minx builds my cars
nice to meet ya
she purrs in response
racer x nods and she uses the computer to illustrate her modifications
their cars will probably be equipped with secret weapons so we have modified your car to try to counter their attacks
the a button will operate your normal jump jacks
the mach flips over on the screen highlighting the newly installed jump jacks
b will seal your cockpit which weve fortified with a bulletproof polymer
gun bots fire digital bullets at the mach which ricochet off the blueprint glass
c will inflate an emergency hexadyno spare after any blowout
avatar vandals slash the mach s tires which explode then re inflate
d will activate these zircon tipped saw blades that will cut through anything that tries to attach itself to you
the mach opens like a swiss army knife
e will project the tire crampons
the image zooms in on the newly equipped cat claw tires
and f will launch a remote control homing bird that is capable of transmitting qtvr footage anywhere you are
a final click demonstrates the capabilities of the mach s homing bird
every race fan has heard the rumors of spearhooks tire shanks and battery boosters
the league has done a tremendous job to clean rally racing up
while its true there have been a few bad apples on thewhole most teams stay within league rules
he winks into the camera
or at least try not to get caught
we glide through the lines of race cars with x ray vision cam revealing hidden weapons spring loaded ben hur tire shredders all manner of grabbers and grapplers as well
as bladders filled with oil or grease
sprittle and chim chim are settling in on the couch a big bag of potato chips and ice filled glasses of coke
the casa cristo is about to begin
faster than a blink sprittle grabs the remote and changes the channel to unser charly a german sitcom starring a monkey
what are you doing
just watching a little tv pops
pops looks at the tv suspiciously then back at his son
its his favorite show
its in german
not the monkey parts
chim chim smiles
oh no you dont
you are not watching that race
out you go
get some exercise
youre too pale
the moment the queen of casa cristo sees the sun shell signal the start of the race
the horizon glows brighter whispy clouds slowly soaking up the blood orange light
they speak in japanese
this is wrong
what you are trying to do
i have no choice
their price is an insult to four generations of our family
and if you die
will then the price be high enough
the queen sees the sun about to break
speed revs his engine a bomb ready to blow
a large memorial commemorates all the drivers who died during this race in memory of those who gave everything for their love of this sport
trixie stands beside speed both of them staring at the name carved into the bronze plaque rex racer
i understand it now trix
i know why he left us
she looks at him
he was trying to change this rotten business and they killed him for it
the queen raises a starters pistol
snake oiler and his two hydrocell team mates meet with cruncher and his gang including vinny three fingers his hand still bandaged
this is supposed to be my race
im supposed to win
i got the green light
promised id get to go to the grand prix
for eight years ive played by the rules
this is supposed to be my race
i cant stand the whining
like a baby needing its diaper changed
snake works his jaw looking for the right comeback
we have a team of wild cards
the problem is these wild cards are better drivers than you
like hell they are
take out katsu
the other two will quit
you just watch me
he and his boys storm out slamming the door behind them
the sun cracks the horizon and the queen fires the gun
all at once tires explode into a wail of rubber burning agony smoke billowing from the sound of their screams
the cars shoot down through the corridor of the small streets like shotgun pellets through a barrel
the cars roar through the streets to the cheers of the locals while above team helicopters circle with the industriousness of bees
trixie speaks into her headset
katsu hydrocells coming up ona your left
the hydrocell cars jostle their way towards katsu speed and racer x
i got him
racer x and speed are escorted by okamoto security into the room
speed notices horuko standing on the balcony and is struck by her beauty
it is such an extraordinary honor to have such talent on my team
lets skip the niceties and cut to the chase
katsuarches an eyebrow
the only reason were here is because you needed two outsiders and because the chief inspector believes youll turn over your
file on remmington and block
racer x eyes him
i dont believe it
i dont trust anyone who needs this kind of deal before theyll bring a criminal to justice
the accusation hangs in the air
but im willing to take a chance that youll prove me wrong
you wont regret your decision
until then you have my word that i will do everything
i can to make sure you checker at bartimaeus
racer x smashes into one of the hydrocell team him into a series of billboards
katsu again smiles
they stand around a gps map of the race
if theyre so desperate why not just use some kind of sniper
theres a million places someone could hide if they were really trying to kill you
any obvious crime would allow the chief inspector to shut the race down
that kind of scrutiny would only hurt the business
theyll do as much as they can to make it appear legit
the real problem well have is after the first leg
corteges is going to be extremely dangerous
take my advice keep your family away from cortega
speed again looks out at moruko on the balcony
katsu roars out of the city onto the desert road
theyre out of the city and heading into the zunubian desert
the chain of cars weave along the ribbon of concrete while the desert dunes raise up around them
a red bearded driver named billy steel belted his team covered in the manecks logo begins sliding up next to speed
a cobra peeks his head out of a basket charmed by a gorgeous woman playing her flute
in the audience cruncher moves up behind billy
he hands him a small black velvet bag
billy pours out a fistful of star dust the glint of diamonds glitter in the greed of his smile
billy smiles revealing his diamond studded teeth then swerves at speed
trixie sees the attack coming
speed does just as billys car plows through passing under him
hes not alone
the manecks team attacks their cars flying at katsu even as a second team the atomic injectables led by tyrus tropp also attacks
this surprises me
tyrus is a good man
i wouldnt expect him to turn head hunter
they arent pulling any punches
cruncher sits shadows drawn around him like the folded wings of a bat across from a stoic looking tyrus
cruncher slides an envelope across the table
tyrus looks at the goons surrounding him then picks it up
inside are the photographs of a beautiful girl playing in a park
the hard edge in tyrus expression immediately softens turning to fear
cruncher smiles like a snake that has just found an egg
things have started heating up as the cars head out across the desert flats
the swerving weaving chain of cars churns up a massive cloud of dust in their wake
attacking cars are caught and spun out by racer x and speed
a hurricane of sand and dirt swirl around katsu who sits calmly in the eye of the storm while his guardian angels go into overdrive
racer x and speed seem like they have been driving together all their lives
lead him here ya go
speed leads an attack straight into racer xs counter
he jumps one car and blocks the attack on x
as their cars merge in
and out from one another something seems perfectly clear to speed he is back at thunderhead with the ghost of his brother dancing around each other until speed
billy slams up against him throwing a lever a grappler locks on to the mach
hes got me
im locked up
another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved blade begins stabbing at speeds tires
racer x watches unable to leave katsu unprotected
speed hits the d button and the zircon saw blades start gliding through the grappler
get out of there
the knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the grappler is cut speed flips away free hitting the c button causing a new tire to inflate while hes upside
down landing on a new tire without missing a beat
tyrus rushes into the opening but this time its katsue who works a hidden lever and a katana like blade flashes a samurai slash across the front tire bowing it
out flipping the entire car which tumbles back straight at speed forcing him to try a split jack firing only the rear jump jacks launching the back end of the car while
the front end of the mach clips against the atomic injectibles car sending speed flipping end over end but landing with strangely beautiful grace
oh my god
did i just see that
a rear single set jump into a forward flip
i know he blew up at fugi but this kid is flat out magic
sprittle and chim chim are laying in lounge chairs wearing bathing suits and tanning goggles holding tanning mirrors under their chins
pops walks up
ive got to go into town for some parts
ill be back for lunch
sure thing pops
pops looks at them shakes his head and walks off
sprittle slowly lowers his tanning goggles to watch go
they drop their mirrors and bolt for the house
theyre back with chips and cokes clicking on the tv as the cars storm across the desert
they start crunching away oblivious to the sound of the front door opening
honey i cant find my wallet pops enters the room expecting to find mom but catches them red handed
he sees the race on tv
you two are in wait
pops before you get mad at us look
sprittle points at the tv eyes wide
im not falling for that its speed
then whos driving the mach
pops turns and indeed theres the mach barrelling across the red baked earth of zunubia
were nearing the end of the first leg of the casa cristo as snake oiler lead driver for the hydrocell team roars through the streets of cortega heading for the
the hydrocell team rear through the cobblestone streets of the medieval city crossing the finish line to a cheering crowd
the hydrocell team jumped on the lead early and would not give it up
they made excellent time
okamoto is still a couple of minutes behind them
they have their work cut out for them tomorrow
a medieval estate renovated into a hotel
katsu smashes a buffet laid out for the okamoto team
if we drive tomorrow like we drove today we will lose
he points at the masked racer
you will get nothing
all of this will be meaningless
snakes weak on turns
well catch him in the mountains
we might if you stop showing off
hey all i was doing was saving your ass
katsu raises a fist but racer x catches it
dont fall apart yet
theres still a lot of race to run
katsu jerks free of racer x and storms towards the door immediately enveloped by his security team
speed looks at racer x as though he can suddenly see through the mask
man will be posted outside your door
we got their attention today
you and trixie should be very careful tonight
speed nods as racer x heads for the door
racer x he stops
i thought we made a good team today
it felt like wed been doing it for a long time
if you say so
he turns away leaving speed alone
remmington wrings the phone as if it were a neck
is this what i pay you for
they aint checkered yet
they do i assure you it will be a very costly mistake for everyone
he hangs up
remmington you have mr
mushi on line two
remmington was dreading this call
he hits the button
mushi so is this what guarantee means to you mr
perhaps your dictionary has a different definition
i understand there is a problem but i assure you there is no need to panic
i am not calling to panic
i am calling to inform you that we will be addressing the problem ourselves as your assurances and guarantees leaves much to be desired
he hangs up leaving remmington to stew in his juice
speed and trixie are eating a room service dinner
it was very weird trix
i knew every move he was going to make and he knew mine
it was so familiar
maybe im crazy but racer x first showed up two years after rexs death
but speed rex was cremated
a body was cremated
remember it had already been badly burned in the crash
even if it was rex no one could have recognized him
so you think he faked the crash with a different body in the drivers seat
somehow the kwik save was disconnected
inspector detector suspected foul play but nothing could be proved
okay lets say its all true
why would we do it
i dont know
maybe the same reason im here
speed goes to the door
im sorry to disturb you sir but do you know these people
speedsticks his head out and there they are his family pops in front like a kettle ready to boil
pops rages while sprittle and chim chim pick through their dinner
is this the kind of driver i have
someone who disobeys
someone who lies to me
is this the kind of son i have raised
and you trixie you know what this race did to this family
did either of you stop to think about us
speed did you think about your mother
or your brother
what it would do if something happened to you
thats all ive been thinking about pops
you mom sprittle sparky
chim chim shouts
yeah you too chim chim
we are in serious trouble pops and its all my fault
this is not the place or the race to do anything about that
because it wont do any good
you dont know that
you think you can drive a car and change the world
it doesnt work like that
but its the only thing i know how to do and i gotta do something
this is over
pack your things
were going home
speed has never directly disobeyed his father
im sorry pops
so am no youre not
youre coming home right now
im not a child pops
you cant tell me how to live my life
if you want to fire me as your driver then fine do it
but it wont change the fact that i am going to
finish this race
pops looks ready to have an aneurism
god you sound like rex
do you want to die like him too
will that make you happy
dont take it out on me because you feel guilty for what happened to rex
okay you two
pops if theyre staying then were staying
all right room service
i suggest we try to do everything we can to make sure we go home together
toe with pops fumes working his jaw standing toe to speed
wheres the mach
logged with security
you added something to it
some defensive modifications
the whole things out of balance isnt it
it pulls left rides a little stiff
pops and sparky leave to do their work
speed feels terrible
he looks at his mom
im sorry mom
your father loves you speed
hes just afraid that i know
its gonna be okay
you wouldnt lie to your mother would you
she hugs him
it is later
he feels a a burly c
man stands guarding a door when bee sting on his neck
to the the darts poison acts quickly dropping the agent floor as a ninja emerges from the shadows
katsu sleeps soundly
above him in the shadows of the vaulted ceiling there is a flash as a piece of metal glints against the moonlight
another ninja crawls like a spider down to an
the sheer curtains undulate in the open window of speeds room as a masked face lowers into view
the men of the racer family lay scattered about the room in cots and on the couches
mom and trixie are in the connecting room
a liquid travels down a
wire that hangs poised about katsus lips
a ninja enters racer xs bedroom and sees him asleep in his bed
the ninja creeps past the sleeping men to speeds bed
the oil drips onto katsus lips
a blowgun is raised
standing over speed the ninja withdraws a syringe from his hidden chest pocket
katsu licks his lips as
the blowgun is fired burying itself into the mound of pillows
racer x his face shrouded in shadows emerges from the darkness where all marked men sleep behind the couch
the ninja realizes hes been tricked and spins just as racer x attacks
the syringe moves towards speeds neck when sprittle rolls over knocking chim chim with his arm waking him up
and as soon as he sees the ninja he screams
the ninja attacks stabbing at speed who just barely catches the needle
the ninja tries to wing chun the hypodermic free but speed is too quick and he forces the needle into the headboard as sparky jumps onto the ninjas back
i got him
i got hiiiyow the ninja throws sparky across the room and tries to bolt but speed is up and throwing a quick combo
the ninja stumbles but a manages a spin kick that knocks speed back as pops grabs the ninja from behind
you attack my family
you try to hurt my son
pops twists the squirming ninja through a series of wrestling moves finishing the ninja in a spinning over head helicopter
launching him out the window
trixie and mom burst in from the adjoining room
oh my god
was that a ninja
pops cracks his knuckles
more like a non ja
terrible what passes for a ninja these days
s still she looks out the window and smiles this family got it
there is a hurried knock at the door
ill get it
it is horuko surrounded by security
oh i am sorry
i was looking for speed racer
speed moves to the door
are you all right
something terrible has happened
katsu can barely sit up his arm draped over horuko his head lolling from side to side
the family is gathered around them and racer x who is again wearing the mask
racer x tastes the needle of the blow dart
a highly effective and debilitating drug
stays in the system for hours but leaves with no trace
no you wont
you cant drive a car
you can barely stand up
katsu leaps to his feet
you do not tell me what i can do he suddenly collapses to the floor
she tries to help him but he is unconscious
what are we going to do
they all look to each other for an answer but no one seems to have one
the phone wakes him and he grunts into the phone in indiscernible japanese
i have been assured that our problem has been solved
perhaps your definition of solved is different from mine
d a in the distance the medieval walled city sinks behin hill as the sunrises the sound of rolling thunder swelling as the race cars come flying over the hill
exploding past us
the second leg of the casa cristo is under way
and the stage is set for what might be one of the most ferocious rallies weve seen in years
crowds lining the road cheer as the cars scream past
already starting to nudge and buck trying to force an early mistake
speed and racer x are immediately forced into their aggressively defensive driving
speed seems particularly wired
watch your line
flies into block for okamoto but okamoto doesnt create enough space
they kiss with the shriek of crashing metal
pops and trixie ride in the helicopter with sparky spotting
packs leaning left look for a slingshot on the right
almost on cue the medius rez team launches at okamoto who feints left and jumps allowing speed to smash block to the inside
speed youre too tight
the cars bounce and speed takes a hit spinning for moment before he regains control
speed mumbles to himself
this is completely and pops mumbles finishing speeds thought
the security guard receives confirmation
the chopper is ready maam
horuko is escorted out surrounded by her security detail
crunchers thug watches through binoculars as horuko exits the hotel then reports through his bluetooth
shes leavin da hotel now
sparky scouts the upcoming terrain
wicked sidewinder coming up
watch the inside out
could get ugly
horuko is escorted to her waiting helicopter
the crew of thugs negotiates the winding crowded
signals loud and clear
on the dash is a gps map with a blinking signal
the chain of jostling cars weave up the switchback with the violence of clattering pachinko balls
double the guard for her arrival in bartimaeus
i gave my word nothing would happen to his sister and i mean to keep it
the inspector gets another call
what kind of emergency
the helicopter races across the scenic landscape
inside the cockpit the pilot sets the auto pilot on and releases the stick
he stands and pulls out a gun
it is cruncher block
speed is driving like a maniac
okamoto looks like hes about to go over the edge
the pilot opens the door to the posh passenger cabin
the two security men go for their guns but cruncher has the drop
dont do it
they raise their hands
on the ground
they get on
horuko stands and cruncher whips his gun around to her
but suddenly something is wrong his eyes going wide as he realizes horuko is not horuko
horuko is katsu
what the katsu snatches crunchers gun and the fixer is too stunned to do anything to stop it
the security team seizes hold of him
but if youre here whos
katsus car swerves wildly back into the middle of the road
trixie has had enough
she yanks up the dark visor on the helmet
couldnt see anything
she gains control and eases the car into the slot
nice line trix
horuko sits beside sparky wearing trixies clothes
top of the hills coming
snakes got at least a quarter mileon ya
well lets go get him
if youd been a little more careful he wouldnt be ahead of us
i told you i couldnt see outta this dang helmet
its too big
i cant believe you talked us into this ridiculous idea
whats ridiculous about it
youre the one always telling me im a better driver than most of the wrl
nows not the time to prove it
its too dangerous
too dangerous for me but not for you
if were going to have a chance were going to have to pass snake before the rendezvous
she floors it pulling out leaving speed shaking his head and trying to keep up
they smear through a hairpin turn and as they close on the nearest cars it is immediately apparent that they are no longer driving protectively or defensively they are attacking
racer x leaps at the bumper of one car corner checking him into the rail while trixie hits like a cue ball on the break scattering several cars leaving speed
little to clean up
go get em girl
he sees them in the rear view mirror
here they come
pick it up
here comes the okamoto team making their move
every winding turn is another click on a fishing rod as they slowly reel the hydrocell team in
the okamoto team moves with synchronized grace while snake and his team struggle to hold their line
whatre you doin
the mountains undulate the cars dip and rise caught in the current of this concrete river flowing one way then another the cars sawing across the belly of one bend
drifting into the curve of another the hydrocell emerges over the crest of a hill with the okamoto team tight to their bumpers
just try it
try to pass
just try it
racer x knows theyre ready
speed slingshots from the back position hurling alongside the hydrocell team until snake blocks him setting up an attack by one of his team but this just allows racer x
a hole to punch through
the cars continue to slug it out still weaving up the mountain road climbing it seems to helicopter or blimp height
now the gloves are off and they are pounding one another bumper to bumper rail to rail
it remains at one level of intensity until snakes bashes trixie hard into the rail driving her almost over the edge causing her to shriek from the force of the
blow and speed loses it
his jaw clenches shifting into a whole new level of intensity
he becomes a cyclone a whirling dervish enveloping the hydrocell team in a cloud of chaos throwing rending
ripping through them until only snake is left
speed is not kind battering him until hes not sure if hes going forward or backward
in a panic snakes reaches for a hidden lever but before he can take hold of it speed clobbers him again causing him to shriek louder than trixie and then
recede quickly away like a dog with its tail tightly tucked
pops cant help a flash of delight
thats my boy
the okamoto team roars into the lead behind some very aggressive driving by speed racer
you kiddin me
he just tore snake a new tailpipe
you all right
shes obviously shaken up
and ready for more
speed shakes his head wanting this to be over
then lets move it
we got some time to eat up
cruncher is buckled into a seat with his arms tied behind him
he glares at katsu who is changing into his racing leathers
havent ya heard
cheaters never prosper
sir weve got the lead
theyre heading for the rendezvous now
katsu looks back at cruncher and smiles
the thug hangs up
somethin aint right
they head down towards the rendezvous which is a hidden alpine nook surrounded by mountains
youre sure no cameras here
checked it this morning
quite a few dead spots in these mountains
the okamoto team roars up to where everyone is waiting
speed climbs out of the mach and heads straight for trixie
i told you she turns ready to fight if thats what he wants
you are one helluva driver
youre not so bad yourself
sparky and pops go to work changing fuel cells and starting to pound out some of the serious dents
racer x sees cruncher guarded by the security team
whats he doing here
werent sure what to do with him
do what hed do break his legs and let him walk back
horuko bows to trixie
thank you so much
it was a blast
they start to turn until machine gun fires objects
the thugs emerge from the surrounding wood
what is this
he strides towards the nearest goon but bullets spit the earth and snow at his feet causing him to freeze place
this is called a change of plan
now freed one of the thugs tosses him a gun
yeah thats right
were changing your plan that changed our plan to change your plan
cruncher decides to ignore that
the new plan what was it again
break your legs make you
i like that
he stands smiling in front of racer x
but first i think its time to play a little peek a boo i see you
we are still waiting for the okamoto team to come out of the pass
those roads can really ice up
one of the thugs pins racer xs arms back as cruncher goes for the mask while unnoticed by anyone the trunk of the mach pops open and four eyes peek
cruncher starts to peel back the mask when a rock clips him on the side of his head
he turns just as whap
a monkey cookie in the kisser
chim chim howls as sprittle reloads his sling shot
get that monkey
the goons are confused distracted and before they can control it the fight is on racer x throws the thug holding him speed and trixie dish out equal measures of
chop socky and good of american slug fu as pops grapples and wrestles his goon into a head lock
racer x hammers cruncher to the ground where he sees his gun scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it katsu steps on his hand
its a short quick turn around and looks like another change of plan
the security guards herd up cruncher and the thugs pops turns his attention to sprittlel get over here
he and chim chim run behind speed
sprittle this isnt a game
you couldve been killed in there
know it was bad
i know we shouldnt have done it
but chim chim was really really scared
okay i was a little scared too
scared of what
sprittle clings to his big brother
i didnt want what happened to rex to happen to you
racer x and pops feel a hidden wound open
we just thought if you got into trouble maybe we could help and its a good thing we did
a good speed looks at pops as if sprittle is making point
oh no youre not getting off that easy
if your mother hasnt had a heart attack already im sure shell know what to do with you two
tires and the last of pops line is lost to the squeal of roar of engines as the hydrocell team flies by
they rush to their cars speed leaping into the mach
growl tires spin and gravel spits as the three cars shoot back into the race
first out of the pass is
the hydrocell team
they better send the emergency trailer wait
is that like eagles dropping from the sky the okamoto ream soars out of the mouth of the pass
here we go again
whatever happened in that pass has left okamoto back where they started but now only one obstacle stands between snake oiler and the maltese ice caves
trixie notices as pops begins to bite his lip
she whispers to sparky
this is where rex
moon white sheaves mottled against coke bottle colored ice floes rise up a glistening wall of glacial plates surrounding the thin ribbon of road
speed enters the first series of caves bored through earth and ice a stroboscopic oscillation of light and dark ads and no ads as the memory of watching rex disappear
down the throat of one of these caves haunts him
what are you doing
are you all right
ahead the hydrocell team grows from small silhouettes flashing in and out of sight
closer and closer larger and larger until once more the three chase cars lock onto their rear bumper
the next caves a rattler
what is that
well make our move in there
the open maw swallows the segmented train of cars each one slipping down into an underworld
where there is no purchase for advertisements only the cold wet darkness where white lights chase after red ones
speed tries to shake his fear when x calls for the attack
the cars split apart racer x leading the charge as sparks flash as with the cross of swords metal striking metal and the ice crusted walls sparkle with star bursts
of the cacophony ringing through the first bending curve
it is obvious that the conditions are much more difficult a sword fight on a frozen lake each of the drivers skidding wobbling drifting farther then they anticipated but the
okamoto team are just too good eliminating one and then the other hydrocell cars until speed again has snake in his sights
this time though snake is ready
not this time punk
he throws the lever and beneath his car a violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that speed hits going
full throttle immediately spinning wildly out of control
he screams trying to hold on as he spits out the end of the cave smashing through the rail separating from the earth hanging for a moment against the soundlessness
of the open sky before dropping like a stone
speed racers gone over the edge
everyone feels the same stomach lurching terror as pops eyes go wide with the terror that he is about to lose another son
speed falls and from inside the cockpit it looks impossibly far to the bottom but the wall of the cliff is not completely vertical and the mach begins to rub
against the ice
speed reacts immediately hitting one of the control buttons and crampons shoot out of his tires giving him just enough of a hold to try a split jack jump the
front jacks firing throwing the car into a somersault across the open ravine slamming against the far side which has slightly more slope allowing the crampons to dig in as he drive straight up the wall of ice
he did not just do that
speed racer is
driving straight up a cliff face are we getting this
this kid is unbelievable
they all cheer
go speed go
speed jumps again vaulting violently back into the winding road just behind a disbelieving snake
speed roars up after him and snake grabs for his lever again but now its speed thats ready jumping over the ice he body slams snake sending him hard into
the rail as speed shoots into the lead
he grabs at an ankle holster yanking out a gun
their cameras zoom in as snake aims
oh my god hes got a gun
speed doesnt notice until it seems his entire family screams into his ear snakes fires just as speed hits the cockpit bubble and the bullets smack against it like a
sledgehammer into a brick wall
he swerves knowing he wont be able to take many hits as snake chases after him firing as speed hits the crampons again and runs up the side of the
mountain then flips off the wall just as the cliff face drops off switching sides as snake now finds himself on the outside as speed bashes him out through the guard rail
snake tries a similar move to speed but snake is no speed and his car bursts apart as he miss times the flip sending a bouncing cocoon to the distant
snake oiler completely going out of his mind could have been altitude sickness it gets crazy up there whatever it was speed handled it beautifully and with less than kilometers
to go nothing seems to stand between okamoto the cars weave through the byzantine streets of san bartimeaus
the checkered flag comes down hundreds of flashbulbs capturing the moment as katsu leads speed and racer x across the finish line
remmington smoulders like the cigar worries between his fingers as he watches the effect of the race happen almost immediately
the stock of okamoto engineering climbs two points
katsu poses with speed and racer x for photographers
racer x is clearly not interested
we make a good team
we did our part
make sure you do yours
racer x stares at katsu whose face is as expressionless as a mask but it feels as though racer x can see right through it
very impressive race
yes thank you
you are very generous mr
speed does this mean youve signed with okamoto
a mutually beneficial opportunity
yes well put
katsu does this mean you will be running in the grand prix this weekend
right now im just going to enjoy this victory
the price is a share
the price is barely above
this is extortion
ill sue you
tie up every asset you own up for the next years
as you wish mr
have a nice day
he grinds his molars until they are smooth
seventy eight a share
ill have the papers drawn up
a pleasure doing business with you
sit across okamoto hangs up the phone
katsu and horuko from him
you have done very well for us my son
katsu smiles the same smile as his father
the only person not smiling in the room is horuko
speed kicks over a tool box giving voice to his rage with a cacophony of clattering metal
he jumps into the mach
the engine guns the wheels screech as he peels out and away leaving inspector detector standing with this hat in hand his frown mirrored by pops
i dont get it
what just happened
okamoto played us for chumps
all he wanted was our help to drive up the stock on his familys company
even if there was a file he had no intention of turning it over
you mean that whole race was for nothing
speed screams as loud as he can strangling the steering wheel as he rockets through a series of familiar with curves
without the lights or banners or crowds the race track echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral
it is here that speed has always found himself
but as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless abandon it becomes clear that he is chasing something that he has lost
he seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life
suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his prayer a miracle his brother
for a moment he believes that he is again driving beside the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up against each other speed realizes this is
no ghost its racer x
the masked racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his anger and speed swings his car wielding it like a club trying to clobber him
racer x dodges the first blow and swings back the two have at one another banging shoving one another into the wall until speed cant take it anymore and he
goes at x as ferociously as he can throwing him into a tailspin crashing him into one of the grand stands
silence embraces the track
speed climbs out of the mach
there is a small movement in the car a shuddering as though in pain and speed realizes he may have gone too far
he runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes the masked man is not in pan he is laughing
he practically falls out of his car
you can drive
i havent been thrown like that in years
what are you doing here
the inspector told me what happened
i came looking for you
thought youd take it hard and maybe do something stupid
why would you care
because youre a fighter
and a friend
why dont you just tell me the truth
racer x stares at him hard
youre rex arent you
you mean your brother
youfirstappeared two years after rexdied
you drive just like him
youknew id be here because thisis where he always used to takeme
just tell me the truth
after a long hard moment racer x pulls off his he is not rex
speed is stunned
im sorry speed but your brother is dead
he pulls his mask back on
im sure where ever your brother is he is immensely proud of you
making the same mistakes he did
for trying to make a difference
from what ive read thats all he tried to do
and what good did it do
he got killed for nothing
racing hasnt changed and it never will
it doesnt matter if racing never changes
what matters is if we let racing change us
everyone of us has to find the reason to do this
you dont climb into a t to be a driver
you do it because youre driven
i dont know why im doing it anymore
at fuji you were trying to prove something
at cristo you were looking for justice
neither are the reason you belong behind a steering wheel
if you know so much why dont you tell me why i should keep driving
thats for you to figure out
he climbs back into his car
i just hope when you do im there
to see it
he roars away leaving speed alone
speed is furiously packing
there is a knock on the door but he ignores it
sprittle opens the door chim chim following him in
hey watcha doin
whats it look like
where ya goin
i dont know
i just gotta get away from here
because i have to
can we come with you
speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu
can we come with you
youll understand when its your turn
he shoulders his bag and shoves out the door
there speed crosses to the door but pops is already sitting waiting a heaviness in his
speed before you go id like to say a few things
will you sit with your old man for a minute
speed chafes a bit but drops his bag
dont try to stop me
i made a mistake trying to tell you what to do at cortega
you were right
i was wrong
i wont make that mistake again
i want you to know that i acted rashly
i said things i wish i hadnt
your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of my self but i was determined to do it this time and i guess i did a pretty good
job of it
i wanted to make sure you understood how sorry i was
the truth was i couldnt have been more proud of you son
not because you won but because you stood up you werent afraid and you did what you thought was right
it didnt amount to anything
it was completely meaningless
how could it be meaningless
i saw my son become a man
i watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off of every driver on the road
this is not meaningless
this is the reason for a fathers life
pops eyesbegin to twinkle with tears
i admit i went to cortega because i was afraid that what happened to rex was going to happen to you
and i just couldnt take that
i couldnt loose another one of my boys like that again
but what i realize in cortega was that i didnt lose rex when he crashed i lost him here
i lost him when he walked out of this house and i let him go without telling him how proud i was of him and how much i loved him
i let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did
youll never know how much i regret that mistake but its enough that ill never make it again
he puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him
i love you speed
i understand that every child leaves home but i want you to know that door is always open and you can always come back
i love you pops
im just so confused right now
i dont what im doing or why im doing it
im locked up in some kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense
i know what thats like
when rex died i didnt even
know if i wanted salt on my eggs let alone if i wanted to keep building cars
then do you remember when we sat here that night watching old ben burns and dugazi
you remember that
sittin here cheering with you something just clicked like a light being switched on inside of me and after that i never had trouble remembering how i liked me eggs
thats just it
thats part of my problem
burns and dugazi
it was fixed
remmington told me the whole story
it was all about some dnf names rotts
theyve known the winner of every grand prix for the past years
its always fixed
thats a tough pill for pops to swallow
i dont believe that
remmingtons a crook
you cant believe a crook
i dont think he was lying pops
the grand prix
who could that be
speed opens the door
she seems to glow radiating her own incandescence
forgive me for intruding but i had to come before it was too late
speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another set up
this is not a trick
i swear to you
i am not my brother
you going to ask the lovely lady in
come on in
she steps in looking somewhat out of place in the suburban living room
can i get you something to drink
my security man believes i am still at the opera so i only have a moment
she turns to speed
i am very sorry for what happened
what my father and brother did was not right and i am ashamed
just another lesson learned
it is they who are in need of a lesson
she pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to speed
this rightfully belongs to you
he opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up
an invitation to compete in the st annual grand prix
my brother was planning to decline anyway but i studied the rules very carefully and as a member of the okamoto team if you present this invitation on the day
of the race they must allow you to compete
pops bursts into a smile and slaps speed on the back
whaddya think of that mr
its always fixed
you do not have to say anything
i only hope you drive as you did in casa cristo and you wipe the smiles from their faces
we dont have a car
right here pops
sparky steps out of the kitchen doorway
whatre you doing in the kitchen
same as everyone else
behind him the entire family peeks out
i dont believe it
you were listening the whole time
trixie goes to him
we were worried about you
i would say good luck saturday but you do not need it
you are already very lucky to have such a family
goodbye and thank you
he closes the door
we got work to do
but pops the race is less than hours away
isnt that how fast remmington said he could build that tin can with all his fancy machines
then well do it in
he heads for the garage sprittle leaping after him
i want to help
well come on
chim chim too
we need everyone
the family gets to work bolting welding drilling cutting and grinding
the framework of a car begins to materialize assembled it seems out of thin air human will made manifest as a car is covered in a sheet bearing the ri
remmington speaks before mushi and his cadre of lawyers and assistants
i swear to you mr
mushi when the grx is revealed at the grand prix and then captures the black and white checkers the demand for our transponder engines will go through the roof
the racers continue to work sparky beginning to fall asleep just as mom brings him a big steaming cup of coffee
the car is further along but still a long way from finished
papers are signed
hands are shaken
pictures posed for
the harmony of the corpratocracy complete as the entire family covered in sweat blood and grease refusing to quit even as the sun rises on nothing weve seen compares to
the staggering scope of this track
it feels like an entire city grand stands rising up like can opened sky scrapers surrounded by clover leafs of track that seem like origami folded highways
preparations are well under way ads being positioned lights being checked make up being applied to ben burns and his announcing partner cass jones
the racers gobble handful of potato chips stuffing quarters of p b j sandwiches into their mouths rushing to finish while caviar shrimp and lobster are being set out on
trays of ice beneath a glistening ice sculpture of
the car is nearly finished pops spraying on the paint as
the crowds have already begun to arrive
at the players entrance fans swarm after cannonball taylor who arrives in his gorgeous sports car
sparky slams the access panel shut
alright fire it up
everyone holds their breath as speed hits the ignition
the car makes a sick baying rattle and smoke begins pouring out of the engine
remmington stands ready to reveal the grx
ladies and gentlemen behold the future
its black shiny and beautiful in a malefic way
the clock continues to tick everyone watching anxiously over his shoulder as sparky works
sparks its getting late
i know i know
give it a try
everyone braces as speed hits the ignition
it is the sound of an explosion held in the palm of your hand
sounds beefy pops
it gives you a little something extra
lets get it loaded
this year marks a new record as the grand prix will be broadcast in eighty four different languages
the camera pans
over the multitude of ethnic broadcasters
just gets bigger every year doesnt it ben
seems like it
the elite hobnob champagne flutes flashing between feathered hats and waxy smiles
the okamotos raise their glasses to mushi
weve got an incredible lineup this year
some major competition
we got a few fan favorites like the gray ghost sonic boom boom renaldi and prince kabala
we got perenial powerhouses like nitro venderhoss gary gearbox kalinkov and mori minimoto
not to mention c ball
cannonball taylor fastest grand prix seed in history driving the new orx from remmington racecars
she looks mighty tight
there is an odd numbered field today nineteen one shy of a full boat as katsu okamoto declined his automatic invitation after winning the casa cristo
hey theres something going on down there
were seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance
a large group of security officials are gathered staring at the invitation in speeds hand
one of them starts to shake his head when he hears is there a problem here officer
remmington is in his element everything seeming to go exactly as planned until gennie comes up behind him and whispers in his ear
sir we have a problem
the doors burst open as remmington charges in
his eyes flash as though seeing ghosts when confronted by the entire racer clan
what madness is going on here
remmington this is a legitimate invitation
we have verified it
where did you get that
i was on the okamoto team remember
i won it fair and square
this is preposterous
he cant be allowed to race
its too late
the ruling on this is quite clear
try to stop it and youll be in blatant violation of the wrl charter leaving me no option but to shut this years prix down until a full investigation can
do you have any idea what that would cost
are you insane
remmington stews then spits a threat at speed
youll regret this
something big is going on because every race official has been wait wait
an announcement is being made
a new driver is being added to the field
holy sh ben burns gets bleeped by the network censors
a name flashes on as the driver is added
now driving in the twentieth and final position speed racer
the roar from the crowd shakes the windows of concerned knitted brows search the room in quiet panic while in private horuko allows herself the faintest smile
remmington meets in secret with cannonball taylor
a million dollars to the driver that takes racer out
he wont get out of the blocks
i prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room
cannonball smiles as remmington starts to turn
were installing a spear hook on the grx
i dont need one to beat that punk
speed begins laying out all of his things while the other drivers move around him wolves stalking prey
in a mirror a yakuza tattooed driver eyes speed while drawing a straight razor up his neck
speed tries to ignore him digging through his bag getting more and more flustered until he realizes he forgot the red socks
the racer family finds their seats
the yukuza man moves up behind a despairing speed straight razor flashing as the gray ghost cuts him off
hey kid the gray ghost
just wanted to say good luck
he reaches out to shake then whispers
theres a million dollar bounty on your head
a million dollars
maybe i should take myself out
your ruffling some pretty major feathers here
why arent you after the bounty
our little dance at fuji thats how it should always be
as the cars take to the field you can feel the anticipation mounting in the audience
something is different
there is an electricity in the air
the presence of speed racer has completely changed the equation
speed is sitting still not dressed
the broken ritual has him confused not sure how to begin
a dressed and helmeted driver heads straight at him but is diverted by speed racer
speed turns taking a moment to realize the handsome millionaire playboy in the tux is unmasked racer x
he glances down at speeds belongings and sees a picture of rex
im quite a fan of yours and just wanted to say how glad i am to see you here
as they shake hands racer x realizes that something is wrong
is something wrong
i got this thing
its stupid i know a superstition but i guess all of us got one
can i help
speed suddenly notices the red trim of his tuxedo and his red tie
he looks down and heaves a sigh of relief
speed rushes out of the darkness of the tunnel into the brightly colored awe inspiring venue that is the grand priz coliseum
there is a dizzying onslaught of giant advertisements and jumbotrons while the enormous crowd roars in lapping waves like the surrounding ocean
there he is now speed racer perhaps the biggest wild card in grand prix history
floating camera blimps seem to hover everywhere including right next to speed catching him unawares with a gapers mouth
the image of speed looking overwhelmed is immediately broadcast onto the jumbotrons eliciting a laugh from the crowds
trixie sees speed on the big screens
speed racer gets his first eyeful of the coliseum
this aint kansas baby
the gorgeous prince kabala struts for the crowd while a team of beautiful female mechanics push his jewel encrusted car into place
he sees speed helping sparky push the mach into place
hey mouth breather get used to he shows speed his ass
cause thats what youre going to be looking at all day
speed tries to ignore him and the other drivers staring at him like a fox staring at a chicken
speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again
hey this cockpit is the exact same size it was at thunderhead
just wanted to say thanks for what could be the most exciting moment of my life
couldnt have gotten here without you
he hugs him
im looking forward to that cold milk
speed climbs in as the speaker system blares ladies and gentlemen start your engines
the engines erupt crashing against the waves of the roaring crowd but inside the mach everything goes completely silent
nothing exists now for speed except the track as he loses all separation between himself and his car
he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes as the countdown begins
the final countdown has begun and a stillness has fallen over this stadium as all eyes turn to one car
this aint a race
its a showdown
again we cut to the many varied expressions of anticipation trixie mushi okamoto sprittle and chim chim katsu and horuko mom and pops remmington and racer x who no longer
has any socks until the gun sounds the cars become bullets hurdled forward except for the car in front of speed which barely moves blocking his he tries to avoid it but cant rear ending him while the car behind him slams into the back of the mach
trouble at the start a misfire traps speed racer causing a uh oh
a car to the side swerves aiming straight at speed who manages at the last second a slip jack jump flipping over the car as it slams into the pile
up while speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the track there is a scream of burning rubber and the mach rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd
i dont know how he got out of that one that kids wiley
the first lap of the grand prix is ben hur brutal as car after car takes a shot at speed but he uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other
littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing cocoons
they try to keep up but speed is even too fast for them
speed fakes left jumps right nice nice
he slips in behind gearbox here comes over under speed executes another beautiful maneuver sending gearbox crashing into boom boom both cars going boom boom their rubber cocoons bouncing free
ben burns is giddy with glee
i told you
i told you
speed racer seems unstoppable moving up from dead last nearing the leaders as they head into the slalom with the gray ghost battling prince kabala and cannonball taylor for the
the prince tries to sight the ghost in his mirrors but the gray ghost seems to vanish
where am i
where am i
i am over there
im savior faire
the prince tries to block the ghost but he cant seem to locate him
im everywhere baby
the ghost is on him pouncing slipping into what feels like a shoulder throw that sends the prince spinning out of control onto the onrushing nitro shattering the princes car
like a mis struck diamond reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust
the two more cocoons bounce onto the road as the other cars roar past
a spectacular crash as the princes jewel covered gigerbon worth an estimated million dollars is scattered over a quarter mile of track
id like to work clean up on that crash
but look out as they approach the big drop here comes speed racer
the cars head over as though falling off the end of niagara and while other drivers cling to their steering wheels just trying to hang on speed presses the accelerator
making his move banking higher than anyone up the big wall and when he dives back down there are only three cars left ahead of the green mushi motors car the gray ghost and the black speed racer is knocking on the door of the new grx driven by cannonball taylor
you hoot anybody home
two time grand prix five time wrl future hall of fame teach me something
speed makes a move and cannonball blocks but it is clumsy and speed quickly counters bouncing cannonball into the wall
is that it
he swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it is immediately clear who is the better driver as speed throws cannonball from one side of the track
to the other
cannonball taylor is in trouble
tear em up kid
the knuckles of remmingtons fist crackle as he wrings the tension
stop him now
see you at the finish line
speed slides into cannonball to throw him but as he does
cannonball throws a hidden switch and under the two cars a spear hook shoots out and locks onto the mach undercarriage
speed feels it and knows what happened immediately
what is it
hes got me
cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall grinding against the mach while the trailing cars shoot post
cannonball has speed pinned as they grind through the butterfly turn
remmington relaxes as speed falls further off the leader pace
sprittle understands immediately what is going on
hes using a spear hook
the surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable
sprittle we dont know that
cannonball taylor is nothing but a big cheater
they exit the butterfly turn and head into the slalom both drivers fighting hard to force the other into the onrushing concrete pylons
the paint is scraped first from the outside of the mach and then the grx as they barely avoid one pylon and then another neither car gaining an advantage until
the mach begins to rattle the stronger grx taking advantage as they head for the final pylon where the camera that is broadcasting the two cars onto the jumbo tron is positioned
this is going to be ugly
at the last second speed hits the two outside jacks causing both cars to rise up onto the two outside wheels of the grx revealing the undercarriage and the hidden
spear hook to the camera
the crowd gasps
told you so
chim chim high fives him
cheaters never prosper
the mach flips down pancaking the grx while the mach crashes free leaving the exposed spear hook to hang limply from the front of the grx
cannonball clearly using a spear hook
that could cost him the hall of fame
not to mention what it might do to remmington industries
shame on them
people begin drifting away from remmington as he feels the walls close in around him
switch but speed tries to start the mach
he hits the the starter only grinds
oh no come on dont do this
pops watches through his binoculars
dont quit on us now baby
racer x is watching with minx
listen to it
dont kill the starter
speed takes a deep breath and it seems the entire stadium takes it with him
he closes his eyes and tries to listen to the car
what do you need
something makes him put the car in second gear
he steps on the accelerator then hits the starter and and the mach roars to life
the crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber
hes back in it but less than a lap and a half i dont know what kind of chance he has
come on kid
the red socks flash as speed stomps on it jamming the accelerator to the floor
hes a half lap behind the entire field but every eye in the stadium is on the white and red streak of lightening as it thunders by rattling the elaborate
lace work of concrete and steel gaining inch by inch foot by foot
people abandon the televised images wanting to watch this miracle to see it with their own eyes
look at the split
hes shattering the lap record
dont mean a thing without those checkers
speed comes out of the spiral glimpsing the back of the trailers as they go over the big drop
where they ease over the edge speed hurls out going airborne free falling past two trailers as the grade of the slope reaches up and gently eases the mach back
onto the track to the delight of the crowd
the mach surfs up the big bank weaving through another pair that try to stop him with spectacularly disastrous results
outside the mach a maelstrom of violent chaos churns inside speed is perfectly at pease
no hesitation nothing fazes him no one seems capable of stopping him
this kid aint just driving hes on a mission
remmington cant take it losing all pretense of decorum
speed weaves through the butterfly cloverleaf taking each turn at such intense speeds that the cars he passes seem to be moving in slow motion
by the end of the slalom he is back where he left off with two cars left ahead of him mushi motors and the gray ghost
welcome back kid
been lonely up here without you
with a quarter lap to go speed racer is back two cars beneath him and destiny
speed suddenly feels the weight of everything that has brought him
to this point
sees images and hears voices flashing through his head as though at his own death
the montage finishes with the image of speed as a ten year old boy drawing pictures of race cars making all the noises lost in a dreamworld that has become
he sees the finish line and makes his move
the gray ghost sees it coming first
oh yeah here we go here we go
speed flashes one way then another moving in ghost like feigns here there and everywhere
thats my move
before ghost knows where to go speed ducks past
sling shotting down alongside the mushi motors car
the yukuza driver tries to block but speed jumps dodging the hit causing the mushi car to swerve and then wildly correct swinging back as speed hop scotches over him
again just the ghost flies in taking a broadside hit from the mushi car both of them exploding just feet from the finish line as speed launches up and through the cloud of smoke and fire crossing into history with the flashing wave of the checkered black and white fluttering softly in the silence as the crowd begins to rise to their feet
the mach slides to a stop and for a moment speed catches his breath then slowly pulling off his helmet he begins to let it all in the thunder of
the crowd can be felt through his chest straight to his heart
remmington screams overturning a table of caviar and lobster crashing the elaborate ice sculpture of the grx at the feet of mushi who turns and walks away in disgust
pops chest is out tears running down to his moustache as he wraps his arms around mom who goes to pieces as chim chim and sprittle leap up and down
hugging trixie the smiles of katsu and his father are gone giving horuko no end of secret joy
the crowd storms over the barriers swarming speed and the mach
its a pandemonium
people have gone completely crazy
in fourteen years weve never seen anything like this
its a whole new world baby a whole new world
the crowd lifts speed up onto their shoulders as we collage pan to racer x watching his brother a smile on his lips
he did it
racer x lowers his binos and turns to the inspector
yes he did
this could change everything
it already has
my men are bringing the family down
do you want to go with them
he turns and takes minx by the arm
can i ask you a question
do you ever think you made a mistake hiding the truth from them
there is a flash of images as we glimpse the truth images of rex watching his car explode in the ice caves his funeral then the facial surgery then the
mask of bandages as one face is lost in a mirror and another is revealed
if i did then its a mistake i have to live with
he walks away while several of the other drivers led by the gray ghost applaud and salute speed as the racer family is led through the swarm of photographers and
she pushes towards him and he sweeps her up into his arms and kisses her surrounded by the sparkle of camera flash sprittle covers chim chims eyes
may cause cookies
mom and pops both hug speed their eyes bright with joy we rise up up and away
roll snazzy credits
