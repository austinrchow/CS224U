written by karl gajdusek lewis john carlino pleased to meet you hope you guess my name but whats puzzling you is the nature of my game
the rolling stones
close on the needle of a precision weighted rpm turntable
it comes down touches vinyl
the rolling stones sympathy for the devil purrs out
arthur bishop s sitting in a comfortable wooden chair stares right through us
lean hard in perfect physical shape
in this moment carrying the stillness of someone utterly in balance
for all we know hes been sitting this way for hours
every man has a death thats right for him
reverse to find a wall of photographs charts official documents
in the center a photograph of a man mid s east indian dressed like the billionaire he is
dodi fayed meets bill gates
for every man theres a way to leave this earth which is so right for them its almost as if they carry it with them
moving over the wall
the mark escorted from a bullet proof sedan by ear wired men
entertaining at a palatial estate
magazine covers the billion dollar lifestyle
the new playboy
passing over smaller articles what does this man do with your money
when the right death overtakes a man there will be grief in those who knew him but there will also be a sense of inevitability
because they will know that of course
close on bishop
statue like except his eyes which dart across the wall in front of him making connections
vintage race cars speed by a blur of color
but all we hear is the rolling stones song
of course this was always going to happen this way
the sound of the race floods in as the cars blow by revealing bishop amidst onlookers watching calculating
two cars tangle in a corner spin to a stop crushing a half million in beautiful restored antique
the mark climbs from his wreck tosses his helmet pissed
bishop raises a camera takes a picture
bishop at his wall again this time actively engaged working it
a picture of the mark in his vintage car goes up underneath bishop tacks a stats page fatality in auto accidents by type of impact
head on side rear
off to the side bank statements cash transfers
united arab emirates
bishop tacks more photos up
the mark getting off a private plane the mark playing polo
a rider slams a ball forward spurs his horse onwards bearing down on the ball
another rider comes in from the side sends the man crashing off his horse
the second man the mark takes a second to gloat over his fallen opponent before charging onwards
in the stands
bishop watches takes a note on a pad
bishop keeps working the wall completely covered now
lists of possible deaths have been ordered drawbacks circled
bishop scans over various magazine covers featuring the mark
one with a vintage hunting rifle slung low in his arms unbroken
american dream or american nightmare
bishop stares at this
eyes moving over the wall accident stats a copy of a hunting club reprimand
bishop stands in front of a moving riverway his body sheathed in a black slicksuit backpack on
he slips into the water and starts to swim
we stay with bishop as he swims hard powerfully not tiring
finally we pull away across miles of water realizing this is what bishop will swim without stopping
a pair of armed security patrol a wooded shore
one lifts a pair of binoculars scans the shore as behind them a form moves from behind a tree blends into the woods
moving fast silent towards a lit structure in the distance
the sense that someone is in here with us
a low green glow illuminates bishop in a tiny cramped compartment
no way to know what or where
the glow coming from his watch illuminates his face crammed and claustrophobic
an eye checks the time the light goes out
just the sound of his breathing
plumes of smoke rise from the end of vintage hunting rifles
game birds scatter into the air
dogs bark tear through underbrush
men dressed in traditional hunting livery move through foggy woods followed by stewards
this is old school hunting old school weapons
camera finds the mark raising his weapon sights
a pheasant falls dogs race after it
the mark starts forward but is interrupted by his steward reminding him to break his weapon as the other hunters have
the mark pushes the man back ignoring him hurrying on
at a small distance two unhappy private security guards follow
a soft beeping almost inaudible
a low rustle of cloth then the green glow illuminates bishops face as he checks the time again
hasnt moved in hours
the mark stumbles forward over eager to get to his prize
hes worked his way ahead of the field
the mist has grown thicker
human forms move on all sides hard to distinguish
guns go off around them
dogs rush by
the mark brings the weapon to his face
the shot echoes through the foggy woods
the mark pleased with himself as always bursts into the lodge gun over his shoulder
a round of applause as his steward holds up the mornings catch
he pushes on into the locker rooms as one security takes station at the door
the second emerges from the lockers having just done his sweep
the mark leans his vintage hunting rifle against the wall opens his locker
he kicks off his boots pulls off his shirt
takes a second to rub his face with his hands
it can be exhausting being him
behind the mark a locker door opens and closes
like a ghost did it
he doesnt sense a thing reaches for his weapon accidentally knocks it to the side
it lands hard
the mark winces half expecting it to fire
he starts to lean down for it when another mans gloved hands reach it first
the mark smiles down at the well dressed man crouched by the gun a little confused
bishop looks up smiles back
he puts out a gloved hand
before the mark can consider hes taken bishops hand
bishop holds tight
the marks smile
even though we know its coming bishops actions are so fast and final were taken by surprise
he pulls the mark in as at the same time he cocks the rifles hammer slams the gun into position barrel pointed up and boom
the shot hits the mark in the face obliterates him sends a plume of gore up against the ceiling
one two seconds before the marks security rush into the room guns lined
first sees the mess puts a hand to his mouth
second starts on the radio
the room is empty
a vintage shelby cobra parked by the edge of the river
bishop emerges from the water pops the trunk of the car
towel and large rock inside
he towels off tosses the suit and the rock into his pack pack goes into the river
he grabs a sweater from inside the trunk
bishop gets behind the wheel dressed
he checks himself in the rearview finds a bead of sweat traveling from his brow
wipes it away irritated and starts the car
a quaint local convenience store off a two lane road nestled amidst trees
bishops vintage car pulls up and he gets out
door jingles as bishop steps in smiles to the grocer a friendly beefy guy in his s who checks the clock
on the nose
got your weekly right here
the man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter
bishop comes forward sees the owners daughter behind the counter
precocious reading a dog eared kids book
i got something for you wanna see
the girl smiles puts down the book and comes over
bishop crouches in front of her
he puts out two empty hands shows them back and front then tickles one ear with a hand while the other appears a small daisy
the girl sees it smiles
a little disappointed
im just kidding
bishop reaches into his jacket pulls out the next installment in the kids book shes reading a series featuring a young female harry potter like character on the cover luna
sophie beams takes it
a quick hug and shes back to her seat opening the new book
what do you say honey
thank you bishop
youre very welcome
and shes back into the book
bishop smiles a little sad
it was nice
but the moments over
he stands and collects his groceries
see you next week arthur
a ranch style compound nestled in the hills
warm rustic and inviting
bishops cobra drives past the main house a large craftsman into a barn where he parks next to a collection of other beautiful vintage cars
he gets out crosses the dirt drive towards his home
a studio separate from the main house
two horses graze in an attached paddock
bishops enters flicking on lights
the home is beautiful ordered
everything a model of design and elegance
the walls are home to a collection of original and slightly sociopathic art
lucian freud de chirico zak smith francis bacon
isolation beauty unrest
bishop unpacks his groceries
nothing looks delicious
his fridge is ordered
glass containers in rows lightly hued liquids in each
he opens a can of friskies sets it down for a mutt like tabby cat who lopes over and eats
bishop scratches her behind the ears
bishop flicks on lights illuminating the wall covered with charts documents photographs of the mark
he goes to a gas fireplace built into the side of the room fires up the flames
a sideboard holds a collection of vinyl albums
mint condition collector
fingers play over titles
rolling stones neil young bob dylan
the turntable needle hits youngs needle and the damage done
music croons sweet into the room as pages photos everything goes into the fire
one photo in particular the mark busy on the phone as a young girl pulls at his suit jacket
he was a criminal bastard but also a father
bishop stares down at the picture consumed by fire reflected in his eyes
bishop running on a treadmill full tilt
a controlled sprint without end
the gym has all manner of customized exercise equipment
weights machines a climbing wall an infinite lap pool
bishop jumps off the treadmill immediately takes his pulse checks it against a clock on the wall jots a note
bishop pressing weights
reps over and over muscles hard straining
in his eyes almost a relaxed intensity
the rest of the world turned off
bishop racks the weights loud
immediately taking his pulse checking the clock
bishop sits at a small desk plotting the evenings work out in a book
he traces columns enters points on a graph
doesnt matter how impressive the numbers are theyve peaked and are now starting their inevitable slide
staring at the book
bishops stands in front of his phone
he scrolls through the last ten calls that have come through
they all read mckenna harry
over and over
three days worth
bishop eats dinner alone at the end of a beautiful antique table
hanging on the wall across from him a vivid disturbing painting of three women
on his plate
his food is a meal we might expect an astronaut to eat
raw spinach a collection of supplements
he crunches through something that looks like cardboard chews stares at the painting
in his study the phone rings
he eyeballs it lets it ring
bishop sits on the couch in front of the television his cat curls under his arm purring
bishop flips channels through an endless display of over amped human behavior
people haw and wink in the sitcoms people yell on the talk shows people cry and lust on the dramas
a news channel shows a picture of the mark
billionaire tech mogul dead in tragic accident
two anchors discuss
heres a guy at the top of his game
and yes there were questions about the money where did it all go
were some of his friends less than friendly to the us
but in the end its not the feds who catch up with him its that age old adage that boys will be boys
these dangerous hobbies come with the risk of accidents like this bishops punches off the tv heads for the door
bishop pulls up in his car looks up
hundred of lit windows above him lives going on behind each
he heads forward the doorman holding the door for him
bishop gets out of the elevator stops in front of a door
he rings the bell
bishop pushes the door open steps into
beautifully warmly furnished
sofas surround a living area a gas fire flickering
throws and rugs
art on the walls tasteful and human
an open bottle of wine on a granite counter top
over all the city thousands of lights twinkle
ill just be a minute
we catch a glimpse of the woman
a towel over her hair wearing a skirt and a bra crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom
even in the small glimpse shes beautiful
bishop looks down at a coffee table
a picture of the first marks elaborate funeral
im sorry i was away so long this time
i had some complications
shes emerged from the bedroom
long dark hair damp from the shower
buttoning a shirt the curve of her breasts caught as she does
a comfortable sophisticated air about her
you dont have to apologize
im just glad youre here now
are you hungry
she starts to move by him his hand catches her arm and she is in his arms holding him tight kissing him
i never thought i was going to be a woman who waits
but i do
i wait for you
she breaks off pours red wine in a glass
were you in europe
was there another woman
i dont mind
suddenly shifting gears i
i made something for you
she picks up a remote fire up a large flatscreen tv
hits a button
a moment then an image flickers to life
on the tv the woman sitting in this same living room
she wears a long sleeve shirt over panties
sips a glass of wine
smiles warm at the camera
the silence of late night
just got back from the weekend at the lake with julianne and barry and their kids
their oldest is five
youd like him
everybody spoke about you of course
we should go up there sometime just the two of us
on the tv she reaches towards the camera and the image jumps ahead
another night late
the woman enters the frame now wearing a stunning black party dress
announcing giggling i just got back from seeing the most boring opening at the pierre grochet gallery
and of course everyones asking where you are and of course i made your apologies but what i was thinking
on the tv she winks at the camera happily drunk
raises her dress a little suggestive
why werent you here to take me home and make love to me
she blows a kiss
closes her eyes
on bishop watching
emotion breaks the surface
the woman raises the remote
turns off the image
looks at bishop
plain not demanding
im not a man who
it wouldnt be good for you if i was around all the time
she moves to him and they are kissing fierce
bishop and the woman make love
shes the aggressor at first pulling away bishops clothing climbing on top of him pulling her own clothes away
bishop grabs the woman who laughs in ecstacy
he reverses her throwing her down on the bed climbing on top
the two of them eye to eye as they fuck
early morning light filters into the room
bishop awake staring at the sleeping woman
his eyes click over to the clock which reaches am
as if hes been waiting bishop rises and dresses silently
bishop stands in front of the plate glass windows
he turns and moves to a music box on a shelf opens it
a melancholy tune plays
he admires the machinery as he removes twenty bills from his wallet tucks them under the box
stay for breakfast
shes standing in the doorway tying a robe around herself
a cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor
not crass or mean spirited but the romance is gone
do i ever
but theres a first time for everything
bishop goes to the dvd player slots out the dvd they watched the night before and pockets it
this was a good one
see you next time
you all right
he turns studies her
this is new ground
he nods and leaves
she stares a moment at the door after hes gone
full tilt again a maintained sprint
he maneuvers through trees over rocks
below him through the woods his home comes into view
a black bentley sits parked in front of the house
a man on a cell phone stands by it
the man wears a mid level suit a hired professional
into a phone yes i just got here
no not yet
he turns reacts as bishop is there close barely sweating
hold on i got him
the man holds his cell phone out for bishop
a beat bishop studying the angles
he takes the phone
jesus christ arthur is that you
how are you harry
oh you know im god damn perfect
im redecorating my fucking office and i wanted your advice on the god forsaken curtains is how i am
beat serious this is
this is something arthur
i need to see you for old times sake
bishop sits in the back looks out at the city moving around them as the man drives
they approach the armored gates of a business tower mckenna holding corp
the driver nods at security who recognize the car open the gate
the car drops down into the garage under the building
bishop and the man exit the bentley
four more armed security down here seated around a table eating delivery from a local deli
two stand one steps forward
sorry gotta do this
patient bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him
bishop steps out of the elevator into a top level wonderland of money manipulation
desks crushed with monitors manned by casually brilliant mit grads
flat screens track the markets
all of this overseen by a witchs tit of a manager who eyeballs bishop coolly
a tapping gets bishops attention
the corner office is glass walled
harry mckenna is tapping on it gesturing bishop inside
the office is high tech
harry less so
overweight and doesnt give a shit
cigars in a ashtray ash burns on the persian rugs
a man to be reckoned with in his time
the time has perhaps passed
harry comes out from behind his desk points bishop to a big leather sofa
bishop perches on the arm
i like the new digs
mckenna laughs like a grunt
fiddles with his hearing aid turning it up
bishops eyes track
has it really been that long
you know how they say youth is lost on the young
if i had my nineteen year old body back i wouldnt be here ill tell you that
id be out there making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts
times have changed harry
they dont wear skirts anymore
mckenna eyeballs bishop shakes his head
he goes to the glass wall points out at the screens financial markets
you know what all that is
off bishops nod thats their money getting moved exchanged
made clean and neat and proper for uncle sam
and i have always been extremely careful
mckenna goes to his desk tosses legal papers on the table between them
you know what that is
thats a god damn subpoena from the justice department
we get a new face in the white house all of a sudden they want to look at my records
they got accountants want to go through my books
are you kidding me
i got the left hand coming after me for what i did for the right hand
bishop looks over the papers nods
so i call them up
i say hey you guys gotta get your own house in order
and thats the point
i tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it i get silence zippo fuck all
what are they twelve
i dont see how i can thats bullshit arthur
your father they still talk about the guy like he walked on water
you theyll listen to
you im not a part of that
mckenna stares out the window at the street below nervous
shakes a pill out of as small vial pops it
he chuckles shakes his head
you remember that fishing trip we all took back in the day
you were what
about eight right
off bishops nod you fell out of the boat
couldnt swim a stroke
animated laughing youre in the water splashing around
you got these big eyes like saucers like youre sure youre gonna drown
just staring at your father and hes not making a move
just looking down at you like
suddenly its gotten less funny
i finally had to grab you by the hair pull you back into the boat
youre shivering like hell and he your dad gives one of those laughs
those big laughs everyone loved him for
anyway the whole time youre in the water you didnt cry out
you were a tough sonofabitch even then
that was a long time ago harry
mckenna turns from the window takes in all his monitors charts
stock lines tick up and down graphs flow pulse
well im in the water this time arthur
you think its easy for me to ask
it cuts like hell
but thats what im doing
bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the office
pillows and blankets on a sofa
some clothes strewn about
mckennas been sleeping here
a long beat
the tension seems to drain from mckenna
he claps bishop on the back nods back
through the glass wall of the office
bishops eyes track as elevator doors open and steve mckenna steps out a beautiful young woman with him louise
shes a trophy the woman you get for being top dog and the one you regret getting
gorgeous self obsessed entitled
she flops onto a leather sofa as steve moves towards the office
steves young mid s strikingly handsome wearing the casual uniform of wealth not earned
but theres something else that arrests bishop immediately
unwasted motion detachment observing the world around him
even as steve nods to one of his fathers security and pushes into the room he picks up bishop
the two men lock eyes a strange reflection not of appearance but of nature
and heres the prodigal son arrived to bilk me for ransom
steve this is arthur bishop
steve shakes bishops hand
nice to meet you
you work for my father
no quite the opposite
arthurs doing me a little favor
so youre a criminal
a last beat between steve and bishop then steve lets it go turns his attention to his father
i need you to make a donation to louises charity
shes mounting some kind of fundraiser and she wants to make sure we do our part
whats it for
i have no idea
and dont pretend you care either
write the check go to the party smile when the you and call you a great and generous man
you ever think of having kids arthur
wearily mckenna brings out his checkbook
suddenly to bishop you know i cant tell what youre thinking mr
usually im very good with that with people
sort of like a bullshit detector i developed
but youre very
hard to read
so what are you thinking
i was thinking that a son should be more grateful to his father
i often wonder why im not
mckenna tears the check out hands it to steve
now go away
thank you dad
are we going to see you at the house any time soon
yeah this is just a few more days
we got this
steve hears the dark in his fathers tone tracks it
anything i can do
yeah you can earn some money
no its going to be okay now
arthurs helping me out
steve glances between the two men
ego slightly bruised
well its good to meet you mr
my father seems to trust you which is
bishop and mckenna watch as he hits the atrium hands louise the check who goes out of her mind jumping up and down giving him a kiss that speaks of
more to come trotting off
steve glances back one more time then follows her
we will take from our children for a lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant
explain that to me
off bishops silence okay
okay call me when you hear something
you take care of yourself harry
well thats your job now isnt it
bishop exits the elevator
security holds the door to the bentley open for him
bishop shakes his head walks out
bishop exits an old freight elevator enters this huge loft space
old architecture divided by free standing walls hung with paintings from the same artist whos work hangs in bishops home
intense slightly surreal deeply haunting
mens faces distraught alone
a matronly art dealer comes forward familiar takes his hand
glad youre here
right this way
as they move across the space bishop catches sight of a model lying nude in a pool of blue paint
across from her the artist is full focused on her
hes roughly bishops age
cigarette dangles off a lip tattoos on his arms
fully comfortable and committed to the alternative life
the model senses bishops gaze looks over unashamed
bishop follows the dealer into another area where they approach a canvas
its a portrait of a young boy alone
the effect is of rage filled isolation
zak is almost finished
it will make a wonderful addition to your collection
bishop looks at the canvas
glances back to where the artist is carefully adjusting his models position
do you want to meet him
bishop enters his home sets his things down
stares at his phone a beat then on impulse picks it up and dials
the voice that answers is female official
good evening mr
how can i help you
id like to speak to dean
theres a brief pause on the phone then
dean is not available right now
can i take a message
just tell him i called
bishop hangs up stares at the phone
the doorbell rings
bishop opens it to find a dhl courier on his doorstep
bishop is suddenly casual friendly
the public face of bishop
they make you drive all the way out here this evening
thats the job
the man gestures to the open barn door the classic cars
you find tires for that old fleetmaster
no not yet
maybe when i do well take it out for a spin
say hello to the wife for me
good night arthur
the man heads back towards his truck
bishop tears away the strip that seals the envelope a small usb jump drive slides into his hands
the friendly grin on bishops face
bishop fires up a computer hooked to a printer
he slots the usb drive into the computer
nothing seems to happen just a low pulsing red light on the drive
almost instantly his phone rings and he answers
we should all be so lucky
the phone goes dead
almost at the same time the glowing red light on the jump drive turns green
bishops printer fires up
it starts printing out pages
a few medical charts
and then a photograph harry mckenna
the new mark
lost in thought
eyes play over his art
bishop hits the study work mode
all hesitation gone
pages are tacked up other ripped down and tossed
he takes out a thick pen circles words syncope cardiac spasms
poor eustachian tube function
bishop sits at a desk under a reading lamp making notes out of a stack of books
a diagram of the central nervous system
the technical specs for an electronic device
bishop receives a set of plans from an attendant
spreads them out over a counter
in the corner a large photocopier
bishop sits at his desk a jewelers loup over one eye working with soldering iron and electronic tools meticulous
behind him tacked to the wall are copies of the building plans
routes in and out penned in
locations of security
hes done his recon
sitting in the sun on a window ledge an open jar of mayonnaise turning rancid
a fly buzzes around it
through the jewelers loup bishop is working on a hearing aide
tweezers adjust a tiny chip slot it into place
bishop eyes it for a beat
snaps it up
the voice on the other end is world weary professional
i heard you called
hey you get the stuff i sent you
thats what i called about
i know him
i think there might be a hold on a second
a long pause
just air on the line
bishop stares at his work in front of him his research on mckenna tacked to the wall
deans voice comes back as suddenly as it departed
no its been decided
this ones a go
you take care of yourself bishop
the line goes dead
bishop stares at the phone for a second sets it down
he looks up at harrys picture on the wall
the sun rises over the city shafts of light illuminating the top floor plate glass of mckenna holding corp
the sound of a phone ringing being picked up
they want to talk
im picking you up in an hour
send your people home
i dont want anyone i dont know near you today
thank you arthur
bishop hangs up his phone watches as three bags of food are put up on the to go counter
mckenna garage scrawled
bishop approaches the counter reaches over the bags for his own food pushing his drink onto the floor
the guy at the counter shrugs turns for a mop
bishop quickly reaches into the mckenna bag switches a wrapped sandwich for one he brought
a white van passes the entrance to the underground garage pulls into the alley behind the building and stops
bishop kills the engine pushes aside a curtain and heads into the back of the van which is empty aside for a heavy acetylene torch
the bottom of the van is covered by a thick black matt which bishop kicks with his foot
the matt falls aside revealing a large hole in the bottom of the van right down to the pavement and the welded steel cover bishop has parked on top of
bishop picks up the torch sparks it
the four security are eating their delivered lunch
security puts a hand to his gut
security looks over
hey you okay
actually call central
im not and with that hes suddenly up and moving towards the bathroom
security raises his radio
elevator doors open
another security guard steps out checks in by radio and heads down a corridor
in the elevator behind him bishop drops through the ceiling hatch dressed casual
he hits a button doors close
elevator doors open and bishop steps out into the office
monitors glow tracking markets and trades
but the human element is gone
except for harry alone silhouetted at one of his large plate windows watching the sun rise over the city
you ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like arthur
you keep standing next to that window maybe youll be able to tell me
mckenna looks over smiles weary
he looks exhausted
he goes to his desk picks up a tie looks to bishop
this turns out alright im going to send you a dozen thai hookers and a case of cuban esplandidos
you can return the hookers if you want but the cigars
i dont smoke
you will my friend
for these you will
bishop and mckenna heading down
mckenna watches the numbers
bishop studies mckenna
then casually why the change of security
bishop slaps the stop button
elevator jerks to a halt
bishop gets a finger into the doors pries them open
mckenna looks at the effort sighs
lets bishop help him down
halfway through balance shifts mckenna starts to fall
bishop steadies him
mckenna stares at bishop concerned
bishop nods heading towards the stairs pocketing a small hearing aide as he goes
on mckenna touching the hearing aide in his ear
bishop and mckenna reach the bottom of the stairwell
mckennas winded steadying himself against a wall
bishop cracks the door peers out
what the hell
mckenna moves in pushes bishop aside
only there are two new faces in the garage
replacements packing weaponry
this isnt good arthur
listen to me
im going to check it out
bishop those men are armed
i know what im doing
and bishop slips out the door shutting it behind him
the moment hes out he turns and sinks down in front of it blocking it with his back
he opens his jacket brings out a small transmitter
waits a beat then flicks a switch
mckenna there staring at the door
he approaches the steel door tries the handle
cant open it
nervous he carefully puts his head against the door to listen
the sound of gunfire voices fill mckennas ears
he staggers back crouched terrified
close on his hearing aide the sounds of gunfire is coming from it
more shots then the sound of pounding on the door
its a trap
the door flies opens and bishop lurches in gun raised
mckenna starts up the stairs breathing hard
behind him he can see bishop gun lined back at the door
gunshots assault his eardrums
on the other side of the door security hears the door slam looks over for a moment but theres nothing else
mckenna picks up the pace hauling himself upwards
sweat pouring off him eyes wild
he stops tries to catch his breath
shooting pain through his right arm he grabs it just as more gunfire sounds from below
bishop comes rushing up the stairs
his shirt stained with blood
gun in his hand
if we can get to the roof i can hold them off
mckenna gulps air staggers on
door blows open mckenna staggers onto the rooftop
the manic victory of having made it clashing with the tragic knowledge that his heart is rebelling
he falls to his knees clutching his right arm
pain coursing through his body
unaware for the moment that everything has gone silent
feet come into his view
he looks up sees bishop standing over him
bishops face is a death mask
harry stares into his eyes
mckenna cackles which turns into a scream as pain sends him reeling
he falls hitting his head
blood rolls down his face
you didnt have the balls
the balls to aarrrghhhh
tears stream down his face
his body heaving not giving up the ghost
we know its in there
but it doesnt show
instead he checks his watch calculates time
oh jesus christ help me
mckenna stops struggling stares up at bishop
tears streaming down his face
please arthur put me out of my misery
bishop checks his watch again doesnt meet mckennas eyes
checks the stair door looks over the building edge
im really god damn scared
suddenly bishop moves
lightening fast wrapping up mckennas head fingers pressing expertly along arteries
mckenna stares up one horrible second then goes limp in his arms dead
bishop releases stands stares down
for the first time uncertainty in his face
why did he do that
he looks at the body at his hands out at the city
wipes his forehead with the back of a hand furious at himself
he reaches down removes the hearing aide from mckennas ear replaces it with the original turns away
seen from far above
mckennas body alone on the rooftop
with steve as he pushes through doors into a mass of police detectives private security lawyers all milling about on phones gathered around a figure on the ground
the art dealer hands bishop the finished painting wrapped
at the far end of the studio the artist and his friends smoke and drink and laugh
bishop nods thanks turns and leaves
steve stares down at his dead father
a cop draws a line around the body
steve is expressionless
bishop backs off from the wall where he has just hung the new painting of the boy
it stares back at him
blue gray morning
cold wind blows across the rooftop
steve watches the last police leave
he stares down at the outline where his father lay
a funeral in progress hundreds of flower arrangements decorations fit for a head of state
a few dozen attendees
at the front steve mckenna sits in front of his fathers coffin cold
his girlfriend louise next to him weeping
she cries at funerals
bishop stands at the back
his eyes scan over the proceedings
sixth sense steve suddenly turns his head makes eye contact with bishop
his good works comfort all of us even in his going
we commit his remains to your earth oh father and we pray you vouchsafe him eternal life and that you bring comfort to those who have been left behind
his only son steve who is himself devoted to the priest falters as steve rises moves away from the event
bishop tracks him as he wanders through gravestones
glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost
at the gravesite men fill in the hole with dirt
nearby six limousines are lined up
but only the one directly after the hearse has its door open for louise who stands waiting looking for steve
bishop watches the dirt hit the coffin
then looks over as steve approaches through mausoleums
yeah harry was a popular guy
good to see so many of his friends here
bishop considers tracks the attendees who pass by a suited man as they leave
each of them receiving and pocketing an envelope as they do
bishop looks back to steve
best grief money can buy
give me a ride home
bishop nods to the head limo where louise is waving impatiently at steve to come
looks like you have one
yeah all of that
all so that the papers print what an important and respected man harry was
steve takes in the one or two guests already counting their money a few yards away
shakes his head
well i hope its what harry would have wanted
but its not for me
bishop steers the car into the hills past high end estates
you know what i dont get is you
harry didnt have any friends
your dad worked with my father a long time ago
so just paying my respects
so your old man was into all that
yeah he was into all that
well that is refreshingly honest mr
what about you
bishop doesnt answer steers the car up a manicured drive
through the windshield an estate
a main house lawns pools guest houses
steve and bishop get out of the car
the mckenna estate was modeled neoclassical for a wanna be emperor
now a week of youth with limitless credit has left its mark
a sound system has been set up poolside
a dj spins a trance like deep groove
young women lounge around the pool in bikinis less
beautiful and bored
young men most dressed modern hip hop mostly white eyeball the women fist bump each other drink beers
steve takes the whole thing in nods somehow pleased
why is it so comforting when people surpass even our lowest expectations
come on in meet the crowd
ive got to please
a favor to me
none of these people even remembered what today was
they move into the scene
people recognize steve hug or bump fists
steves friendly but stays locked on bishop
bishop observes it all not uncomfortable
do you believe in fate mr
a basketball hoop has been set up near the pool
young men take turns dunking and then landing in the water
i think maybe were all doomed to become our fathers
ill probably die spoiled corrupt lonely and alone
runs in the blood
what would that make you
youre still young
you can do pretty much whatever you please
at the hot tub two girls kiss each other filmed in dv by an young entrepreneur
you think so
just chuck all this and go help the children in south america something like that
well look at you mr
youre a dreamer
steve heads inside
a beat bishop follows
as soon as they enter steve finds himself locked up by two beauties who whisper excitedly in his ear
do you want to
no in fact im pretty sure thats illegal in this state
come on this way
steve leaves the beauties disappointed moves up some stairs
steve and bishop move into another room where two huge flatscreens have converted the room into a wii court
young muscle bound posers play a first person head to head shoot em game
others drink cheer
two bump fists with steve
one fronts cool at bishop fakes a punch at him
bishop just watches doesnt do a thing
the kid smiles nods
on the floor paintings of harry mckenna discarded
this used to be harrys realm
now steves taken it over
giant ornate king bed
huge balcony overlooking the estate
steve goes to the railing of the balcony looks down at the grounds the people
bishop hangs back glances into a private study untouched from when harry ruled there
papers books a portrait of harry over the desk
you know i went up there
to where my father died
hell of a place to die
bishop comes abreast of steve also looks down
removed from the party and the pool area a separate area of the estate contains an outdoor gym
weights exercise equipment a fighting matt and martial arts equipment all present
off the gym area that all yours
if the body is weak the mind cant be strong
bishop nods impressed
something about this young man
engaged observing bishop but not needy
at the door a friend of steves is held back by security
shes up in the bungalow
i think she might really do it this time
my girlfriend thinks that my fathers death is a good time to kill herself
she thinks im not showing the appropriate human reaction
ill let myself out
youve seen this much
arent you interested
steve and bishop push through a guarded gate up a small path arriving at a beautiful bungalow set back in the gardens
candle light glows inside
louise is nude immersed in the water of a jacuzzi located in the center of the room
on the side she has a bottle of scotch some pills and two razor blades
she looks up at steve streaked eyes dart to bishop
would have thought youd have started by now
this isnt about me
its about you
you need to watch
steve crouches down pours himself a shot from her whiskey bottle
something angry and cold in his eyes
you dont believe ill do it
no i know you louise
youll do just about anything if itll get you enough attention
you think you can hide behind that cool attitude
like nothing matters to you
but i know you
louise blinks scared a little
but she pushes the fear away picks up one of the razor blades
a beat then with a quick gesture she slices across one wrist
blood rises to the surface runs down her arms into the water
steve doesnt move
neither does bishop
louise picks up the second blade with the cut hand
fingers fumble but she gets it
slices across her other wrist
stains the water rose
how long will it take
bishop rises looks down at her in the tub
how much do you weigh
a hundred and ten
his eyes take in her body the flow from her wrists
youre a hundred and twenty five
itll take an hour and a half maybe two
when you get cold
then youll know youre close
steve takes in bishop in this moment nods
glances at the clock
then he refills his drink heads out to the patio outside
sits facing away from them
hell stop it
he thinks hes above it all
but hes not
no one is
not clear if hes agreeing or observing
bishop sits with steve on the patio
from inside louises soft crying can be heard
seen through the trees in front of them young people dance splash party
i know you feel this
i know youll stop me
if you dont care anything about your life why should i
steve looks to bishop
he checks his watch
im getting cold
im scared steve
bishop looks at steve who just keeps staring outwards
you can help her if you want
the sounds of water splashing
louise arrives on the patio a blood stained robe loosely pulled on around her
mascara eyes ran
she stares down at steve
youre a bastard
you know what the kick of it is louise
if you actually had the stones then theres be something for us
but in seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life
well then well be done
lifes not fair
what happened to you
maybe you never really knew me
louise looking between the two men
she sways on her feet and bishop puts a hand out steadies her
youre a bastard too
both of you
like looking in some dark mirror
go on louise
youll do fine
the worlds gonna love you
louise steps away turns stumbling down the path into the dark
a beat the men just watching after her and then a scream from below
people rush to louise help her to the ground
others pulling out cell phones call for help
louises loud cries drift back
would you have let her do it
well never know will we
steve rises heads up a small path
steve and bishop walking high above the estate
far below them the lights of an ambulance in the driveway
you didnt answer my question
but its a whole other world when youre personally involved
theres a very big tab that has to be picked up
bishop stops looks down at the action far below them
governments cops the military
we give young men a licence and send them into it blind thinking itll all be okay
because someone told them they had permission
but when you cross over that line you do it alone
most people they stay that way from then on
everybody can kill
you take a mother protecting her child
but thats instinct
what im talking about is up here
tapping his head knowledge of foresight
a person who knows that the only way to truly be free of mans laws is to break his highest one
it sits there between them
why are you telling me all this
why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend
bishop stares down the hill at the commotion
these arent your people are they
you dont have people
your life is crowded but youre alone
steve unconsciously nods then you know youre right
you grow up spoiled rich like me
only thing you really learn to recognize in people is when someone wants something from you
what do you want mr
what are you doing here
bishop considers steve thrown
thanks for the tour
its been interesting
yes it has
bishop turns heads back down towards the estate
steve watches him go
bishop stares down at the line of supplements and pills set out in front of him something gnawing at him
his cat nuzzles around his legs purring
he scoops up the lot washes them down with water
bishop sits on his sofa antsy
on the tv the days news plays out in silence
anti american protests in a middle eastern country
official resistance to us eavesdropping policy
break down of high level
bishop rises goes to a stack of dvds
grabs one slots it
on the tv the woman speaking to him from her beautiful apartment
similar to the one we saw
she leans against a large plate glass windows shirt and panties sipping wine
jesus what a night
we went to opening of fernandos new restaurant and betty was there wearing well whatever we call those things she wears
on the stack of dvds
there must be twenty of them
i miss you
everybody says hi of course
but with me
its like i feel you there with me even when youre not
on the tv she pulls her shirt off over her head faces the camera again topless
i feel the way you touch me
bishop rises blows out of the room
dropping in on bishop sprinting on the treadmill
faster than weve seen him go before
on and on
he hits the weights slots extra s onto the press bar
the weights clang into place
on bishop pressing the enormous weight
one two three
he racks the weights disgusted
gets up throws on more weight
he presses it again
racks it again angry
adds more weight
back under the bar
muscles distending straining
he cries out as something gives in his shoulder
the weight settles down on him crushing him
a moment in his eyes the weight pressing the air out of his lunges
he laughs manic surges up against the weight tossing it off the weights slamming into the floor boom
bishops car pulls up fast
he gets out tosses the valet his keys heads in weirdly focused
bishop sits alone at a reserved table at the back a plate of sashimi in front of him
he looks out at the restaurant
laughter smiles hands touching hands waving mid story lips parting
womans hands touching their necks eyes sparkling men laughing wallets flashing
bishop rises suddenly his hand going to his wallet trying to get out of there
he steadies himself moves towards the exit
people look over alarmed as he grabs backs of chairs to steady himself
vertigo looming sounds distorting and suddenly hes falling into blackness
a female doctor is examining the injury
professional but attractive
and attracted to him
her hands on his shoulder gentle
her other hand on his back
her eyes play over his form scars wounds healed
a battlefield for a body
quite a collection you have here
something like that
does this hurt
bishop smiles recognizing the nature of the touch
yes a little
the doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long then moves across the room writes in a chart
any next of kin anybody we can notify
off his shake no how about an acquaintance
am i going to die
no not today
bishop reaches for his shirt slips it on
you damaged your deltoid muscle
but that doesnt explain the anxiety attack
any unusual stress recently
something at work
off his shake no im prescribing cataflam for the pain and paxil for the stress and im going to give you my card
if you have any other episodes
or if you need anything else dont hesitate to give me a call
she holds out her card
he looks at her lets her stay that way for a moment then takes the card
she looks away
you can pay at the desk
bishop pays cash
he crumples the prescriptions tosses it in the trash starts to toss the doctors card
he can see her down the hall speaking with another doctor
a moment he pockets the card
steve sits in his fathers office chair staring back at us occasionally nodding
we reverse to find a collection of investigators a forensic doc and a hardened security specialist
the doc is in the middle of a presentation
boards hold diagrams conclusions crime scene photos all about harry mckenna
the doc demonstrates the precise hold the pressure points that killed harry mckenna
steve watches impassive
bishop runs through the woods full tilt
finally stops in front of his house
he feels his injured shoulder winces
bishop sits on his sofa in front of the tv a bureaucrat at a press conference
a female diplomat pushes through photogs with her hand up shielding her face
words scroll us intelligence under scrutiny
high level meeting
bishop hits the remote and the tv goes to static white noise again
relax almost asleep
we stay on his face a glimpse into his only moments of peace
pounding on his front door
bishops eyes pop open
hes on his feet instantly alert moving past a sideboard
he touches a hidden catch a click and he reaches underneath comes out with a handgun
steve is there pounding on the door
please i need to speak with you
the front door opens
bishop fronting sleepy
steve is energized lit eyes blazing
what time is it
i wanna show you something
itll be interesting
steve drives too fast
bishop is shotgun
the rear area usually reserved for passengers is empty
gonna tell me what the big surprise is
id rather show you
i know melodramatic
but i think itll be worth it to you
bishop tenses almost imperceptible as steve pilots the car into the underground structure beneath mckenna holding corp
car screeches to a stop
steve grabs a case is out
bishops takes in the area
two of steves security there looking stern
bishop checks the gun he has concealed in his waistband reaches for his door
elevator opens at the very top
steve pushes out onto the roof
security lighting floods on illuminating the desolate surface in eerie even light
steve opens his case starts tossing down photographs close on the pictures harry mckenna
dead on the roof
the doors the elevator shaft everything
papers coroners documents
maybe its time you start talking
off the papers you know what that says
my dad didnt die of a heart attack
i mean he was dying of a heart attack but thats not what killed him
the blood flow to his brain was cut off his brain died before his body
somebody killed him
on bishop considering steve
what do the police think
they dont want to hear about this
i mean theyll look into it
but they dont very much like the idea that they totally missed this one and itd be just easier for everyone if i would shut the hell up
what do you want
they killed him
here on the roof of his own building
his own security all around
why even kill him if he was already dying
you tell me
to make a point
that no ones safe
that they can get to anyone whenever they want to
so what am i doing here
bishop supremely alert listening
i got my black belt in karate when i was nineteen
ive studied judo since i was six
no youre not
most people are but youre not
if i came at you right now id wind up dead as my father wouldnt i
bishop doesnt answer
steve breaks away looks down at the place where his father died
same as if i tried to exact justice for my father
these men what this is
its something you know about isnt it
something you could teach me
i didnt get the impression you even liked harry very much
steve surges forward
real anger intensity boiling over
you really going to stand there and judge how much i loved my father
what the hell do you know about it
bishop hearing this
a nerve touched
besides this isnt just about harry
harrys dead may he rest in peace
but this is about me
they came here and they killed my father
they did that to me
you want revenge
steve doesnt answer
a long moment between them
steve turns looks out over the city
you know the word nemesis
its not actually a word
its a name
she was one of the greek goddesses
retribution against any mortal who became too proud
the executor of divine justice
its a beautiful idea dont you think
bishop shakes his head turns starts to walk back towards the elevators
steve collects his papers angry
in case you havent noticed i now have a couple of million dollars to spend on this so i will find them myself and ill deal with them myself and
if i wind up dead trying you can bury me right next to dear old dad jesus stop your whining
no ones ever spoken to steve that way
a stillness between them even the wind slows waiting
corner of sixth and grand
dont be late
bishop nods starts to leave turns back
no more surprises like this okay
on steve watching as the elevator doors erase the older man
bishop stands in the middle of his home still
then he moves to his office grabs a newspaper
he moves to his study turns to a page slaps it down on the glass on his scanner
hits a button the white light of the scanner passes
big king bed never used
a huge painting by the artist on the wall across from the bed
bishop hoists the painting down off the wall
he has a print out from his computer tacks it in the center of the blank space left by the painting the picture of steve scanned from the mckenna obituary
tacked alone on the wall
bishop stands on the corner waiting
he checks his watch
steves bentley pulls up to the corner parks in a handicapped space
steve gets out nods to bishop
bishop takes in steve the bentley a metermaid ten yards away already moving towards them
bishop enters this linoleum lined hallway slips the bored attendant
the man hits a button a door clicks open
as they enter fluorescent lights flicker on
some burnt out others shorting
rows of gurneys line the room
bodies covered in green morgue drapes
steves eyes play over it
bishop is cold business like
this is a test
bishop moves down the rows pulling drapes away as he does
nude bodies are revealed
men women teens
in some the reason for their death is obvious
others arent telling
you want to know about killing look around
steve does a little creeped out but keeping it cool
the act of killing is an end in itself
any other motive keeps it from being pure
the psychopath has no motive
no hes driven compelled by his sickness
hes as much the victim as those he kills
more drapes fall
dead eyes stare up at them
but when you make your own law youre responsible to no one else but yourself
maybe youre free
this isnt some idea anymore
this is the real thing
you still with me
another drape falls
a beautiful woman
no signs of injury
ever heard the term mechanic used outside of its normal meaning
my father used it
a guy who works the tables
bishops smiles shakes his head
a hit man
bishop just stares
steve shakes his head looks away from bishop winds up staring at a dead man
laughs to himself
what are you thinking
i had you pegged as
a security consultant
maybe ex military
maybe i do
or maybe you just get paid to kill people
bishop nods his head yes
so why let me in
i mean i know what i want
what do you get out of it
times are changing
security is better trained more lethal
sometimes i could use a partner
bishop nods smiles
he moves away from the tables leaves steve standing in the middle of it all
there isnt room for those who are outside of it
theres too much isolation
friendships cant work
eventually everyone expects you to account
becomes a liability
you stand out
steve smiles shakes his head
you need a
im offering to teach you something that most people cant be taught
because you think im a natural
that remains to be seen
taps his head but youre alone in there arent you
steve continues to stare at the bodies
bishops starts towards the exit
think it over
when i find the men who murdered my father
you help me to kill them
you may never find them
you didnt answer my question
dropping into the middle of a fight
steve and bishop attacking each other mixed martial arts
steve is the aggressor moves in knocking bishops defenses away
hitting bishop who takes the punch steps back
steves still on him
kicking two three times
bishop catches a kick tosses steve back
he lands cat like on his feet comes back at bishop strong
hitting pushing bishop back against a wall seeming to dominate the fight
a buzzer goes off
bishop drops his guard would be flattened if steve didnt pull his punch walks out
behind bishops gym is a rifle range
an assortment of weapons lie on a table
in front of them some trees some old cars
some bottles sitting on the limbs of the trees
bishop picks up a handgun checks his pulse
steve has obviously learned from him does the same
bishop raises the gun
two bottles shatter at yards
he tosses steve the gun
steve keeps two fingers on his pulse
im still at
im working on it
bishop nods picks up the rifle sights
yards away the bullet impacts the head rest of an abandoned car
bishop looks to steve who gives up raises the handgun
steve tosses down the gun frustrated
you were still over
what am i supposed to do
there are no perfect situations
you fought me at so you were winning
but in doing so you gave up your shooting option
its all about choices
bishop starts to leave
whats your look like
two cars blistering down the highway
bishops cobra and steve in a classic maserati
they jockey for position weave in and out of the other cars on the road
portrait of control
expertly working the tuned car coaxing power and speed out of it
careless going for broke not caring if he has the space to make his moves
he swerves his car right at bishop
who has to peel away off the highway onto the smooth dirt pack
he downshifts blasts back onto the road catching air
steve laughs out load as they crest the top of a rise
looming ahead an existing accident
a beer truck jack knifed across the freeway
bishop brakes fighting for control
steve swerves his car too fast it goes into a spin
clips another car gains air and plows ass backwards into the side of the beer truck
bishops car slides to a stop
bishop gets out tracks steve climbing out of the maserati onto the hood protruding from the side of the truck
laughing whoooping at the sky
bishop approaches sees that hundreds of bottles of beer have cascaded out of the punctured truck
steve wipes blood from a cut on his forehead grabs a beer and cracks it swigs as he sits on the maserati hood
he grabs another tosses it to bishop
come on up man
the view is beautiful
bishop takes in the situation the small crowd gathering
he jumps up sits on the hood of the car with steve both leaning back against the cracked windshield
you lost control
steve puts out his beer
a hesitation then bishop clinks beers with him
they both drink
stretched out in front of them the highway seems to go on forever
you ever think about just
never turning back
why dont you
i have a cat
steve laughs loud
maybe the first time in ages
they drink watch the sun move lower in the sky as emergency vehicles approach
steve comes in from the guest house showered
sees bishop at the dining room table takes in the place for the first time
the art on the walls
you know looking at these a person might think maybe theres a screw or two loose up there
steve catches sight of a manila envelope in front of his empty place
is this what i think it is
dont be so eager
theyre of an outdoor area
steves eyes scan over them interested
whos the mark
a huge square filled with vendors selling all manner of food and good out of carts and stalls
music voices crowds of people
bishop moves through
dressed average just a guy in the crowd
he watches a couple argue
its not good enough to simply follow your mark and attack him
most of these people know theyre targets
theyll be watching for you
a moment then steve enters the frame tracking bishop
you need to understand the location control the situation
youre looking for escapes security police presence
bishop passes two cops squeezes between two parked produce trucks towards the row of shops that border the square
bishop stands in front of a case watches the precision instruments tick
from behind a counter the chinese owner notices him puts down the watch hes repairing approaches
s authoritative a loup on his forehead
interest you in anything
bishop takes in the man eyes check polished reflective surfaces back to the man
bishop points to a watch
thats a beauty
you know your instruments
concealed amidst exotic guatemalan wraps steve tracks the watch shop
the attractive older woman running the stall eyes him
he looks right through her
bishop exits heading back into the market
most of all you need to answer this question how does this man die here today
bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat
steve follows behind bishop lost in the sea of people
everybody everyday has a way to die
you have to find it
bishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys rocking horses vintage dolls
his gaze finds a large still boxed doll of the luna cromwell character that the grocery owners daughter is obsessed with
almost life sized
they dont make that anymore
thats a classic
i can let you have it for three hundred
bishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll
a group of teens runs by bishop buffeting him for a moment
slightly off kilter he checks his surroundings
bishop starts again aware for the first time that a man is headed his direction passing a knife sharpening stand blades gleaming his face hidden by a low hat
bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye turns and pushes through the tight space between two stalls out the back where trucks are parked
bishops glances back for the man squeezes between two large trucks
coming out the other side when pop
a loud sound makes bishop glance over
a hissing coming from one of the trucks which starts to roll backwards and suddenly hands are on bishop from behind pushing him backwards into the space between the two
a flash a split second to stare into steves face holding him there to be crushed and
the one truck slams into the second the vice closed metal crumpling
bishop at the last minute pulled back by steve whos holding him there smiling
bishop checks the surroundings nods
steve release him
thats all you got
how about god damn perfect man
dont get cocky
a thousand witnesses
man takes a wrong step
excuse me if i take a moment to appreciate myself
because that was poetry
laughing smiling you just cant bring yourself to be impressed can you
bishops considers notices that the luna cromwell doll has fallen in the gutter
picks it up tries to dry it
hand to his ear whats that
oh you are impressed
no come on you dont have to say that
really im fine with you what
youve never seen someone better
you did very well
damn straight i did
and now in celebration of me im taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses
something about bishops serious gaze has stopped steve
bishop reaches into his jacket places a gun in steves hands
a confused beat steve conceals the weapon
theres a man behind me
look up once then look away
dont look back
steve glances up
we realize were right in front of the watch store
the owner is pulling the steel grate down over his store closing for the day
you got him
you did good here
but this was just a game
is your graduation
who is he
he owns the watch store
what did he do
bishop comes close focused
ive taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder
ive taught you to be invisible
but thats strategy not killing
the real test
its the actual killing isnt it
do you want this
be very sure
because you can walk away
bishop studies him
turns to go
were right here where you wanted us to wind up
you knew where id hit you didnt you
steve watches him go
he turns back
the owner is headed home for the day
bishop sits back at his reserved table in the rear of the place
in a chair next to him the doll is awkwardly perched
around him people laugh
he reaches into his breast pocket slides out a new dhl envelope tears it open
a new jump drive slides onto the table
he eats takes pills his eyes locked on the drive
to luna doll who do you think that is luna
he takes a card out of his wallet studies it
its from the flirtatious doctor
he pulls out his phone dials
steve sits in a nondescript car lights out parked
two stories up a lit apartment
the watch store owner crosses by one of the lit windows
the owner has a delicate vintage brietlang in his hands
he places it on a patch of velvet watch repair tools laid next to it
he moves to an old stereo puts the needle of a turn table down on spinning vinyl
the lonely sounds of brahms piano concerto no
fill the room
he returns to his desk sits
a tiny noise from the hall
he looks up sees nothing settles in to work
to the front hallway
steve stands in the hallway motionless
hes just closed the front door behind him
in his hands a lock pick set which he now pockets and pulls out the gun bishop gave him
close on bishop
no way to tell where he is
hes holding the luna doll
he reaches forward knocks on a door
the womans apartment
not the doctors the same weve been to before
everything eerily identical to the last time
sofas gas fire throws and rugs open bottle of wine
ill just be a minute
a glimpse of the woman in her bedroom topless in front of a vanity
she glances back smiles warm
laughs a little when she sees the doll
its for a friend
bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door moves on into the apartment
im sorry i was away so long this time
i had some complications dont be
shes emerged from the bedroom adjusting the dress shes just pulled on
she comes up to him kisses him
he doesnt respond
she backs off moves to the kitchen to pour two wines you know who i saw yesterday
he and ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use
i was thinking maybe next week you and i should go
approaching handing him a wine
you and me the whole weekend
what would we
she approaches him sexy
touches him intimate
he stares at her blank
she recovers fast moves off
of course why do we need that
we have each other right here
carefully slowly steve makes his way down the hall towards the lit living room
the owner pauses enjoying the crescendo of the music
eyes closed for a moment
then they open
steve is standing in the doorway to the living room the gun pointed at the owner
the owner sees him becomes motionless
the two men staring across the space between them
and then everything happens very fast
the owner lurches to the side with surprising speed and agility just as steve fires
the bullet catches the owner in the side spinning him around
he crashes to the floor
but only for an instant
then hes back on his feet moving across the room
steve tracks pulls the trigger again but the gun only clicks empty
the man reaches a coat rack grabs it in one fluid motion and is moving back at steve who barely has time to drop the gun and block the rack
as it slices through the air at him
the owner hits and hits again
skilled professional martial arts trained
steve blocking one two the third hit connects sends steve reeling back crashing through the watch repair table
the owner leaps at him with the rack
steve is barely able to catch the end before it impales him
the two men breathing struggling the owner forcing the point lower towards steves face
blood pools on steves shirt
steve and the owner both track it
the man is bleeding badly from the bullet wound
a split second calculation and the man abandons the coat rack races across the room as steve clambers to his feet
the man reaches the far wall hits a release
the wood paneling slides open revealing a car fully automatic assault rifle with a silencer
the man grabs it opens up
bullets chew through furniture drywall glass searching for steve who dives into the hallway retreating as the man comes forward firing in deadly precise bursts
steve hides behind a wall which erupts blown to bits
he stumbles through a doorway into a kitchen
the woman and bishop staring forward watching another of her videos
another late night diary
shes in a long shirt and panties leaning close to the camera
do you know what i dreamed
i dreamed you and i had a child
bishops turns from the screen walks away
beat she silences the tv moves to join him
i know its crazy
i dont want to pin you down
i know you need your freedom
sometimes i miss you so much
hes staring at her oddly
his eyes move down to her sofa where another mans tie has been discarded
a moment then she shakes her head angry with herself
the pretense dropping
the real woman scooping up the tie tossing in a drawer
really i am
you didnt give me any warning this time
im sorry bishop
it wont happen again
with the owner
holding the car
listening for his target
his hand moves to the wound in his side comes away covered in blood
another decision the man slides the weapon over his shoulder retreats
moving with the man through his apartment
he reaches his bathroom blows inside
tosses the toilet tank to the side reaches in and comes out with a military grade stim needle which he jams into his own thigh
a moment with the owner feeling the drug course through his system giving him strength
steve comes out of nowhere hits the man in the head with a heavy copper pot sending him reeling back into the tub
steve starts forward dives to the side as the man opens back up full auto bullets chewing everything
car finally clicks empty
and the man is on him kicking him
steve rolling away
the man pulling him back
steve takes brutal punches to the head and face
blocks one and they grapple rolling in the tight space of the hallway the man coming up on top pinning steves arm slamming him in the ribs
steve screams surges up with the man
smashing him through a small table winding up on top of him his hand around the owners throat
the two men
eye to eye
steve squeezing the life out of him
the mans free arm hitting steve over and over
brutal body blows
steve takes the punishment
continues to squeeze
finally the man weakening
in his face
a dull resignation
steve doesnt answer just keeps pressing
the mans eyes film over
steve just keeps pressing
staring into the dead mans face
finally he rolls off
flops back against the wall broken bleeding weeping
from the heart the guts releasing everything
bishop sitting at the womans dining room table
carefully she comes and takes the seat opposite him
the professional not the actor
he stares into his wine
raises the glass to drink
his hand shakes
do you remember what you wanted to be when you were a little girl
she hears it it wounds her
im sorry i didnt mean
i was thinking of me
she looks up clear eyes
no its okay
i wanted to be a marine biologist
i used to watch those jaques cousteau movies and just
i was beautiful
he hears the simple truth of it nods respectful
he rises and goes to the music box on the mantle takes out his wallet and removes the twenty bills
dont worry about it this time
on the house
then he slides the money under the box as before
we all gotta make a living
he leaves grabbing the doll as he goes
she watches him go strangely
sadness breaking through her cool
bell jingles as bishop pushes in holding the large luna cromwell doll
the grocer looks up smiling as he sees bishop then confused as he takes in the doll
a squeal of delight as sophie appears running grabbing the doll out of bishops hands
thank you thank you
she takes off back into the living quarters of the house
the two men exchange looks uncomfortable
i saw that in a
im sorry i probably should have asked
a small beat that says yes you should have
dont worry about it bishop
you have a good night
bishop pulls up in his vintage cobra
shuts down the powerful engine emerges into the night and moves to his porch
the front door has been blown open by gunfire
bishop moves in silent alert
he reaches down under his sideboard for his gun
reacts as his hand finds nothing
can i ask you a question
steve sits on his sofa in the dark head lowered
are you surprised to see me
steve reaches over turns on a table lamp as he looks up
his face is bruised bloody
his clothing stained and ripped
in his hand bishops gun from the sideboard
bishop tenses doesnt react
steve spits blood smiles
guy owns a watch store yet keeps a million dollar apartment
supposedly sits on his ass all day yet takes stairs double time
it was sitting there right in front of my face wasnt it
bishop doesnt respond
was that the man who killed my father
theres a code to what we do
it may not be rational but it matters
the mans name was harry xiao
he was a mechanic
last year a us representative died in a fire
along with his wife and two children
a few months ago a ceo vacationing in costa rica was found dead with his wife
because the woman was tortured the authorities believed it was drug related
civilian casualties are very effective at hiding intent but theres a line i dont give a damn about that
you havent answer my question did he kill my father
bishop doesnt react then
you should put that behind you now
steve nods swallowing emotion
bishop starts to move and steve is suddenly there still angry pointing the gun right in bishops face
i could have died today
blind fucking luck
look at me
you tried to kill me
that man was
he was unstoppable
but you stopped him
give me one good reason i dont blow you away right now
one god damn fast bishop slaps the gun away pins steve up against the wall
now im sorry if you got a little scared
but this isnt coaching girls softball is it
this is life or death
every time you go into this somebody dies
every time its you or the other man
so stop your crying
he releases steve who falls to the floor sucking air
you got what you came for congratulations
youre done go back to your friends your women your whole beautiful life
that used to be my front door
try to close it on the way out
bishop starts to go
steves words stop him
they dont mean anything to me
this makes sense
i dont know why
but i think i was meant to do this
and like you said you could use someone
bishop studies steve a long beat
shakes his head goes into his study
bishop fires up the computer hooked to the printer
he glances over
steve is standing in the doorway
bishop tosses steve the jump drive
steve studies it slots it into the computer
almost instantly the phone rings
bishop punches on speaker
the same silence
we should all be so lucky
the phone goes dead
the light on the drive turns green
bishops printer fires up
it starts printing out pages
on bishop and steve
watching the pages feed out
photos a new mark at an elegant gathering of powerful men and women
tall powerful entitled
his arm around a turkish beauty in an elegant black one piece
emerging from a limousine at a large public event
the same beauty on his arm
height weight medical history
bank accounts figures
leases deeds of property
a last photo peeling out of the printer
the woman the beauty in a diplomatic power suit
a second to realize shes the mark
more pictures weve seen this woman on television recently
on bishop and steve reacting
then bishop gestures towards the large empty wall waiting
you get started
ill make coffee
what did she do
unsaid questions asked unanswered
forget i asked
seen through x telescope
the images magnified flat
the view unstable moving
just the low sound of wind
panning over upper floor windows hesitating on a pair of armed security making their rounds
camera clicks then move on
finds the entrance
a line of people moving through a metal detector
one young man in particular
steve collects his cell phone from the other side of a metal detector slots a bluetooth and heads in
bishops voice fills his ears
slow down as soon as you get inside
security station will be to your left
steve passes through a door pauses as two guards talk in the open doorway to a security control room
how many views
eyes moving fast sixteen no eighteen
four second intervals
one of the men notices steve who starts forward to ask a question
the man points him down the hallway towards the consulats reception
steves eyes track monitors
make that four and a half seconds
bishop is sighting through a camera affixed to the telescope headphones on
hes on the th floor of a skyscraper under construction
cement pillars and steel work
these guys are packing israeli made uzis
couple are actual military
bishop takes in the other buildings across the street then moves his sight up the embassy adjusts a control p
through the scope large tinted glass windows suddenly turn transparent
bishop scans find the marks husband on the bed watching tv bored
he scans again
finds the mark in the adjoining room on the phone and angry
bishop touches a switch on the telescope and a small laser projects
the womans voice fills bishops headset no were literally locked in here
im supposed to be presenting at the un but i cant do that if everyone is going to panic about security
bishops scope zoomed in tight on the mark staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
this is america
people dont just kill people here
then she shuts the door
bishop moves his focus upwards to a glassed in terreriam like structure on the rooftop
an indoor swimming pool
the same pictures now tacked up
moving over the wall
meticulous study days of work blueprints of the building
service corridors highlighted surveillance cameras marked pictures tacked to locations
magazine and newspaper clippings about the mark showcasing her beauty
headlines the new and beautiful face of turkey
the face that said no to america
other materials doctors reports
time tables intervals circled holes noted
steve and bishop studying everything
bishop almost trance like
work it again
she never leaves
its like they know were coming
maybe they do
steve nods continues pacing scoops up bishops cat and strokes her
bishop watches him
falls off the rooftop
falls or jumps
steve moves to the wall of pictures his gaze lingering on shots of her on vacation is a swimsuit
i tell you one thing killing her is not the first thing that jumps to mind
bishop hears this frowns moves forward
his eyes scan the mark at the pool getting ready to swim
im going for a run
you wanna come
let me ask you something
you ever not feel like running miles
bishops sprints runs through the woods around his house
body pushed to limit
in his eyes his mind somewhere far off working
steve alone in bishops home
he moves from room to room
he hits the kitchen looks in the fridge makes a face at the empty shelves the bottles of supplements
he moves on pauses to stare at the gas fireplace in the study
moves on towards bishops bedroom takes in the king bed
runs a finger across the headboard dusty
he stares at the large painting across from the bed
you like it
didnt hear bishop come in
i dont know
always made me feel
steve follows bishop to the wall of research on the female mark
bishop points to some old research on the mark glamorous
she was a model
the mark is a beautiful woman
before arriving at her current position she enjoyed the way men looked at her
thats gone now
she needs to be taken seriously
she hates that men only see the beauty
magazines heads of state all focusing how what a piece of tail she was
like you did
bishop slaps a picture of the pool the mark swimming
two security agents positioned
why is he standing here
wouldnt he get better coverage
he cant see her
he cant see her
neither of them can
bishop snaps it up
catch you at a bad time
bishop doesnt respond
always the conversationalist
anyway just calling to say wed like you to go ahead with this one
as soon as you can
phone goes dead
bishop hangs it up
steve looks at him anticipating
nice downtown joint
second story tinted glass looking out over downtown
tracking over faces laughing drinking relieved to be done for the week
finding bishop sitting alone watching the people
the flirtations the animosities
he looks down at the street below where a ups driver has exited the building
steve breaks the frame sits down across from bishop
run it again
patrol number three moves down the service corridor at
five minute window after to make it up top
three minute climb to position
three minute window to engage
shake stir add lime and enjoy
bishop smiles looks away
howd you get into it
bishop looks back surprised
checks his watch
this business its not like theres a degree you can go get
its like most trades it gets passed down
my father was very good better than ill ever be
but no one controls
the nature of the work is that some people know who you are and what you do
a man told his girlfriend to impress her
the girlfriend told some people she owned money to
bishop finishes his glass of water
i was young
it took me four months to find the people another to find the girl and she gave me the man
thats how i
got into it
you ever wish you just
let it go
but i wasnt wired that way
what about you
steve and bishop oddly locked
three small explosions in the kitchen
flames shoot out of the galley
a cook stumbles out on fire
a waiter douses him with water
steve and bishop
they havent moved a muscle
here we go
and theyre moving
security takes a call as another man studies his monitor people fleeing the building across the street smoke
fire in the restaurant
into radio turkish patrols two and five were closing down the front entrance
the mark stands at her closet starting to unbutton her shirt to change for her swim
she pulls it closed as one of her security knocks and pushes into the room from a balcony
excuse me mam
theres a fire next door nothing to worry about
the mark nods
the man locks the door behind him crosses the room leaves through the main door professional
steve and bishop push upwards through a stream of people flooding down the emergency stairs
they reach a heavy door locked and alarmed
three people burst out from the inside
steve catches the door and theyre through
a few lawyers and a secretary still collecting their things look up as bishop and steve push in holding up badges
you need to get out
whole building is going up
bishop and steve move on as the startled employees leave
they move down five doors push into
a private office
desk computer a handwritten note reads leave mail here will be back wednesday
a box from ups which bishop tears open
inside what looks like a large weapon
steve goes to the windows pushes them open
the embassy across changing its security pattern
men are leaving posts on exterior patios locking doors
below the excess manpower is channeled to the front
bishop turns fires out the window
a cable streaks across sinks into the wall of the embassy feet away
bishop hooks the cable on this side tosses the gun in the box
steve seals it with tape slaps a return label on it
he crosses the hall tosses it in the mail room
when he returns bishops already secured the cable outside
steve hooks on as well theyre both wearing harnesses under their clothing
he steps out onto the ledge with bishop closes the window behind him
bishop lets himself fall backwards
flashing light of the fire trucks
no one sees the two figures sliding silently from building to building above disappearing over a th story railing
steve lands next to bishop who unfastens the cord they used to cross spools it back to them
no way back now and no trace left behind
jackets strip reverse to the pattern of the embassy security
a quick lock pick and they slip inside
elevator doors open and the mark gets out
she nods to the guard on duty heads into a changing room
two guards monitor screens corridors rooms entrances and exits
pairs of guards make their rounds
closing in on one pair
something about them
the guard squints just as the image changes showing another part of the embassy
the guard hits a toggle returns the previous image
but bishop and steve are gone
the mark pulls the straps of her swimsuit up over her shoulders
stares in a mirror as she tucks strands of hair under a swim cap
quiet lit from overhead by large halogen lights hanging from the hanger like beam structure
dark shadows in the corners
the low sound of water lapping light reflecting off the water moving over walls
the mark enters and hangs up her robe
she goes to the edge of the pool looks down into the water then glances up at the guard whos stationed across the space
he nods back to her moves to the lower space giving her a little privacy
a second guard looks in rudely checks out the mark as she dives into the water and out of sight
he shrugs looks back out at the roof lifting a cigarette to light
across the roof an access door is open
the mark swims hard
cutting through the water
she reaches the far wall and kick turns against it
her body passing above us
silhouetted by the strong halogen lights above her
only the throbbing silence across the space
the indoor guard checks in on his radio
looks up as the door nearest him swings open
he rises approaches the door curious
the rooftop lit by security lights the strobing of the firetrucks below
he hears a rustling a banging
torn he glances backwards
cant see the mark in the pool from here but can hear her strokes
she kicks hard dives under
and were in her p
the far wall approaching then we revolve as she turns now looking up at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface breaking the surface now swimming face up to
the bright lights hanging from the girdered ceiling
the second guard tests the door
takes out his flashlight and plays it over the roof
we reverse to find steve there tucked away just out of sight
the first guard reaches the source of the noise a plastic bag caught in a revolving air vent
he pulls it free
with the mark coming out of another turn still backstroke looking up
she makes it half way across the pool
floating staring upwards into the light
but its like she senses something beyond them puts a hand up to shield her eyes
she opens her mouth to scream
he goes in taking her with him underwater his momentum carrying them both several feet under
she twists in his arms fighting
screaming bubbles flowing from her mouth
above the surface
no sign of the violent struggle going on below the surface
across the room
guard number one returns glances up towards the pool
doesnt hear anything
he sits back in his chair
the struggle is violent silent terrible in its inevitable conclusion
the mark writhes and jerks but bishop holds her tight always pulling her away from the surface
finally the fight goes out of her
she goes limp in his arms
he turns her stares into her unseeing eyes
then lets her go rising slowly to the surface
at the surface
bishop just breaks breathing in silent
he raises himself slightly sees the guard at his post
across the room
the guard glances back towards the pool hasnt heard anything for a little bit
a new noise from outside gets his attention again
he heads out hand on his sidearm
the guard approaches the same door guard already checked banging in the wind
he starts to move towards it when a figure looms he almost draws his weapon breathes relief when he makes guard
its the second time its come open
she still swimming
the two guards come into the pool area
on the far wall the shower is running a towel has fallen over the drain and the water is flowing down and into the pool
one of the men steps forward concerned
the mark floats face up in the pool just under the surface
bishop has already shed his wet clothing pulls on dry clothes as steve comes into the room
they barely acknowledge each other business
bishop stuffs the wet clothes in a bag dumps it into a laundry chute
how did it go not yet
as if on cue an alarm blares
excited voices come on over an embassy wide pa system
voices from the next room
bishop opens the chute again as steve cracks a glowstick puts it between his teeth swings his legs in and drops
across the room
the door to the dressing room opens armed guards flood in along with embassy officials speaking on radios
the room is empty
tight pitch black except for the eerie glow coming from the glowsticks bishop and steve have in their teeth
they slide fast the sides of the tube rushing up at them
and then suddenly a dim light at the bottom rising fast
steve lands hard in a cart of towels
rises and pushes himself out of the way just in time for bishop who grabs the pack he tossed down shoulders it and theyre moving again now through sub corridors
alright you gotta admire that
you gotta admit we are a spooky good team
they push through a set of old doors move fifteen feet to a metal roll down door
its like one moment were there
the next moment
he rolls up the door
stares at a new wall of cement bricks
bishop takes in the problem starts to solve it
he tracks left right considering options
there wasnt any sign of this on the plans
i went over them fifty times
this isnt supposed to be here
this cant be here
bishop holds up a finger
shhhhhh they listen
a soft beeping
both men peer around the edge of the metal door to where a small box with a red light blinks
what do we do
steve looks at bishop and boom
doors blow open three guards burst through machine guns raised and spitting
steve hits the deck
watching bishop its like everything weve seen so far was in slow motion
this is the real thing unleashed
bishop wraps the first man up uses his kevlar vest as a shield to catch the fire from the other two
the man screams as his arm breaks
bishop gets control of his weapon focuses it on the other two
one is blown back
the other dives for cover
fluid bishop reverses the man pushes him away from him coming up with two of the mans flash bangs in each hand
each hand dials the grenades timers to two different settings simultaneously popping the levers
second attacker fires a burst which bishop ducks the bullets stitching across the first attacker slamming him back his rounds tearing into the ceiling showering steve in debris
bishop throws the first grenade which reaches the attacker just as he rises for another shot
another down as another attacker dives through the door at bishop who wraps the man up his fingers finding pressure points on the man who goes limp in his arms
on the floor witnessing everything
even in the chaos recognizing the move
bishop shoves the last grenade down the front of the dead attackers clothes wheels him around pressing him against the concrete brick wall
two more security kick open a door guns fire
bishop goes horizontal his legs crushing the one man against the metal grate even as he returns fire at the other two who fall back and boom
the grenade goes off
bishop is hurled against the far wall
smoke and debris fill the space
bishop moves hauling steve to his feet and shoving him into the ragged hole blown in the brick wall even as bullets trace after them
a bullet catches bishop in the side he sprawls then leaps towards the hole
cover in the floor is tossed aside
bishop and steve emerge move feet to a non descript buick
the keys are waiting bishop starts it up drives up the ramp
next to him steve is catatonic lost
as he drives bishop rips a strip from his shirt pads the wound in his side
you still here
it was my fault
i was in charge of the exit
i looked at every work order every entry in the building logs
no one controls thats the nature of the beast
steve swallows nods as bishop brings the buick around a last corner accelerating at the closed gate in front of them a turkish guard waving his arms frantically
firetrucks and ambulances already crowd the streets
theres just no time or extra manpower left to react to the buick which plows through the gate of the locked garage
two blocks behind a single police car follows
bishop takes a hard turn moving fast
you did good in there
you hear me
it was asking a lot
you came through
steve nods processing accepting
bishop slides the car to a stop in a covered lot
across from them bishops own cobra waits
behind them the police car tears by lost
bishop drives down the small lane leading to his home
steve is staring out his window deep in thought
finally looks over
for the first time takes in bishops injuries
so back there
that was one hundred percent
bishop looks over gives nothing
door opens and bishop and steve come in
steve plops in a chair head in his hands
a beat and then music filters in
neil youngs needle and the damage done
he raises his head sees light glowing from the study
bishop sits in a chair eyes closed
steve comes in stares at bishop
looks over and admires the surface of the spinning record
do you think you know it when youve made the mistake you wont survive
or will it be like the marks
wake up on top of the world never know
steve glances into the open cabinet where bishop keeps his vinyl freezes
comes out with an signed album
oh my god
this is a signed hendrix axis release
this has gotta be worth
we have to play this
you have to play this
shaking head no that one
is for a special moment
havent found it yet
you havent found the
are you kidding
you have to what
bishops eyes shoot open
he looks out the window where a series of sedans are pulling up
men get out approach
this could get
bishop steps out of his home
one of the several men there steps forward
dean would like a moment of your time
off bishop who
sedan pulls up bishop is escorted onto a private jet
steve stands in the middle of bishops home
steve stares at the classic vinyl on bishops turntable
steve wiring his ipod to bishops stereo
nine inch nails piggy comes blasting out insults the speakers
steve moves to the bedroom stares at the haunting painting
he reaches forward takes it down
blank wall behind
steve blasts in lights glow on illuminate the wall of research on the female mark
he goes to the gas fireplace flames flicker up
steve rips down the pictures of the woman
moves to the fire and feeds the first one in
on steve watching
tracking to the side
down below the fire stuck to the side of the interior cavity
a scrap of paper
steve kills the fire reaches in carefully removes the scrap of paper
a corner of a photograph
a few buildings distant out of focus
bishop shirtless stares in the mirror
he checks the wound in his side splashes vodka from a handful of mini bottles painfully re wraps the wound
bishop emerges from the bathroom peers out at the grey monoliths of washington d
steve stands alone holding the scrap of photograph now in a plastic envelope
he stares at where the chalk line has almost completely faded then looks up taking in the views vantage points
a half mile away a building under construction rises high
bishop steps off the plane
another sedan and driver waits
through a camera the mckenna holding corp building
image focuses on the rooftop shutter clicks
steve lowers the camera looks at the display
he removes the scrap from bishops fireplace compares it
the same buildings in the corner of the frame
no remaining doubt
bishop killed his father
the security professional is up here with steve hanging back
steve nods to him
i dont care what it costs
driver pulls the sedan to a stop in front of a large nondescript building
bishop steps out alone on the street passes through the morning commuters and goes in
bishop passes through a security checkpoint
post hyper conscious
smart guards backed up by battle ready us marines
bishop collects his id waits for a door to click open
bishop sits in a fluorescent lit room now with a bar code badge on his coat
a few other people also wait
bishop checks his wound pulls his coat closed to mask where blood has stained his shirt
a door opens and a plain woman nods to bishop
bishop sits in a chair
through blinds views of gray dc
we realize that the plain woman is sitting across from bishop watching him
finally the door opens and dean enters
pasty white slightly balding
its hard to locate where the sense of power come from but its there innate
he motions to the woman who leaves
dean sits at his desk taps his fingers on it
you look like shit
how does harry mckennas son figure in
hes going to be working with me from now on
you sure thats wise
do i need your permission
and for the record i dont believe youd ask for it
dean grabs a remote control on his desk points it at the set of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life muted
news reports featuring the killing of the turkish embassador
shots of the woman smiling
helicopter shots of the pool structure
words scroll terror on our soil
us envoy ejected from turkey
that was my baby
but my baby has turned into an epic shit storm and so when the man who caused said epic shit storm suddenly decides to do some soul searching
what are you doing bishop
the mistake was mine not the kids
dean leans in intense
bishop watches the screens
a screen changes to a commercial for a bahamas resort
i am on some very fucking thin ice right now which means you are on some very fucking this ice as well
someone i trained
that could be worth a lot to you
dean laughs rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior blinds raises one
from here they can see out over the office
glimpses of a dozen conversations
other men and women at work
more than a couple glance over towards deans office
a predatory vibe
and here i thought we were both going to live forever
dean stares at him
bishop stares back
suddenly this becomes the moment the decision
you know in this business you only get one mistake
off the flatscreens so nothing more like that
you take full responsibility
the two men face to face
then deans phone rings
he turns to it snaps it up
yes were all sorted out
i just need you to the hit on the woman
what was the reason
dean looks back surprised angered
im calling you back
dean clicks off takes in this change of rules
a dead seriousness infects his voice
you know this foul up mckennas son its all got some peoples panties in a real twirl
this isnt the time for questions
this is the time for survival
dean turns away picks up the phone again
yeah get me stan again
steve lays out by his pool sunglasses baking under the sun as his group of hangers on swarm around him
play dance splash
hes immune to all of it
louise climbs from the pool water drips off her perfect form
she nestles in behind steve her hands running over his body
he stares straight ahead as if she didnt exist
come on baby
whats the matter
finally something does catch his attention at the gate a dhl van pulling up the driver heading toward him
steve lowers his glasses
seen from far away the sedan pulls up
bishop gets out
bishop enters looks around
no sign of steve or any disturbance
he moves through the house
bishop tense in his study holding the phone which rings
steves voice comes on the voicemail hi this is steve
you know what to do
bishop sitting on his couch
on the tv in front of him images from a protest in turkey an american flag burning
bishops eyes flick to the stack of dvds from the woman
he keeps watching the news images
his phone rings
he snatches it up
youre still alive
seems that way
hey can you meet me
something i want to talk with you about
come up to the house
bishops sportscar pulls up in front of the large estate
bishop gets out surveys the grounds
the windows of the house dark
the grounds empty
he moves to the gates to the back yard finds them open
he pushes through cautious
bishop moves towards the darkened pool area
as he approaches steve comes into view standing by himself on the edge of the diving board in the center of the dark space
there you are
thanks for coming
whats on your mind
steve just smiles shakes his head
bishop stares at him tense confused
each trying to read the other
then steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth drinks
bishop takes a step forward and
lights wash the space
sound fills the air
bishop ducks rolls his hand moving under his jacket
but not coming out with his gun
he takes in a surprise party opening in front of him
beautiful woman laughing blowing horns
men pouring champagne
streamers falling to the ground where seconds before they blew into the air a large banner illuminated behind steve happy birthday arthur
and steve standing on the board master of ceremonies staring back at bishop
oddly cool dispassionate
then he smiles
women come to him touch him put a party hat on him and give him small kisses with wishes of happy birthday as he moves to the pool edge across
its not my birthday
when was the last time you celebrated your real birthday
no response from bishop
steve nods swigs the bottle again
hes lit something fierce and fiery in his eyes
youre overdue buddy
who are these people
they think youre a friend of mine a producer from canada
in other words theyre all your best friends
bishop sits on an outdoor sofa surrounded by several gorgeous aspiring models
steve sits across from him louise under his arm
bishop watches as one of the models ties a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue presents it to the group to a round of applause
so what movies have you made
oh he makes the really violent disturbing stuff
you wouldnt know it to look at him i know but whats locked up away in there
tapping his head frightening man
god i love those
which ones mr
kckenna has a creative relationship with the truth
i dont actually
the model glances around unsure
so what do you do
what do you do
bishop doesnt respond
hes just staring down
discarded lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on the tear strip from a dhl envelope
come on mr
were all waiting
bishop looks up at steve who smiles back
a beat and then bishop is up and moving through the crowd pushing by people laughing dancing
he almost runs into a bright blue haired woman on the arm of a jockish rapper
he comes up short realizes hes staring into the face of the woman
shes utterly different than weve seen her
tonight shes the clubbing party girl
dark lipstick bright blue wig heavy eye liner
this is strange
the rapper shes with has found a group of his buddies
high fives all around
he glances around for his date
is he your
no just a job
off his nod i have to
she nods turns away
he also turns starts moving through the crowd pushing through dancing bodies
and suddenly shes back with him
lights and sound and dance around them
she leans forward kisses bishop once
backs off smiles turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat mid story with
turns away as the music stops
steves voice fills the outdoor space amplified
ladies and gentlemen
the man of the hour
a spotlight hits bishop
he squints up as the crowd makes space for him
steves near the dj speaking on a mic
i know that not many of you know my friend
my good dear
i mean hes a man of few words
and hes an art lover
did you know that
his home is covered with work
its amazing what you can find in there
a weird beat
steve smiling fierce
happy birthday arthur
behind steve a covered object
steve now turns to it pulls the cover off a portrait of bishop clearly done by the artist he collects
the image is twisted vivid disturbing
as the crowd erupts in applause the artist himself now comes forward steves arm around his shoulder and bumping fists before the artist heads on towards bishop shaking bishops hand
on bishop just looking at steve who stares back
bishop bangs out a door into the front drive makes it to his car fumbles for his keys
sweating off kilter
hey you forgot something
steves there holding the portrait
bishop nods takes it
sorry for leaving
im just not used to no worries man
its your party
you can leave it
its true isnt it
what you said to me the first time we met
this thing we do
finally you always do it alone
bishop nods unconsciously starts towards his car forces himself to stop
i can feel some male bonding coming
we gonna hug it out bishop
no im serious
anyway its been a long time since someone did something for me
steve looks back nods
happy birthday arthur
steve raises a hand shoots bishop with a finger
a wink and he turns and is gone back to the party
bishop climbs into his car pulls away
bishop drives the car out of mckennas estate pulls out onto the street
he starts to accelerate away
then stops the car in the middle of the street
fighting what his guts are screaming at him
losing it pounding on the steering wheel
party rages on oblivious to the absence of its recipient
suddenly faces turn upwards
to where steve is looking down on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool
are you all having fun
shouts and nods
i despise each and every one of you
more shouts laughter
steve leaps out into space
perfect huge swam dive
hitting the water
a moment of silence
was that deep enough
steve erupts out of the water
party roars back into life
high above the festivities
bishop slips over the wall makes his way down towards the estate
dark and empty in here party raging outside
bishop enters steves bedroom
messy the bed unmade
a womans underthings lying on the floor
bishop surveys the room checks drawers peers down into the party below
he can see steve in the middle of it all louise on his arm his hand on her ass
bishop moves to the office door locked
he slides a pick set out of his pocket gets to work
the door lock clicks and bishop enters closes the door after himself and locks it turns around
the room has been stripped of everything that was in here last time
gone are the paintings the portraits the mementos
all traces of harry mckenna removed
instead a single desk inhabits the center of the room a small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it
bishop comes around touches a key on the keyboard
the monitor glows to life with a single password prompt
bishop stares at it
he sits staring concentrating
steve has moved to the edge of the raised patio looking down into the valley
his eyes still deep impossible to read
karens got some amazing e
you need to come try
steve turns those cool eyes on her
we think he might slap her then give me a moment
ill be right there
well do that amazing e
and he looks away back down over the view
a resigned loneliness settling into his features
bishop just staring at the password prompt which throbs in front of him
his eyes flick across to the few books lying on the desk
bishop reaches forward types nemesis
and then our minds are blown
the entire wall of the room in front of bishop glows to life
its a one large high resolution monitor
on it glows an infinitely detailed work up on bishop
a photograph on him glows at the center of the screen changing every three or four seconds to another
this is bishops method brought into the st century
accounts medical charts psych profile associates residence
takes it in
touches accounts and the window spreads out across the whole wall
multiple windows all of bishops money displayed in real time the numbers subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets
another window above is labeled associates
bishop touches this one and the financial windows are replaced with a collage of faces
not too many
we recognize the store owner and his daughter
an older man gerald bishop bishops father
and a photo of the woman
bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out from the single
many stills but several are in motion looping childhood movies
a commercial done as a teen
a blue movie when she was
bishops eyes settle on a video image he and the woman caught just an hour ago in the middle of the dancing party
the woman leaning to him kissing him
bishop stares at the image then touches another image labeled residence
instantly the images are replaced with images of the interior and exterior of bishops home
bishop stares at them confused
realizing that in one of the images the trees lightly sway in the breeze
his eyes dart to an image of his dining room
it looks like a still until suddenly bishops cat passes through the frame
bishops eyes dart moving from frame to frame
the whole interior of his life
his living room bedroom study gym
all live feeds
son of a bitch
door bursts open steve pushing in his arms wrapped around louise and another gorgeous woman from the party
as the two women hit the bed start undressing each other steve takes a moment sensing
something not right
he pulls keys from his pocket unlocks the study door peers in
come on steve
we need you
mean men and loose women
metal on the juke
duct taped naugahyde
bartender on parole
eyes raise as bishop pushes in scattered focus hits the bar
lots of it
bishop fumbles in his pocket brings out a thick wad of cash
s and s
at a booth two ex cons lock onto bishop one sporting a middle finger raised fu tattoo on his bare shoulder
bishop pushes forward
thats too much
bishop grabs the shot down it
pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender
im not going anywhere
another shot is put down on the bar empty
bishop wipes watery eyes nods to the bartender to hit it again
bishop stares at the drink then his attention is drawn to the bar tv
footage from the protests in turkey is narrated by a news anchor speaking
intelligence services can listen to our calls
but what about the rest of the world
well today the answer seems to be no as outrage over the assassination of the turkish envoy bahar miryem has forced the us to reverse its position now saying that
it will not make it support of turkeys eu bid contingent on its cooperation in the security agreement
miryem had always advocated for turkish autonomy from bartender hits a remote annoyed
channel changes to a s charles bronson flick
bishop blinks shakes his head
he collects himself weaves out of the bar
the ex cons watch him go
bishop weaves his way into an alley to piss
relieves himself on a wall
done he zips up turns
one of the ex cons catches him across the face with a punch
bishop reels back against the wall
bishop takes the punches no defense
the guy backs off slightly winded
dude you dont want any more give us that money
bishop shakes his head
two more hits to the body
bishop just keeps taking the punishment
seems to relish it
look ill give you my money but you have to promise me you wont spend it all on lipstick and tampons
ex con pulls a gun puts it to bishops head
you wanna die right here motherfucker
bishop raises his eyes to the man
not so drunk after all
bishop sits at his dining room table staring straight ahead
his face is cut his flesh swollen
if paranoia and loneliness had a face this is it
reverse to find the artists portrait of him hung on the wall across a surreal and distorted mirror
he chews his food steady even acutely aware hes being watched
we linger on the small camera eye tucked in the high corner of the room staring down
steve sits half naked in the office chair the high tech wall illuminated in front of him
in the bed in the other room the two women are asleep nude draped over each other
steve watches bishop leave his table
he hits a control and the image shifts picks up bishop checking his mail grabbing a baseball cap from a rack as bishop moves to his den settles into a
chair facing the television
cant see his face just the back of the cap on his head the tv screen set to white static
he touches a key and the image zooms in on bishop moving slightly
where are you baby
the tv purrs static white flickering light fills the room
we slowly turn reversing to find the baseball cap held up at the top of the chair by a pillow
no sign of bishop
bishop moves through shadows
he knows the positions of the cameras avoids them heads towards his barn
bishop enters turns on lights
he threads his way through his collection of beautiful automobiles until he reaches the far wall
he rolls up a large steel door
revealing a wall covered with his research on steve
lots of it weeks of work
he moves forward to a paper that lists stats about steve that includes a blank space for occupation bishop fills it in mechanic
suddenly lights wash across the space
bishop glances out a van is making its way up the drive
the wall sized monitor glows steves face as he watches the dhl driver get out makes his way to the door knock
steves eyes flick to what he can see of bishop asleep in the chair
steve leans forward interested
the dhl driver knocks again rings the bell
still no motion
and then bishop rises from the chair makes his way to the door
steve watches bishop signing closing the door and moving into his living room where he opens the package considers the small jump drive that slides into his hands
close on bishops weighted rp turntable
the needle coming down
touching spinning vinyl
stones sympathy for the devil croons out
on bishop tacking up pages photographs financials
we dont get a clear look but some pages are redacted theres government letterhead
personnel files budgets itineraries
many stamped classified
bishop draws lines connections
tosses some pages down pins others higher
he backs off stares through us
steve pushes in looks around tracks towards the study
he enters the study sees the wall the nights work
in the center a photograph of dean bishops boss
there you are
bishop is leaning in from outside
nods to steve
so who is he
very well protected
what happened to you
you should see the other guy
bishop tosses steve an object goes back outside
steve looks at it
a welders helmet with visor
steve comes out to find bishop working intently on a chemical project
hes pouring a black plastic like substance into a shallow mold creating a quarter sized object
is liquid semtex with a built in combustible
nice and shiny once it dries
bishop takes a knife scratches the surface of the coin sized disc then backs off by steve back into so thats how we take him out
shaking his head no
thats just to focus the mind
you makes bombs to focus your mind
what do you do
beat off the wall this ones different
they want it fast and they dont want it to look like an accident
someone wants to send a message
like with my father
didnt think that was your style
first time for everything
steve looks at bishop
outside the explosion concusses against the house
a window cracks
steve crouches hands covering his head
bishop puts a hand out
theres something i havent told you
i broke a rule
i brought you in without asking
so this hit is a test
of us of our arrangement
beat off deans picture if that man is breathing three days from now
then theyll need to make an example of us
do you understand
takes bishops hand who pulls him up
so what youre saying is you and i are stuck with each other
for getting you into this i knew what i was doing
bishop considers nods
steve and bishop push in backpacks on
trash bad lighting sad people in dirty hallways
they start up a long flight of stairs
steve and bishop push out onto this dilapidated rooftop washington dc spread out around them
they unpack gear from the backpacks
tripod camera and telescope are quickly assembled
bishop steps back lets steve take the first look
bishop takes notes
i count six
no seven at the main door
through the telescope the front entrance of the nsa building
the security check bishop went through
jesus theyve got us marines in there
two at the door one
maybe another two out of sight
bishop considers steve locked to the telescope the sharp point of the pen in his hand
fifth floor corner office
through the telescope steve finds dean at his desk talking on the phone
alright got him
hes at his desk
we could take the shot right from here
glass is three inches thick
steve moves his hand to turn on the laser bishop used before to listen with
and has laser sensors
steve laughs suddenly walks away from the telescope
bishop goes to it takes up the watch
what are we doing here
who is this guy
through the telescope dean shouts into the phone slams it down
leaves his office
bishop pulls away from the telescope hunkers down to wait
starting to get it
yeah im getting that this isnt a job
its just a really complicated
steve moves off restless
whole day has passed
bishop hasnt moved stares across at the nsa building the corner office
steve sits nearby
you know you can front sonofabitch all you want bishop
youre scared too
you dont really know how were going to pull it off do you
you ever think theres some things that just cant be done
everyone has a death really
because this guy
i look at this guy i dont see his death
i see my death
and i dont particularly like the view
bishop notes the lights going back on in deans office returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book
through the telescope dean back at his desk
he looks exhausted
and you know as much as i like the quality time unless you can read lips i dont exactly see what were doing here
steve glances at bishops pad where hes transcribing words no no tomorrow
im sick of this this is my life were taking about
youre bringing me in
give me a time and a place
you read lips
bishop glances at steve puts his eye back to the camera
through the lens extreme close on deans desk
a piece of paper on the blotter
bishop pulls the memory card from the camera
you any good with computers
bishop is working on his classic mustang
hes got the steering column apart working the mechanism
steve is in front of the electronic wall of info on bishop
his hospital report open
in a separate window video feed of the real bishop in his barn working on his car
steve marks the injury on bishop then opens a new window
multiple images of the scrap of paper on deans desk
steve gets to work enlarging rotating skewing the images
music and laughter filter in from outside
steve becomes aware of the noise from outside frowns
steve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never ending party
he raises a gun and fires into the air
faces startled look up at him
get the fuck off my property
a moment then people start to flee
only louise drink in hand moves towards steve confused
steve levels the gun at her
steve comes back into his office facing the wall
he tosses the gun on the table gets back to work
glances at one of the other open windows that shows bishop at his fridge pouring himself filtered water
steves hands fly
the images are pieced together enlarged skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address
steve punches it into a search window waits a beat then eyes scan over the list of returns lock onto something
he picks up the phone punches a number
watches as bishops phone rings watches bishop answer it
did you get it
its the us attorneys office in new york
hes trying to get out
steve trying to read bishops face zooming in
do you think were hitting him because of what hes done or because hes trying to get away with what hes done
does it make a difference
no i dont suppose it does
the two men far separated
do the angles
find us a shot
steve and bishop step out of the airport with bags hail a taxi and climb in headed into dc
securitys going to have the actual street locked down
but theres a residential street perpendicular
upscale streets lined with brownstone walk ups
steve and bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers and nannys ushering their children to school
high end people
theyll put up with a sweep but theyre not going to allow an agent to spend the day
they reach an address
bishop puts on a hat some sunglasses slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads dc municipal utilities
he trots up the the half flight rings the bell of an elegant brownstone
classic living room
magazine racks grand piano original art
besides the angle isnt right too flat
except when they hit the stairs
itll spread the group vertically
steve and bishop work in quiet efficient silence
each opens their bag removes a series of innocuous objects begins to dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal
from a clock a firing mechanism
from the tube an aluminum barrel holds a fishing rod
the rod is discarded the barrel is attached to a hard plastic stock
aa batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each
as this strange choreography continues in silence we pan across to the dining room where a woman and a man are bound and tied pillowcases cinched over their heads
their bindings allow them to hold each others hands which they do tight
theyre terrified but okay
back in the living room bishop adds the last piece to the home made rifle a telescope lifted from a childs gift box snaps it on top of the rifle
dean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into daylight
hes on the phone eyes darting nervous
look i dont care
find her i need to talk to her right now
bishop puts the rifle to his shoulder sights
behind him steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase considers it looks back to bishop
you ever worry about the right and wrong of it all
im not talking about god just
tapping his chest whatever you feel here
through the scope the us attorney building
the security detail
the steps leading to the street
its a little late for come on
youre telling me youve never done anything just because it was the right thing to do even if it didnt make any sense
you never took a chance like that
bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch
once i did
howd that work out for you
then suddenly bishops view is obscured by a large truck which has stopped trying to make the turn
we have a problem
bishop moves the scope precisely looking for alternatives
he sets the rifle down thinking as steve takes in the new situation
theres no shot
what do we do
theres no shot
a moment more and then bishop moves
we travel with him to the entryway
keys hats jackets sunglasses
bishop grabs a hat tosses one to steve
and bishops out
the truck wedged in
the security detail suspicious of the truck
cops get involved
men speak into radios
moving with bishop steve following
hats and sunglasses
they descend the steps onto the sidewalk closing on the us attorney building ahead
steve comes abreast of him as they move down the street
on your four
you see him
coming up a man in a jogging suit stretches touches his ear wheres hes wired
steve and bishop come abreast of him
steve pushes him down into the garbage alley between two homes
the man drops
steve comes back the mans gun palmed
offers it to bishop
youre the shooter
youll know when
with them moving taking the corner onto the main street in front of the large building
deans eyes track the outside the limo making the final turn onto the street
security visible ahead
listen i need you to go out of town for a few days
no i know but you have to trust me
just go no dont tell me where
just go okay
yes ill call you soon i gotta go
steve and bishop moving
they pass directly behind a command vehicle
security on headsets watching monitors
local police are also working one cop in particular guarding the corner of the perimeter
bishop nods to steve who heads up the stairs towards the building
bishop checks his watch looks down the street where deans limo and escort have turned the corner
bishop moves to the cop stands in front of him
the guy patiently puts a hand on him moving him on
bishop doesnt move
the cop frowns
a needle hits a records surface
pleased to meet you hope you guess my name
suddenly dropping into deans pov as his limo pulls up to the steps
chaotic motion light streaming in as the car door opens security handlers reach in
we move fast up steps lined by city police
one of the police turning his head staring at dean
his handlers unsure whats going on alert that somethings not right
bishop does nothing
security reads deans fear closes on bishop even as dean himself starts to back away separating himself from his own security now turning to run
straight into steve gun raised
a small moment frozen in time as dean understands his end
steve double taps dean in the chest then one to head
and chaos begins its rule
security which were closing on bishop now reverse draw weapons and fire at steve who drops down in the small cement crease between stairs and statues
ducked low bullet shattering granite and marble around him laughing
the first glimpse of something wrong inside this young man
bishop for the moment forgotten by the security who have reversed to deal with steve suddenly animates
perfect timing the security reversing again as bishop draws his gun and fires over and over clipping officers and security in the legs as he sprints down the steps towards
bishop lands inside the limo pulls the door shut as bullets thunk into armored sides and spider bullet proof glass
the driver looks back through the opening surprised just in time for bishop to grab him by the collar and haul him into the back at the same time slipping
through the opening and sliding into the drivers position
as he slams the shifter into reverse men line up in front open up with weapons
wheels smoke limo accelerates backwards angling up the steps
security dive aside as the limo clears the rail comes down hard just across from the small alcove steves pressed into
the passenger door opens
security are standing up opening up as steve dives forward
steve lands awkward in the front seat as bishop throws the limo into drive floors it down the steps of the building men diving aside swerving onto the street
steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the driver grabs him from behind hauls him backwards
bishop eyes his mirrors counting the number of vehicles pursuing
eyes makes calculations gets distracted for a moment from the raging fistfight between steve and the driver occurring in the rear compartment
bishop raises the divider steps on the gas
engine whines limo surges forward pursuit cars dropping off
there are no turns no spins
this is straight line acceleration circa french connection
bishop guides the limo faster and faster blasting across intersections timing his spacing to inches no margin for error
around him pursuit cars arent as good they veer off into crashes clip traffic spin out of control
in front of bishop intersection after intersection of cross cutting traffic
bishop speeds up or slows just a fraction making space for the limo barely
he notices a hand held automatic weapon secured to the dash grabs it checks his mirrors
in the rearview bishop watches a pursuit car t boned by a truck then his view is blocked by steve and the driver as they wrestle and fight
over his initial surprise the drivers trained and good
he locks steve up slams him against the window choking him
bishop sees a traffic jam looming ahead the limo closing at mph no alternatives
he lowers the divider
get in front
working on that
bishop hauls up the e brake putting the limo into a spin
the shift in force tosses steve and guard across the rear space
steve dives forward towards the front as
the limo goes into a wheel rotation angling towards the hard corner of a building and wham
limo clips the building halfway sheers the limo in half
the rear section crumples against the building as the front section skids down the building face comes to rest against a grocery
bishop and steve recover roll out of the now exposed rear of the drivers compartment and into bishop and steve slide in as police cars slide to a stop outside
small glimpses of cops and swat taking positions
steve peeks over a counter
a few cops fire
a glass window sheers fruit catches rounds
we have got to go
steves pointing at the rear exit
it looks far away
you go for it ill cover you
bishop takes in the exit the gun in steves hand
more cops arrive take positions
there must be thirty guns pointed in their direction
bishop cranes around tracks cop and swat
im sorry i brought you into this
not now bishop we have to it was
it was the only thing i knew how to teach you
steve looks at him oddly moved
dont worry about it bishop
i brought myself into this
bishop considers this nods
and hes up and firing towards the swat
clear shot at bishop
a micro second hesitation and then hes running for the rear exit
cops and fbi react to the shots all open up
the windows erupt in a hail of gunfire from the outside
bishop hits the ground rolls towards the rear exit
bottles and produce exploding under the assault
steve reaches the exit glances back to see bishop on his tail room being chewed up behind him
steve blows down a corridor
a swat member suddenly comes out of as side door raising his weapon
steve flattens him comes up with the mans weapon reverses lining it straight at bishop
who hits the ground as steve fires rounds pushing back pursuing swat behind bishop
more swat push in shields raised guns lined
bishop slams into them from the side
pushes one through a door breaks anothers knee as he disarms him moves after steve
steve and bishop emerge almost simultaneously race up the alley as swat emerges behind them rounds tracing after them
they clear the alley onto
pedestrians and shoppers crowd the small streets
bishop and steve tear through people on opposite sides of the street as overhead a helicopter clatters
behind them swat and cops give chase
up ahead a van skids to a halt swat pouring out
bishop and steve duck into
displays fly as they muscle through to the back then through service corridors back into a restaurant headed for the front door
two cop cars close from outside
bishop raises his weapon opens up into the metal of the cars
the cops panic reverse slamming into parked cars
the cops piling out and taking position as restaurant patrons scream and flee
bishops checks his fire
pure instinct swings his weapon to lock onto steve whos also raised his weapon at bishop
the two of them suddenly lining weapons into each others faces
eyes locked as beyond them another police reinforcement arrive takes position
the sound of a cop distant outside chambering a round into a shotgun
both men dive to the ground roll even as they switch to single shot mode to preserve ammo
bang bang bang they fire back at their attackers precise as the cops open up
bullets find exposed legs and arms men stumble back or fall to the ground screaming
almost at the same exact moment the men switch their aim back to each other
both men controlling emotion and body
gasping for breath bleeding
you dont know
glimpsed through shattered windows swat arrives takes the perimeter
theyre being surrounded
suddenly an suv pulls into view between the restaurant and the swat and police position a confused and frightened woman at the wheel
police shout at her confusing her more
steve makes a decision
lowers his weapon grabs a napkin ties it to hide his features
and with that steve is running towards the outside
behind steve bishop steps out gun in each hand
clean shot of steves back
he opens up
bullets tracing around steve pushing the men back just long enough for steve to reach the suv haul open the door
the woman screams as steve pushes her aside takes the wheel
she scratches back one hand ripping the bandana away from steves face
he stares at her for one deadly second
bishop flinches as the sound of the shot come from the suv
the passenger door opens and the woman climbs out as the suv accelerates away cops and swat firing after it
the woman watches her car go then turns and sits on the pavement
her hand moves to her chest comes away bloody
angry like weve never seen him
the stupid waste of it all
he meets the womans gaze
she dies looking at him
helicopters clatter above bullets plink into dishware and hardwood
bishop just stares at the woman for a long beat then he turns away back into the building
swat approaches the suv slammed against another car
shielded men throw the door open
swat move into the restaurant bishop was last seen in
guns lined checking corners
but theres no sign of bishop
bishop enters the flat
cool afternoon breeze blows through curtains
he stops stares at the couple who owned the flat who now lie motionless
small holes in the red stained pillowcases over their heads
steve has been here
bishop swallows angry
he forces himself back to the task at hand
breaking down the never fired weapon
he works efficiently silently
bishop sits at the gate waiting to board his plane
he watches families get ready college kids laughing
on the silent tvs cnn shows footage of the aftermath of the gunfight in the street
a us attorney speaking at a press conference
something is wrong in this country
but today because of the actions of a few cowardly men we may never know the true face of a voice announces boarding drowning out the tv
bishop collects his things
grocer glances at bishops two grocery bags then to the clock
sophie reads her book with her doll
a car speeds by outside
sophie tracks it looks at her father
key in the lock bishop enters stands in his living room
bishop stands in front of his machines still
reaches out touches one
bishop sits across from the portrait of himself finishes the last bite of his dinner
he takes the plate walks into the kitchen and to the sink washes the plate
his cat curls around his legs purrs
bishop takes a scrap off the plate bends down and feeds it to her
she starts to eat then her eyes narrow
steve hits him from out of nowhere
bishop sprawls as steve looms gun lined
bishop hits steve with the fridge door knocks the gun out of his hands it skitters along the floor
bishop moves towards it steve swings a knife
bishop catches the blow but steve hauls down on the bad shoulder
bishop screams as something gives stumbles back as steve swings again bishop turning catching the blade in his shoulder
bishop reels back against the wall as steve picks up the gun and bang
fires as bishop flees the room
steve follows keeping his shots controlled
slugs chew into walls furniture as bishop dives out the front door
steve advances re loading
you know when they came to me
i said are you sure
but theyre right arent they
steve steps out onto the porch
you dont really like the work anymore
bishops voice comes from the darkness near the barn
steve shoots as bishop moves finds cover
what did you call it
thats a prerequisite
besides i guess i had other reasons
if it matters today we killed the man who ordered the hit on your father
yeah but not the man who actually killed him
steve advances clearing the side of the barn lines his weapon on bishop whos standing next to the barn
whyd you kill those other people
shakes his head you really going moral high ground on me
you might want to check your soapbox there partner
steve fires just as bishop slides back into the barn through a side door
steve laughs slides towards the front
but thats the difference between us isnt it
youre all alone but you still
you wish they liked you
whereas i have people everywhere
and all i ever want is to be alone
steve hears banging coming from the barn
theres no weapons in there bishop
what did you teach me
ive controlled the situation
one hundred percent
the barn door blast outwards as bishops vintage mustang come careening out of the barn at steve
who stands his ground
he aims fires five times through the windscreen
the rounds impacting bishop as the car looms at steve who steps aside at the last moment the car barely missing him continuing on and impacting against the side of
the propane tank
steve squints and booooom
the propane tank erupts in flame
steve is knocked back
when he rises the interior of the car is an inferno
the body is slumped against the wheel the fire consuming him cleansing him
bleeding bruised victorious
steve enters the study looking down at bishops record player looks back at the wall of work on dean
smoke seeps through the walls pushes through cracks in sills
steve opens bishops record collection takes the pristine collectors hendrix
the one never played
he moves into the living room
flames lick across the walls
through the smoke he sees the portrait of bishop staring back at him
he raises the album in thanks
steve now stands outside bishops home watching
the whole place is an inferno
pictures bubble and peel before turning black in the heat
the stack of dvds melts dripping down
in the barn
flaming beams crash down crumple classic cars
steve watches it all
the fire reflected in his eyes
a hot gorgeous day
slight breeze blows through trees ripples the water on the pool which is suddenly cut through by the figure of steve swimming laps hard
he gets out at the far end looks over his grounds
theres no one here anymore
the place is deserted except for ear wired security who patrol the grounds
police and fire pick through the smouldering rubble
a detective watches as the door to bishops fire ravaged car is pried off
steve trots in from outside pulling on a loose shirt
the house is spotless transformed
no sign of a frivolous young mans pursuits
art and culture and wealth
the door to the car gives suddenly falls to the ground
the detective pulls a handkerchief puts it over his nose and mouth as he peers in at the body
steve busts in dragging his fathers s turntable with him
the portrait of bishop has been hung here in his office
he glances at it then breaks the seal on the hendrix album stares at the grooves before seating it on the turntable and hitting a switch
player starts up needle swings over
steve moves to his computer and punches in the password
on the wall sized screen the bishop research glows to life
all the connections people history that made bishop
bishops cat jumps into his lap purring and steve strokes her
finally a decision
he hits a button and the prompt delete file
appears on the screen
needle comes down touches the record the sweet sound of hendrixs little wing fill the world
steves finger still hovers over enter
bishops cat jumps down trots away
he watches the cat go hits the button
the wall sized screen goes blank
just a cool white nothing
steve smiles nods leaning back
when a voice comes from the record player overlayed above the song
steve if you hear this then it means you found the right moment to play the record
good for you
it also means you had to scratch the needle across the surface of the record
steves eyes lock on the record player the needle scratching across its surface from the surface of the record the smallest trace of smoke
sorry it has to end this way
steves eyes dart to the portrait of bishop
its cold eyes stare back
the windows of steves office blow out of the estates nd story
the detective handkerchief over his face leans over the body
burnt beyond recognition
camera moves away down to the bodys shoulder
every man has a death thats right for them
where a form a heat shadow has burnt into the charred remains of a shirt
a fist middle finger raised
we know this tattoo
it was on the ex con who tried to mug bishop outside the bar
this is not bishop
a death so right that when it arrives those who knew him will say yes this is right
the detective leans the body forward and the shadow disintegrates into ash
a brand new maserati crests the hill moving fast
brakes lock up it slides to a stop in a patch of dirt
this was always going to happen this way
bishop gets out
shaved healthy clean
he climbs onto the roof of the car stares at the highway which winds away into the distance
freedom laid out before him
he stares at it wanting needing
